The service here is top notch, if it's your first time they'll present you with a complimentary mini-flight so you can sample their entire range. Right now that consists of gin and various liqueurs. I wasn't a fan of the liqueurs, but the gin is an absolute steal at $35/bottle (not available for purchase on Sundays!)   They used to have a few BBQ offerings, but sadly that's gone now. While the space is dog friendly, the outdoor seating is relatively small. We were planning on bringing our pups, but I'm glad we didn't...both the parties out there with us brought their dogs and it would have been 6 pups in a relatively small area.  Drinks range from $8-10, and they regularly rotate out flavored slushes, absolutely perfect for Summer.

Daughters was with grapefruit and mine with cucumber.  We also purchased a cheese plate which we were told was made up for them from the local grocery store.

Their small personal pizzas are worth every penny. With all the new apartments going up in the area, I\\'m sure this will become a well-established neighborhood pub. Unfortunately, the one negative is that at the time of check out, the infamous \"how much do you want to tip\" screen pops up with at least a 25% minimum when you pay by credit card.

I love the diversity of their brews and the frequency with which they change. I've been very happy with the quality and friendliness of service. I think their price-point is spot on for both the brews and the food. I've recently fallen in love with their Caesar salad. It's absolutely delicious and I love the home-made dressing. This will be one of my go-to spots for the foreseeable future and one that I look forward to sharing with my friends. I highly recommend the Bada Bing pizza (meatball) if you love cracker-thin crusts like I do.  They always have a fun variety of beer. I've recently enjoyed their Foeder style beers. They also have a nice selection of hazy IPAs right now that show good variations of the style. Again, I don't have a single favorite as their rotation of brews ensures that I find a new favorite each visit.\"}, {'author': 'Adam G.', 'datePublished': '2021-03-28', 'reviewRating': 5, 'description': \"I went here with my friend because he said they have good pizza.

First time and the food was delicious. Great Greek salad and the large was just enough for 2 people to split. Ordered a pizza and first off I love the crust. It's a thin crust that if you probably asked to have it cooked a little longer for some crispy but not too crispy crust and it would be amazing. Also ordered these Tex-mex style meatballs and they had chorizo in them which was different but satisfying. Next time I'm in Austin I'm headed back to oodwood for a Stromboli.  Service was amazing because you order everything from your phone and pay from your phone so I really don't see how someone could mess up that system lol it's not like your server is going to forget to put your order in.  It's dog friendly and I love that.

They have board games and serve yourself water (sparkling OR still. THAT&apos;s a first!!). They don&apos;t have outdoor seating, but plenty of seats indoors. They also sell small bites and other drinks like wines and ciders. Their guest list is pretty solid with brews from Zilker and Independence to name a few other Austin loves. I got a taster of Central&apos;s own beers. We really did not enjoy the milkshake IPA that had a strong vanilla aftertaste. It was way too sweet, but to each their own.\\n\\nTheir restrooms are clean and they allow outside food too. SCORE! Now if only the owners would install some wifi...our taptender told us that the owners are still getting that set up. So that&apos;s a great sign!
