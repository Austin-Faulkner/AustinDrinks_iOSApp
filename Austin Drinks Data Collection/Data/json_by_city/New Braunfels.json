                "description": "One of our favorite places to relax and enjoy our weekends.  We love the owners who have made us feel like they have known us for years.  They have an amazing beer collection to offer.  I typically order one of the beers that they are trying out.  This last weekend I ordered the Banana beer.  Great start and awesome finish, not sweet but you could definitely taste banana in it.  You can find a pour for everyone's taste in their selection.    Now onto the food.  But first, let me just say during the right season they do have a beautiful vegetable garden growing on the premise that is used to enhance some of the menu items they offer.  They offer a delicious pizza made with fresh ingredients, it always hits the spot. You can also order a Red Beans and Rice which is also very good but my favorite is the Cornbread which is included.  I always order extra cornbread, it's that good. I've also had a few of their salads.  Music, music, music!  It's mainly an outside venue with plenty of seating throughout its open area and a few tables inside by the bar.  So that being said they have included a great stage for live music from Thursday to Sunday.  We have enjoyed various bands from blues to Texas country-rock to name a few.    A must to include in this review is that it is a super and I mean a super, dog-friendly venue.  I love this about GB.  So if you're looking for a place to kick back and enjoy the Texas vibe Guadalupe Brewery is the place to be for sure."

                "description": "Always love this place! We've been with them since there were in the non-climate controlled warehouse next door. Truly amazing to see how hard work and wonderful personalities can flourish a business. We love the owners and see them every time we are here.  They have a lot of experimental beers, as well as flagship beers. The owner said they were going to add more porters and browns to their permanent selections to suit those who aren't into the unique pours.  The pizza is phenomenal and made to order and the space is wonderful to soak up the sun (or shade) and listen to live music with your furry companions."

                "description": "As a stout beer fan, this is one of my go to places. I have love to watch them expand from a single room and 10 foot wide porch to the multiple building compound they have now. The beers are always delicious, the staff is always extremely friendly, and the addition of the new pizza kitchen is a huge plus.  Last time we were in, we ordered a build your own pizza that included a plethora of delicious meats and even topped it with truffle oil. If you are looking for a fun place to grab a delicious beer, listen to some live music, and eat some phenomenal food, this place that has it all."

                "description": "Spent a girls weekend away in new braunfels and found our party of 5 at this place. We needed somewhere w a patio, dog friendly, and gluten/carb friendly. This marked all the boxes. It's a large outdoor seating options w plenty of tables and different areas to sit. There is live music, the brewery, several options in food and craft beer. I tried the spiced apple cider and a friend had the Texas honey ale both made locally and they were not only great tasting but pretty strong for a craft beer. The weather was gorgeous and such a great location. We tried the pizzeria on site and it's presented as \"Detroit style\", wasn't sure what that meant but was really happy w how it came out. Square/rectangle size sliced into 6 squares and very soft pillowy dough w a good amount of toppings and sauce ratio. We ordered 2 and an order of red beans and rice. Would definitely try them again so I could try other things on the menu."

                "description": "This open patio brewery has a fun and great atmosphere! It's super spacious with the seating area options and one area dedicated to smoking cigars. The beers taste fantastic, especially the bourbon infused one! The brewery also has live music and the band we listened to the night we were there was awesome! There is a second tasting room where you can get flights instead of full tapped beer-that area houses the main brewery area. There is also food at the Guadeloupe Pizza Kitchen which is off to the side of the brewery...the pizza we got that night was the Detroit style pizza, one was veggies and the other pepperoni and it was very tasty! This is a great spot to hangout with family and friends!"

                "description": "After a long day on the river we went in on a Friday being and I'll admit we were a little hangry. Everyplace in NB was packed out and GBC was no exception but it was for good reason, thankfully we didn't let our hunger or the crowd deter us because we would've missed our big time!   So they have two separate building you can order beer at, and a pizza building, pub fare building and taco shack all surroundings common outdoor seating area.  I will say the beer selection and quality was amazing, They had so many unique flavors full of body, light to dark and low ABVs all the way up to 15%! Im so thankfully they weren't 90% IPA which seems like the trend nowadays but truly had a large variety as selection to please everyone.  Their cider was perfect my tart and not sickly sweet like every cider is, super refreshing.  The food was no second fiddle either, and held its own not just against the beer but other rival restaurants with similar fare.  First of pricing is really good so you're not gonna break the bank. Also you get a ton of food for what you pay.  But the icing on top is that the food flavors are soooo good, we had the cheese curds, blue cheese burger from the pub food building at it was honestly one of the best burger ive ever had.  The pizzas were equally as wonderful and had some awesome combinations you don't normally scene but they have them down. We got the one with corrizo and it I think is one of my favorite pizzas now!   This place should be a regular watering hole for everyone! although it's outdoor seating the trees, canvas overhang and mister make it bearable and they really have an ambiance that make you wanna stay and hangout, especially with the live music in the garden patio setting.   As a suggestion/request I will as the business owners to blessed put up some fans! Not just for the heat but the stupid flies especially in the smoking section were super annoying!"

It was our first visit since they expanded and it's even better than before. Same great expansive beer options with a lot of new outside space. They also have a separate small batch only bar and overall, their prices are very good. It's also dog and kid friendly and all the people that work there are very friendly."

                "description": "I was visiting from out of town and admittedly came to Guadalupe with high expectations due to the very high rating here on yelp but I can honestly say that those lofty expectations are not why I'm giving an average rating. The layout threw me off when we initially got there but we quickly figured out where to order food and where to get the beer. I got the Tiki IPA and we ordered a Detroit style pizza, Caesar salad and focaccia. Everything but the salad was really good but it took AN HOUR AND 20 MINUTES TO GET OUR FOOD. I have NEVER had wait remotely that long for food before, anywhere. Only other complaint is fairly minor in that the beer was $8 for 13oz which I felt was a bit expensive."

                "description": "Guadalupe brewing is one of our absolute favorites, and they keep expanding and somehogetting better and better. Amazing flavors and unique beers for every taste ranging from light pilsners to heavy stouts, hoppy IPAs or sour berlinerweiss. They have unique flavors such as dreamsicle, and If they advertise a flavor in a beer it'll definitely be a leading flavor and not slight hints! They have an outdoor seating area that is gorgeous, and an inside area as well. They also have two different bar areas to order from- and some beers are only at one bar and not the other, so check both before you choose! You can get reservations for a week in advance, so they're great for groups/special events. They also serve pizza which is so good! They offer normal or Detroit style, and is an absolute must!"

                "description": "This is a bring a group type of place. Tons of seating and a great atmosphere. We sat inside by the bar but it was still really hot. We were hoping it would be a little cooler since it was by the bar inside the building but this is Texas after all.   We really enjoyed it and the burgers were so good. We did a flight of beer so we can taste a multitude of what they have to offer. The Peanut butter stout was amazing. The only complaint was the copious amount of flies swarming us, lol. We tried not to let them bother us but they were drawn to our food.   We probably would have stayed longer but the heat and flies got the best of us. We ended up going to a different place to day drink. I think it would be even better during the fall, winter, or the spring."

My advice for this place or any place for that matter, is to not trust the hours posted on any site and call to be sure they're open. I hope to visit another day."

The food truck will run out of some things so get in line ASAP' if you're hungry. I'd recommend the truffle fries and rib sandwich."

We've even slung beer for them on occasion to help out with events and goodwill.  From a \"closet\" with an outdoor grill on Friday nights, to a full dining and entertaining establishment,  Anna and Keith have never lost focus of their dream even all through Covid they have persevered.  The latest additions of a awning over the beer garden and customer laser engraved new tables to sit, three food choices including a new boffo pizza kitchen, you can't go wrong to stop in, relax and enjoy their hospitality.    Parents... there is a posting on the GBC website, please leave your minor children at home after 7pm. We don't see a lot of adherence to this request and this insults your hosts by being rude and reflects badly on you as a guest.  \"Prosit\""

I had a simple pepperoni pizza and it was absolute perfection 10/10. Better than Via 313 in Austin, which I hold as the standard by which Detroit Style pizza should be measured. One pizza was enough for one person, and I really wanted to order and second but I resisted."

I have attached a opening, videos and photos for Sunday morning, and food menus, hours (for food) and more. Hours for the brewery is open tue-thu 5-9 fri-sat 12-9 sun 12-6. The pizza is made with their fresh garden vegetables that you can see them picking tue-thu 5-9 and fri-sat 12-9 (peep my tik-tok, which isn't my thing but it's cute)"

                "description": "Pretty decent establishment with a good variety of beers.  But as someone else mentioned, they specialize in sours.  They did have one Heffe when I was here today, but they said they are discontinuing it and only going to offer sours.  Sours are really not my taste, but to each his or her own.  I sampled a couple of the sours and they were ok, but again, just not my cup of tea, so I won't judge them on that.  Staff was very friendly, very knowledgeable about the different beer selections.  The clientele that we hung out with and spoke with were also very friendly and cool.  Bar area was kind of small but there is also a bit of seating back in the brewing area.  And yes, they do offer flights."

We tried all 8 beers they had on tap at the time of our visit! The blond one and Orono were some of our favs. But the pklfkr was different and good. I also really loved their shivas tears. In all I was throughly impressed. I would HIGHLY recommend this place!!!!!!"

The service was good. I see a lot of people complaining about their sours lol. That's literally all the serve! It is a brewery that specializes in sour beer. I personally like sours and ciders so for me it was great, but If you prefer IPAs then this might not be the spot for you."

                "description": "Dear city of New Braunfels:  I hope you understand what you have here. New Braunfels brewing Co is in my opinion, one of the best breweries of Texas, definitely the best when it comes to sours (in my humble opinion).  I am gonna go ahead and sound like a pretentious douche, but my husband and I are huge fans of sours, and we have been to over 60 breweries around the country. This one is absolutely a keeper.  The brewery is ran by a family that lives in town, they do everything from cutting the fruit that goes into their beer, to brewing and marketing, so don't expect fanciness, a very small group of people runs the entire show. They are usually very good about updating their menu on facebook.   Remember, this brewery specializes in sours, you will not find the regular styles like Lagers, IPAs and Stouts and such. If you are looking for anything other than sours, please skip it instead of giving it a bad review.  The tap room may be tiny, but it's packed with awesomeness and flavor. The staff is super nice and knowledgeable, and they are always ready to help you and tell you all you need to know about sour beer.  This brewery is not a place to hang out for a long time with your friends, but more of a place for doing a quick tasting and take some bottles home. This is absolutely not a good place for large groups.  I recommend that you buy a flight, which is $8 for 4 small pours, that way you can taste different things. If you want to commit to just one, the prices are very reasonable.   My favorites are Saison de Nefle, Hell yeah! and PKL FKR.  We like their stuff so much that we bought a membership to their club, which is totally worth it."

                "description": "Wheats and sours, that's it.  Two beers I never drink but NB Brewery specializes in them.  A small store front brewery in the heart of historic downtown. Very friendly staff were quite informative.  Only the second time I have tried a sour, first time at Jester King and I did not like. They gave me a free taste and off I went.  We quite liked the sours actually better than some of the wheats. We tasted 5 of the 8 taps and liked all but one.   The sours are like a double fermented beer inoculated with live bacteria and can be quite puckering. Some are barrel aged up to a year.  If you're in town I highly recommend stopping in. You can even wander around the small brewery on your own.  Oh btw, they will pour you a cup to go. New Braunfels allows open containers, drink up!"

Really small inside area, but a nice little beer garden out back. No food.   Also, importantly, if you don't like sour beers - I wouldn't make the trip. That is what they specialize in, and every beer on tap is some form of sour except one."

                "description": "We definitely hadn't planned to stop by New Braunfels Brewing Co on our last brewery tour, but while we were at Faust Brewing, the bartender let us know they were having an anniversary party. We decided to stop by and see what they had to offer.  It turned out that most of their beers leaned toward the sour end. Sours aren't necessarily my favorite, but I was intrigued by the pickle beer. (Not a fan.) However, they had some dark sours that were actually delicious! This was our third brewery of the day...so that may have influenced my taste buds, but no matter...I still enjoyed them. And the anniversary party was hopping and it seemed like a lot of people love this place.  We'd like to go back and check them out on a non-party day, just to see what they've got. Definitely on our list of places to go again!"

They don't change the website, but to quote the guy pouring, \"nothing in life is a sure thing\". I'm pretty sure the \"on tap now\" list is supposed to be a sure thing. Thanks for not only being a Dick, but for wasting my time.   2. All of the beer follows the ode if a little spice is perfect the whole bottle must make it better. Not good. I tried 6 of the 8 beers hoping for one I could finish. NOPE   First clue I should have just turned around was the bartender asking me if I was hungover.  (Nope, but thanks for telling me I look like s°~×  before saying welcome to our brewery)   NEVER AGAIN"

                "description": "We had an accidental run in with this brewery. We happened to spot it as we were getting out of our vehicle on our way to another place. The open sign was calling us, and for it being past 8:00, finding a brewery open that late is unique.  The tasting room is fairly small with a few bar stools and a bench in the brewing room. They  invited me to go in the brew room to take pictures.  These brewers are some of the nicest we've met so far. Great company and conversation. They even recommended some other local businesses, which I now have bookmarked.   The beer: they specialize in wheat beer. That's not typically the style of beer I enjoy, but I did find one called the \"Hot Child\"- a cucumber and jalapeño infused beer. We only had time to have one beer as their tasting room closes at 9:00. Currently their tasting room is open Thursday-Friday 5-9pm. I hope to see these guys at Wurstfest someday."

Not for everyone, but they have a place indoors to chill on hot summer days. I'd fire up the pit on a summer night, if they would let me.    They do change the beer menu quite a bit, but they do have there regular beers. Staff is friendly and helpful. Sorry, no beer flights, and I see why, you don't want to get something your not happy with, plus they will give you sample.  They have a kitchen, we've eaten her before, so I can only recommend what we have tried, the pretzels, the pizza, and the bratz.    Now they are about to open a coffee bar, can't wait for that."

Yelp actually points me me that there is an actual brewery in middle of nowhere, just drive through some windy roads to get there.  Well that seems like a fun adventure on a Saturday afternoon.    Little did I know that this little brewery would be located in the middle of a preserve.  This is where hiking trails meets beers. No masks need rules just some friendly owners ready to talk beer and God's country.   Well let me back up a bit as the hiking part is not quite is not quite available aw of 2021.  But the owners of this wonderful property own all of the acres of this incredible property so maybe this may become the next latest and greatest thing since yoga and beer drinking came to be..  I loved everything about this place.  It was spread out so you could find a spot without being disturbed.  They had picnic tables to hang out under the trees, even rocking chairs for grandma. Totally open to all age groups from the kiddos to oldies but goodies.  Normally I'd not want what could be described as chaos in a normal brewery setting but with the beauty and spaciousness everyone seems to get along and make it work.  Kids and AA/NA 'rs are drinking the hibiscus tea while the majority are enjoying a freshly brewed beer.    Beers are a nice mix here. They have nice light options for the Texas heat like a 4.8% Pilsner kolsch Hefeweizen and orange juice infused pale.  Then they get more serious going to a stout w/marshmallow graham crackers and coco nibs and get all the way to a 9% imperial stout with blackstrap molasses that comes regular or bourbon barrel aged. Those only come in a 6 oz pour which was appreciative considering we all do need to sometime and head back to civilization...  I loved all of the beers especially the Pilsner as it was so refreshing in a hot day.  But even the darker beers were super smooth.  I also loved how they gave you taste tests before committing.     They even gave a bit of entertainment going on with a guitar player on the outdoor patio.  Kids were dancing and adults hanging out with their pets. Yep i didn't see anyone not having a fun time, especially when most people have been deprived so to say over the past year, cough cough:D  This was a great find for us venturers, and I wholeheartedly recommend you bring your friends and family to this wonderful scenic treasure.  Yes Beer does exist in God'scountry. Say Amen to that .."

                "description": "This place is a little hidden but I think that's what I like about it. Off the beaten path of 1863, snuggled in the countryside with abundant outdoor seating and space for dogs to play and kids to run. There is shade, which is nice but an inside area for those triple-digit days. There are outdoor fire pits for when the weather is actually enjoyable in Texas.  There is usually an on-site food truck on the weekends. The beer is very crafty and creative. My first 2 visits were very excellent. Recently, my trips have still been enjoyable but a bit disappointing. While I admire the creative side of their brews, I do not care for everything to be fruit-infused. I don't mine 1 beer being fruity, but when that is all there is to choose from (other than the Kolsch) it gets old, fast. When I first was visiting this brewery I loved their porters. I haven't seen them in months. I think I would frequent this place like i used to if there were more non-fruity options.  Other than that, I love how it's family-owned, a large, open space, and just a relaxing atmosphere. Hopefully some non-fruity porters or ambers show up soon so I can head back out."

Beautiful location, both the brewery and the gorgeous outdoor seating area.  Feels quintessentially central Texan. LOVE IT. It was made all the more enjoyable by the live music being played the night of my visit. This place would be worth going to if the beer wasn't very good....but that is FAR from the case. The beers are fantastic with a wide range of both familiar and eclectic styles. You can get 5oz pours of anything, enabling you to try quite a few without getting too tipsy. The customer service was friendly as can be. I will 100% be back next time I am in the area. Drink local!"

Food trucks would also be a wise improvement, but perhaps they didn't have trucks on the day we came."

                "description": "This IS a cool little spot, it IS a great place to try out many different beers since you can make your own six packs, but I do wish there was pricing so you have an idea of what you are about to spend without having to ask someone how much everything is.   And I do also wish the pricing was at least somewhat competitive. I totally understand they don't sell at volume like the big box stores, and I don't expect big box pricing. And I'm sure the lease on the building is not cheap, so to some extent, I do understand why the pricing is on the higher end.   But without pricing, what happens is you pick out a number beers and you have a rough idea of what it all might cost, then you get rung up and the total is considerably more than you were thinking. It's really an unpleasant experience. At that point you don't want to make a fuss, so you just shell it out. If you are not in a position where you need to stretch your dollars, definitely stop in. You will love it. If you DO need to stretch dollars like me,  you'll probably want to stick to the big boxes for now."

And when we do ask questions,  get a short or sarcastic, (looking annoyed) or condescending answers.  People much friendlier at Krauses.  Shame, this place is so much closer to where we stay."

It is dog and kid friendly, and a nice place to just sit and enjoy the weather. On some weekends there is a food truck, so that is nice.  Overall the place is clean and very welcoming. There is a lot of bottled beers and ciders to pick from and just a small amount of beers on tap. While I understand that space is probably an issue, I wish they wouldn't carry local beers like Faust on-tap. If I want Faust, I can drive over there. If more taps were available it'd be fine but I'd rather try something else local but not from the same town."

The new place is awesome,  there is a large bar area and seating inside and out. They also now have homemade foods and snacks.  They have the same great selection of Texas beers and a few more.  They also have a huge selection of can and bottle beers you can either drink there or take a six pack home with you.  You will have to try the fire sale (I think that's what it was called). The bartender picks out a beer or hard seltzer out of the cooler, it's fun like a spin of the wheel to try something different.  They now have Sangria Slush which tasted very good and it is also made in house.  I felt very comfortable there, you wear a mask unless you are sitting to drink and eat, they use social distancing, very clean. and the restroom was also very clean.

I hate onion rings but love their onion strings. Every other item we ordered was delicious. Except for the fries. Boring and incorrectly cooked as compared to the tots. Get the shortcake dessert, you only live once. They have their own brews and guest taps, plus a way better than chain hotel hard alcohol bar. Staff appears to be overworked like most places these days.   Trying to not become a regular so that I can still fit in my pants."

                "description": "Just an ok experience - nothing too exciting but probably a nice amenity for anyone staying at the (haunted) hotel.  I was also pleasantly surprised to see it was a brewery! (We were just told we were going to the Faust Hotel)  I had a couple beers that were decent - I liked one better than the other but unfortunately I don't recall which they were. I don't recall what the meal I ordered was called - but it was a bratwurst wrapped in puff pastry. It was something I had never seen before and seemed fun. It was alright - might have just been executed better (the puff pastry wasn't done well). And I never got to get the server's attention for mustard, which would have elevated it. Oh well! I might try to recreate the dish at home!  We peeked around the hotel lobby a bit, hoping to see a spirit, but no luck!"

                "description": "My favorite meal out of the three we had when staying locally! Im going to focus on the things I ate - the Mac and cheese and ahi tuna.   That ahi tuna was the food highlight of my weekend. Ever since COVID, I've been having the hardest time getting quality tuna from restaurants but this dish was perfect. The crunchy slaw added a nice contrast to the to the tuna and sauces. I loved the combination of the multiple sauces. I would drive from San Antonio to new braunfels just to get that tuna appetizer.   I've had the Mac and cheese from here before a few years ago. I remembered it being good and it is! It ended up turning into 2 meals, it's a good amount of food. I like the noodle shape they use and the addition of the veggies. The additional Parmesan toasts on the side are so yummy. Can you ever have too many carbs with cheese?"

The beer cheese was a little off, but I really liked the pretzel bites! My husband loved the chips and salsa.  I ordered a cheeseburger with bacon and guacamole and it was one of the best burgers I have had in NB. My husband had the rueben and said it was hands down the best he's ever had.  I also had a couple house margs and they were delicious as well. Overall, I really enjoyed our visit and we will be back!"

Extremely diverse menu. We are from Florida and eat in Tarpon Springs (Greek community) regularly. The chicken souvlaki was better than what we get in Tarpon! It came with awesome potato salad and some grilled vegetables. Excellent food, excellent drinks, and affordable - and kid-friendly!"

What's not amazing is the service. If you sit at the bar, service is good. Sit at a table? Sorry for your bad luck.   The lobby is really nice with antique pieces and a couple pianos. Go check it out! Maybe run into the resident ghosts roaming the property. They're friendly enough. Cool brewery with amazing food."

Our server was Maddie and she was fabulous. She was also made our drinks and they were top notch. She got my husbands tequila on the rocks order right and made a very good Mexican martini and French 75! She definitely made our evening great. We had the perogies and German nachos for appetizers. The perogies were excellent, we really enjoyed the shoestring onion rings on top. The German nachos also were excellent. I had the beer cheese soup and French dip. The soup was very good, I was disappointed with the french dip. I think it just couldn't compare to the nachos and perogies. My husband had the corque monsiuer with fried eggs and was very impressed. My son had the Faust Wellington and was also very happy. We will be back soon and highly recommend!"

It has an amazing menu where everything sounds delicious and lots of drinks to choose from. Not just beer! They also have unique cocktails like a frozen strawberry mule which we enjoyed very much sitting at the bar. They have indoor and outdoor dining seating.  Although this place is big and it does get packed, our service was excellent and the food came out fairly quickly and hot. They definitely have a system down. The queso dip we tried was a perfect start to our meal. Of course we tried the fussy five dip which has everything in it, even corn. So good!  We decided on sharing a burger since they are pretty big. With so many unique and delicious choices on the menu it was hard to pick. We went with the Diablo burger which was absolutely delightful. Pickled onions, spicy ranch, jalapeño bacon AND a jalapeño fritter make this burger a great savory experience. Their sweet potato fries were crispy and perfectly salted and were a nice side item to have.  Overall a 10/10 experience and I cannot wait to come back and try more things at this place next time I am in New Braunfels."

We got there around 1 on a Tuesday and soon realized that parking was going to be an issue. Being that I have an injured knee, we weren't wanting to walk very far. We drove around a few times and finally found a spot on the road across the street. The parking was the only issue we faced though.  There were 3 of us and a baby and we were sat immediately. Out server was Don. He was very nice, patient, and informative. My cousin got the Great Southern Burger with a side of fries. My sister had the Crab Cake Sandwich with a side salad. I had the Crab Cake Appetizer with a small side of Poutine Fries. Don informed us that they have a scratch kitchen and you can customize your order. The food was delicious. We were so glad that we chose to eat here and didn't even mind that it was a 45 minute drive from the house. They have specialty drinks that they're known for and apparently they also have delicious shakes. I didn't try one, but I kind of wish I would have.  All in all, I'd say definitely try this place if you're in/near New Braunfels. They have seating both indoors and outdoors, and a pleasant ambiance. If you don't mind walking a bit for parking... or driving around until someone leaves lol, then this is a place you should try."

We sat outside in the patio since it was nice weather out. They have seating both inside and out.   We ordered the chips and queso as an appetizer along with the cocktail flight. The drinks were really good although I'd wish they have a few more options  on the menu cause there are only 5 to choose from. The mucks cow mule was my fav. For food we ordered the all American classic burger and the born and raised tacos with Mac and cheese. Both were delicious and did not lack flavor.   We already wanna go back to try something different ok then menu."

I couldn't get enough of them.  I will return soon to enjoy an entree because the descriptions written about them sounded delicious."

                "description": "This in my opinion was one of the better meals I have had in a long time. We were a large party of 8 and all had different meals. They were all so unique and different packed full of flavor and fun. Our waitress Carson was extra sweet and seemed to make it a priority to make great small talk.   I had the Diablo burger and paid extra for a premium side. They make their own tater tots and they were filled with jalapeños, cheddar cheese and cream cheese. They had a little extra crunch to them but were like nothing I had before.   We shared the apple pie cheesecake which was also good. I would not call it great and a must have but I also think that is because I may have overeaten my meal because it was so divine."

                "description": "This place was amazing!!   I loved the cocktail flight, you get to choose which cocktails you sample and we chose the Sangria, the Mule, the Marg, and the Sipper. Our favorites were the Sangria and their signature frozen Mule.  The sausage dip was okay, not the best I've ever tasted but it wasn't bad by any means.  My bf got the Born and Raised tacos with elote on top. These tacos blew our mind lol. They were so juicy and just everything we did not expect from a ground beef taco. I'm really glad we got these. The Mac and cheese he got as a side was great as well. It had pimento cheese so it had a slightly different taste than we are used to but we liked it!   I had the Havarti Jam burger. I thought the burger was okay, as I've had a bacon jam burger before elsewhere, but it was still enjoyable though. Their beef here is perfectly cooked and tastes amazing. If you love caramelized onions and Havarti cheese, and you don't mind a hint of sweetness from the jam, this burger is perfect for you!   We will definitely be back to try some of their tempura- fried shrimp dishes."

They definitely have different things that make you explore and try new things! I was iffy with my Diablo burger but man it was the best combination of sweet, spicy, and meaty! The chips with queso was ok, the chips were a little stale and queso was clumpy. The service was amazing, friendly, and swift. Everyone was happy to help and knew their menus pretty well. Our server was also very experienced when it came to draft and crafted beers along with spirits and fund drinks! I would most definitely come back! My mouth is watering just thinking about this place"

Wait staff was friendly and efficient.   We stopped here on our way up to Austin to celebrate our anniversary. I went with the Mexican Street Food Burger, I think that was the name? ‍ Anyways it was a burger that had a bunch of things on it including Mexican Street Corn. It came with fries which I upgraded to Poutine Fries because why wouldn't I on our anniversary it's time to celebrate. Wifey got Shrimp Tacos with pickled onions on top and I believe some kind of Asian style seasoning. Her meal came with fries as well which she said were good but once she tried my poutine fries she quickly wished she upgraded. We shared my fries because hey it was our anniversary and I'm a nice guy (sometimes).   Overall a good dinning experience. Would reccomend and would return."

                "description": "Their website says:  \"The health and safety of our customers and staff is our number one priority. That's why we are continuing to take precautionary measures to ensure proper sanitization and minimal contact for all your orders.\"  Given this statement it seemed odd that no one in the place (except for me) was wearing masks, and the tables weren't spaced far apart. I would be very uncomfortable dining in here. But my order was for pickup.   I ordered a Caesar salad. The online menu says there's a balsamic reduction, but it was nowhere to be found. That's unfortunate. The salad was a decent size. The dressing was good. It seemed like it was yogurt based. It needed something. Maybe more garlic, or some salt.  The Parmesan crisps were a nice touch, and weren't mentioned on the menu, so maybe they took the place of the balsamic reduction. It's a fair trade off.   I'm on a low fat diet due to some recent health issues, so I think the rest of their menu is off limits for me."

Fantastic place located right downtown. Walking distance from a local hotel. The beer selection would impress a cicerone (certified beer expert). The portions were huge and the staff was great. Gorgeous decor with an indoor and outdoor option.   Fred was our bartender and he was awesome. Great personality too.   I can't attach any pictures because I ate all the food!"

Great outdoor space, but it was thunderstorming while we were there.   $17 for a burger and fries is pretty steep though. I got the Scape Goat and the thin beef patty didn't even come close to covering the bottom bun. Disappointing for a burger at that price point. It was flavorful though. Parmesan aioli fries were an up charge; they were pretty delicious.   Basic cheeseburger was deliciously messy and the side salad was beautiful!   We tried the Muck Mule, Peach Sangria, and I had a sample of the Flamingo Fruit beer. All were very good.   Give this New Braunfels gem a try when you're visiting or just passing through!"

                "description": "Stopped by tonight because I saw the Spicy Juicy Lucy listed as one of the best burgers in San Antonio/New Braunfels. Arrived right at five and seated very quickly on the cute patio. Service was quick, and my mouthwatering burger arrived promptly. Definitely lived up to the hype, stuffed with creamy pimiento cheese and stacked high with all the good, non-healthy stuff. Just the right amount of spice too, more about flavor than intense heat. I devoured it quickly because the bun could barely hold it all and I just couldn't resist. So tasty.  Also, the service here was so amazing. My sweet waitress came out to tell me they were fixing my order to get me the sweet potato fries I ordered instead of regular fries. I hadn't even noticed the mistake! I ended up with both sets of fries, and then they didn't charge me for either to make up for their mistake. Superb customer service that sealed the deal for me. Going to recommend this place highly to everyone I know. Hoping to try another burger here soon!"

I'd recommend this restaurant for any occasion, just get there early lol. I live in Pflugerville or I'd be there all the time!"

Either way, this is a cool, low key joint. Best part is that they serve both wine AND coffee! They are the same company as Wicked Voodoo Coffee, and its super interesting that they have a wine and coffee bar. I love it! The concept and the place is so unique. They also have legit charcuterie boards. The staff here is also extremely sweet and nice. Great customer service, amazing ambience, and a great place to bring friends. They also have a private seating area if you wanted to reserve for a large party. If wine and coffee are your jam, this is a perfect place for you!"

Then there is Melinda, who was primarily taking care of us.  She was subbing in from one of their drive-thru locations due to being short-staffed, and she was flat-out nails!  Great personality, extremely helpful, and just a lot of fun to talk with. My wife did have the munchies and ordered the bacon donuts, not really reading the description...obviously missing the 'mountain' in the title.  This is enough to feed Joey Chestnut...a huge pile of freshly made rings, topped with bacon and a sticky-sweet glaze...with a side of healthy fresh berries.  My wife has breakfast for the next few days. Great wine selection...coffee smelled great, but did not have any (got a bag of beans to go), and truly outstanding people... We will go out of our way to visit again, for these experiences, even in today's climate, are rare. You will not be disappointed."

                "description": "I have not been to Seguin Brewing since they were in a non climate-controlled warehouse behind a house, down a dirt road in the countryside. Crazy to see them now downtown in a large, beautiful space. Sadly, the beer is, I think, still mediocre. Everything seemed watered down and missing something. Their Heffe and Oktoberfest just didn't taste like that type of beer, and the Pecan is just meh. I was disappointed to see the beer hadn't improved over the years. However, if you do come here, the pizza is phenomenal! There seemed to be only one guy working the kitchen (bless his soul), but he was turning out pizza after pizza and they were so good! I have the Sleek Blue Ribbon and oh man! Drool! I love pesto on pizza but usually it takes place of the red sauce, which I don't like. But here, you get both = win!  I'd say it's worth a stop, but if you're a hardcore beer snob, it may not be to you liking."

                "description": "Best Place in Seguin!  Popped into this place while explore Seguin. The craft beer is excellent. I had the El Hefe wheat beer while my wife had the Bock and Rohl amber bock. Both were terrific, clean and crisp. The El Hefe had the right amount of cloudiness and citric aftertaste while the Bock and Rohl had a caramel finish. The brick oven pizza was tad singed but that added to the flavor. It was loaded with toppings and cheese that literally oozed off the slice as you picked it up. Customer service was also great. The bartender's recommendations were spot on and the kitchen staff were quick and friendly."

The people next to me we raving about the food too.  Love to know if you are making your own crust\\dough, but right now I'll give you the benoit of the doubt.  The girl behind the register was KILLING IT: serving tables, making pizza, taking orders, and great attitude.    The bar side: ugh, where do I start, and all in sanitary conditions.  The guy in the green shirt pulled down his mask to talk to everyone, didn't wash his hands once, then used a towel sitting by the bar to wipe down every single inch of my glass.  I just asked for a new glass and poured my beer in there."

At times surly service and excessively long lines to place food and drink orders make this a pass in my book. Their in-house brews are very nice but some can be found on tap elsewhere, which I highly suggest if you want to try any."

We came here on a whim from the office. Sam helped us with setting us up with the private room and keep us in budget. I wasn't trying to have anything formal but I still wanted it to be a nice evening for my coworker was leaving the office.  The food was DELICIOUS and the service was AMAZING  to say the least. We stayed in budget and my party guest paid for their own adult beverages. I feel the need to add this information because the staff did not make it seem at all to be an inconvenience and were so accommodating.   We then leaned it was trivia night and this lasted about 2 hours and we really did enjoy this as it was a great team bonding experience!  Huge thank you to Seguin  Brewery for the memorable evening in Seguin!"

Service was warm, welcoming, genuine.  I will return to try their other menu items, they sounded yummy.   I liked that use paper straws and non styrofoam to go boxes."

                "description": "Pretty decent brewery located near historic downtown Seguin. They offer a variety of their own brews in addition to some guest taps from other breweries. I believe they also offer some other drinks such as margaritas and wine. The space is pretty cool with lots of room and a hip look. They have TVs to watch the game on. We visited on a Saturday and the service was good and the place wasn't too busy - although it did appear to be busier when we walked by later in the day. There is a kitchen in an adjoining space that serves up some brick-oven style pizza, though we already had lunch plans, and therefore didn't partake - but it looked really good! We enjoyed our visit and would consider a return trip if ever in the area again."

Lots of history to get lost in, regardless of their status.  Arrived as they were opening the doors. Tried several beers, all passably good. Filled the growler for later.   Ordered a couple of pizzas to stave off teenage hangries. Pizza was ok. Definitely wouldn't come back just for it.  Nice space. Nice people. Nice prices. Okay food and beer. I'd like to see what it's like on a Tuesday evening when just the locals are around...  When in Seguin, it's definitely a place to visit."

It came with a red cabbage slaw that really surprised me at how good it was as that's not a thing I usually like.  Only minus- I'd like to see more microbrews on tap. There are at least 3 breweries in New Braunfels and only one represented here when I went. There's a good selection of German imports but I'd really like to see more Texas beer on tap. If they need to stick with the German theme there's plenty of German style beer from Texas. Fredericksburg is not that far from here."

                "description": "This is a must stop place for us every time we're in New Braunfels! We've been for brunch, lunch, and to enjoy beers and apps. Honestly, my favorite time to come is for brunch, especially when it's nice enough to sit outside. The ambiance is amazing: brews, live music, and great brunch! Our first time here was for a Mother's Day brunch, which we were fortunate enough to enjoy wonderful weather and got to sit outside and hear some live music! Their avocado toast is delicious: kale, sprouts, and eggs however you like them. It's perfect if you like healthier fare. Some of the skillets and schnitzels are more popular, but I'd honestly get the avocado toast again as it was THAT good.   We most recently came here for my brother-in-law's birthday dinner and really enjoyed it! For starters, the service is amazing. We showed up with cakes, cupcakes, and an ice chest full of ice cream. The wait was an hour long, but they sat us quickly when they realized how much stuff we had brought. They kept the cake in the fridge for us and provided candles and a lighter, which was super nice and helpful! The service alone is reason enough to come back: they truly go above and beyond. For dinner, I ordered the grilled salmon and my husband had the TX BBQ shrimp. My salmon was cooked perfectly and I really enjoyed the potatoes! The shrimp was amazing - I wish I'd ordered it! It had a good amount of heat to it as it also has andouille sausage. It's definitely worth ordering!  As a side note, this place can get PACKED on any given weekend and doesn't take reservations. Something to keep in mind during peak hours if you're coming starving. Overall, can't recommend this place enough if you're stopping in New Braunfels. It's truly a must-do!"

                "description": "The place is very spacious with a beautiful mural on the outside - I was surprised at how packed with people it was in spite of how large it is. Definitely very popular. The outdoor seating is ginormous! You could tell they were busy but still Emilia, the manager , who was acting as hostess and all around hands on, was very sweet accommodating all who came to her. She was very quick to meet everyone's needs.   I sat at the bar, thanks to Emilia (the first waitress I encountered at the bar was very rude and actually told me there was a wait for the bar and I needed to se Emilia... she was wrong, bar's open seating as in all places). Cynthia ended up being my server. She was wonderful and quick to take my order and check on me for drinks, etc.   They were out of the Wiener schnitzel, which was the reason I originally went, so it was very disappointing. While the ambiance and space and food were great, I was a bit disappointed at the fact that they didn't have such a signature dish so early in the day (noon). I ended up getting a jager schnitzel which felt a bit dry / over fried, but the mushroom sauce was delicious! It was tasty but I'll have to go back and see if it was just bad luck. The fingerling potatoes were well seasoned and delicious. I don't eat boiled cabbage or sauerkraut, but I tasted it and seemed pretty authentic.   They did have quite a varied menu of both food and drinks and most of the waiters and waitresses seemed to be very on top of service. I'll definitely be back in hopes of getting a Wiener schnitzel and maybe try a few other items."

                "description": "Was here for spring break and my dad wanted German food. There are lots of advertisements and lots of praise for this establishment. Esthetics is pleasing with a nice outdoor/indoor seating. Our server was less than attentive and clearly did not want to be there. Starters we went for the pretzel, break and cheese sauce was great but there was a film of fried cheese on top. Clearly been under the heat lamp since lunch. My daughter and dad decided to get the schnitzel and I had steak frites. The schnitzel was cold and dry and my steak was clearly spoiled meat! After staring down the server for 30 minutes and waving him over for the chart we was forced to leave a tip per the server due to the credit card machine. It was such a bad experience that my dad didn't even want to try the other German food in the area. Clearly this is just a drinks appetizer establishment."

                "description": "We had to try a German restaurant in New Braunfels and everyone said this is the place to go. They have a huge outdoor Biergarten and even the \"indoor\" Bierhalle is essentially outdoor, with mesh walls and sky high ceilings. Dogs are not only allowed, but encouraged, both in the Biergarten and the Bierhalle. There were several there when we visited and they were all very well behaved.   We ordered a ton of food here, and liked all of it. I'm not usually a fan of shoestring fries, but the ones here were perfectly cooked and seasoned. The broccoli was also prepared perfectly, not over or under cooked. The red cabbage was pickled, making for a unique but very good dish. The Apple fritters were the highlight of the evening. More closely resembling a corn fritter than the Apple fritters you would get at a donut shop, they were crispy on the outside, soft inside and came with a delectable dipping sauce.   A couple of complaints. The live music (a Biergarten staple) was WAY too loud. We had to lean right up to each other's ears to talk to one another. Also, although our main course came surprisingly fast, we had to wait forever for the dessert."

                "description": "This is my second time visiting this restaurant and the rating it has on here fits it well. It is not horrible but not overly fantastic. I can see this as a place to hang out with friends for a beer and finger foods.   The day we went there was a farmer's market so we were occupied while we waited the 45 minutes it took to get a table. I am guessing COVID restrictions play part in this, which is fine. The beers are good! I lived in Germany (Heidelberg, Ketch, and Kaiserslautern) for over 12 years and my husband is French and German, born and raised in Schweinfurt, Germany. Going to German restaurants are a treat for us because we like to compare American German restuarnt to the originals. All American German restuarnat cater to the Bavaria region of Germany and this one does a great job mixing both American and German style foods.   I had the Texas schnitel, which I did not care that much for. My husband had the German meatball which was amazing. The brussel sprouts are some of the best I've tasted since moving here.   In all, this is a fun place to hang out with friends and family. They have live music, which I would have hoped was traditional German, but hey! I do see myself visiting a third time."

Still hit or miss on the table service, but overall they have it down. Being very cautious about distancing and masks.  New and updated menu which has some great items on it.

We came from SA to have dinner as family and go float lanterns in the river on the anniversary of my mothers death. It was a special day and there was a two hour wait. Pedro understood we weren't there to celebrate, it was a special evening and got us a table right away. We eat here often and definitely highly recommend. The food is amazing, service impeccable and the drinks are great! Thank you again!"

We spoke to Lauren, the owner at Aquabrew and they were incredibly kind and generous with allowing us to use their venue for after the service. When we got there, the GM, Hannah, took such great care of us and everyone else who attended. They went above and beyond for us during a difficult time and helped take one thing off our shoulders and for that they have earned our business forever. Really good people! Great beer!"

When we walked in we were very disappointed in their craft selection. I had researched this prior to choosing to go there based on their craft choices showed online. Again, something else that needed to be updated. Also, they aren't serving food. There was a large dog walking around that would come right up to you or sneak up under the tables and lick your feet. I like dogs so it was ok but for someone that doesn't..... Would not go back here until they get fully moved or opened."

                "description": "They've thought about everything at this brewery.  Great food, live music, seating inside, outside, and UPSTAIRS on the deck!  When the weather is right, they have the big glass garage doors open.  Yeah, they brew their own beer here and they have a decent selection.  It's not your typical brewery where you can just stroll in and choose the table you want to sit at.  That's because they have full table service for food and drinks.  I prefer breweries that let you wander around from the bar, to an outside table, to an inside table, and then back again - you know, rinse, lather, and repeat (relaxed and unstructured - I need that once in a while).  If you just want to stop in for a quick beer, you can sit at the bar.  The bar is quite large but also very popular with the college crowd, so it's hard to get a seat at times.   Now to the serious stuff - the beer!  I've had their Kolsch (San Marcos Blonde) and their Vienna Lager.  The blonde was the run of the mill Kolsch, not bad by any means, but the Vienna Lager - wow!  It had a great malty taste to it.  I liked it so much that I purchased a crowler of it to take home.  I rarely do that, so that tells you it must be good.  Enough useless banter - here's everything else you need to know about this place:  Free parking lot right next door or free 2 hr street parking.   Patio areas in the front and the back with overhead infrared heaters and fans with misters (they have both Texas seasons covered).  This place is popular with the college kids - TOO popular.  Growler refills are $12 or $18 for 64 oz, and $24 or $36 for 128 oz, depending on the beer you select.    Crowlers to go:  $8 or $10 (depending on the beer).  You can get three for $20 or $25 (depending on the beer).  Plenty of food options.   And I almost forgot to tell you - they have a FULL bar, not just beer!"

                "description": "Aquabrew is definitely a gem in San Marcos. I learned about it through the purchase of the brewery tour on Groupon. The tour was quaint because it's not that big, but very interesting.  The gentleman who gave the tour seemed a bit rushed at the end, but he answered our questions and seemed very knowledgeable.   At the end of the tour we got to sample some beer. They also have a beer club where you buy a growler, we got the one for $100, and join their beer club. You get a punch card for 10 refills on the growler. My husband and I got one each for $200. I was thinking it an \"okay\" deal i guess. Truthfully I wasn't that thrilled cause of the price. But OMG!!!! IT IS WELL WORTH EVERY PENNY FOLKS!!!!.   Aquabrew has some of the best beers around. I am Army and have lived and traveled all over the world and this lil place holds its ground when it comes to beers! Purchasing the growler is the best deal too.   I have not had the food yet, but the place is always busy and people seem to love it. And they have some of the cutest guys behind the bar.  In all, I give this gem an A+"

This place really has a community feel with longer style tables and an incredible open patio with fans and lighting, ping pong and live music... and of course... beer.  The food was very flavorful. Thai chicken had good spice and the chicken thigh was tender and juicy. The Margarita flatbread was fresh tasting. The arugula salad was huge and bursting with fruits and flavor.  The beer was excellent and just what you'd expect from an onsite brewery.   Overall, if you're looking for a fun place for you and your peeps to chill, eat and drink in San Marcos... you'd do well to try this place. Plus it's right up the street from the Cheetham St warehouse."

Long tables instead of individual tables to encourage people to meet new people ! Which is a really awesome concept . Also there's a large bar since it's also a brewery.  Food- my food was about a 3.5/5 , but my friends was a solid 1. Her salmon Benedict had almost uncuttable biscuit since it was so hard , and the most burnt potatoes I've ever seen. My food which was the stuffed French toast was pretty yummy, but not a lot to it.  Noise level - 1/5 THE BAND WAS SOOO LOUD. I couldn't here my friend talking 1 foot in front of me :(  Price - 2/5 wayyyy overpriced for what you get. My French toast was 11.91 and my friends meal was 15.91  Probably won't return unless it's for a group outing , but still a cool little place to check out !"

Easy to get a seat and our waitress was very attentive, despite it being happy hour and slightly busy on a Friday after work.  As a table, we ordered the: a) Brew House Pretzel - Amazingly soft and the beer queso is a great pairing  b) AB Bacon Jam Fries - HOLY! The bacon jam itself is something I've never had before and I must say this makes it a must return for me  c) Glass of Imperial Pilsner - Smooth and pretty standard for a Pilsner  d) Glass of Artificial Intelligence Tripel (9.72% ABV) - Yeah...the ABV tells the story itself  This spot has a great atmosphere, very rustic and cozy. Definitely a nice place, just wish you could order directly from the bar for faster access to beer."

                "description": "You know when someone takes a picture of themselves and posts it on Instagram,and it's at just the right angle to make them look super attractive? The Yelp reviews of this place kind of remind me of that. It's not that it was bad, but I was expecting a lot more.  The highlight of my meal was the Mosaic IPA. Balanced and drinkable, this beer was really enjoyable. I also tried the Swine Dive IPA. The taste of this was a little too clean for an IPA and just didn't have the hoppy depth to add to its character. Not bad, but I wouldn't get it again.  Overall the food I ordered was really lackluster. I didn't hate it, but it certainly wasn't a memorable meal. My chicken empanadas were oily, and had very little chicken in the filling. The whole thing struck me as more of acorn dog egg roll hybrid, and didn't really seem like an empanada at all. I was grateful for the spicy sauce it was served with, which was pretty tasty. I also ordered the brussel sprouts. There were some decent flavors here, but I would have really preferred them to have a little more char on them. They came across as slightly undercooked and worse yet, very wet. A little crispness would have gone a long way.  Service was fair, friendly enough but really on the slow side. It took me almost a half an hour to get my food and it wasn't crowded. The couple at the bar sitting next to me ordered hamburgers. I have to admit I was a little jealous because they looked good. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. Maybe it was a bad night. Whatever the reason I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again."

                "description": "Great location and cool venue. It's evident a lot of time and thought were put into this place.   Great beers, especially liked the Ape-ricot Wheat.   I wish I saved room for the Porter Ice Cream Float.   The AB burger was solid, maybe a little messy tho.  Forget the fries tho. The regular fires were under seasoned and chewy. Think Wendy's fries when you  don't finish them at lunch and try to eat them at the end of your shift. Bleh  The staff was super friendly.   The outdoor portion looks great but a bit too hot out today to go and enjoy it."

That portion of the night really sucked.  Howeverrrr, the street corn, queso, crispy tuna, edamame, and loaded fried were reallyyyy good. We especially loved the street corn. I wish we would've gotten the delicious food on time, instead of having to remind the staff multiple times butttt at least it tasted amazing??   I can't give them more stars even though the food was great because service is so so so important."

                "description": "Unfortunately the new menu and chef drops the rating from 5 to 4. Still friendly waitstaff and excellent happy hour. But the reason I come to AquaBrew and recommend it to everyone I meet is the food. The \"new\" salmon dish isn't even close to the goodness of the previous balsamic salmon with veggies. Dry. Lacked flavor. Sticky rice instead of the delish potatoes and only green beans instead of a mix of seasonal veggies. Hubby had the tostadas and 'meh' reaction. Will give it one more try before relegating it to happy hour only place with 3 stars. So sad."

                "description": "Just left after lunch. Cute/hip spot with friendly staff.   We ordered the AB burger and I did an upgrade to their bacon jam fries ($4 upgrade). I was so excited to try these fries but they were very underwhelming to me. $4 is steep for an up charge but had I enjoyed them I wouldn't have minded. The burger was the best bite on the table. It was small in size but very juicy and tasty. Not one to split.   Next up was the fried chicken and eggs. It has so many things I typically like - fried chicken, cream gravy, bacon jam, eggs, but I didn't like this dish. It lacked dimension of flavor. It needed something. The herbed fries that came with it were good. I liked them better than the $4 bacon jam ones.   Our kids split the stuffed French toast. The only ate a little bit because it was too sweet. If a kid thinks something is too sweet you know it's toooooo sweet. Neither ate it. It was a waste of money.   Overall I'm glad we tried it but don't need to return on our own accord."

I really enjoyed the margarita I had and the atmosphere was nice. Are usually never think of AquaBrew to eat at, but now that I finally tried it, I will definitely go back! Love it! The shrimp and grits is super buttery but I LOVE IT"

                "description": "Great meal here! Came here for dinner last night with family based on the Yelp reviews and couldn't have made a better choice! Tucked in the back of this nice historic downtown community, the quaint little restaurant is a gem.  We started with cheese sticks for an appetizer. The cheese sticks were great and the marinara sauce was unique and possibly the best I've ever had! The cheese sticks were cooked to perfection in a well seasoned batter that was great standalone but went perfectly with the marinara. The marinara was seasoned well with a little sweetness to it which I've never had but it was the best marinara I ever had! A great way to start a meal.  For the meal, I got the Black Jack Queso burger. It was great. Soft bun, burger patty cooked perfectly medium well and well seasoned, fresh condiments and the cheese complemented everything well. The fries were well seasoned and tasted great! Great meal and I'd definitely both recommend and return."

                "description": "After a long and rewarding work week, a rare opportunity arose for the wife and I. Date night. I told the wife that the restaurant was her choice, and I would not say no to any suggestion. In the mood for something different, my only request was not a chain restaurant.   The wife's pick: Gruene River Grill. The wife always suggests Gruene River Grill, but she cannot get me to go. I am a carnivore and generally prefer to eat meat over chicken. Looking the menu, they have a lot of yummy looking options, but a majority of the dishes are chicken. But a deal is a deal, the wife wants, the wife gets. Let's roll.   We pulled into the parking lot and the lot was packed. This parking lot is usually always packed, so this was no surprise. I dropped the Mrs. off to get us in line while I parked. After a small wait for a spot, I was parked and getting a text saying she was already seated. Pretty quick for a Friday night!   I walked inside and found my wife seated by the window that overlooked the river. I promptly grabbed a seat, and the waitress came and took my drink order. She returned shortly thereafter with my drink and we decided to order cheese sticks for an appetizer. The queso was our first choice, but we did not want to fill up on chips, so cheese sticks it was. After a small wait, she returned with cheese sticks and took our order. The wife ordered the Guadalupe chicken dish, and I ordered the New York Strip.   We then started on the cheese sticks. Neatly presented on a long rectangular plate with marinara sauce. They were crispy, delicious, and the marinara sauce was a combination of sweet and savory. Delicious.   In good time, our main course arrived. Both were presented very well and looked very delicious. I took a bite of my steak, and it was delicious. Perfect temperature, very succulent, and the sauce that was on top of it was delicious. My wife started on her plate as well, and enjoyed her first bite as well. While she was distracted, I attempted to make a stealthy move and attempt to steal a bite. She quickly caught on to my game and denied my attempt. Dang it...   We both finished our meals and were very satisfied. The atmosphere was great with the whole Gruene vibe, the service was great, and the food was delicious. We paid for the meal and were gone in great time. Upon walking out, the line was out the door with people waiting to eat, so perfect timing (we got there right around 6:00 PM).   The next time you are in a Gruene and want a delicious meal, give this place a try. You will not be disappointed.   Enjoy."

                "description": "When friends heard that I was flying into San Antonio, they urged me to take the 35+ mile drive to new Braunfels, Texas, and eat at the Gruene River Grill. It seemed like a lot of trouble just to eat at a restaurant, but I followed their advice and boy am I happy. Also comporting with their advice, I ordered the Mandarin jalapeño pork chops. They are so incredibly good. Absolutely the platonic form of food. There's the tiniest kick to them, but what I mostly notice is the flavorful pork chop, grilled to perfection. The green beans are among the best I've ever eaten and the mashed potatoes are incredible, as mashed potatoes generally are. There's are really creamy. The only recommendation I would add, other than asking for a table with the Riverview, is save one of the pork chops to take back so you can eat it right off the bone in the privacy of your own home. Highly recommend. A+++"

                "description": "I really wanted to try a steak house tonight so we ran across Greene River Grill and everything looked good. They served Texas size portions for sure! We ordered the trifecta appetizer, then I had the Balsamic Ribeye because I love ribeye steak! And Hubby had the Chicken Fried Chicken which is one of his favorites at other restaurants.   The trifecta was really good. I loved the salsa and queso. Hubby loved the guacamole (I am not a fan). The steak was good at first but then I noticed that al you can taste is the balsamic vinegar. The meat was tender but there was not flavor. The green beans and red potatoes were good. Green beans had a little kick to them. The chicken fried chicken was ok. Not really seasoned. Hubby added salt and pepper. The mashed potatoes and corn were REALLY GOOD!   Overall, we have plenty for tomorrow's dinner but we will try another steak house. May try to get something else here when we come back to shop."

Not that you'd expect anything else from this dip! We all fought over the last creamy crunchy bite, oh yes, this dip is served with tortilla chips and it's gluten free for those that have an intolerance like me! The yummy wedge salad with added bacon and blue cheese rounded out my \"cheesy\" meal at GRG! Oh, I almost forgot, for those that like prosecco, they've got it! Thank you to our attentive servers, Carson and Alex! Now, if y'all could just make me a gluten free chicken fried steak ;-) Cheers!"

                "description": "Gruene River Grill is a place for hanging out, great outdoor ambiance and great food! Oh and Gruene is sounded like 'Green'?!  LOL That threw me off by the locals around here telling us.  Going to Gruene downtown was a  small nice town with lots of lights on their streets and big trees, hearing bands play music and small local stores to shop.  Some houses were converted to bed and breakfast places or stores. Unfortunately, we came on a weekday but the place was still crowded.  The parking lot of Gruene River Grill was large and the parking was full but we got lucky. When dining, ask to sit in the causal river dining area versus indoor. We came at perfect timing before sunset and overlooking the river.   Our server was very friendly and hospitable. Love the Texan accent but I forgot his name to give him credit. They have the downloadable menu scan to see the menu.  This is common now since Covid 19 started.  They do have happy hours on weekdays from 3:30p-6:30p and we missed it.   With many friends to order, it was great to try every dish they had.  We ordered many things and these were my ratings of eat: Peach Bellini (5 - a must try as its strong and good) Cucumber Mojitos (5) Cesar Side Salad (4) Crawfish Jalapeño Chowder (5 - a must try!!) Redfish (4.5 - a little bit salty on some parts but flavors are good) Filet Gorgonzola Mignon (5 -  a must try as its tender and love the blend of this cheese on meat) Balsamic Rib Eye (5 - their signature dish) Country Fried Steak (5 - crispy, moist and huge portion!)  All dishes, sides like green beans and potato wedges were very well cooked. Definitely, come here to try their food and enjoy their ambiance as I definitely recommend them. [14th/100]"

                "description": "This restaurant was recommended to my fiancé by one of his coworkers.  We got to the restaurant around 4 on a Sunday and got seated immediately.  For an appetizer we had shrimp wontons, which I highly recommend.  I had a hard time deciding what I wanted for dinner.  There were a lot of different entrees that sounded good to me, but I decided to go with their blackened redfish with crawfish Dijon peppercorn sauce served on a bed of basmati rice and a side of Asian slaw.  It usually comes with vegetable medley, but I substituted that with the Asian slaw, which is a favorite of mine.  My fiancé had the 16 oz ribeye seared in butter and balsamic vinegar with green beans and garlic crispy red potatoes.  We had dessert as well and chose the banana pudding, which is one of my favorite desserts and their's was amazing.    We really enjoyed The Gruene River Grill.  The atmosphere was nice, our waiter was kind and very attentive, and it was a clean restaurant.  I definitely recommend this restaurant.  They have a wide variety of different entrees for everyone, from tacos, to steaks, to seafood, and entrees with an oriental twist.  We are looking forward to going back and trying some different entrees ourselves.  As far as price goes, it was reasonable, especially for the portion size and quality of the food.  I've heard this restaurant gets pretty busy, and they do not accept reservations.  If you go on a weekend, I recommend going sometime in the early afternoon."

                "description": "We visited Gruene River Grill for the first time on a Friday afternoon, before a concert at Whitewater Amphitheater. We were very fortunate to get good parking spot and was promptly seated by the nice hostess.  We started off with a couple of cocktails, The Rattler and a frozen Margarita. Both were delicious. For appetizers, we split the Shrimp Wantons. Holy Moly were they delicious. Seriously, one of the better things I've eaten in a long while.   For our main courses, my wife had the Oriental Salad and I had the Beef Fajita Street Tacos. My wife loved her salad. The beef fajita tacos were simply fantastic.   We will definitely be back the next time we are in the area. The service was great, the drinks were refreshing and the food was delicious. 5 stars from me.  *Sorry no photos, too hungry to snag a pic!"

We had about 35 people for a 70th Birthday party which they catered for use. We were given the downstairs room which greets with a panoramic view of the river below (I mean DIRECTLY below!! It's amazing how steep the hill is)    Our 2 servers were absolutely amazing, friendly, outgoing and extremely courteous. They went out of their way to bring us food that was not originally on the buffet line to help accommodate picky eaters (the kids lol)    The food was out if this world good!! We had Santfe chicken, smoothered steal, mashed potatoes and green beans. The steak was so tender I only needed my fork to cut through it!! Everything else was amazing and flavorful as well.    I can't wait to come back again!!"

Had the spinach and artichoke dip and that was pretty tasty as an appetizer. Overall this was a very good meal. Lastly finished off dinner with a carrot cake that had very good flavor. Overall I will definitely be back! This place does it right and had great customer service by Anna our server."

                "description": "First of all, this restaurant is beautiful. It is huge and the view is amazing. It's perfect for date. The staff were friendly. There was a line when we got there for dinner but it went fast. We were given a window table and it was a  breathtaking view. Of course, I had to try their peach Bellini. It was sooooo refreshing and gave me a nice little buzz. For starters, we had their home made cheese  sticks and bowl of jalapeno crawfish chowder. Both were very good but the chowder stole the show. My kiddo rated their cheese sticks \"the best she has ever had\". We figured if their appetizers were that good, the entrees were probably better.  Unfortunately, they were not. The country  fried steak was huge but it was bland, gristly with a bland and burnt tasting gravy. The corn that came with it was delicious though. My fried catfish was moist and fresh but bland yet again. The Asian slaw and fries that came with it were good though. The chicken Guadalupe, I was told was ok.  All in all, we liked this restaurant but might stick to appetizers or try something else next time. It is also worth noting that they are supporters of the Wounded Warrior Project and provide military discount as well."

                "description": "The fried catfish is to die for! They catch the biggest and freshest ones. Get the spinach and artichoke dip to start off with. And definitely recommend the Asian slaw if you want to try something new. You get to see the Guadalupe river from windows or patio. And the service is terrific!"

                "description": "Ok, so this place is really cool. It's in a historically old rustic building (think big bar like), right along the Guadeloupe river. The menu is pretty diverse- we tried the enchiladas, the chicken Guadeloupe, and the oriental shrimp salad. All were amazingly tasty. Sean , our server, make sure our glasses were never empty. He made the suggestions on the meals and he was spot on. If you're down in Gruene , you have to give this restaurant a try. I'd give it five stars."

                "description": "We went to Gruene River Grill our first night after moving into town. It was a great start to our new life here. Kerrington was our waitress. She was one of the best waitresses we've had in a long time. She knew the menu very well and recommended great food. The decor of the restaurant is very cool. I had the Gorgonzola burger and my husband had the Gruene chicken enchiladas. Both were very good. The enchiladas were a little spicy but not too much. The burger was also very good. I definitely recommend Gruene River Grill and Kerrington."

I typically order the redfish because it is an extra large serving with a tasty crawfish sauce. Save room for dessert became the cobbler is wonderful!"

Starters - 3 (good presentation but just ok taste)  Main course portions -2 ...  (5 if you like paying for fillers, but you won't get much meat or any kind)   Quality of food - 1... (5 if you like it drowned in a bland sauce/gravy)  Service - 2 (waitresses could not get our order right from the beer to the main meal)   Atmosphere - 4   Summary- if you want to pay for a beer and starter with a decent atmosphere you'll be ok. Main meal quality and quantity of food provided are over priced and not worth it."

Restaurant is adorable - love the location right by everything - super easy to walk to a bakery or around downtown   3. The food is DELICIOUS. From the rye bread, the schnitzels and sausages, and ESPECIALLY the black forest cake. Seriously, the best I've ever had.    Cons:   1. They run out of the Black Forest cake. Seriously. I went here on my birthday, and they run out of it at the beginning of the week usually. And it's REALLY the best. I hope they start making MOOOOREEE!   2. It's a little pricey, but the portions are huge and sharing is definitely easy."

Picked this place and really enjoyed the service and selection of items!  The rye bread was really great! Then I had garlic soup that was good. The Wife wanted to try the sausage sampler. They had the spicy mustard I like. The only problem I had is, I've never had jalapeño sausage in Germany!! Not my thing.  Then I had the Rinder Goulash that was really great, the Wife had Huhnerbrust Geschnetzeltes. Chicken breast with sautéed spinach with mushrooms that was good as well!  I really like the place. I wish Yelp allowed 3 1/2 stars. Would I go back, you bet!"

Plenty of parking was still available for his customers but he felt it was more important to cuss me out then to ask me respectfully to move my vehicle. I've never eaten at this restaurant and I never will due to how the owner acts out in front of it."

Firstly the series's great. The waitress was friendly and the place very clean. Beautiful ambiance perfect for a date or a couples dinner night. The food was good both my girls and husband agree it was yummy. All of our food came correct and hot. The beer was cold and the bread was fresh. Something to note while this is not a dress up place it's easy to feel under dressed. Also, this is a great place to try new things but the price is high and the options limited. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a quiet dinner with good food. As far as the food it was a little salty but flavorful. The sausage mustard was to die for and the red cabbage was absolutely delicious. We left full and satisfied."

                "description": "This little cottage restaurant has the potential to be a absolutely great German restaurant. However, it has a little house work to do to get there. No doubt it has the charming ambience and Great German food of the best restaurants in the country.   Here is a list of minor items that needs to take care of first.  1. A vase of plastic flowers on the tables needs to have real flowers. 2. The bread needs to be changed to a better hearty German bread instead of the white bread with brown swirls. 3. Do not simply dump a small pile of foil-wrap butter pads, but have a real butter server with the bread. 4. The service on a Sunday afternoon was deplorable. The young man probably was a student from TSU in nearby San Marcos, working on weekends to make a little money for college. He did not repeat the orders from the four of us and therefore our food came all mixed up. He never thought to refill any of our drinks until we finally ask him to. He was a nice of guy  but just not trained to be a true sophisticated food server like this little restaurant deserves.  By the way, having a young singer with real lederhosen amble through the dining rooms singing German songs with his accordion was brilliant. This restaurant is truly a little gem that simply needs to be polished."

I lived in Germany over 12 years and the Alpine Haus has some of the best German food I have discovered stateside.  They are short a baker so they are short on desserts especially their Black Forest cake which the time I had a piece it was spectacular.  I have been told if you go during the week they typically have desserts.  If you enjoy authentic prepared and tasting German cuisine then this is your spot.  Ask for Katherine as your server.  She was friendly, attentive and very knowledgeable.  Bon Appetite and Geschmack gut."

The reason for two stars is we were charged $7.50 for a split plate charge which normally includes the sides on both plates. Nope we were given a empty plate! The waiter should have advised us of this and told us for a few dollars more we could have ordered the sausage appetizer. I wrote them to seek a reply but they never responded to their form on their webpage."

                "description": "Walked into the Gristmill about 7:55 P.M. on New Year's Eve 2021, not really expecting to be seated.  Surprisingly, the hostesses were very accommodating, and promised us the outside seating we requested \"in about 20 minutes\".  We were seated in five. Our server, Morgan, a lovely  young woman, a college student at a Texas University,  was impeccable in carrying out her duties, she gave us much better service one might expect on such a busy night as this was.  Everything was perfect, from the seating, to the food - onion rings, tortilla soup, the bronze catfish and the baby back ribs were all excellent. It was an amazingly wonderful experience made so by a diligent and attentive wait staff. Totally recommend the Gristmill River Restaurant"

                "description": "Ambience: the vibe felt great. Nice breeze coming in from the water. Our server was super nice. We went early so not too crowded until about noon-1p. Great surroundings/shopping to walk off all the food.   Food: As we reviewed the menu, our server couldn't tell us too much about certain entrees secondary to his own eating restrictions (which I understand) HOWEVER, does kinda put a damper on things as I was hoping to narrow down my thought options....chicken, steak, burger or what???  I settled on the Bacon wrapped filet because I know that almost anything wrapped in BACON has potential but, I wasn't WOW'd by it. Bacon wasn't cooked all the way, steak was really tender but a little more red, than I like, for a medium well preparation. They also put gravy on my mashed when I clearly said, gravy on the side. Assuming he forgot that part??? No biggie...moving on....  One friend ordered the Trout, really good, seasoned well.  Another friend ordered the chopped steak, really good and the cheese on top totally set it off.  Overall, I wouldn't mind eating here again with friends on another beautiful weekend day!  Just keep in mind, NO AC, just ceiling fans."

                "description": "This place was really great. Staff at the door wasn't very friendly but we enjoyed our waitress a lot. She was so funny, kind, and really made our experience phenomenal.  The restaurant itself is HUGE and beautiful. Definitely a great place for a date, friends and family hangout, just something for everyone and every occasion.  Food is great, I really see what all the hype is about. They pack their sandwiches FULL of meat. We could not believe the portions we were served and for the price? Absolutely worth it. Wait for a Sunday afternoon wasn't too bad at a little over an hour. Gives you time to hangout around town and enjoy the shops. If you can snag an outside table, I would highly recommend it, like I said the views from the restaurant are great.  10/10 recommend"

                "description": "We had so much fun at this restaurant! They are currently redoing the back so all of the seating was inside.. they had a nice warm fire going.. great views of the river inside.  It did get pretty toasty inside thankfully one of the waitresses came over and opened up the windows..   I ordered the steak salad and my friend ordered the chicken salad sandwich..  The steak salad was good, there was a handful of the lettuce that should have been tossed out not tossed into the salad which is why this isn't 5 stars.. The steak was good super tender!  We both loved the chicken salad sandwich.. it's not sweet which made it different and even more delicious!  I almost forgot the onion rings! I would absolutely order those again! Only able to eat one so I'd order the small but sooo good and not very oily at all!"

Ours appetizer finally arrived and then our meals 1-2 minutes later.   Good thing the onion rings were amazing. I had the chicken fried chicken and it was cooked perfectly and had a nice seasoning. The flat potato fries were a pleasant surprise with the perfect amount of seasoning salt."

                "description": "If it wasn't for the view/location, I think I can totally rate it as 1, or if any.    The food was not the tastiest thing I have had. It was decent. It is as average as going to Jim's/IHOP (please don't be offended if you are a fan). But the price you have to pay for a side of onion rings (picture below), it was $11.99. Honestly, they were genuinely crazy prices for the quality and quantity.   The customer service is extremely bad. We were walked into our seated area. No one greeted us at a table until about 30-40 minutes in, and that's after we tried to get their attention. No one ever came back to check on us after the food was delivered, and we were even having a hard time to get the check. I personally wouldn't go back again."

                "description": "The Gristmill is an iconic restaurant for the Gruen (pronounced \"green\") New Braunfels (pronounced \"new bronzefels\") area.   I have been here many times and give the place 5 always because of location and ambiance and the he have had to -1 for food with the comment that sometimes the food is a five and other times it's a 3.   But I come back because it's a really cool place and when there's live music it's even more cool, yea more better.   I don't recommend the jalapeño margarita as it makes my lips hurt but I do recommend the jalapeño poppers because even tho they are hot the taste is so good you would eat them if they were shooting flames.

                "description": "Just ok. By no way can I see a four star restaurant. We walked in for what you can consider as aperitif time or early dinner. We had dinner plans already but felt peckish so we had a couple of drinks and some nibbles. Our server Taj was great he was five stars. We opted on first available and were seated in the outside picnic tables. Our first table was next to the area where there is a waiter station but the smell was very off putting and asked to be seated at an adjacent table which was allowed. As we walked by we are several almost uneaten sides being pushed to the side and later picked up for disposal. We saw another table being waited on by a different server that was audibly and visibly upset that their food had yet to come out. We order precisely what we were planning to have a margarita and a sangria. Both were fine. We had the chips and artichoke dip and the half rack. All descent. Not phenomenal but descent. Everything was lukewarm. Our food came out quite quickly even before the steaks from our disgruntled diners. And it's was falling off the bone but lukewarm at most. This restaurant has loads of patrons and they hire a lot of personnel but I think they need to dedicate themselves as well to the kitchen. The coleslaw was not homemade and just about to turn which you can taste and even notice from the bubbly juices of the slaw. Would I return...No just not a four star experience with the quality and taste of their food."

                "description": "Must see! Everyone that comes to Gruene has been to the Gristmill. It is located right next to Gruene Hall and the water tower. This building is historic and used to be the cotton gin. I enjoy looking at the building every time I come here. I included a bunch of pictures so you can see the charm of this place.  I got seated right away but if you are coming on a weekend be prepared for a little bit of a wait. They do not do reservations so plan ahead. The good thing is that they have a ton of shaded outdoor seating if you have to wait. For an added bonus you can often hear the music from Gruene Hall.  I ordered the club with fries and it was great. Their fries are the best and I have never had a bad experience here. My wife also got the club sandwich and she loved it.   I have also done work events here and you can rent a room in the back. The service is always great which is nice being this is a tourist attraction.  If you haven't been here before then you have to put this on your itinerary while in Gruene. You won't regret it!"

                "description": "This was probably the coolest restaurant that I went to while around San Antonio area.  This was actually previously a factory of some sort many moons ago.  It looked as if not much was changed from the original, or they just made it look that way.  I have to say, if you like AC while eating then it's best to find another restaurant.  They have fans and shade.  So when you walk in, it's right in the town of Gruene (pronounced Green), you can easily park in the little towns parking lot and just walk (if you're able).  My aunt informed me to NEVER come on the weekend or you'll be waiting a very long time because it's a hot spot.  Off to the side of the building there are countless benches that have mist oscillating fans so you don't have to pass out while waiting in the heat.  They do have live bands that come for entertainment, and an outside bar to order drinks while you wait.  I mean, if you have all that in the waiting area then it really must be worth it.  Luckily we sat right down on the week day.  We were given the option to choose inside or outside.  We went for outside. Now this restaurant has so many levels and stairs that lead you to the back of the building.   The waiter was fantastic, the food was incredible.  All-in-all it was a good experience.  I didn't talk too much about the food because you're more so going there for the atmosphere, and Gristmill definitely wins."

                "description": "This restaurant used to be good. The amount of food you got was huge. They were known for their chicken fried steak. Well not anymore, it was tasteless.  The meat and gravy had no flavor. The green beans were good after you added the seasoned salt that was on the table.  It's a shame that the prices go up, portions go down and the quality goes down. The service was very slow. I found out the waitress was new and overwhelmed. We still gave her about a 30% tip because she was new.  I will say that the queso was good after we added pico to it.  Probably won't go back. So many other places are better for chicken fried steak."

The rooms were all wonderful with the large fireplaces.   Our server was Chloe and see was very efficient and kind. My wife loved her fish but was did not love the round fries as much because she thought they were a little soggy. The crispy one were great. I ordered the chicken fried steak and it was perfect. The sauce on the side was great. The mash potatoes were very tasty but could have been hotter. I love hot food. It is a issue I have with all restaurants.   This is a beautiful building and we will definitely come back and enjoy the river once COVID is over. I bet the outdoor band areas are great in the summer. All in all much more to love about this place than minor little things."

We met around 11AM at Underground Pizza in New Braunfels. You pick from a customized menu for OffRhodes customers with a 2-topping pizza/salad/drink menu and receive your beer tasting glass. The pizza place gets their ingredients at the local farmers market. Definitely recommend the fresh mozzarella + bacon crumbles as toppings. So good!  The tour bus that brings you to each location has plush seating areas with plenty of room. It was cold outside when we went, but I believe when it's not sub arctic the bus is AC'd.   We stopped at three breweries: The Faust Brewing Company, Guadalupe Brewing, and New Braunfels Brewing Company. Got to see first hand the production process. We loved trying unique small batch beers you can't purchase in stores. Apparently I've been drinking beers that taste like skunk water so this was nice. Lol  We can't wait to do another group tour in the next few months!"

                "description": "I took the tour last weekend with a bunch of friends. We started off at Underground Pizza in New Braunfels. Really good food! Then we went to New Braunfels Brewing Company. Kelly was really informative, and the beer was really good. Very friendly place. Next we hit Middleton Brewery. Loved the atmosphere and they had a real big selection of good beers. Last we went to Guadalupe Brewery. They had a different brewing system that was interesting to see. All the people at the breweries were friendly and informative. Our tour guide took good care of us and was very informative about each stop. We had just the right enough time at each stop to reasonably sample what we wanted. We ended our tour playing a giant game of Jenga, and relaxing, at a pub called Patek's in downtown New Braunfels before going back to our cars. It was a personalized, full day of enjoyment. The bus holds 14 people so it's a cozy group. I thought it was a great price for what was provided. I was told they have more than 1 tour. I'm going to go again after a few months with more friends. It was really relaxing and fun. Dress comfortably and enjoy."

My husband and I try to incorporate as many brewery tours into our trips and vacations as possible (yes, we love beer...like, a lot), and our day with OffRhodes certainly did not disappoint. A delicious artisan pizza lunch, shuttle service to three very personal (and personable!) hands-on brewery tours, plenty of tastings (yay, BEER!), and a professional, fun, and knowledgeable guide. Next time you are in New Braunfels, give these people your money! You will not be disappointed. Thank you, Chris, for providing a genuinely perfect beer lover's day."

                "description": "PURE wine, y'all! I've never had anything like it! It smells better, tastes better and you don't get drunk as fast! I never thought I'd call a wine \"beautiful\". Be warned, the website does not have pricing, and the bottles (no by-the-glass business) starts at $68ish. They do have 4 pre-selected wines you can taste for $20pp unless you buy 3+ bottles of wine, then the tasting is waived.  We were thinking \"uh-oh\" based on the prices when we arrived but holy dang! Nothing like we've tasted before! Totally brag-worthy! The owner greets you and gives you all the info- his place he built from items from the land, his story (if you want to read it..regarding France) and just his history on wine. A super cool place, super relaxing and QUIET and just amazing! Go inside to look at all his cool collectibles from around the world. He's even teamed up with Jester King! Ask him!  You don't want to miss this place! It's truly delightful, but bring your deep pockets, and they DO take card!  *no kids or pets allowed"

                "description": "What an amazing, hidden gem near Canyon Lake! First, all the wines are made by natural fermentation (aka natural wine) with organic grapes- this winery is even featured in a Natural Wines book. The owner is so friendly and also has the sweetest dog. The decor is unique, interesting, and definitely sets a mood. The wine is delicious- we had a bottle of the \"on-site-only\" Lambrusco Pet-Nat, and we bought a couple others to-go. All the local websites were advertising Dry Comal Creek as the only local winery (and I'm sure it's great), but we stumbled upon La Cruz de Comal because Dry Comal closed at 5 and La Cruz was still open until 6pm. We will DEFINITELY be back for more organic, natural wine!"

So mad when our family members open the paper wrap. The corks on both bottle are soaking wet and cracked. The wines tasted nasty. 1 bottle (supposed to be sweet) taste like nasty medicine. The other one is red wine,  taste like someone opened it for a long time and then put the cork back, we didn't want to drink it anymore even it cost us money. Because it was so nasty. I can't believe it."

The sommelier was very knowledgeable but not too stuffy. Great stories about the wine. We brought two young kids and didn't feel out of place. No food available, but able to bring your own."

The tasting room looks like a little cottage nestled in the French countryside.   The owner/winemaker, Lewis, is a piece of work. One of the most intelligent and yet one of the most obscure and eclectic people I have ever met. A true pleasure to meet and chat with.   Do yourself a favor. Check out the hours and plan to visit this little piece of heaven. You will be thrilled and so glad you did.   I highly recommend!!"

                "description": "On our hunt to visit a unique winery in the hill country of Texas, we found La Cruz de Comal. When we drove in, right away we noticed the winery's main building and it felt like we were in France. It is an authentic European building, small and cozy and welcoming!  The owner was there to serve his 100% estate grown grapes which boast of no additional acid, sugar or sulfites to his wine. The owner, who is a retired lawyer, Mr. Dickson, calls his wine, \"real wine.\" We tasted four wines and our favorite was the port, it had a smooth and delightful finish. There also is a sweet winery dog who loves to visit with the customers...we had a relaxing time there and would recommend it to anyone who wants to taste \"Real wine.\""

                "description": "I decided to take a trip and visit this place. I researched all the vineyards nearby but this place not only had the highest reviews, it seemed to have a nice scenery. The interior and exterior has french touches to it and you can tell each piece was well thought out.   Now the wine.... my husband and I FELL IN LOVE. At first the prices seemed to be pricey but once you do the wine tasting, you'll know why. The wine is so pure and has so much grace you have to walk out with at least a bottle (we bought three). I like wine but I'll only drink one glass because I get dizzy but when I went hope my husband and I both finished a bottle. The wine here has no sulfites and you can just taste the purity of the grapes.   Pricing: When you buy three wines the tasting fee is waived for one person ($15). The owner gave us a discount so after one wine tasting fee and 3 bottles of wine we paid around $160.   The interior is just lovely here you can just tell each piece in the room was placed there for a reason. The bathroom outside looked very old so I was very hesitant to use it but one you go in it is so cute and was not uncomfortable at all.   So, overall this place was an excellent experience!"

                "description": "The winery is very nice but the wine is terrible. I have had some wonderful wines all over the states and in other countries. It is very obvious the owner should have stuck to being a lawyer. I understand the all natural thing. But it was awful. I tried to like even one of them or even find something interesting about at least one. With all of the time spent in Napa Valley and in France you would have thought the wines would at least be palatable. The only thing I can figure out is most of the reviewers don't drink wine. And if your thinking about going to see for yourself...I'm being nice in my descriptions."

                "description": "I love everything about this place! It's a hidden gem tucked away in the hills just south of Canyon Lake.  Lewis, the owner, is a former big-time defense attorney in Houston who found his calling to be one with the grapes and wine. Listening to him wax poetically about what he's doing differently at his vineyard gives you insight into what you're about to experience. He's also a hoot!   Instead of using commercial yeast, the wines ferment from wild yeast/bacteria on the grapes and whatever bacteria is in the HillCo air. This gives the wines an obvious farmhouse character (mild funk/horsey, slightly sour). He doesn't filter so the wines are a bit hazy and have some sediment/yeast on the bottom.   Grapes are either grown on-site or purchased from farms in the Hill Country and they don't add sulfites.  If you like traditional wines, you might not enjoy the wines that much but I still think it's worth a visit.  Tasting: $15 for 6 samples Bottles: Range from $25-$60 Times: Tasting room is open on Sat and Sun from 12p-6pm. What we bought: a bottle of Rose.  The tasting room is an adorable limestone building and the vineyard can be seen from the windows.   If you can't make it to the vineyard, Jester King Brewery just started carrying their wines in its taproom! It's a match made in heaven! Wild yeast for everyone!"

The tasting pours were generous and we enjoyed learning about the differences between their preparation methods versus the larger, more commercial vineyards.  I have to assume it's those differences that led to such pleasant flavors.  I've always been a red guy but found the first white I've enjoyed here.  Another first, I could really discern the various ingredients/flavors in each glass of wine, and the reds didn't have that strong bite to them.  I've been to Napa and Senoma, as well as France and Italy, and I just haven't ever enjoyed the taste of wine as much as I did during our trip to this little winery."

                "description": "We just left and I'm SO confused... I don't know how our experience can be so different from all the other Yelp reviews. We just parked, shared a tasting and left in about 15 minutes because we felt kind of unwelcome and found the wines to be awful. And we wanted desperately to love this place, because it is GORGEOUS. I'd have been very easy to please to be able to spend time in this beautiful place. But the owner was kind of frosty, barely spoke to us (but was more vocal with others), didn't tell us anything (not even the names) about any of the wines. I complimented him effusively on the place when we first got there and tried to get him to chat during the tasting, but he didn't thaw. I don't know if we made him mad because we chose to share a tasting?? We would've gotten a glass or two once we found a wine we liked. We felt like we weren't wanted, which when you're sitting at the little wine counter right in front of the guy, is really uncomfortable. I could've ignored all that if one of the wines worked for us, but I hate to say it, we thought all 4 were terrible. We drink a lot of wine, not cheap or sweet ones, and none of these tasted like anything we've ever had before. I'm confused that every other reviewer LOVED them and we had such an opposite reaction. We are at a loss for the experience we just had. The winery is so so beautiful though, it rivals CA wineries. So bummed. :("

For our third try, we went on February 26th for a 9 pm dinner.   We order the following:  Share: shrimp campechana Salad: traditional Greek salad  Savor mako's bacon cheeseburger and creole fried chicken.  Signature cocktails: cucumber mako-Rita and whiskey sour.   All I can say is everything was amazingly delicious. The server was terrific. She had great recommendations and knew the menu well. She made sure things got filled in a timely matter. I still can't stop thinking about the food! They also have delicious fermented red jalapeños made in-house. OMGosh! I'm obsessed! I can not wait to go again."

Seafood Paella was a bowl of grease soaked rice with a few bites of seafood and some shrimp.  Pork shoulder had some weird sour flavor to it.  Tried to save it with a chocolate cheesecake at the end but nope. It was a chocolate brownie, nowhere close to tasting like a cheesecake, it was dense and dry, also had some strange flavor that we were trying to guess but couldn't figure out what it was."

                "description": "So this is my first time here, to make a reservation online was easy but I did pick a time that I knew wasn't going to be busy to have a great experience. The food was amazing however the menu is very limited but during Covid I have seen that restaurant menu have become limited. I enjoyed the wedge salad added shrimp, I know salad uhh but nope it was amazing they had croutons that were bacon omg it was yummy. The started was a shrimp campechana with some tostada, the size is a little small but it was great because I got to finish my whole entree. The only complaint I would say was our waitress, at first I did give her a benefit of the doubt, but as she countined to get tables it just felt that she ignored me more and more. The reason I put three star was because the food was amazing, the servers who were not our server were helpful wish I could have tip them instead. She just seem to avoid the table, said she would be back and just took a while. At the end she did completely forget about us which left me upset, I did wait a few days because I wanted to clear my head before writing a review. The food was so amazing that I might be back but might do take out next time which is sad because it's a nice environment to enjoy a meal I just don't want to experience that kind of service again. Placed the new menu on here because it does seem like the stuff on yelp are older. The waitress did stated that everything on yelp was old so here something to help. Wishing the restaurant the best, maybe it was just bad timing for me, we'll see on my next visit"

                "description": "First off, the place is a very relaxed atmosphere. The hostess/waitress was super nice.  The place looked clean inside and the outside patio too. Don't expect to see or hear the creek though it's kind of a ways away. We went during brunch hours and we had the place to ourselves considering it was already 2pm. Brunch ends at 3 and dinner starts at 4pm. I had the oyster mushroom omelet and the lentil soup. I wish they served bread for the table. It would go great with my lentil soup. The soup was perfect! The roasted potatoes could've been a little less roasted. My omelet was a little bit over fried. I'm not sure if that's the way they always do it. The waitress mentioned a happy hour from 3-6pm during the week with some $5 drink specials. I would return to try their  dinner menu."

                "description": "I chose to dine alone this evening. I used the Yelp app to help me decide, and Mako's ended up being the perfect location. I made a reservation; it wasn't needed, but I wanted to be on the safe side. I was seated quickly at a high top near the bar where I could still enjoy the peace of dining alone, with the background noise of quiet conversation from others and ESPN playing above the bar.   I'd made it just in time for the Happy Hour specials and decided on a $5 old fashioned and the $5 Gouda ranch wedge ($1 with grilled shrimp1). I added the butternut squash bisque after placing my initial order, and it was the right choice. The funny thing is I can't quite describe what made it tasty, but I cleaned the bowl! The salad was pure perfection...seriously...you canNOT go wrong. I'm not sure if it was the tangy pickled onion, the smoky lardon bacon,  or the perfectly grilled shrimp that made the salad so scrumptious, but I'm already planning my next visit for that one item alone.   Since I wasn't stuffed from my satisfying meal, I decided to indulge in dessert. I chose the poached pear with the Portofino wine reduction and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It was delicious, but SUPER sweet. So, if you're not into that, pass on this dessert. Even though it's a small dessert, it's perfect to share because it's probably too rich for one person (except me!).   This will not be my last time enjoying happy hour here; I've already text a friend to suggest this as a new monthly get together spot! Next time I'll sit outside!   Side Note: I definitely recommend the \"Smoked\" old fashioned made with star of anise, juniper berry, and mesquite chips. Ask to see a demonstration to add to the overall experience. It was a pure delight. It somehow took a simple $5 cocktail to the next level."

The food is exceptional and the chef is talented. We loved the bartender and our servers. Highlights were the burger, salmon tartare and the delicious market salad. Thanks for having us!"

                "description": "We found this new trendy spot in Cibolo, Texas. The host was very accommodating when we arrived, if you wanted to wear a mask then they wore mask and if you were comfortable and not wearing a mask then they would not wear a mask.  He sat us all down as we were still waiting for three people from our party. Once our full party had arrived, we had to wait. Unfortunately the waitress took over 10 minutes to come to our table to at least offer some water.  Overall our experience was very great! Unfortunately I did not take a lot of pictures because it was my sisters birthday. But I did manage to sneak in a picture of my cheeseburger which was very light. And I don't mean light in a bad way I mean it as in a satisfying way. Must try!   Their cocktails are also very delicious. I had the cucumber margarita cocktail if I'm not mistaken, and it was very light and subtle at the same time. But boozy!   The only part that I was not super happy with was that the waitress mentioned to us that she had ordered a special surprise for my sister which was their almond cake. As a gift from her. So to me that means that the dessert is on them. But surprisingly when I received the ticket the almond cake was on there. I did not feel like I really wanted to argue over the almond cake but as I stated the way she mentioned it to me is that she was covering the cake. So for that reason I did remove one star.  Something that I really liked about this place was the bathroom. As a first time Mama i've noticed that many restaurants don't have a baby changing table. Or if they have a baby changing table it's very dirty. This place had a very awesome baby changing station. They had diapers, they had wipes, they had waste bags. You think of it and they had it!  Thanks To their management for this!   Great place to eat! Enjoy!"

                "description": "Mako's is a really nice restaurant! The staff was very friendly, the restaurant was nicely decorated and had great ambiance. The food and drinks we ordered were delicious. One of the previous reviews mentioned the Aunt Bees Knees being delicious so I decided to try it and it was really good. My wife got the salmon and I ordered the Pork Shoulder. The salmon was delicious (probably not worth $30 but it did taste very good) and the pork shoulder was also very good as well. One thing I will caution in regards to the pork shoulder is that it is very fatty. There was a lot of fat on the sides of the lean pork that added flavor for sure but wasn't very healthy. We also ordered the Brussels sprouts as an appetizer and they were delicious. A lot of good flavor.   We enjoyed our time at Mako especially since the staff was so nice. However, the price was really not worth it. I'm going to give it 5 stars bc there isn't a 4.5 star option and the experience was worth more than a 4 but I don't think I'd be coming back mainly because of the price of the food. It was good though; so if you don't mind paying extra then this is a good spot for date night or to enjoy a nice evening dinner.   Overall: 4.5 stars"

                "description": "If you're looking for fine dining , a place to celebrate something special, or just want fantastic food and feel extra special them look no further than Mako's!  We celebrated our anniversary and wanted to experience a place we hadn't been to.  Walking in we were immediately seated.  Wait staff was jovial and attentive.   Our appetizers were very good and filling (we should have only ordered one but couldn't decide between the two) fried Brussels and Levantine trio. Our entrees were equally difficult to choose but ultimately my husband ordered the 1855 beef coulotte, medium rare.  It was cooked exactly how he wanted with red on the center and juices running in every bite.  You could even taste the hint of coffee spice.  The turnips and carrots were prepared in a Marchand de vin sauce, complimented it nicely.  My entree was the chickpea crusted salmon.  I loved every bite!  It had a slight char on the outside but very moist on the inside.  The tomato and eggplant stew it came with also delicious.   Easily a five star restaurant that I'd recommend and plan on returning to."

The servers were on top of it as we were changing seats, walking around, it was definitely professional.  The booking and reserving was so easy too.  Everyone enjoyed their food, my paella was awesome. I also tried their steak and their fried chicken...I would order it all if I could afford it. There is no competition with flavor and quality of their ingredients.  I thank the restaurant and we all enjoyed our time."

                "description": "I don't usually leave bad reviews, but unfortunately I feel compelled to in this case.  We ordered the butternut squash bisque, scallops, and paella.  Butternut squash bisque was basically flavored oil with some seeds... there was literally a layer of oil on the top when it came out... I still pressed on and gave it a chance though... it tasted ok at best... In general I'm a human vacuum cleaner so I ate the entire thing, but I would not recommend it if you're looking for an actual bisque/soup.  The scallops were tiny and it only came with 3.... The bed of risotto that the scallops were on had a very odd taste... not like an old taste, or like the food was rotten, it was just seasoned horribly. Again I stomached the entire thing, but the portion size was so small that I was done with the entire plate in literally 3-4 bites.... Total rip-off for the $34 price point.   The Paella.... my mom sent it back.. i tried it before she did though and I wouldn't have been able to stomach it. It was absolutely horrible. Terrible flavor, overcooked seafood, odd tasting sausage, and about 1/4 cup of rice... we couldn't even see the rice when the plate first came out because there was so little. Is this shrinkflation or just normal for this place? I have no idea...   I would not normally have even posted this review but.... After we told the server we'd be sending the Paella back, she stopped by the table that the owner was sitting at and let him know... He never came over to talk to us about it.... and when the server came back, she said the kitchen agreed that it was bad LOL. What?   They were nice enough to comp that dish, but again, the owner/manager/whoever never came by to talk to us about it, apologize, ask how everything else was, nothing.... On our way out we walked past the table the owner was sitting at... he said \"sorry about that, have a good one.\" LOL  Never again"

Think hop daddy or a similar restaurant. Once you order at the front, grab your seat and make yourself comfortable. I stopped by on a Saturday early afternoon, and luckily enough it wasn't super busy. If you if anyone was wearing a mask. But since this is Texas I guess COVID doesn't exist.  Onto the food! I ordered off of their brunch menu which was super delicious. The Chilla Quiles were enormous l!!    I sat down at the bar, which was OK and really where my four-star review comes from. The bartender was nice enough, but really didn't seem interested in actually serving people. She's definitely one of those bartenders that wants to give you your drink and then get you out of her face. It wasn't super clear to me how to check out so I asked another random person that came by and they were kind enough to explain the process to me. Being from out of town, folks in Texas sure aren't as nice as we say we are. And I say this as someone born and raised in Texas."

                "description": "We happened to be in the area and stumbled across Industry as a brunch option. First, today is pretty cold outside and their wall windows (?) are wide open. I get it, it's their design. We were considering finding another spot, but decided to stay and try it out. I ordered the chilaquiles w/ chicken, hubs got the chicken sando, and we had a side of the green chile queso. The food came out at a decent pace. The queso was barley luke warm. Why? It tasted okay, flavors are nothing special, but I was expecting it to be warmer than what it was. When our order came out, my chilaquiles were also luke warm, if not almost cold. Is the cold air chilling the food quicker than normal? Probably not. The side of beans and rice I had was piping hot and I ate that towards the end of my meal. The chilaquiles were made w/ the chips that they serve with their chips and dip; not a fan of that. The hub's sando was good. Overall, 3 stars cuz the flavors weren't that bad: I was willing to overlook the cold dining room, but not the almost cold food."

                "description": "TLDR a-ok to I'm a fan despite some bumps  My first time ordering for pickup. Everything was delicious, it was ready at the time promised. The big flaw was I didn't get the beer battered squash I ordered and paid for, but as Mr R didn't check the bag before leaving we cannot lay that all on them. It was a very busy night and mistakes happen.  The other error was I didn't get the 30% off to-go booze still advertised on their online menu which is why this isn't 5*  Mr R is besotted with their black bean veggie burger. I think there must be spice in the patty as none of the other listed ingredients explain its lovely low heat. He also likes the texture of the bean patty, he wanted me to mention that.  The salmon burger was good, huge, nice fresh veg, I love the spice in the aioli and poblano ranch, but I REALLY wish they still did the smoked salmon bagel I had one brunch there long ago.  The farm beet salad? Gorgeous. Mr R gleefully ate most of it on his own and he often eats salads with a sense of duty rather than joy. I loved the white balsamic vinaigrette it came with, I'm going to need that more often in my life.  The drinks to go? Hooray! One note, bring your own standard brown pulp drink tray if you think you'll need one because they didn't provide one. The pours were fabulous on our mimosas, The Closer and White Box. Ice was the perfect amount.  The transaction could have gone smoother, but the meal went down great. This remains a place Mr R wants to go *every* time he's in town."

                "description": "We ordered from UberEats and after having them call to say they were out of the Salmon Burger and Catfish with Chips we opted out for the Chicken Friend Chicken and Fried Chicken Burger. The order was delayed by 35 minutes which is understandable since they had to switch out our meals. But once we got our meals we realized the sides that come with the entres were missing completely as well.  Starving my friend dug into his Chicken Fried Chicken and I took a few bites of the sandwich. He was basically done with it when he cut into the last bits and realized that the food was indeed cold and fleshy. I stopped to look at mine and I was baffled by the underlying pink on the bottom of the chicken patty. He immediately regurgitate it back up and I stopped and threw the rest of my sandwich away.    We spent over 70 dollars on a meal that had to be thrown away. The only things we did eat were our Brussels sprouts and cheese fries.   Will not be eating here again."

I gave them an over all three stars only because they lost one star on my dish, I ordered biscuits and gravy super dry not enough gravy for the portion of the biscuit. Then they lost the second star because half way through my meal, my mimosa never arrived! I was parched and when I asked the waitress she said \" I lost your ticket, I will put in your  order\" I don't understand how that even works when you order at the front of the restaurant.  The food could be warmer came out cold. The presentation of the food was great, customer service was great, the ordering process smooth."

We had an awesome time with Thor as our bartender last time we were in town. He was there this time and we got to say hi again. We sat at the bar and Raina took great care of us! We tried 2 lagers from different TX breweries and had some great shots. I could not decide among 3 choices for dinner, so I let her pick and surprise me. She chose the al pastor tacos. They were delicious! We are only staying in San Marcos 4 days and are already planning to go back for dinner on Monday! Ps if you are a whiskey drinker, try this! It was so smooth!"

The $11  mimosa carafe special immediately got my attention. I knew I had to have that. Found us a booth on the left corner by the bar. Ordered the mimosa, 2 industry burgers, Parmesan fries and the tater tot casserole. The mimosa was disappointingly room temperature. The burgers were bordering on salty but were good. We especially liked the chips and salsa that came with it. The fries were good but a little expensive for what you get. The tater tot casserole , we didn't like at all. Very salty and the hot sauce did not go with the dish at all. Don't think we'll come back."

We also had the chicken tacos and the person who had those raves about how good they were! We also had the queso, salsa, fried squash, loaded fries and Brussel sprouts for appetizer and all were a huge hit!! Most of the teenagers had the burgers and did not like them. They said they tasted like sausage. I think the issue is the burgers were very, very lean and smoked so they were a little dry.  The BIGGEST COMPLAINT were the flies...OMG!!! So freaking annoying to have to constantly be waving your hand back and forth so a darn fly does not land on your food!! Do something about that bc we would never come back solely for that purpose!"

For a place as small and intimate as it is, there's a lot of seating packed in it and even some outdoor seating. There's games, lots of games.

With that being said, I've been to growler places in the greater Austin area and IMHO, I think The Growling is better than most of them.  As previously mentioned, there are 28 beers on tap, all Texas-made stuff, but unlike other growler places I've been to they have a bar and you can drink a pint, invite friends, and just hang out. The owners are super friendly and work hard to set you up with the perfect craft beer experience! They even have a stage setup for live music and get live acts mostly on the weekend.  Also, as previously mentioned, there is no kitchen but they allow outside food and with Pie Society, Bobcat nation, Dos Gatos, Mocas/Javas, Rose Garden (Chinese), and Thai Thai in close proximity; you won't have to go far to fight off those hunger cravings! They haven't been open very long (less than 2 months) so they're off to a slow start but hopefully as word gets out they'll start getting busier and maybe even expand on what's an already great start! If you're in San Marcos for the River, the Square, the Hill Country, or in school looking to skip class, The Growling is every bit worth checking out!"

Whiskey Business has a diverse, quality, well-priced inventory. They had everything I needed. Even took home a six of Boerne Brewery's Old Courthouse Ale at the owner's suggestion. It's like he knew what I'd like. He did. One of my favorites is an Irish dry stout {think Guinness}, and I've now found a new favorite. Love it! I'll make Whiskey Business my go-to.

                "description": "When you hear the word BUS one would normally think about a city bus or there like. This is not the case for the Crafty Thirst Beer Bus, no it's a VW van that is being used to serve beer. We were passing by and noticed a sign that said Grand Opening. We stopped to check out this Grand Opening. We were approached by this creepy guy smoking a cigarette as he said do you have ID, we showed our drivers licenses and instead of saying thank you, have a nice day anything he just stared at us. We were reading the list of beers that were offered. It was a little confusing as there was no direction on what the beers were are how much they were. We decided to order at the VW \"BUS\". We were asking what different types of beers were available and how much they were. The guy that was helping us (later found out was the one of the owners) passed us to someone else. We thought that was rude but the lady that served us made up for it. The beers were $7.00 dollars for a 9 ounce or you could get 4 -  7 ounces for $10.00 dollars to me that is extremely high. Most of the places in Canyon Lake have beers for $2.50. The beer we had, had more of a foam head on it and we were not offered to top it off. Another guy was serving mixed drinks one with Pecan Rum. The mixed drinks were $7.00 dollars, high for the area and the amount you get. I will confess that the rum was one of the best I have had. A few times I heard other people saying that the price's were too high. If you can get a beer for $2.50 then why would someone pay $7.00 dollars. The band was the only entertainment and they were amazing. There was suppose to be a raffle for the VW BUS but when I asked about it I was told that it was not going to take place. This was troubling being that I was told by the owner that it was the main giveaway."

It was medium busy, most of the indoor tables were filled up and the bar had a few other people. We sat at bar seating and were helped right away. Being so close to the university, it's a college vibe.   I ordered a chai hot chocolate, it was amazing. Something about hot chocolate on a rainy day.....  We ordered loaded samosas (Vegetable samosas topped with chana masala, curry queso, cilantro walnut chutney and cucumber mint raita) and a sampler trio. We got spicy powder on the side.   Great flavors. We left full and happy. If we lived in the area this would be a regular spot for happy hour."

The two servers walk by my table and didn't make eye contact, as though they had never seen someone with so much melanin before. They continued to serve other seated and even folks coming in for the first time. It was embarrassing. It's 2022 and the last thing I want to assume is that it was because of race. Frustrated, I walked to the bar and asked for a manager. The bartender (Josh) informed me it was the dark hair gal and that is when I was acknowledged. Josh was very nice and served me and took my order.  Josh saved the day, but they need to work on their customer service.   I had their taco and the fries were absolutely delicious! The food blunted my frustration. I will come back because I believe in 2nd chances...and of course the food."

                "description": "We really wanted to like this place.  It has a great casual ambiance and we loved the place when we walked in.    We went on a Sunday, and it wasn't too busy.  There wasa couple with a great dane there, so it's dog friendly.  My bride ordered the samosas, and I ordered the curry trio with saag paneer, butter chicken, and chicken tikka masala.  We got north street fries as a appetizer.  So, the samosas came out nice and warm.  My wife thought the bread was overcooked, but she was hungry.  Perhaps it was old oil on a Sunday evening after a busy weekend.  The fries were warm-ish and a bit soggy.  The seasoning was very good, though, and the basket of fries was a good size for two.  The curry trio was disappointing.  The saffron rice was hard and warm-ish.  I don't know how else to describe it.  The Saag paneer was kind of tasteless.  I've eaten great saag paneer, and this ain't it.  The Chicken tikka masala was similarly underspiced.  The butter chicken as well, but I expect that from butter chicken.  I had ordered it as a counterpoint to what I had hoped would be some spicy dishes.  At this point, I'm wondering if it's us.  I've worked with Indian nationals that have taken me to some hole in the wall Indian places in Irvine, CA, and they absolutely knocked my socks off.  We go to many places in Texas that have a good yelp rating, and we get a lot of bland food.  We really like to patronize smaller places, and I hate to give poor ratings, but have to be honest.  We really liked the people and the place, so will give them a try again in the hopes the stars align for a better experience."

                "description": "I came here to meet a friend for drinks and a light lunch -- we both got appetizers since we were planning heavier dinners later that night -- and when it comes to the food and drinks, I was not disappointed.   I got the vegetable samosas, and the samosas were nearly perfect, with the potato and pea filling having just the right level of seasoning. They came with beautiful mango chutney whose chunks were visible and a lovely green chutney. Both were so delicious I was hard put to decide which I wanted to put on each of the three samosas.  For drinks I had two of the Wasatch Polygamy (a nitro porter), and it was fantastic. It had a hint of sweetness, but wasn't as overwhelming as a milk stout, but also the delicious flavor of a porter.  The patio dining was great, with plenty of shade.  The only reason I'm not giving five stars is that service was... slow, with respect to both drinks and food. Otherwise, the whole thing was outstanding."

The establishment is adorable - informal seating inside and out.   I first got some pappadum and a few chutneys-tamarind and mint. They were spicy! Caught me off guard but delicious for sure.    My mom ordered the Curry Trio with chicken curry, paneer tikka masala, and saag paneer. I ordered  a beef kabob curry taco. Every bite of every dish was delicious. While I loved my taco, I highly recommend the Curry Trio because you get a great choice.   When we first got there, I was like meh. Only a few tables were seated outside and the inside was empty. But right after we ordered, the place quickly filled up! Wow.   The service was superb. I couldn't have asked for a better server. I'll definitely be back!"

                "description": "The food here is amazing and the staff is very friendly! The idea of putting a Tex-Mex twist on Indian food is brilliant.  I was very pleased with the variety on the menu and how tasty everything was. My children loved the curry queso, saag paneer, and the paratha.  My husband and I enjoyed our paneer tikka masala tacos (I had chicken).  The Mango lassi was different as it is icy and minty, but we really enjoyed it, and so did my children.  I can't wait to go back! One thing that was also really surprising is that the coffee was super good! Please remember this is a fusion restaurant, so it is not your typical Indian. I noticed a lot of lesser star reviews complained about it not being Indian food. Yet, it is Indian Tacos. It is a fun twist and something different. I highly recommend."

                "description": "Visiting San Marcos and North street popped up on my Yelp top restaurants.  Restaurant is in a renovated older house with super cute outdoor patio seating. We sat inside it's smaller but very cozy. They have a bar with many draft beers, wine and specialty drinks.  We started with the vegetable samosas and it came with side of mint sauce and mango chutney that was so tasty. Both complimented the samosas in a wonderful way. The flavors were amazing.  I ordered the tiki masala taco that was filled with so much flavor and very filling.       A must try!! And hubby had the trio which he choose tiki masala, curry chicken and butter chicken along with coconut rice. All three were fantastic.  Service was good and food was fantastic and very reasonably priced.  I'm excited to come back and try something new on the menu and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND North Street!! #supportsmallbusiness"

                "description": "Ok. Here comes another Indian restaurant review. But wait! Its TexMex Indian!  Went to lunch with coworkers on the first day of fall, so we got a table outdoors, never stepped foot inside. Service was slow, but it seemed it was only one waiter, so no points taken away for that.  Server was detailed in explaining what everything was and the level of spice and comfort. We had one vegan and one spice sensitive guest in our group, so he pointed out what would be best for the group to order. I ordered chicken nachos, and paneer tacos, wanting spice and meat. Other guests ordered samosas with mango chutney, vegan nachos, and spinach paneer. It was filling enough with a beautiful presentation! The jalapeno cream mixed with tamarind on the tacos mixed perfectly with the Indian spices.  The curry on the shredded chicken and tortilla chips (couldn't tell if they were made in house or store bought) had me trying not to lock the bowl. Will definitely go back to try more items on the menu!"

                "description": "I'm not sure if the \"authenticity\" of the food at North Street, but what I can say is WOW it's delicious, regardless.   The building is absolutely adorable and beautifully decorated. Bathrooms are always spotless and the women's bathroom kindly offers hair ties, feminine products and occasionally mints. (It's the little things!!)  They only offer beer or wine cocktails but even the wine cocktails feel and taste pretty craft cocktail-y. The ginger lime spritz is my fave!  Being a self proclaimed queso connoisseur, I was hesitant on curry queso. Why fix what ain't broke? I was wrongly hesitant, North streets curry queso is liquid gold and oh so delicious.   I don't think there's a single bad thing on their menu.  The Katz brothers truly do no wrong"

                "description": "Hilariously good Tex/Indian fusion. The chicken Tika and curry tacos are out of this world. The queso is ok. But seriously, if you're not already in San Marcos, come here. And eat this. It's that good. If you think you're a foodie and haven't tried this, fix that. So incredibly good. And for $9 per taco that's basically a meal and a party in your mouth, it doesn't exactly set you back much. They have a great beer selection too and cool ambiance and attentive service. But the tacos are the draw. Come here. Eat the Indian style tacos. 5 stars."

                "description": "Unique spot with a mix of great options of drafts and curries!  We enjoy having different types of beers and this place has a good unique assortment of drafts to try.  I was able to get some lavender cider since it was pretty early in the day, but the porter and stout options were very tempting (some at over 12% alcohol).  The dogs were with us so we settled outside in their spacious yard that has a lot of shade and a fan blowing.  We ordered curry fries as an appetizer and they were wedged exactly like chic fil a fries seasoned in a curry mix powder.  These were good, but can do with a pinch of sugar and lots of extra spice.  I had the chicken Tikka masala plate and my husband got the chicken 65 taco.  The taco looked more like a wrap and wasn't as filling as what he expected, but tasted pretty good.  Fried chicken seasoned in sauce inside the taco had a good kick to it.  My chicken Tikka masala plate was delicious, but a little extra spice would help.  Also, I think the restaurant can do better by adding naan! Great concept to check out!"

They seemed to have attitudes of a bar that is not in a college town but a boujee downtown bar. The bartender who was close to my age charged me for regular priced drinks when we ordered 2/3 of our drinks in the happy hour range. When I came to close out and order our (3rd) last drink. The bartender said \"do you mind if I close you out?\" I thought this was very odd as it was a Wednesday evening and I was purchasing not only alcohol but food. I do believe they have an amazing food truck that supplies great food. I am sure this was a one time fluke as the rest of the experience was great. I do stand by my opinion that the staff maybe biased to certain crowds so be weary."

Friendly staff, good environment, easily my favorite bar in the area. Also, the neon sign in the women's bathroom is great, I hear the men's bathroom neon sign is pretty funny too. You must visit this place!"

It was a great performance, the beer was cold, the audience and ambience was terrific, Ive heard a great deal about the Phoenix chili and how its made with sirloin, and have been eager to try it, but the kitchen has such erratic hours, that i cant seem to find out when it's available, even if i call ahead. Definitely an oppty for improved consistency."

The burger was dry, but that may have been due to the lean meat. The tomatoes and potatoes wedges were absolutely delicious. Have to add that we sat outside on the patio on a sunny day. The table was filthy and sticky. The staff should check outside ones in a while, or leave cleaning wipes for the guests."

                "description": "A must visit bar and restaurant in downtown New Braunfels. The Phoenix Saloon has a rich history being registered as a Texas Landmark as well as being on a tour of haunted places! They've kept up that 1800's saloon feel, very cool!  That aside, their menu is delicious. Top shelf \"bar food\". But the must have is their homemade chili and cornbread. It's to freaking die for! But be warned, it comes in three levels of heat. The hottest would tear up the toughest of Texas cowpokes! They also have a full bar with a multitude of craft and domestic beers on draught.  The Phoenix is also well known for their showcase of local music talent. From a laidback guy strumming a guitar on the small stage during the afternoon, to full on rock and country bands on the big stage at night on the weekend. That said, the ONLY drawback is the music (during the afternoon) can be too loud at times. Still, add the Phoenix Saloon to your list to visit (or comeback for another visit!) you won't be disappointed."

                "description": "I never give any food/drink place five stars regardless of how good they are.  Also, four stars because it's a little dark in there.  Otherwise a great place to go and be seen without getting talked about, unlike at The Faust.  Nice to visit during the day for lunch and a beverage.  Definitely has a nighttime music vibe.  Very loud, be warned, but you can take your drink outside and sit on the patio and people watch.  I'm not a beer drinker, but I'll order a screwdriver.  I go so rarely and am always amazed that the barkeep knows what I drink!  I'll grab a stool and she'll ask if I want \"the usual.\"  Uncanny!  They could add some modern conveniences like purse hooks by the bar stools, but it's no big deal for me.  It actually keeps me from forgetting my purse if it perches on the bar counter.  I love this place so much that I have the urge to go tomorrow!"

                "description": "The Phoenix Saloon is conveniently located just off the main square on the corner of  San Antonio and Casteel with huge windows to look out to the street. I've been here several times over the years since they have opened. It's always a stop on the pub crawls!   What's not to love...  Long bar along the way for all those bar flies to hold up Lots of seating which is also great for groups Huge band stand for those night with live music Food!... how about that history of chili???  The history according to their website: \"Since 1871, our building has been home to various bars and saloons, most famously the original Phoenix Saloon. It was here in 1894 that William Gebhardt, proprietor of the back room cafe, invented chili powder! Prior to this, chilis had only ever been used fresh, but Gebhardt devised a process for crushing and drying them. Gebhardt brand chili products are still widely available today. The original Phoenix Saloon was reputedly the first bar in Texas to offer service to women. No lady who valued her reputation would dare be seen in a saloon, so the proprietor set up a ladies beer garden with bells in the trees for service. There was a deer pen too, and an alligator pit and badger fights. There was even a parrot on a perch just inside the front door that was taught to say, \"Have you paid your bill!?\" in German! Prohibition put an end to the good times at the Phoenix, which closed its doors on June 26, 1918. The Ludwig Building, as it was then known, was expanded and turned into a department store in 1922. In 1935, by now renamed the Schmidt Building, it was remodeled again. The building was home to a number of retail and service businesses until the Phoenix rose from the ashes, so to speak, on March 5, 2010. Like its mythical namesake, the Phoenix Saloon has been reborn! The new owners relish the building's flavorful past. In bringing the new incarnation to life, they've exposed the original 1871 brick wall, salvaged the old Phoenix Saloon beadboard paneling and re-used various old shutters, sinks and lights. Trying to celebrate all aspects of the building, they also constructed the 40-foot-long bar from the old department store cabinetry, flipped a mirror from the old shoe department upside down behind the bar and relocated a three-way dressing room mirror in the ladies restroom.\"  The Phoenix is also to be reported as being haunted... with such history, this shouldn't be a surprise.... Boo!   So go grab a local beer and some Texas Red with Fritos and a burger on the side... it's time to have a good 'ol time in downtown NB!"

                "description": "Came for the chili and history.  They have 4 heat level chilis. They all start from the same base chili and then peppers are added ranging from jalepenos to ghost chilis. I stopped at habanero. Not blazing but good heat.  The toppings are pricy at $0.75 each for small amounts of onion, cheese, sour cream, etc. it adds up quickly.  The chili flavor is tasty. Large chunks or as they say hunks of browned sirloin (seemed like chuck) are widely dispersed in a thickened chili sauce. I prefer 80% meat with just enough reduced chili stock, theirs is more like 50:50.  Moved on to the blue burger. Menu says stuffed with blue cheese but it is actually mixed in the meat. It was well prepared and tasty.  The atmosphere is super chill and the Night Owls were on stage tonight, I'm impressed! Service is mostly order at the bar.  I'm pretty much a chili snob, I only like my own creation but theirs is pretty good if someone else is making it for you."

When we arrived the blonde bartender was assisting another customer for a hot 5 minutes. When she came over to us we asked to order food and she said the kitchen closed ONE MINUTE BEFORE. But ma'am, we have been standing here for a while... If someone took our order when we arrived, we wouldn't've been in this pickle. The place was not busy (2-3 3 tops max). I understand the kitchen is closed but I'm sure, positive even, that they don't throw out the chili as soon as the second hand hits 12. You could've asked the kitchen to scoop one bowl of chili out in exchange for money, and I bet $100 they would've done it. Why? Because I ask my kitchen guys all the time.   We will not be coming back and my boyfriend would like to speak to management/owners. Thanks."

                "description": "This place was so cute. Stumbled upon it as we were looking for a spot in San Marcos and went on a Tuesday night and dang, this place is poppin on a Tuesday!  All the outdoor spots were taken, so we made our way to the upstairs outdoor balcony, until we were able to snag a table downstairs (which is where you want to be). We quickly found out it was BINGO night. Yes, bingo night! No, it wasn't a bunch of boomers either! I wish I had gotten her name, but the girl hosting Bingo was incredible - great personality with lots of jokes and she def knew how to work a crowd!  Cons - sadly there are some. The sangria flight is awfully sweet. The pizzas are good but took soooo long to get. The food menu is very small so you better not come starving or with a picky eater.  However, if we're ever in the San Marcos area again, we will definitely be back to just enjoy a night on their outdoor patio!"

Also the cider flight is $10!  The pizzas are pretty good! I got the white blanc both times and added pepperoni and jalapeños to one and just jalapeños to the other!  Again, i place to stop by after floating the river( normal times) or shopping at the outlets!"

We were a bit more casually dressed as I would've liked, but it's okay because it was our first visit.   The vibes here are amazing. Everything looks nice and sophisticated. We both had drinks, a couple of martinis and something else that I can't quite remember.   The Brie was something new to my boyfriend, and we really enjoyed it. My Margherita pizza was perfect and my boyfriend Chicken Blanc pizza was also sooo good. I think his was better than mine, lol!   I recommend this place to everyone I run into. It's so cute and the perfect date night"

This is the only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars Bec we expected more selection. They have a few cheese plate options and small gourmet pizzas. I chose the pear and bacon pizza, which was delicious. my husband had a pepperoni pizza. I also ordered a sangria flight, which was quite nice. On Thursday nights they offer a free lava cake with the purchase of a flight. The lava cake was tasty. The servers were friendly and the decorations were nice."

                "description": "I stopped here with a friend on our drive from Austin to San Antonio and will definitely be making the trip back to San Marcos to visit again! I ordered the white sangria, which fair warning was very sweet but it was still delicious. The menu said the white sangria had ginger in it, although I didn't taste that specific ingredient I was hoping for, it was still a good choice. They do wine flights as well, and have a pretty good happy hour.  We ordered a cheese board and sat at the bar. The cheese board was generous and filling, the service was great, and the atmosphere was on point. It is a casual wine bar, and they had live music outside which would have been nice to watch aside from the cold weather. They have a lot of seating outside, and a good amount of community seating inside.  Overall, great experience here and will be hopefully going back!"

You said I was \"punching down for laughs\" when he was greeting me to your establishment.   First of all, he was the one \"punching down\" since he kept making his jokes loud so that all the other employees around could have a laugh. He never greeted me to the establishment. Also, I kept my mouth shut, took his rudeness in stride, manned up, and moved on. Apparently his and your feelings were hurt by my relatively insignificant review and you just had to make a public display.   I neither live in the area nor will return to your business, and in the end, neither of us should really care."

                "description": "We were in town and decided to stop by for lunch and reminisce on the good old days. We came in knowing it was under new management but wanted to still give it a shot. The waitress was very attentive and checked in on us often, and when she gave us the menus we instantly realized NOTHING WAS THE SAME. I had always ordered (and was craving) the jalapeño queso burger but that was now named something else, and based on the description I knew I wouldn't be a fan. We both ordered their 1/4 smash burger with grilled onions and a basket of fries. When we got our order we both looked at each other and knew this was not the Taproom we had during college. The food itself was okay (not great as before) and the amount of grilled onions was significantly less... unless we are in an onion shortage I feel more could've been given. After we finished eating we both agreed this would probably be our last time coming for a while. Just not the same.   Again, the waitress was very attentive, checked in often and food was okay, but it's hard to not compare the past to present."

That being said, we all got burgers so I feel like it could have been faster? The food hit the spot after a day on the river but just to get the waiters attention was hard work as they only had 4 people on duty. Then to pay the check again it was another long wait. I can't recommend this place if you're hungry, but if you have the time, sure you should go. Prices were reasonable."

                "description": "Salty with a side of Micro transactions.   I have had a few items here and I would have to say this is the saltiest food in San Marcos and not in a good way.  Their menu is very over priced and boy do they love their micro-transactions or add-ons.  Fries are extra with their expensive and average burgers. BACON is like $2 extra.  They charge you for using a credit card and so much more.   Their queso is Velveeta and rotel and not even that good. Most of their chips they serve with the queso is tiny broken scraps and they get annoyed if you ask for more.   The staff is either uncaring or over-worked. I have had many incidences where I am eating solo and am ignored in getting service initially and after.  This is most likely because the server is more interested in dealing with the beer drinking frat guys. Almost every time I have been there I have been left without a basic refill of water. Many times i have also sat waiting for my food with no sight of my server.   The only saving grace of this place is the half price wings on Wednesday, but even then I would get them to go."

                "description": "Drove up to San Marcos from SA to meet sister and niece to help move into dorms.  They were running late, so decided to stop here for some drks and grab a quick bite.  Place was not that crowded (in the front) and the tables were spaced out.  View was nice to enjoy those strolling by  the sidewalk.  The sign at the front said $3.50 bloody mary's, so I ordered one and it was the bomb (see pic).  Perfect drink that had all the fixin's.  The Chicken and Waffle Bites caught my attention, so I ordered that to hold us over.  These were really good and worth the appetizer! The reason for 2 stars knocked off were the service that was absent throughout our time here.  He disappeared all the time and couldn't find him once my sister and niece showed up.  This service made me decide to go somewhere else for lunch.  The other star was due to being charged full-price for the 2 bloody mary's.  I didn't say anything, as I wasn't sure when the waiter would come back and also felt small businesses need any extra cash during these times.  I still tipped the waiter, since they need money too but not sure how he was so busy with a light audience in the place."

The fries were also to die for, crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside and perfectly seasoned. Will definitely be back!"

                "description": "They've got a good selection of beers and ciders (for the non-beer drinkers like myself). I come specifically for the pizza burgers. They are my go to burger when I get a burger craving. However, I have heard that all their other specialty burgers are amazing as well.   My one complaint is the service. It's mainly a bar, it's going to be busy- I get it. I've worked the industry. But every time I've gone, something is wrong with my order, I'm double charged on something, or the waitress hardly ever comes to check on us.   I'll keep coming for the amazing burgers- and they deserve the stars, but the service needs some improvement."

                "description": "Look for my previous review y'all.  no resolution was ever made for that experience to ever be forgotten by me or them. They refused to serve me and I refused to stay quiet. I escalated to the owner after his employees all worked together to ensure that customer service is not important to them at all. I spend a lot of money eating out especially to try new things and I support local businesses. But I couldn't try their food because they don't accommodate properly to accept mastercard payment on a to go order (which they now claim they do allow). Hope you all decide to go somewhere else that values you as a customer. Support black owned businesses.  I hope the COVID hits them hard in the pockets."

If you live in the area and work from home, this is a must for Favor. It's often available quickly without a delivery fee.   The fries are very tasty. They have a good selection of on tap beers and the wait staff is friendly.   Prices are fair, you get a good amount of food for what you pay.   Where this place falls short of a Five star (well four star) are the other menu items quality. Wings are good, but the other menu items are nothing to be excited about. They'll do if you're hungry, but not if want flavor beyond bland."

                "description": "After getting over the $67 bill for myself and my three boys, I realized that we did have a good meal. We ordered fried cheese  balls that were delicious. Two of the three boys ordered wings and fries, and cleaned their plates. My youngest ordered chicken tenders from the kid's menu and they were huge; he was only able to eat one before he was satisfied. I had the pecan chicken salad with a blueberry pomegranate vinaigrette. The salad was basic, but a solid choice. The dressing wasn't as flavorful as I'd hoped for, but fortunately the chicken and the candied pecans were good enough to carry the salad. I also ordered a pina colada at the advising of the young waitress; I won't do that again.  Overall, it was a good, and we definitely enjoyed ourselves.  Whether we return or not will depend on the boys suggesting it again for our Friday night outings."

It wasn't packed for a Saturday afternoon but they did seat us back to back with other tables before capacity was supposed to be opened up to 100% so that was a bummer.   Our server sort of left us to it. Didn't relay any info regarding happy hour or food recommendations despite noting it was our first visit. Every time we looked up he was across the restaurant working on something else until a larger party was placed in his area, then his focus swung to them.  Nothing really stood out, food-wise. If you want something crunchy and you're already in the area, maybe swing through, but I won't be going out of my way."

                "description": "We decided to go to Anchor Bar after seeing it on Texas Eats.  We've been there a few times since then, and we absolutely love their wings.  They've got quite a variety of sauces, and we have tried the mango habanero, spicy garlic parmesan, honey siracha, honey bourbon bbq, and the extreme.  They were all really good,  but the spicy garlic parmesan and honey siracha are our absolute favorite.  The spicy garlic parmesan has a light hint of spice to it with a nice garlic parmesan kick.  The honey siracha is sweet with a light kick of spice at the end.  I personally like the honey siracha the best out of both of the sauces.  It's the perfect combination of sweet and spicy.    We also get the mac and cheese balls appetizer, which is fried macaroni and cheese served with a side of ranch and a side of honey siracha sauce.  They pair very well with the wings we get.    If you enjoy wings, I highly recommend Anchor Bar."

They did temperature checks for all guests, tables were very spread out and masks required! Some of the best I have seen at a restaurant the past year.  Some positives: the music playlist was the bomb, really loved that. The boneless wings on my meal were good, and I would return for that! My husband got the Buffalo chicken wrap, which he said we alright, but he would try something else if we went again.  Some not positives: I love Mac and cheese and was not a fan of theres at all, just not my type. I also got the queso and chips, and I think it should've been hotter, because it was already thick (not runny) by the time it was brought to our table (I would give this another chance if I knew the cheese would be dippable, because the flavor was good, just hard to eat)  Overall, we might go back and give it one more chance!"

                "description": "Great new brewery that just opened up in the Universal City area. The food is phenomenal and the beer is exceptional. Has incredible staff and a nice outdoor area that includes a kids area and is dog friendly on the patio.  Service dogs are welcome inside.   From burgers to chicken sandwiches, Korean brisket tacos, crispy Brussels, all their homemade dipping sauces and the best fries I've ever had, you can not miss this place."

                "description": "I really enjoyed this place! It is just what Universal City, and the east side, needed. It has your typical brewery vibe with indoor seating and outdoor seating, and although the weather now may be a bit chilly, once the spring and summer weather comes around, I can see the place popping off. There is a cute Instagram worthy decor wall that says \"Beer Is Better Together\" so bring your cute outfits.   The beer selection on tap is vast and has something for everyone. My gf got the mango milkshake IPA, and it was a hit for her. I also heard talk that even if you don't prefer IPA, you'll enjoy it, so give it a try. I'm a dark beer guy and I tried pretty much every Belgian on the list along with the coffee Porter, my personal favorite. I bought a growler with the Porter to take home and I plan on using that growler many many more times in the future. My least favorite was the quad Belgian, but to each their own. It still wasn't terrible.   The food was great quality! Brewery and bar food always hit good to me, but this place really did it well. The Korean fusion theme was great. At the time, there was a special menu ramen item that my gf ordered but it was too spicy for her, so avoid if you're sensitive. I scarfed it down, however. I personally ordered the Boar Burger, and would recommend that to anyone coming in with a burger craving. Their fries are made in house. Also, try the Brussels sprout appetizer.   I'm very excited to see where this place goes. I'm hoping for seasonal brews and more menu specials down the line, but I know they're trying to just establish themselves and that's perfectly fine. I'm rooting for this place! Keep it up."

The beer options are well curated, and I personally enjoyed the single IPA (abv 7.1). Citrus forward, with hints of floral, a classic. The soft pretzel and brussel sprouts are amazing. Looking forward to going back!"

I love the different options that they have with drinks. I even saw a seltzer! I loved all the food that I got. This is the perfect spot for this area since there isn't many breweries on this side of town."

                "description": "Gather Brewing Co. is going on my list of go-to places to eat and drink in the Schertz-Cibolo-Universal City area. I've seen the sign from Highway 78 for a while, but I heard they were open and wanted to check it out. We enjoyed a delicious meal on the patio. The restaurant was busy and we're still not exactly sure how ordering, pickup, beverages, etc. are supposed to work, but the staff are helpful and friendly, and everything worked out.   \"The Big DIPA\" is an IPA that comes in a lovely branded tulip glass with a long stem. The beer has an amber color and rich taste, but is also clean and refreshing. It tastes like it comes from a scrupulous brewery.  We enjoyed a variety of delicious sandwiches. The kimchi and glaze added just the right zing to the Korean chicken sandwich. The crispy chicken sandwich is classic and satisfying. The smashburger is loaded with beef and nicely garnished. We enjoyed the brioche buns and crispy/toothsome chips/fries.  Gather Brewing Co. is a winner and fills a niche in the Universal City area. We are looking forward to coming back to try more brews and appetizers."

                "description": "This is a really nice place to have a drink and eat some food with friends. They have a really nice warm vibe, and all the employees are very friendly. They have a moderate selection of drinks. But I think their food is way better than any of their drinks. Their Korean tacos were surprisingly very good but I think the star of that show is the small bowl of noodles you get with it. But I think the best thing I've had there was there gather fries with the white truffle sauce. That sauce makes me want to come back over and over again. The parking here is kind of meh but the food is worth it."

                "description": "Lovely place!  While I never like ordering at counters, the process was relatively straight forward.  I didn't know you ordered food and drinks at the same counter, but that's how it's done.  My husband is a beer snob and wasn't especially impressed.  I like a spiked seltzer and I enjoyed mine quite a bit.  Our experience with our meals taught me that simple is better.  My fried chicken sandwich was simple but tasty.  Their fries won the show.  My husband's Korean Fried Chicken Sandwich had a lot going on and none of it was to our liking.  It didn't get eaten.  I love that Gather is local, not a chain, is in a lovely building and is veteran owned.  We will likely go back eventually, after prepping ourselves a little better on what to try.  My husband is hoping they will add a hazy beer to their offerings."

                "description": "This brewery was on my list of places to check out on my next trip to Texas. I was able to check it off my list during my latest visit.  There is a lot of outdoor space, my preference on a sunny TX day but it was a bit chilly when I  stopped by so I sat inside.  The decor has a modern farmhouse look with long tables for large groups or beerhall seating in the center, bistro height tables for mid-size groups on one side and cozy tables for 2 by the stainless fermenting tanks.  You order your beer at the counter near the taps and pick up food near the back. Easy! The staff was friendly and welcoming. Everyone working appeared happy to be there. I ordered an IPA and the pretzel. The beer selection isn't extensive but covers a range of types so finding a beer is not an issue. I enjoyed my IPA, an American IPA-the Brew-S-A. The pretzel came with 3 sauces, a mustard, cheese and caramel-this was different but delicious. The food menu is similar to the beer menu, not big but will have something for most. I'd like to come back for lunch next time I'm in town so I can try an entree. I had a great visit to Gather and will be back. It's low key and casual with great food, beer and smiling faces behind the counter.  The street the brewery sits on is under currently under construction but it's an easy detour and worth the extra few minutes drive."

                "description": "I have driven by this are for about two years waiting  for this brewery to open.  The just opened up, and we had a chance to come by. The place is clean, plenty of room to sit, indoors and outdoors. The staff is friendly and helpful.    We are always looking for a good place to come hang out and be social. Good place to bring the kids, they have an area for the kiddos. Very kid friendly.     There were four of us, so we started with a hot chocolate, with marshmallows     I got the noble wheat, has a great taste, but it is missing an orange slice. Still great tasting beer.     Also had the trilogy, which is a Belgian triple ale style beer. Has a great smell, and a great tasting beer.     Had the cold front quad, omg, wonderful smell and great taste. Highly recommend this one.    Next one was the morning glory, a coffee porter, smelled is great, the taste is good, not too heavy on the coffee, which is good.   The last beer we had was the \"takes two to tango\", an ipa, not a fan of too many ipa's, but this one for me is very drinkable.    Also tried the pretzel, with the spicy mustard, the whiskey caramel, and beer cheese dips. This pretzel comes from Uwe's bakery in New Braunfels. Great pretzel."

It took some time to finish building the brewery but the end product is worth the wait. If I had to choose a favorite it would be Brew-s-a (IPA) but all of them are delicious. Can't wait to go back for more!"

                "description": "I really wanted to like this place.  The decor was contemporary and the place itself seemed to have a nice vibe.  It's close by and the only brewery within a 10  mile radius.   Service was inconsistent.  There seems to be miscommunication between the people behind the bar and the waitstaff. One said we could only order at the bar and another said they could take our orders. Who knows, either way, we had to be constantly reminding them of what we'd ordered, or bringing us basic items like water, silverware, and our check. They're not as attentive but we felt that having 2 people might have been overwhelming for the inside of the place. Let me say I'm not much of a beer drinker.  I tend to stay with pale ale and ciders.  My husband on the other hand, loves stouts, lagers, and other types.  This was a soft opening and we were told limited types of beer were available.  Of the 5 that were available, he liked 2.  They offer 2 wines (cab and zin).  Stay with the cab.   They also offer food.  It was a hit or miss on what was served.  The Korean brisket tacos tasted like 2 separate items.  The little bit of \"Korean\" slaw on it was ok, not much flavor but at least refreshing.  The brisket was dry, hard, and tasted like nothing.  It was served with rice, let me rephrase- soy sauce and some rice.  I eat and make rice frequently,  I took one bite and pushed it aside. It was soy sauce with rice, no other flavors came through.  The pulled pork bites were \"eh\". My husband ordered a chicken burger.  That was tender and flavorful.  The Korean wings were good.  I'd order that again.  We will give this place another try but the 3 stars are because some beer items were good and a couple of food items hit the spot if you're hungry."

I did like the glasses, but I can tell you, the best pretzel I've had in a while was here. Their sauce game was impressive, though some of the staff were a little on edge it seemed, but we'll chalk that up to covid and the world basically falling apart over the past two years. The Korean wings were delicious, and the garlic aioli was super tasty, I would put that on anything. I'll definitely come back for food alone, and partake in some beers!"

Came w/ a fairly large group for some holiday celebration vibes and had a fantastic time gathering at GBC! The beer is great, with a wide array of options, all made well. Several fun seasonals that I really enjoyed. We spent time both inside and out and and great vibes in both spaces. Very kid friendly, but the way it is setup if you prefer to stay away from little ones, you certainly can. The food was great, with all in the group mentioning how great it was.

                "description": "Often times breweries forgot about the people who don't drink. This place caters to everyone. I do wish they would put their custom made sodas, teas and coffee choices on their online menu so people like me know this place offers these items. The main reason we checked out this place was from a previous review mentioning something about their sodas as well as showing food pics. Either way because they offer non alcoholic beverages this will be our new brewery, I don't drink and my husband does. I got there blueberry soda and smash burger, both were fantastic. My hubby got their IPA beer and Korean tacos.... Whhaaaaat?! Those were amazing, such great flavor. Also we split a pretzel and I have to say I'm kinda a pretzel snob and tried many, this by far is the best one yet. The buttery coating on the outside and cooked to perfection on the inside. They served it with 3 sauces that my husband said was really good, he especially liked the caramel dip one. If you're reading this you should go check this new place out at least once and then you'll find yourself to be a returning patron haha."

                "description": "What a charming place this was! My friends and I decided to come by on a Wednesday evening for happy hour. It wasn't very busy and we were immediately seated in a nice booth that created the illusion of separation. I couldn't see anything behind me! This is a good thing btw!  We ordered some drinks and apps for the table. A couple Old Fashions, Mexican tea, and a drink off the secret menu that was delicious but I can't remember the name. The drinks were beautiful and tasty.  For the table we had the lemony hummus, the charcuterie, the hot Nashville chicken sliders, a cheeseburger, and honey butter chicken biscuit.  The lemony hummus came with fresh, crispy carrots, watermelon radishes, and celery. The hummus was creamy and tangy. It has a lot of dill, but I didn't mind that at all.  The chicken was a tad burned, but it was good the biscuit was soft and yummy, but it could have used a little more honey. I think the cheeseburger was the star. It was perfectly cooked and just hit the spot. The fries were also good. Just what I wanted!  The charcuterie was tiny, but it had some great treats.   And our waiter was phenomenal. He was attentive and super engaging. He gave us lots of information and we had a lot of fun small talk with him too."

                "description": "Food took f o r e v e r  to arrive. Server was nice but food took so long at one point she said it would be here but then It didn't come for another 30 minutes, this was around 4 pm  When it arrived, the scallops had enormous amounts of sausage like ham. Not sprinkled but probably a third of the dish. This was NOT in the menu. It was hard to push aside there were so many and we were afraid to send any food back due to the time it took to arrive. We had 2 orders of scallops around $35 each for only 3 scallops.  We also ordered the special meat loaf, that was good.  Bring a sweater, it is freezing in there and certain booths have the air blowing directly at you.  Interesting place, but too pricey for what you get... not much."

Our waitress was phenomenal and the food was impeccable. Best was the bloody Mary's! We will definitely be returning! Excuse the photos my camera is messed up. The only reason I did not give it five stars was the interior was not as great as they made it out to be."

How can you go wrong?! Meatloaf!!! honey butter chicken biscuit with a fried egg on top with Tallow Fries! Delicious. Housemade lemon and dill hummus. Amazing. You cannot go wrong with anything on the food or drink menu. You will not be disappointed."

                "description": "They have lost their passion. Pre-Covid I will say this spot did do a great job on drinks but we visited 1/22 and it definitely was not the same as it was in the past. We had the charcuterie and meats that were on the board were extremely thick. We also had the crab cake and it was mediocre. Not bad but not great. During Covid I do wish they had updated their hours and even now on yelp it states they are closed which is not correct. During Covid it stated they were open when they weren't. No one is monitoring the marketing for what it seems. Hostess cared more about being in the phone Vs caring for guests. Such a disappointment when there is so much potential."

                "description": "So this place always comes up on my searches so my husband and I decided to give it a try. When I go to a restaurant I like to evaluate it not only on a basis of food, but also the theme. The servers are in character - they are dressed as if they are mechanics with trucker hats. Nice touch to the restaurant given that it has an overall vintage gas station/industrial look.   Space/layout: Definitely a fun place to go to for brunch. They can accommodate large parties and have a bar. The decor around the restaurant are instgrammable, so if you are into that go ahead and cop yourself a pic.  Food: Not gonna lie, the food we order was a little bit more on the saltier side (Dirty Hash and the Shakshuka). Not sure if it was the cook that day or if the cook over shot the salt, but my husband and I had a difficult time finishing our food since it was a tad bit salty. Portion is great, presentation is amazing, but too salty. I am willing to give this place another try. Other than the saltiness, the food here is really good. But come thru and see how the food taste yourself!   P.S. Order a biscuit, it's really, really good here! Homemade and fresh."

                "description": "We went to the Downtowner (First Timers) on Saturday evening to have dinner before our show at the Brauntex ... 'Elvis' ... And he did deliver ... He paid a Tribute to the King!!  So, when we walked in, there were two hostesses at the front. They asked if we had reservations, which we did not. I told them it was fine, that we could walk next door to Krause's and next time I would make a reservation.  Well, all I can say is that those two hostesses moved heaven and earth to accommodate us! They perused the seating chart and came up with a 'plan' for us. As long as we could be done by 6:30p they had a table for two. We told them that we had to be at the Brauntex at 6:30p, so all was good.  At first, we thought they were just going to sit us in the back room.  LOL  We didn't realize that the restaurant went that far back.  And our waitress (Can't remember her name!) What a hoot. She was a pleasure to have. Answered all of our questions about the menu, etc. She brought water out in this cool bottle ... She told me I could have it ... And then wrestled it out of my arms when I tried to leave ... Just Kidding!! And then our food came. It was delicious!  And we were walking out of the restaurant at 6:30p.  KUDOS to everyone that took care of us!"

My only meh about this place is that there are 3-4 taps with Guadalupe Brewing's beer. Don't get my wrong, I love them, but they are right down the road, so to me it doesn't make sense to have that many of theirs on tap, especially since my husband and I frequent local breweries.

                "description": "In the latest wave of gentrification in this town, it seems like all I can find are hipster breweries that serve \"craft\" beer and overpriced food served on rectangular plates. If you like that kind of crap, go to aqua brew, you animal. If you want to go somewhere with cheap drinks and cool people (and if you live north of campus like this guy), look no further than Treff's. Some highlights.  You call it nights and you call it week:  Every Sunday, Treff's does $2.50 you call its, and $2.00 you call its on Tuesday. In addition to that, Treff's picks one week out of every month to be You call it week. That means $2 you call its all week. Going there, getting piss drunk, and stumbling back to my apartment, is among my fondest memories.   Atmosphere:  This place is dirty and divey in the best of ways. I used to go here with my friend from work all the time, and I always enjoyed seeing the bartenders and regulars. Really interesting people. Another upside is the patio, which allows filthy smokers like myself to smoke, drink, and have interesting conversations with other people. Another thing to mention, though, is that Treff's is much more of working people's bar. If you're a frat bro or sorority girl looking to blow mommy and daddy's money on a night of partying, you probably won't have a lot in common with the people here.  The glasses: This is just a little nitpick of mine, but I always hate going to the square and getting served drinks in a plastic cup. Treff's gets ridiculously busy some nights, and they still manage to serve all of their booze in glass, which is something I like. On another note, the bartenders here are absolute rock stars, and they don't take shit from anyone.   I haven't gone in a while since I don't have anyone to go with, but you can bet your ass the first place I'm taking my girlfriend when she turns 21 is gonna be Treff's."

Adults only in a drinking sense."

It was in existence way before he blew into San Marcos, and was known as the coolest, anti-frat bar in San Marcos.  That's why he bought it from Andy and Ben Linn, original owners.  He has expanded, added alot of TV s and updated the interior, but it will never be the place it was in the late 80's.  Keep blowing smoke, Patrick, - the Green Parrot is calling your name."

Can't beat it. Karaoke is also offered on Sundays, which is my favorite day to visit. Different events are hosted just about every day of the week. Although they don't serve food, they allow you to order at the restaurants near by and enjoy it there while washing it down with a cold alcoholic drink. Pretty awesome!"

At 2:03 they bouncer was stand at our table demanding that two of my girlfriends and I chug our drinks and leave when we stated we'd like to not get drunk and drive the entire bar staff proceed to attack us and demand we finish our drinks, that we had just got and paid for, and leave or they'd take them.

A few minutes later another friend met up with us and brought a round of shots. Within 10 minutes of being there a bouncer came up to us and told us we need to leave because we were \"too drunk\". I told him we weren't and we hadn't drank at all before we got there, we had all just been at a work function. He told us the bartender saw us walking to the bathroom \"looking drunk\". He wouldn't let us finish our drinks that we had just been served and only made the 4 people with shots out of my friend group leave. I think the staff there is racist just like other reviews are saying. Won't be coming back."

The bartender who is also manager and share-holder DID NOT MENTION TO US  that well vodka in the form of a pickle shot would be $6. As a longtime bartender being served by a long term bartender, when I'm told \"wells are $2\" I trusted that Chad would be honest with us. Instead, he took us to the cleaners. If I could give no stars I would. I have been in San Marcos for over 10 years. About 6 years ago I was man-handled by a door guy for no reason. I did not return to Treff's for almost 4 years. Since then, I have gone back a handful of times in hopes that it was just \"one bad apple\", but now I see that the employees at Treff's are out for nothing more than money. Even the door guy tonight was short and smile-less. I have received nothing less than awful service at this bar and I will not be returning."

This was my second visit to Treff's because the first time i had been there i did not have a great experience.

Whiskey Sours only $3.50 and then they have some killer drink specials during the week I believe on Sundays and Tuesdays they have -You - Call -  Its- for only $2!!

Their selection of beers was so/so, although I had heard that they had more than what they actually had.  The parking lot was awful. Construction going on and one way in and out. Only about 10-13 cars could park and you can forget it if you're driving a truck, as the guy driving a f250 found out after hitting the parked Mercedes.  Not a great place for a huge group of people, but not bad for a San Marcos bar. When visiting just be wary of the parking lot and crazy drivers."

Well, as usual, we squished into a parking spot in the front of the tavern, walked in and sat at an open bar stool. I ordered an Ace pear cider and started chatting with friends while the jukebox was going with a vast array of music choices! Thats the beauty of a jukebox and I love the diversity!  Okay so I decided to check in (via Yelp) and saw that they had an offer for $2 drinks which really excited me because it wasn't a Tuesday and I still could get some $2 drinks? HELL YEAH!  WELLLLLLL.... it was more like a HELLLLLL NO because the bartender didn't allow me to redeem my deal. He even said he texted the owner and that the owner had no idea what kind of deal I was talking about? Well, the offer is still open on my Yelp app and I plan to find the owner next time I'm at the bar and ask him about it because that offer didn't magically come to be!!!  Anyway, yes Treff's is a super chill, casual and cool bar but they lost some points with not accepting my Yelp offer (I mean that's what the offers are there for hellloooooo)!! Guess I'll stick to only going in on Tuesdays..."

Bartender was serving us and she was unavailable. Saw some lady tucked behind the fountain machine on her cell phone and when I asked for help she said she wasn't on the clock. I'll assume that to be true. Looked outside and saw the bartender having a smoke and putting on makeup. I walked outside to let her know about it and didn't request anything in return. She apologized and offered to reimburse my card (I paid cash prior to my finding and a 30% tip to which I should have taken back, but I did not).

                "description": "I went this past Sunday at lunch.  There were maybe three tables sat when we got there.  We ordered the onion rings appetizer.  They were very good except for the ketchup tasted spoiled.  We ordered three burgers where they charge you for the cheese and a different bread if you want it.  I chose the Jalapeno cheese bread.  After waiting about 40 minutes our waitress comes out and says they ran out of hamburgers but rest assured they were making some and ours would be fresh!  My family laughed and said, what had they not ran out would they not be fresh?  Needless to say and hour passed by and our food finally came out.  Trusting the yelp 4 start review I'm ready to eat!  Well my Jalapeno and cheese bun came out and it had no Jalapeno or cheese in it and it was the type that is old and falls apart and was fermented.  I almost asked for my $1.50 back for the upgrade but my family said let's just get out of here and forget about it and not come back.  So for $52 we received an order of onion rings and three burgers and no drinks.  A sign of the situation as well, the table next to us complained of the hot sauce for their tacos being spoiled.  Their 4 star review may have been earned in the past but this place is not something I will ever be looking forward to.  ****Update*****We used my Mastercard here to eat and didn't use the card anywhere else.  I've received two fraudulent charges on the card now.  A girl by the name Jessica used the card to buy pizza in Seguin."

It's a smaller restaurant with plenty of seating and a full bar (although pretty simple draft choices).  The prices are good, and the food is great! I had the buffalo chicken sandwich on sourdough. It came out fresh and melted in my mouth. I can't say I have had a chicken burger this fresh and moist...ever! My husband got the Texan which was great as well- not too much bbq sauce and the flavors went together great.  While we didn't have room for anything else other than beer, I would definitely be back. Very dive bar feel with what seemed like 98% \"locals\" or return guests as everyone was mingling with the bartenders a lot. I am happy to say this didn't affect our service since the bartenders were the waitstaff as well.  Definitely check it out! Also karaoke on Saturdays!"

The only problem is that it's already the regular spot for a LOT of people so you better start taking lunch breaks early.  I came with a work friend and got a decent table ala \"seat yourself\". Lots of burger options and that's what they are known for. I had the Texas burger on a bun. Usually, it comes on Texas toast (of course). It was ginormous and well done. The pile of bacon on it was - it amazes me to write this - almost too much. I think there was more bacon than beef. Also a couple onion rings and bbq sauce made this an awesome meal.  For a side I had the tater tots which were tasty and well cooked.   I would have liked speedier service, but the three women serving this place were flat out slammed and doing an impressive job of keeping up with the flow. So go, be patient, and don't fill the place up!"

                "description": "Incredibly substantial menu for a dive bar, a ceiling-to-floor menu of shots, super friendly staff, AND , amidst the DosEquis and Lone Star and Bud, a single tap reserved for local Guadalupe beer...LOVE!  Drawn in by the media buffet above the bar (football, football, football, Simpsons, football, football...something for errbahduh!), we parked it there.  There's a great list of pre-built burgers, but also a long list of carb jacket (definitely go for the jalapeño cheddar! Definitely. ) and topping choices from which to build your own. He orders the Australian burger and I beer, I go for a much more Texan option: chicken fingers and fries basket, white pepper gravy duh, and a sweet tea (Don't judge! We had just spent all afternoon at  brewery, and I hadn't eaten. Adultin' like a mofo!) The waitress was kind enough to suggest that the fries in my basket would be enough for both of us. ..\"*if* I felt sharing\", lol. Well played, ma'am! And much appreciated tip, seriously! ...and indeed they were. A very short few minutes later, a veritable mountain of food was placed in front of  us.  Burger: Super!! Chicken and gravy: Really really good. Fries: Old eff'n Bay!!! Yaaayyyy!  Sweet Tea : holy shit, use the lemon! Super sweet and delicious with it. Without citrus...drinking Karo sizzurp through a straw lol.  Bellies : full.  To-go box: also full.  Bartender: Badass"

                "description": "I believe in always starting off on a positive note...  that being said, they played good music while we were there.   We heard the burgers were supposed to be good. Decided to try it out for Mother's Day. NOT for us. Burger was large, but very greasy and lacking in flavor. We asked for extra crispy sweet potato fries, I've had more flavorful and crispy sweet potato fries frozen out of a bag. Menu was a la cart, so we spent way more than we should have for in my opinion, poor quality food.  Customer service (if you can even call it that) was non existent. Will not go back. Pat's Place is definitely much better, unfortunately they're closed on Sunday's.  For the lovely folks letting their small kids scream and fight over the pool table, pool sticks/balls, AND use a stick with no tip on the felt, unsupervised, I'm thinking Chucky Cheese is probably a better choice next time."

                "description": "Today, for 8 hours, I've been thinking about downing a hand-formed, griddled hamburger. Where to go? My criteria: new place, no tips, local, inexpensive, and at least a 1/2 pounder,   There are not many places to get hamburgers over here. There is Smashburger, which has been getting horrible ratings, Chilis (my favorite), Texas Roadhouse, Gruene River Grill, the Phoenix Saloon, and Pat's place. Now, places where you can get away without paying a tip--whether that is through the drive though or takeout--are GG's Corner Cafe (Marion), Blakes's Cafe (McQueeney), Kirby's Korner (Seguin), the Longhorn Cafe (New Braunfels), and today's addition with Landa Station.     This dive bar is located about a block past Landa Park. While looking at their menu online, I noticed that all of their burgers are 1/2 pounders (plus); they have one pounders also, chicken sandwiches, and Mexican food (cool). This is a bar folks!  I went through the drive though, after phoning in my order 10 minutes earlier. I ordered a patty melt ($5.75) because I haven't had one since I was a teenager, ions ago. The patty melt was described as a 1/2 pound burger, grilled onions, and swiss cheese on a buttered, Texas Toast. I must have arrived 5 minutes too late because my \"toast\" was no longer toasted. Either it was not toasted enough, or it steamed in that Styrofoam box and turned back into bread.      The burger was huge, juicy, and was cooked medium, as I had ordered (plus), the onions were great; however, the cheese was a white cheese sauce, or poor quality cheese (I think the former). The cheese seemed almost like white cheese whiz. If these burgers could be improved, I would only serve Wisconsin cheeses. I would pay 75 cents more.  They also have chopped pork, chicken, and many burger combinations. Because of the price, the drive through, and hand formed burgers, I will definitely be back. Oh, and on Wednesdays, when you buy a burger, you get a beer for 10 cents (probably inside only)."

                "description": "Leaving the Outlet Malls and headed back home via Hwy 21, we needed a lunch spot on the \"right\" side of the interstate for easy in/out. 54th Street hit all of those needs.  We were promptly seated by a super sweet hostess. We have a toddler and we were able to grab the booth highchair on the way to our table instead of getting to the table and then waiting for a highchair. I know that doesn't mean a lot, but 90% of the restaurants we visit, we have to wait for them to seat us then they bring a highchair to our table. By them having the booth highchairs at the hostess station, they are \"working smarter, not harder\". Big kudos the them for that.  Our waiter was (forgive me for I didn't catch his name) was extremely knowledgeable of the menu and helpful for all questions.   I had the Cherry Limeade to go along with the Gringo Dip and Chips we ordered for our appetizer. Both the limeade and the chips/dip were outstanding. I would recommend both.  For entrees, we had the Prime Rib French Dip and the Havana Club. The French dip is the first sandwich listed and I didn't read any further. I'm a sucker for a good French Dip and this sandwich delivered. The wife commented that her Havana Club was delicious as well. The kids had grilled cheeses with fries. All looked great and they devoured them.  All in all, this is the spot you're wanting for an easy off/on when traveling north on I-35. We'll be back when we are in the area."

My husband had ribs. My friend had ribeye with blackened shrimp. Everything was tasty.  Waiter tried but kept forgetting stuff. We didn't get straws till 20 min after our drinks were served. Like no one got straws to drink.   then he kept forgetting the refills and my glass of water.  My 5 yo noticed and commented on the server's forgetfulness. He was nice but he's obviously new-- he didn't know the menu well at all. But it's fine, we had a good dinner. Price was very decent."

I had the Havana Club sandwich with the Chicken Tortilla Soup on the side and the Key Lime Pie for dessert. The sandwich was great! Pretty big and definitely worth the price. The soup was also good as well. The pie was great and unlike any other pie I've had, tangy and with amazing crust.  Overall the atmosphere of the restaurant was great, especially for the night time. Its got a cluttered pop-culture type decor style, similar to that of Beyond Burger, nice dim lighting, and huge comfortable booths. Our waitress was also very kind and did a great job. I highly recommend this place, especially in the night time for the atmosphere."

After tonight we will no longer be returning to 54th street restaurant.

Yet there was a party of 12 that didn't show for their reservation and still we were refused service. It was supposed to be the graduation dinner for my fiance and this is how it turned out. It is not our fault that the restaurant is understaffed, but losing us as loyal customers definitely is their fault. Save your time and $ take your family somewhere else."

                "description": "This place was a jewel of a find! Just 4 miles up from the San Marcos premium outlets this place is well worth the stop. A gentleman from North face recommended it to us and we are thankful we listened. The best way I can describe this place is a pub like feel with amazing pub like food and even better personal service! The gluten free menu was AMAZING and I felt safe eating here as a celiac! The rest of our group had plenty of option as well. Two of us had burgers and the other had soup and sandwich and we enjoyed every bite! Jeanne was our server (hope I spelt that correctly) and she did a great job helping us choose menu items! If we ever come back to Austin/San Marcos this will be a stop on our list!! The gluten free burger was so good, the bun was not crumbly or taste like cardboard but perfect! I actually took home half of the bun to eat later... ha! Thanks 54th Street, it was great!"

                "description": "Surprisingly good drinks and comfort food.   I had the loaded tater tots and a pina colada. The tater tots were filling, and made me feel full despite the order only giving five tater tots or so.   The pina colada was good too. I am usually not a fan of alcohol, but this pina colada was actually good to me. Not too bitter, which was pleasing. However if you have more mature tastes, then the drinks here might not be satisfactory. College students like sweet alcohol, and this restaurant gives exactly that.   Parking is plentiful, and the demographic of this restaurant is mostly college students. This place gets loud too."

They were so nice and suggested so many choices. It was so fun and chill didn't even realize we where waiting for a table. I recommend this place and haven't even been here. I've been to so many places and the hostesses are never this nice. Definitely have great staff here!"

The crispy calamari wasn't crispy (but it tasted fine).  pros: The greeter and waiter were both polite from the start till the end.  The alfredo pizza was yummmmmy. The price was reasonable.  The interior was nice.  We went mid day during the week so it wasn't busy.  Their timing with the food was good.  overall: Very nice."

Stephanie tells me she will be out shortly. 7 minutes later I get a text saying my food is being packaged. 20 minutes go by so I call back. Stephanie nicely apologizes as it was sitting there for about 20 minutes. I get home and the order was not correct. $30 with tip for extremely cold, incorrect food. I tried to eat it but it was awful. I was trying to be so nice, but I just want to cry lol"

                "description": "This review is just the staff and not the food as the food was good along with the cold beer. We went into the New Braunfels BJ's in the afternoon on a Sunday, not real busy. Sat down and waited about 15-20 mins before a server came by. I asked him they were busy and he said no, I responded with oh I thought you might be since it took you so long to come by the table. So that may have come off wrong but bear with me. With that comment the waiter said oh I must have been getting someone's food. Ok I can understand that. He takes our order which is Nacho's for my wife and I to share and drinks. The food comes out quickly and looks great! The gentleman that brought the food (not our waiter) asked what else we needed, plates please. About that time our waiter stops by and asks what else we needed and I said napkins. Ok, so here we have a large order of nacho's and no, plates or napkins or even waters? After about 30 mins the waiter comes back by and asks us what else we need. My wife asked for a water.  More than 5 mins later he brings it out. The entire time this waiter never smiled and for that matter none of the servers smiled at any of there guests. We watched them all while we ate and it was unreal how unhappy these people looked. To be honest, I left a $1.87 tip on a $35.00 ticket. I usually would have tipped $7.00-$10.00 on that if it was good service but he just made us feel like we shouldn't be in his space. I'm old, 68 and maybe getting a little mean but a smile and a \"I care\" attitude would go along ways! The bad is that no one will do anything about this, look at the corporate Facebook page and it's negative after negative comments and no responses."

                "description": "Early dinner seems to be our thing these days as that seems to be our most comfortable level of dining in .. also great to take advantage of any happy hour apps or bevs when you dine early  So first things first, YES the staff are masked and gloved. YES social distancing is enforced, YES there is sanitizer available at the entrance.  Service was great, beverage selections always great here esp if you like craft brew. My choice here is Jeremiah Red if you like a bock or amber beer.  The calamari we ordered for appetizer was plenty to share between the two of us..could definitely split three ways and fresh and not rubbery or tough. We also split the delicious Ahi Tuna salad and a small pizza.  The tuna could have had a better sear, like the salad  I had here couple years ago.  Now I will say the pizza is deep dish pie, and I felt fell a bit short on the cheese, but the buttery soft crust was delicious.  The pizza did take nearly 20 minutes before arriving to our table...good time for conversation with company and enjoying your drinks, so be prepared for the wait.   Menu is online and paying your bill is also taken care of online.  No exchanging paper or using a shared pen to sign your tab."

Coming in at about $16 I was expecting a little more pizza for my money. The crust was good. It had some crunch and a little chew. I was disappointed that they forgot to add one of the standard topping of this specialty pizza."

So since everyone is obsessed with BJs I'm going to focus on the positives of BJs instead of listing what I don't like about BJs.  Really enjoyable sports pub in the north burbs of San Antonio (far north on I-35) which I visited on two occasions - mostly because it's right off the highway, so when we're in this part of town and somebody wants to meet up with me (a specific dude, basically) this is usually his choice because he thinks it's more convenient for me. I told him on a number of occasions that I'd rather go five miles off the highway to some amazing little ethnic hidden gem, but he's always like, no this one's easier and it's my favourite place anyway - I think it's easier for him more than me, 2 mins drive and he's right there.  I do like it though, and good memories here for us. For a sports bar it has pretty good food and he's all about the alcohol and they have a good selection, and pretty decent prices as well for that matter."

A gentleman sat at the bar and was either psychologically going through something or simply on drugs.  The bartenders were women and immediately we all noticed something wasn't right.  One of the ladies asked for the manager...but apparently because of his size or i don't know what he did nothing and eventually sent the chef out to talk the the guy.  This didn't work and the man continued talking to demons and requesting wine. Finally the manager came out and talked to the guy and walked him out.   But i feel like it should have been handled more quickly as the employees obviously didn't feel safe."

The wait was said to be 15-20 minutes and it was 38 minutes. Our food took forever and our appetizers came out cold with our main entrees, thank god avocado rolls taste fine semi cold. Our waitresses were rude, my wife said one was Brooke and she couldn't catch the hostess's name. It seemed like we were bothering both of them for even coming to eat there. We have never had an experience like this before with BJ's Restaurants. Please chat with your employees about their attitudes and figure out an actual time frame."

Pizza was ordered with instructions to please do not drizzle with garlic aioli sauce and put on side, but there its is drizzled.

                "description": "Amazing everything!  Friendly staff, great outdoor ambiance, freakin good food!  We got the Santa Fe and The Alamo wrap, with group beef. The ground beef used it the same for both, so the difference is really the other topping inside. We also got the fully loaded fries... Hands down, best fully loaded version I've had! The fries was prepared well, the toppings were generous. Just typing this out makes my mouth salivate already lol!  I wish we were close to this place, I'd always get their fries!"

                "description": "They took our money and promised food but they weren't open!   The online system took our order and charged our card, but when we went to pick it up, there was absolutely no one there. Everything was dark and shut up tight( even though online it said they were open) with no sign or anything. We have repeatedly phoned them to check but they don't answer. While we figured out what to do, several other cars pulled up to pick up their online order, but of course, no one was there. Very unprofessional of them and disappointing. After I reached out to my community, I found out this is actually a very common thing, so I don't understand how they can remain in business. This is absolutely unacceptable, especially since they charged my card already."

                "description": "If you take 3009 from I-35, as if you're following the signs to the Natural Bridge Caverns, on the right side is a place called Wraptitude, which features amazing burgers, gourmet wraps, seasonal salads and tacos. There's even a kids menu so, just about everyone in your family will be happy.    Wraptitude is a rustic place with most of the tables outside either on a small deck or, fenced yard which includes a playground for the little ones. There's also a small sit down bar inside as well. I had The Maverick burger which includes cheese, avocado, bacon and 1000 island dressing. There's also a Goose burger (are you noticing a theme here?), Viper Tacos and so much more.  This is not a fancy place so, don't get all gussied-up but, it's a nice family place to bring the kids out, meet up with friends.  The staff are extremely friendly and polite.   I hope you have a chance to enjoy this very casual place and with the weather beginning to warm up, eating outside will be fun again."

                "description": "Found this gem while treating a Veteran to a lunch on Veterans Day. It's a nice small indoor/large outdoor restaurant. Upon arrival parking was easy and they have plenty of room. You can see a lot of picnic tables and small playground set.   I'm giving 3 stars because the lady who took our order was super rude. I would ask a question and it was met with so much attitude and unwillingness to help. If it wasn't for me treating a friend to lunch I would have completely walked away from this place.   The bright side was that the food turned out really good. We split an order of sweet potato fries bc it's a huge serving. I ordered the Santa Fe wrap which is Pepper Jack, black beans, corn, rice, chipotle spread with avocado (vegetarian option). It was really pleasing, wrap done right. They also have a nice selection room of craft beers."

                "description": "I recommend this place, cause when it is nice outdoors, this is a great place to be. Also the food is great. To me, once they change the buns on the burgers, I want a burger now. I didn't like the buns before, so I started getting the wraps, which are delicious, now I'm hooked on the BLT. Plus this place has a friendly staff, they do get busy, so the wait for food may be awhile, but the beer selection is pretty decent.   One draw back is the bathroom, just one."

They weren't wearing masks or gloves, so keep that in mine when going.  The had a little park thing and a bunch of outside seating, so it's great if you have a family!  We didn't get to try any of the beers.  The Cali club was good, but there was nothing special about it.  The maverick was good but again, there was nothing special about it.  The loaded fries were good, but it wasn't as presentable as I could make it myself at home. It also felt like it had waited out for a while before it got to us.  There was nothing really special about this place, but the food was ok."

                "description": "Came in for a quick lunch with the hubby. The waitress at the bar was nice. We both hd tea and it was good nothing special. My husband had the 46 burger wrap. It was ok. The sauce tasted like thousand island. Nothing made it special. The menu stated it came with fries, but he didn't get any. I ordered the Hollywood taco. The shredded chicken was GREAT. The price for what I got was high. Just a normal sized taco you would make at home. The tortilla tasted like an H‑E‑B tortilla, not bad just ok. The meat was topped with a few kernels of corn and fresh diced jalapeño. The verde sauce was mediocre. Again nothing special. I added fries to my order and they were good, Very crispy. They were out of fried pickles which was a huge let down since it was one of the reasons we chose to give this place a shot, but I'm not holding it against them with the supply shortages going on right now.  Overall everything was ok, but didn't seem worth the drive or the price."

                "description": "So we're heading to the caverns and wanted lunch.  We ARE NOT chic filet kinda people!!  Found this place on yelp and it was along the route we were taking.  OK yes, it is somewhat of a hole in the wall, or for that matter quaint, picturesque, salon, on the side of the road. Walked in and were greeted by Heidi (one of the owners), she told us to pick where we wanted to sit, so we saddled up to the bar.  Yes, small bar, but very adequate, plenty of tables to sit inside, and outside.   Craving a burger, but not wanting the bun, started reviewing the wraps.  My husband and I both ordered wraps and a order of onion rings.   My Santa Fe with ground beef was wonderful, the cheese was creamy, the beef tender with just a hint of spice.  My husband enjoyed the Alamo wrap and it disappeared.  OH, don't let me forget the salsa she gives you with the wrap, I don't remember what it was but it was super with kick!  The onion rings we shared (small order), was the perfect amount for two people, they were fresh and hot!  We are not dippers, so we did not take Heidi up on the sauces she offered for the rings. If ever back in this neck of the woods, we WILL be back!"

                "description": "Came here with the family after doing Natural Bridge Caverns. First, be prepared to sit outside, there's not much room inside, especially during the social distancing times. However, even though it was over 90 degrees outside the shade and breeze kept it cool enough to be pleasant. Kids had a playground to okay on - though it was a bit past it's prime.   The ordering seemed a bit haphazzard, which seemed to be due to only have one employee working front of house despite it being rush hour lunch time. This caused me to have to stand at the bar for considerable amounts of time waiting to order or when I went to get a beer. Hopefully this was just someone not showing up for a shift and not a perpetual issue.   Now for the food. I had a Santa Fe wrap. Standard Mexican ingredients, but all together tasty. My wife's burger wrap with fries in the wrap looked quite good. Kids chicken strips were solid quality. The fries had good flavor and crunchy outsides. Beer selection was surprisingly good (Blood and Honey automatically  means I'm happy).   Solid, if not spectacular experience."

                "description": "I was excited to try this place and loved the outdoor area. My friend and I ordered the Santa Fe wrap and we were quite disappointed. The entire wrap was rice, it was so hard to eat because of the amount of rice made the wrap so dry. It hardly had any chicken, mine had maybe a 3 little pieces of chicken bits and about 6 black beans. Just a drop of sauce and no cheese or corn. I should have taken a pic but I had to open mine up to remove the big glob of rice. Same with my friends. Our sons loved their burger and grilled cheese. Next time I will try a burger but for being called wraptitude, I was expecting a good wrap."

                "description": "We stopped by after spending the morning at Natural Bridge caverns. We ordered a few burger wraps, chicken strips, and the surf burger from the kids menus. The food was really tasty and fries were delicious. The main issue here was that they seemed to be understaffed and weren't set up very well for social distancing. They have a very small seating area and bar inside and several picnic tables and outdoor seating options. While you can spread out just fine outside, you have to go inside of the crowded small building to place your order. It was a very small space with too many people inside close together. Also, the fountain drinks and cups were self-serve set up right next to where everyone was standing. If they had online or outside ordering so that you could avoid going inside, it would really improve things."

                "description": "This was the 1st meal while in Texas, and we dare say it was superb. The guy running the restaurant was super chill and energetic. The atmosphere was relaxing with the eclectic decor.  The hubs had the burger wrap while I had 3 tacos (pork, asada, and avutarian). We also shared the half-loaded fries.  The fries were amazing! Usually with these types of dishes, the fries become soggy or aren't even crispy to begin with. These had a crunch even to the last few pieces. And not to mention, it was loaded with a lot of beef and bacon pieces. What a value for the amount of meat that's in it.  His burger wrap was seriously da bomb. All the 46 sauce and ingredients stuffed inside the wrap was just oozing outwards. The wrap consisted of beef, bacon bits, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and onions -- pretty much what a burger is. Biting into this was a wowing moment. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  My tacos were okay. They weren't superb (standard lettuce, cheese, lime, and tomatillo salsa). I wouldn't rec it as this place isn't known for their tacos:  * Asada: The avocados were creamy. This was prob the freshest and tastiest of the 3 tacos. * Avutarian: The flavors were faint at most. There wasn't much wow or anything that made this taco look nor taste diff. * Pork: The flavors were lacking, and the pork looked super bland (see the only close-up pic worth taking).  Everything about this experience was 5 stars minus my taco choices. The loaded fries and burger wrap were just mind-blowing delicious and at a great price.  Though there were limited parking spaces in the front, the back had plenty of nooks and crannies you could squeeze your car into."

We were able to park close and was seated right away. We loved the look and feel of the court yard and restaurant.  Cozy is how we described it. Our server was attentive and we passed on appetizers but order a bottle of French sauvignon blanc wine. Very good wine at a reasonable price point. We both ordered the 7oz loin steak. I opted for chicken tortilla soup, tasty thick soup but it was not very hot (Temperature). My wife had the salad with blu cheese dressing (good quality). We were pleased that our entrees did not arrive until we finished our soup/salad course. Again a point of proper service by our server. Our loin steaks were proper Temperature and had a great char crust. Great tasting. Green beans were fresh and cooked with still a bite to them. Roasted potatoes were nice.  For dessert we ordered black coffee that was fresh, cheesecake and a chocolate cake with ice cream. Desserts were very good.  We highly recommend and we return soon"

I had seen all of the great reviews and even had some friends that Have recommended this place.  I love the decor and the house feel to this restaurant. We were seated right away and the service was top notch. I got the tortilla soup which I recommend and I ordered the steak with the port wine reduction sauce with blue cheese. I am picky about my steaks partly because I think I am pretty decent at cooking my own. This steak did not disappoint and the sauce was amazing.  Afterwards I had the cheesecake which was not only good but also the perfect size. If you are in New Braunfels you need to make a visit here and check this place out!"

It's a great place to have a date the atmosphere is just romantic they have out side sheeting shopping in the area and everything on the menu is just amazing. I usually start off with the chips and three salsa, then my go to entree is the steak medium rare with blue cheese sauce, for those of you who don't like blue cheese still try it even if it on the side because I know I'm not a blue cheese love but this sauce just hits different. If you have room for dessert get the cheesecake that has melted Carmel with  pecans or take it to go it's a great breakfast. They are also kid friendly so it a nice romantic dinner even if you don't have a sitter. The service is always great no matter who's your server just expect a wait Friday, Saturday and Sunday but it's so worth it promise."

The service was excellent though which made up for the lackluster food.  I have eaten here a couple of times.  Once was just for wine and cheese board, which this seems to be a much better place for, just not the full dinner."

The people who work there are friendly.   The parking is difficult but the food is worth the trouble. Huisache's meals are one of a kind.  They take fairly ordinary recipes and add little twists.  Those twists make their entrees taste marvelous. Well done Huisache Grill!"

The hostesses were very rude and non understanding. We asked to be seated outside near a heater and she threw a huge fit, returned outside and threw our menus and silverware and plates (which were filthy from the patrons before, they had not been cleaned properly and were covered in food). Then we waited for a good 10 minutes and still we're not seen by a server so we left. All in all terrible service and cleanliness."

My issue was the food quality. I have run restaurants and I know what should and should not be on a plate, especially with such a busy place. The salad was wilted. My tomatoes were starting to shrivel. The bread had been frozen and not thawed all the way before they cooked it. The meat was a lower grade than we were expecting.   Sometimes it's hard for me to eat out having shopped for three cafes and been a chef for 10 years, so take this review knowing I'm very picky.  My expectations are probably higher than they should be."

The mashed potatoes were dried out. The meat was over cooked. And the waitress was inattentive.    This place used to be a gem prior to the pandemic.  I would recommend it to people from out of town.  Now, I will just warn them to not waste their money here."

My husband and I thought the place was beautiful, however the food was ok. We started off with some wine, the moscato was great and added to the ambiance. We had the broiled spinach and artichoke dip.  I was expecting a traditional dip, but let me tell you what we got was not average at all. The dip seemed to have a hint of lime in it. My husband loved it, it was not for me. I can more closely describe it to tasting like corn in a cup. They also serve it with bread and chips. For an entre, I had the parmesan breaded chicken breast. It was stuffed with mushroom's, spinach, cheese and  artichoke hearts, served with a side of penne pasta and broccoli. I wish that my chicken was stuffed significantly more. I could hardly taste the filling. The penne pasta was a little bland, but I did not mind it. The broccoli was cooked to perfection and I quite enjoyed it. My hubby got the 2oz mixed grill. He was satisfied, but mentioned it was not for him.   In conclusion, this place is worth a try, the location is beautiful, and they also have cats in their courtyard!"

I feel like going into specialty stores like this are intimidating, because everyone seems to know what they want. My husband and I don't drink often, and it got overwhelming looking through all the variety of fine wines and liquors.  We had questions about vodka, and thankfully staff came up to us to give us recommendations on both local and nationwide brands. We decided to try some locally made vodka and WOW! One of the smoothest drinks I've ever had.   They also sell frozen foods, horderves, plates and silverware, which makes this place a perfect spot if you're looking to host a last minute get together or date!"

                "description": "Spec's has endless options to appease anywhere from a casual to an ultra refined palette. The majority of the staff really knows their stuff and are eager to help you hunt anything down.   If you're walking in for the first time, don't let how huge the place is throw you off your game. Everything is well sorted and sectioned off so even if you don't want direction from staff, a quick skip down any aisle will give you an idea of what that section offers. There's usually a couple tastings near the entry, incentive while you're shopping, and the first Wednesday of every month there's a pretty big wine tasting (Usually 7-10 sections, each offering several samples.)  Beyond beer, wine, and spirits, Spec's offers some pretty swanky snack sections. Its a great place if you're wanting to build a gift basket for someone, or if you're in a hurry they have some pre-built gift baskets up for grabs, too.   The prices are pretty fair, I've never bought something and found it astoundingly differently priced anywhere else. They do offer good deals if you're paying cash instead of debit or credit, they give a military discount, and if you're a Spec's rewards member there are perks like first dibs whenever hard to get items come in. Its a pretty great option to scoop up everything you'd need in one stop."

                "description": "Been to this store MANY times; however, this evening was a terrible experience.  No registers (normally manned) were open so only checking out at the front where the half-pints/pints/etc. are located.  Waited in line a few minutes, which was no big deal.  When I was called \"next\" I quickly requested a pint, but the guy checking me out was a complete jerk!! Rude, condescending and generally, I guess, in a bad mood.  No business should hire people like that!  Didn't thank me for the business ... just remained surly.  So, too many other liquor stores to put up with that crap and it will be my last visit to Spec's.  Oh, by the way Spec's, the holiday season is closely approaching and I normally spend my fair share during that time ... not this year for you!  You're like the liquor store nazi ... adios!"

                "description": "This is a huge store! In addition to their vast selection of liquor and large array of wine options they have special chocolaty treats to purchase and lots of fun bar and party snacks. They have cigars and cigar supplies. I usually frequent the Spec's at the Villages at Stone Oak but the wine guy there told me this store offers wine tasting on the first  Wednesday of the month so we decided to try it out. It  was a nice little event, 5 wine stations with at least 2 wines but most had 3-4 options to taste. There was a little tiny sample of a cheese, onion, and olive and a bonus station of bloody Mary tasting. I really like being able to taste affordable wines before purchasing and they offer them at case price if you purchase during the event. Only thing I would suggest is either bring your own palate cleansing cracker, etc or maybe Spec's could offer a small palate cleaning option at each station. I understand this is a free event but a small option should be  to much to ask for. Also, the pourers didn't seem to know to much about the wine, they were just pouring. However, I think it would have been more interesting if they would have known more about the wine/region/etc. Additionally, one can bring their own wine glass. I ended up purchasing some wines that I would have never purchased otherwise. Over all, pretty neat little free event and I will attend again for sure."

                "description": "I'm absolutely livid with the poor customer service practices at this Spec's in particular, and from this point forward will avoid Spec's altogether as much as I possibly can. Ugh!  I've been coming in to this store, in person, at least once per day for over a week, looking for a limited-release beer. On the first visit, a manager filled out a Special Order form with my contact info, assuring me that, while the beer would be sold on a first-come, first-serve basis with no holds,  I would receive a phone call when it was indeed in stock so I could haul over there in a hurry and pick one up. On each subsequent visit - the most recent being 8:30 last night - my phone number was confirmed and I was assured that I would receive a call when it was available.  With no call received, I stopped in this afternoon to check in, just in case, and was informed that the beer had come in this morning and sold out already, that they had deemed it, upon delivery, \"not fair\" to follow through with the promised phone call. Bullshit!  If that had been the case from the beginning, fine. 100% understandable. But given that it's acceptable practice for management to switch gears at the 11th hour and completely disregard their promises to me, I find that it would be *unfair* to my consumer conscience to continue to spend any money at store with such ridiculously poor customer service standards."

                "description": "Ladies and Gentlemen? I gotta give a mad shoutout to Spec's. But seriously folks. Can you really find something to complain about here? I tried to find the elusive bottle of Glen Deveron single malt scotch here as well. It was in the computer but I had no luck in procuring this Nectar of the Gods. But that is ok. The gentleman who assisted me took the time to look and found out he could not get it. I will not need to tell my own self to SHADDAPP!! because there is no need to whine or complain. In case you have not noticed the shelves are brimming with many other fine products to your liking. And not being able to find EXACTLY what you think you need is definitely a first world problem.   I would like to add that at this particular location I was able to procure some Absinthe spoons which I could not locate elsewhere. And this just made my girly man nipples erect with exhilaration. Otherwise I would have had to order the dang things online which I luckily avoided. And this is good because just like the rest of the crowd of habitually chronic complainers, I like immediate gratification. It is nice to see the object I wish to purchase. To touch it. Hold it. Imagine how good it will feel to impart it into use. Try this with a stripper in a club somewhere and you will get tossed out of there in a hurry. So this theory does not work everywhere. Be advised.   And the thing with Spec's is that you really can't beat their prices. And the selection of tequilas as well as wines is unsurpassed. I have never had a complaint for any gift I have purchased here for anybody here. Maybe that is because all my friends are alcoholics? NAH! It just means that I might be unimaginative when it comes to buying gifts such as liquor or cigars and resort to this. But it is great because my buddies can enjoy their cigars and liquor guilt free. If you have male friends who are married with three kids or more then always get them a good bottle of liquor and a few stogies for a gift. It will always hold you in the esteem of \"righteous dude\" status. Even if their wives don't particularly care for you.   And a few hours spent in their company for obligatory holiday visits will leave you invigorated upon departed their company. And you will also feel less sorry for your old buddy when you leave him with the ball and chain as well as the life to which he is fastened like a dog on a chain leash. What the hell else can you do? You told him not to marry her. Besides, you left him with a good bottle of whiskey. And now your work is done. You have been the best friend you can be!   I am your yelp buddy, Madman!! And you can always trust my reviews and I will never steer you wrong! Happy New Year! Don't be an idiot. Don't drink and drive! Unless you are swinging wood on the golf course. That's a much different kind of driving. There are other kinds of driving too. But I believe I have said quite enough already."

No Real Ale bombers? Seriously? No Guadalupe. No New Braunfels. Limited Branchline. They did have 5 Stone and Freetail. A few Austin breweries but very limited selection even from those.

They have a huge cooler area where they have a lot of ice cold beer.  They also have a wide variety of wines and liquors along with a humidor.  Spec's has a large selection of cigars.  They also have everything you need to make mixed drinks and items for your food and cheese boards.  Spec's carry and wide variety of cheeses including Yancy Fancy which includes ghost pepper and habanero.  They also have special meats, olives, and nuts and different kinds of snacks.  Spec's even had caviar and different kinds of crackers.  Try the olives stuffed with blue cheese which has been hard to find lately.  The Spec's in South New Braunfels also have the same items, it's on 35 in the same shopping plaza as Planet Fitness.  Spec's goes above and beyond with customer service, if you take the name of a certain beer, wine, spirit they will look it up to see if they have it or can get it in.  Spec's is the one stop shop for entertaining or having what you need to sit at home while in this pandemic in front of the television watching a movie.  I felt very safe there with social distancing, hand sanitizer, and everyone wears a mask while shopping at Spec's.  Thank You Spec's!"

Just a pretty great selection of beers in general, but the Deep Ellum - especially when their seasonal cherry chocolate porter hits shelves - will bring me back to this particular Spec's...I can't think of a single place in San Antonio that stocks it.   I've been gravitating lately toward San Anto mom n pop bottle shops (and Dr. Seuss, apparently) - local is better anyway, but mostly because of the option to build-your-own mixed-6... As per the norm with Spec's, that's 100% not an option here (*lame*, Bunny!). There's also no chocolates counter, and their deli consists of a small selection of prepackaged cheeses. Oh yeah, another thing that's lacking: a purse hook in the ladies room. ..Ain't no way I'm setting my junk on the floor, and the fine art of hovering is extra difficult when you're trying not to pee on a crossbody bag AND the toilet seat.  But...  The store is bright/shiny/new, very spacious, and there's tons of parking. I was greeted enthusiastically at the door, and subsequently asked by no less than 3 associates (and not in that annoying \"what are you stealing? Watching you! \" kinda way) if I was finding everything OK. Eye contact and a smile from every passing employee... very welcoming.   On the way to the river, get your Beaver Nuggets across the street, but definitely leave the beer purchase for here."

                "description": "Brandy was the best tour guide! My husband and I booked a tour/tasting for my birthday. Masks are worn and there is a plastic divider inside of the van.  The gentleman at Sister Creek who served our wine did great. Brandy was very knowledgeable, personable, professional and kind. She is a walking wealth of wine/vineyard information. If you're looking to book a tour, short or long, I highly recommend this company! We were given the option for her to provide a little info and just let us vibe or provide us with everything. I love all things wine so I went for it all! I wasn't disappointed. (Btw she took magnificent pictures for us as well)."

                "description": "A few of us from Houston wanted to do a wine tour birthday party for a friend.  Brandy was super accommodating in the reservation process and her husband Matt picked us up the day of at the hotel we were staying at in San Antonio.  He assured us it would be a very different tour from what we're accustomed do and he was right!  He was so knowledgeable that we really enjoyed the tour.    We had shopping time in Fredericksburg and we never felt rushed.  Excellent recovery on their part too when there was a slight hiccup in our reservation and with what was available to tour, he didn't skip a beat.  He  made other arrangements and we continued our tour.  Additionally, I left my iPhone charger in the van and they had it delivered the same day.  One of my girlfriend's left her sunglasses at the Sisters Creek Vineyards and Matt was able to recover the sunglasses and had them mailed the same day.  That's true service!  We would most definitely enjoy doing another tour with Cottonwood Wine Tours in the future and we plan to do so soon."

                "description": "This wine tour was for my niece to celebrate her birthday. I did not expect much but I was not impressed with the timeline, the first winery, the driving, or the mask mandate. To start, we were one of 3 stops and that should have been planned better. One pickup and drop off only. Second, the first winery was not pleasant, friendly, or poured enough wine to have two sips. The second winery was more energy and fun. The driving was a little unsettling. Before ever sipping wine, I felt sick in the van with the disruptive swerving and plowing over bumps. I was uncomfortable with the lack of ventilation as well. While I do not expect a lot for $125 a person, I did expect a fun experience. My recommendation is drive yourself, get a hotel, and not be confined to a timeline, other people, car sickness, or bad wine."

                "description": "What a great tour!  Diane picked our group of six up at our hotel and the adventure began!  We had our first stop at the Saint Tryphon winery, which was the cutest place with an amazingly knowledgeable and friendly staff!! Tres  presented our tastings and was great to talk and listen to.  Our group of six bought several bottles of wine.  We then journeyed to another gorgeous winery with a little less on the customer service.  We gave our feedback immediately to Diane, who said that she would have a discussion with that winery and I believe she will!  Diane then took us into Fredericksburg and pointed out many local establishments.  Throughout the day, Diane provided many facts and tons of information about the area.  She even managed a quick detour to drive by Luckenbach for us!  We chose this company because it is a small business and were very pleased with the personal touches, snack bags, and intimacy of this tour.  We would highly recommend this company for your wine tour adventures!"

                "description": "I met my mom and sister in San Antonio for my mom's 65th birthday.  They came by way of Chicago and I came in from Portland, Oregon.  My sister did all of the research for the trip and found Cottonwood wine tours so we could get out of the city and into the hill country of Texas.  It was a Friday and my mom's actual birthday when Matthew picked us up at the hotel.  Right off the bat he was really cool and laid back.  He had a lot of fun facts about San Antonio as he is from there and the drive out to Sister Creek winery seemed like we were just hanging out with a friend.  Coming from the Willamette valley I have seen plenty of winery's but nothing like this one. It is an old cotton mill turned into a small winery that produces some great Bordeaux varietal blends and even a Pinot Noir!  Matthew was very knowledgeable on the topic of wine and wine making.  After the wine tasting we headed to Luckenbach for some beer and a little live country music. There is a lot of history to this place and we had been there 33 years prior when my sister and I were toddlers.  He told us no rush and let us enjoy this little country music Mecca, he even had the famous song loaded up on his phone when we got back to the car.  We had him take a picture of us that emulated the one that had been taken so many years before.  Next stop was some Texas bbq, like real bbq, he said we couldn't expect any city bbq to be better and I would say he was right!  All in all this tour was awesome, I would have loved to take other tours with Matthew, like the Alamo or some of the other missions but I don't think he offers those yet, maybe an idea?  He was very personable, knowledgeable and friendly.  The type of person you want to be around and I know my mom had a very special birthday because of this tour/guide.  I highly recommend Cottonwood wine tours for any tour they offer in San Antonio, it is run by Matthew, his wife and his mother in-law and I look forward to returning here to see their success!"

Matt picked us up and was super friendly and gave us a lot of information about San Antonio, the winery we were headed to, and was just overall really nice and friendly.  At the first winery at Sister Creek, we switched out with Brandy because she was doing the actual tour we booked, Matt was just doing our pick up. Brandy was super fun and every bit as good as Matt. She took us to another winery, let us walk around Fredericksburg (after some great advice on where to eat), then at the end decided she'd take us by a small local liquor distillery that makes some really cool stuff like jalapeno moonshine!  From start to finish, it was amazing. These two are friendly as can be, very knowledgeable, and nothing felt cookie cutter. They make it feel like a personal experience. I definitely recommend giving Cottonwood Wine Tours a try!"

He was so polite and interesting, genuinely knowledgeable when it came to wine and the Hill Country. After our first winery, we got back into the car to find goody bags with water and snacks waiting for us. He had extra chocolate if we needed it!    I really liked having time to eat and shop in Fredericksburg between drinking. He pointed out suggestions for places to eat or to drink more on Main Street before dropping us off. He even took us to a bonus winery not on the schedule since we were doing so well on time.   I highly recommend Cottonwood. Matt was easy to contact and professional throughout, even when we were all a bit tipsy. He was a very safe driver. Great job."

We were staying in the adorable town of Wimberley so I researched tours in the area.  Jodie's Taste of the Hills Tour got great reviews and went to wineries close to the Wimberley area. The day of the tour ended up being chilly and rainy. As soon as Jodie pulled up with her spectacular shuttle-like van she was out like a flash with pretty umbrellas for us! We went to 3 different wineries which we thoroughly enjoyed! After the first one, we returned to Jodie's vehicle and she had a gorgeous tray for us of cheese,  sausage,  crackers,  grapes,  olives, dips.....simply divine!!! The tour was also just the 2 of us and we loved that Jodie still did ALL of this for a tour that I believe takes up to 12 people! The next time we plan a trip to the Hill Country we are going to do one of Jodie's Beer tours!! We had such great conversations with Jodie too! Thank you sooooo much for the GREAT time! Sooooo much fun!"

Jodie made us all feel like we were old friends, even though we had never met anyone else on the bus.  She was very detailed with the stories of each winery, and explained all the different varietals, answering our every question along the way. The bus was very comfortable and clean, and she stored each bottle we purchased until the trip was over, but we could have had the bottles on the bus had we chosen to.  The wineries all seemed to know her, so they were expecting us and were incredibly friendly. We were not rushed anywhere, and still managed to make it back into town to enjoy shopping on the square.  My wife and I were pretty hungry by the time we had lunch, since we didn't have breakfast, but the tapas style lunch was perfect for the glass of wine we purchased to have with it. The lunch was delicious and filling.  Overall this was an amazing experience and I will be recommending this tour to everyone I know."

Jodie is such a pleasant and inviting soul. She asked about each person's preferences as to be able to personalize the tour and pick which wineries she decided to take us too.  She is very knowledgeable of the town and the wineries.  The lunch she provides is just amazing. By the time we were done I felt like I had made an incredible new friend. I can't wait to go back and do more tours."

She knew all the best places to go. The picnic lunch she provided was amazing. I wouldn't change a thing about today. I would love to bring some friends and do it all over again."

She has an extensive knowledge of wines, the wineries, the towns, etc. Our favorite part was lunch because of the views and the wonderful spread that was provided for us. I highly recommend this tour and in fact will probably we doing it again, soon, I hope."

                "description": "Perfect - the highlight of our trip!  Jodie was the best, most fun, knowledgeable and coordinator.  We went to Driftwood, Duchman and Fall Creek Vineyards.  We were fortunate enough to have great people touring with us, and it made the tour all the more fun.  She prepared the best picnic lunch I've ever had.  Sugar Shack cake balls, meats, cheeses, crackers, hummus, a goat cheese something served on crackers (that I LOVED, and I hate goat cheese), spinach feta rolls, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something.  She was fully prepared for everything.  Boxes for the wine we bought, umbrellas in case in rained (it didn't), plenty of water...this wine tour couldn't have been more perfect if she tried.  Thanks, Jodie!"

She provided an excellent variety of foods including a hot portion and gluten-free (just in time `cause I was lit after the 1st vineyard). The three vineyards for that day were selected based on the wine preferences of the tourists that day (A+ perk). We never felt pushed or obligated to buy wines, but we all did because they were very good (!), and Jodie kept our purchases organized and stored for us. She also gave a good background on each vineyard and on the Wimberley area in general. We learned a lot about Wimberley and wine and were able to get tipsy knowing Jodie was an excellent driver of her comfy bus. And have you been to Wimberley? That hilly countryside is beautiful!"

Our tour was originally scheduled for 10:30a, but got pushed back to 1:15p due to shuttle trouble (we had the option to receive our money back, but actually liked the later time).  We stopped at three wineries, including Driftwood Estate and Duchman Family Winery.  The views at all of the wineries varied, but each were unique to their locations.  Jodie provided an amazing picnic-style lunch, including a charcuterie (meat and cheese) board, chicken salad, nuts, walnut and feta salad, grapes, chocolate cake balls, bottled water, etc. At the second stop, Jodie was kind enough to call in people's orders to Salt Lick BBQ and had it all ready to take home by the third stop.  We can't wait to return again!"

She gave us a lot of background information on the wineries as well as the town of Wimberley. She had a delicious assortment of snacks for us to munch on while we rode to and from each winery. She helped package our wine purchases and brought us umbrellas as it started to rain. She even went the extra mile, literally, and drove us back to our hotel since it was raining as we had walked to our meeting spot earlier in the day. We had another couple on the tour with us which was really nice since we had people to mingle with. It was a very personal experience and I felt as though we were all just great friends spending an afternoon together. Who needs Napa, everything is better in Texas!!! We will definitely be repeat customers."

He picked us up from our Airbnb and drove us 45 mins out and back, while we blasted some rachet songs to sing haha. He would check in on us during the winery to see if we needed anything or have any questions, and he would offer to help us take multiple pictures. He also got one of the wineries to allow us to explore their cellars!   On our last day in Austin, he drove by our airbnb to pick up someone else and honked at us as we waited for our uber. We were all so happy to see him again, as we all enjoyed our experience with him.   I recommend Texas Tipsy Tours with Arlen ;)"

They do all the heavy lifting with the friendliest spirit and let you and your group have the time of your life!  We had the BEST time on our tour and absolutely adore Arlen, our driver! He was the kindest, most considerate, thoughtful, responsible driver ever! He was so fun but also let us have our time to just be girls and we didn't have to open a single door, make a decision, or carry a single bag (if we didn't want to) the whole time we were with Arlen!  Also, the management team was incredible. Wei booked last minute and they were so accommodating and listened to our unique needs/wants for the tour! And we're so detailed in instructions. I have had bad experiences with wine/bus tours with other companies and I was SO impressed with the whole experience at Texas tipsy!"

From the minute I called to book to the minute I said goodbye to our driver the day of the tour they were fantastic.   So when I called there actually weren't any times available. They worked with me to make sure they had a tour time and sprinter available for our group of 6. I had a million questions; they were patient and kind.   Our group was 6 but one of my friends asked if we could add an additional person. Reached out to TTT and they said sure no problem. Literally 3 HOURS LATER I got a call that another girl tested positive with covid and wouldn't be able to come with us obviously- they were so nice and made the switch back to 6. Very grateful for their exceptional customer service.   Day of our driver Bryant was early which was great! Got on the bus and let us have free range of the radio, answered any wine questions we had or any questions about Fredericksburg. He was a fantastic host. Always texted 15 minutes till our time at the winery was up and took as many pictures as we wanted. He was so sweet! He also made sure we were never thirsty or hungry. Which for a group of girls is very important- smart man! Haha   I've heard things about other companies having hidden fees and people getting charges after leaving Fredericksburg and we had none of that. Texas Tipsy Tours was very transparent with all of their pricing and they had no hidden fees.   Thank you TTT for making our trip perfect. You won't regret booking with them."

                "description": "My experience with Texas Tipsy tours was nothing short of perfect!!! From pickup to drop-off, Courtney (the owner) made our experience amazing! When I initially started inquiring about a tour a few months ago, many of the companies only offered private tours for a minimum of 4 people. However, Texas Tipsy Tours offers small group private tours (i.e. 2-3 people). This was perfect for me. She also made planning our trip so easy, and she promptly answered all of the questions I had.   On the day of the tour, she picked us up from our hotel in Austin in an Infiniti SUV (it was very clean too)! She even made a pit stop for me at a CVS on the way to our first winery. Throughout the 6 hour tour, she made sure we stayed on schedule. She even let us change a stop last minute because we wanted to check out a brewery!  One thing that was amazing was the comfort she provided! She allowed us to pick the music, provided phone chargers, and let us control the AC! She even opened our doors for us AND dropped us off/picked us up right in front of each place we went!  Overall, I highly recommend Texas Tipsy Tours, and I will definitely be back!"

It was as easy as getting on the phone, explaining what I wanted, and Courtney took care of literally everything else. We picked the breweries we wanted and even included a food stop. She coordinated the bus pick up, drop offs, schedule, and even reserved tables for us at each stop. I love that we had our own bus (very nice one, by the way!), and had the flexibility to create our own tour based on beers and food my husband liked. It was the perfect Saturday in Austin!

I have taken quite a few van tours around the hill country and Texas Tipsy Tours sets themselves apart by not just being drivers but they truly host you the entire day. I will ALWAYS use this company going forward. We did a private charter from Driftwood to Austin, TX and back and Keaton our driver was a delight. He made sure we were picked up on time and each of our stops were easy and flexible. We did a mixed tour around Driftwood and Dripping springs the next day and our guide Eric executed the BEST DAY for us. He even picked up on what we were liking and recommended a change to our final stop to Vista Brewing and we were SO glad he did. At each stop he made sure we had plenty of water, snacks and chairs to enjoy the gorgeous venues. This is totally above and beyond what we would have expected from a driver. Courtney was so easy to work with and she helped make recommendations for our group ultimately making our weekend get away FLAWLESS. I promise if you don't use this company, you're wrong."

Would highly recommend if you're looking for a relaxed tasting without the hubbub of big party buses, AND if you're looking for a more personalized experience with people who can really throw a party. Fredericksburg can be confusing because of the many, many options, so Courtney's expertise in the wineries proved incredibly helpful. Highly recommend!!"

We selected the premium wine tour and stopped at 3 wineries and picked up lunch at Hye Market.  The entire experience was well thought out and planned thoroughly.  Courtney is one of the owners and helped me figure out which wineries to taste.  Keaton was our driver and he was great!  I would definitely recommend this tour company."

I did not have a lot of information on the distilleries and Daniel was incredibly helpful when figuring out where we should go. We had 19 people on the bus and we had SO much fun. The bus was super clean, Daniel was great and we had the best time. We originally had the bus for 5 hours but Daniel was nice enough to let us add an additional hour to our trip for just a small charge. I would recommend ThunderDome Party Bus to anyone.   We definitely want to plan another trip in the summertime to go floating.  Thanks Daniel!!!"

The stereo system was bumping, and Daniel, our amazing driver, had no issue with us turning it up to 11.  Our group was most guys in their 30's and Daniel gave us good recommendations on spots to check out that were age appropriate.  In between spots, Daniel drove me to a gas station to help me restock on beer. He even came in and helped me carry and load beers into the coolers.  Great communicate from Daniel from beginning to end, and he someone found the perfect spot to pick us up on busy Rainey St at the end of the night.   Great value and great experience.  Highly recommend."

                "description": "Looking to experience great Hill Country wines and barbecue - we had both taking Winding Road Wine Tours Salt Lick Sunday Wine Tour.  The tour picked us up in Gruene in a new luxury bus at 10:30. We were greeted by the tour owner Billy Martin.  The bus was very comfortable with a u shaped seating arrangement and a table in the aisle.  Should seat around 12 people comfortably. The bus has a great sound system that is Bluetooth enabled - Billy played whatever we wanted from sources such as Pandora and Napster music service. First stop was Driftwood Estate Winery. Driftwood has perhaps the best winery views in the Hill Country.  I really enjoyed the reds and came away with a bottle of Longhorn Red to enjoy at our next stop Salt Lick Barbecue. Yes, Salt Lick is byob. It was beginning to rain and Billy dropped us off near the check in stand. He's thought of his customer's needs providing us large golf umbrellas. It was busy with people waiting to be seated. However, he got us seated right away. Our final two wineries were Fall Creek right across the street from Salt Lick and then Wimberley Valley Winery. Fall Creek has solid wines and the service for our group was outstanding. Wimberley Valley Winery was an unexpected pleasure. Their tasting room is roomy and comfortable with plenty room at the tasting bars and a comfortable seating area facing a large stone fireplace. They have a variety of wines bottled on site along with other wines from around the world. The grounds were spectacular with numerous large shaded decks to enjoy a glass or bottle as you wrap up your tour.  What a great Sunday drinking Texas wines, eating Texas barbecue and meeting new friends!"

There were 7 of us on a family vacation trip and we wanted to have a fun but classy wine tour where we got our money's worth and then some. As a new resident to the area, it's important for me to know what high quality tour guides are available. Well, Winding Road Hill Country Wine Tours with Billy is definitely the way to go, folks."

The vineyards selected by Billy are great - wonderful grounds and fantastic wines.  Billy (great guy) is well known at the vineyards and ensures you get great service and a great spot at the tasting bar.  The charcuterie board for lunch in conjunction with a tasting in a private room was very special.  All-in- all just a wonderful experience.  Highly recommend this tour.  I understand he also conducts craft beer and spirits tours (next time)"

                "description": "Planned a surprise Bachelorette weekend for my close friend this past November.  Throwing a surprise weekend is stressful enough but Woody was SUPER accommodating especially for being so last minute.  There were many tours that I could've chosen to stick with but Woody was so authentic about his services and was a person of integrity when it came to what he offered.  He personally picked us up from our little hotel we were staying at and drove us to all three of our tours. His tour bus was super clean and we all had a blast! He even offered to pick up some cheese and snacks at the HEB close by to have on the bus if we wanted! I really appreciated Woody taking the time to answer my numerous phone calls with questions I had as this is my first Bachelorette party I threw.  I HIGHLY recommend using Woody if anyone wants to have a great time and looking for someone to trust. I will be booking with you again Woody, thank you so much for everything!"

If you come across Fredericksburg Uncorked Wine Tours, stop your search and make the booking.   Organizing a wine tour for 18 girls as part of a bachelorette party was a breeze with Woody, the owner/operator of Uncorked. He gave great advice, offered competitive pricing (especially for the expectant mothers/non-drinkers in our group), and was easy to communicate with. Woody was incredibly patient during the lead up to our tour, and then was a funny, gracious, and attentive guide during our wine tasting experience.   Our tour was fantastic from start to finish, and I can't recommend Woody and the rest of the Fredericksburg Uncorked team highly enough. All (18) of us had the greatest time!"

I called him Friday morning at 8:50 hoping I'd get a call back before the 10 am tour and I did ten min later and I was able to get on his first tour . I honestly called three or 4 more tours throughout the week and left messages and he is the only one that called me back. Not only did woody come through, he came through at the last minute when I thought We weren't going to make a tour.  He was funny , knowledgeable and overall a great guide. He even recommended a few things that weren't apart of the tour (Alamo Springs Cafe) which we ended up going to and was delicious.  Lunch was not included but the place we went to was pretty great for a sandwich . I'd hang out and grab a beer with woody any night !  Thank you for making my boyfriends birthday a good one !!"

I was upset and apparently he was too so he threw customer service out the window. I never agreed to Woody keeping my credit card information on file after he charged the wine tour for 11 girls (almost $1,300).   The driver Tommy was nice but he did nothing special and didn't know the basics of Woody's business. Had he known even a little bit about Uncorked Tours, there wouldn't have been confusion about lunch.   As far as the wine tour: William Chris and Lost Draw were my favorite wineries. Hye Market pretended we weren't there half of the time. Pontotoc was greedy with their pours.   Woody was very unprofessional and difficult to work with at the end. I would not recommend him. Book early to get the highest rated wine tours (2-3 months prior)!"

He was quick to respond and helped me schedule a party bus big enough for all of us. David, our driver, showed up early and made sure we had everything we needed for the trip. He had a giant cooler with ice and waters that we were able to load up with seltzers. I booked our wineries ahead of time which made getting into the tastings a breeze. David made sure we got to each winery on time and went in ahead to ensure each winery was ready for us when we arrived. He even coordinated to have the band at one of the wineries sing Happy Birthday! David was absolutely fantastic, and we had a great time with him. We will definitely be booking with them again for our next trip. I highly recommend Open Range Tours to anyone visiting Fredericksburg!"

                "description": "\"Double Pimp D\" aka David was absolutely phenomenal.  We had a group of 13 in San Antonio go wine tasting in fberg for the day.  He picked us up from San Antonio, drove us up to Hill Country and around to 3 wineries.  As this was my first Texas wine tour, he did an AMAZING job of helping us select which wineries would be a good fit for the group.  As we had a decent amount of guys with us- he suggest Garrison Brother's Distillery which ended up being a HUGE hit!  He was extremely professional, courteous and just an absolute delight to spend the day with!  He also has a wicked funny sense of humor.  He was also very accommodating and ordered and picked up lunch for us so we could continue to enjoy beautiful Hill Country.  I would use him again in heartbeat and highly, highly recommend him to anyone wanting to enjoy Texas Hill Country!  Thanks David!"

                "description": "Do NOT recommend! We booked a tour for 8 people and everything was a mess from the beginning. We were told we would be upgraded to a 15 passenger bus. A 15 passenger VAN showed up with a dent in the side and ripped seats. We were told we could bring coolers. We were only able to fit 8 adults in the van with our two coolers- no way we could've had another person in the van. None of the wineries had been scheduled yet and the ONE we had specifically requested was not available. We had to scramble ourselves to find wineries, in which we were promised everything would be done ahead of time. The meat and cheese tray that was promised was a small tray that was bought during the tour at a convenient store to feed 2 people. Our driver was great, however the owner did not deliver what was promised and we were highly disappointed. There are plenty of companies to choose from, and I would NOT recommend Open Range."

D'Ann was extremely responsive and gave me several suggestions of where to go. Since I'm a wine club member at quite a few wineries in the Hill Country, I opted to do a custom tour and made my own reservations. Greg, the owner (and D'Ann's husband) arrived on time and drove us to 3 wineries where we were able to enjoy a nice, relaxing afternoon. Greg was so friendly, helpful and accommodating. I would highly recommend Open Range Tours...thanks, D'Ann and Greg!!!"

They know a lot about the wineries and have personal relationships with the owners/managers/tasting staff.

                "description": "We went to Fredericksburg for a girls trip and wanted to spend a day at the distilleries and breweries. David was fantastic to work with planning everything out. I wouldn't have changed any of that part. But, once the day rolled around we were met with a hiccup. The driver, not David like I was anticipating after multiple conversations, arrived in a mustang for 5 of us. Obviously that wasn't going to work so I was offered by the driver only to cancel or reschedule. Our trip was planned around spending our day out and about so cancelling wasn't an option for us. After a phone call to David, we were assured our day wasn't ruined just a bit delayed. The driver left and showed back up with an SUV and away we went. The driver wasn't interactive and she didn't seem to even be having a good day... It happens I get it but come on. Anyway, we made the best of our day and enjoyed ourselves. When we were dropped off, I tried to pay but she said to get with David. No problem but I did have a problem with her then saying that she'd go ahead and take the gratuity and that the standard is 20%. I didn't even know what our total cost was to figure 20% but asking for the gratuity before I even paid for the day was in poor taste. We did go ahead and tip, and well mind you, because that's the kind of people we are. I ended up calling David and finishing out the transaction and once again, he was a pleasure to deal with. Overall, we'll use them again because I appreciated David that much. But, I'll definitely make sure we don't have the same driver. 5 stars for David but 4 stars overall for the above mentioned."

Sam, the owner and driver, was unbelievable. Very accommodating, great driver, and super chill.   We planned to hit up the Salt Lick on the party bus and then venture around to some breweries afterwards. Sam made sure that the group got where we needed to be on time, had great suggestions for breweries, and made sure we were having as much fun as possible.  The bus is great. Fit everyone comfortably with enough room for a cooler in between all of us. Sam had her playlist turned up or she would hand over the AUX cord and we could play our tracks as loud as we wanted. The whole experience was incredibly laid back and worry free. I would absolutely recommend Cool bus ATX to anyone that wants to have a great time with a big group in Austin.   On a side note, if it is Sunday, make sure that you buy beer on Saturday because they don't sell it on Sunday before noon.   Thanks again, Sam!"

We originally had 5 ladies who were going on the tour with us and one backed out. We didn't ask for a private tour and John (who I'm guessing is the owner) didn't tell us until we were already at the first location that he would stop the tour until we paid for a fifth person that wasn't there. No wonder he kept pushing cash, it was a complete rip off. It was either go home after that tour paying $125 a person..Or have two more tours while paying for a person who wasn't there. PS it's about $15 for the wine tastings. ($15x3=$45) It was not worth it. On a positive note, Gary at Hanhe Estates winery was amazing. Highly recommend this guy and his wine."

We were picked up and then drove for 45 minutes without our driver, John, saying a word about where we were going or how long it would take to get there. He then picked up 3 other people when it was supposed to be a private tour. He took us to the wineries but never said a word about where to go or what to do. He followed us around at the wineries and sat with us. He was 30 minutes late then forgot what the schedule was supposed to be and tried to keep us at the 2nd winery until 30 minutes after we were supposed to be home. He told us we could pay with cash or card, but he only actually took cash or PayPal, which put some people in a real bind. He hounded us about payment the whole time.

                "description": "I rented a party bus through this company a couple weeks ago. In the beginning, Robert was extremely accommodating and friendly. And our driver, Terrell, was great. We got dropped off at COTA for a show and had a great time!  But where it turned south was at the end of the night. I texted our driver 30 minutes before we needed to be picked up (like he requested) and he said no problem. Then we left the concert and were walking to the pickup spot where I gave him a call. He said he got in an accident but would only be 20 minutes and I said that's fine. 20 minutes roll by and I gave him a call again, no answer, but texted and said it would be another 20 minutes. We ended up waiting in the cold for almost an hour and well after most people had left COTA. Multiple people in our party ended up just taking ubers because they didn't want to wait. The whole point of a bus is so you don't have to wait.  The next day, I texted Robert saying we would like a refund for the extra hour we paid for waiting that we wouldn't have used if we had been picked up on time. He said he would call to discuss but never did. I've now sent him multiple emails - mind you, being incredibly nice about it. All I asked for was an hour refunded back - not the whole thing, not even half. But still no response.  The customer service level of this company is terrible should anything go wrong. So hire them at your own risk."

                "description": "Apologies for this review being so incredibly late but Austin Nites was the best! We had rented a party bus on pretty short notice to take a Bachelor Party to and from Lake Travis and Robert and team were amazing.   It was also Prom weekend so the schedule was packed for them but they still took care of us and worked with our schedule.   Our boat ended up staying out on the water longer than scheduled which through our plans all over the place and Robert was there waiting on time. Given his packed schedule, the driver did have to leave without us but Robert made sure to get me in contact with another service and they sent a bus over right away.   All in all, it was an incredible experience!"

Missing panels inside of bus missing or duct tape together.  Another party bus parked next to the one we had and it was so obvious how terrible looking our bus looked.   Can't believe owners would let this bus represent their company. Hope they use our $700 toward getting it fixed.   Driver was pleasant."

But how is that supposed to work when you have a huge group? I called austin nites party rentals for a few reasons 1. I love puns and 2. I'm am austinite and 3. My group was over ten people and we wanted to go out and have nothing to worry about. Great party bus, great personable driver, great experience definitely reccomend these guys!! DONT DRINK AND DRIVE!! Call someone you can trust call Austin Nites!!"

                "description": "I'm incredibly frustrated with this business.  We had spoken a couple times in the months before I decided to book and I initially felt great about potentially booking with these friendly people.  When it came time to book I called them and was told, once again, that our requested date was open and we talked out an agreement.  The owner tells me we're good to go, and that all he needed me to do now was to send him my information so that he could get a contract sent that same day.  I'd explained to him that I was booking this bus ride to and from a party boat, and that I would be booking with them that day as well.   SO, I get off the phone and send my info.  I call my party boat folks to let them know I've just confirmed my bus, and I'm ready for a boat.  I book with them based on my discussion with these guys and put down $400 to hold our reservation.  It's been two weeks since I last spoke with this company and they have ignored my calls, texts, voicemails trying to figure out why the contract hasn't come through.  Our event is next month, and at this point I've been researching new solutions, and unfortunately the new solution means I can't use the same boat company, and therefore I've lost my $400 deposit.  I did not have this money to lose, but after being ghosted by this company I guess I have to take the loss and move on.  They seem like nice people, and it takes A LOT to get on here and write a negative review, but this has caused me a lot of stress and I want to prevent this from happening to anyone else.  I hope at some point I find out a reasonable explanation and can revise this review, but not counting on it.  We'll see I guess."

                "description": "BOOK WITH THIS COMPANY!  Robert did a solid job taking me and a bunch of my friends to Lake Travis and back on July 4th. His price was WAY lower than other companies I called, being the ONLY one that actually sticked to his regular prices during this busy day. He arrived early and was 100% responsive to my emails and phone calls. He arrive early to pick us up and was extremely friendly and professional. He helped us carry our coolers and accommodate everything on the bus.  The bus itself is amazing. Seats are stacked in two rows facing each other, which is great for dancing and socializing, since you are actually facing half of the crowd. The sound system is also very good. I almost feel that the bus trip was even more fun that the boat.   In summary, Austin Nites Ent. is the best on price/quality, Robert and his wife are responsive, professional and friendly, and the whole experience I had with them is positive. Would highly recommend anyone to use it, and will definitely consider using them again if I ever need to.  Thank you guys!!!!!"

                "description": "We rented a party bus from Robert for my brother's 30th birthday. They were one of the only companies I found that didn't increase their rates because of prom season. I called about 10 other companies looking for fun and safe travels with almost all of them being ridiculously overpriced to take advantage of the prom goers. Robert was very accommodating, professional, and had awesome rates. He called two days before the scheduled time of arrival to check in and verify everything was still good to go. He asked if there were any changes in the amount of people and offered a bigger bus just in case. Our drivers, Patrick and Joe were awesome! Patrick called me early the day of to verify everything and let me know he'd be there at 8 and then called again when they were almost to our pickup location. They arrived right on time with an awesome bus just for us. He had coolers with ice, a flat screen tv, music system, AC and even a bathroom in the back. What more could you ask for? Part of the evening was spent at Graham's Central Station in Pville. We didn't realize prior that Graham's doesn't serve food anymore and had to order pizza to the bus. Patrick gladly retrieved our pizza and brought it to us when it arrived. We all had a blast, felt safe and were taken care of. Highly recommend Austin NItes and shout out to Patty PartyWagon, if you had a Yelp page, I'd write a review for you too."

The transportation (van) was very clean and well-taken care of. We had the van to ourselves on the couple's tour but it can easily fit a big party!  Booking a couple's wine tour on their website was super easy (and I'm sure it would be for big groups too)! The date availability, cost estimate, and customizability is spot-on. The moment you book, they send you a comprehensive list of wineries and distilleries (!!!) with rankings of the view + wine. They also have great options for add-ons, such as a charcuterie board or stopping by for lunch mid-wine tour. Love that.  There's no doubt I would choose and recommend 830 Elevated again for any future wine excursions in Hill Country. Thanks again, Brayden and Deb :)"

From start to finish everything was so easy and customizable to what we were looking for while planning our annual girls trip. Prices are incomparable with Five Star treatment on a PRIVATE tour. Right after booking we got an email with a list of the area wineries and restaurants that had notes and ratings so we could choose where we wanted to go. This is a private tour so Brayden picked us up right in front of our Airbnb and we were off. We toured four wineries and he kept us on schedule but never rushing us. After the tours we opted for the night service so he dropped us off on Main Street so we could grab dinner, sing some karaoke and when ready to be picked up to end the evening just had to shoot him a text and he was there. We just cannot say enough good things about this company. Do not second guess - book with Brayden and Deb"

I believe they were on the city website as a recommended tour, but also Google directed me to them. Either way, I am so glad it happened this way - our experience with 830 was indeed elevated!!! The customized tour that Deb set up with me over the phone was exactly what my husband and I wanted - a distillery, a brewery, and a winery that made you feel like you were in Napa. Without even knowing us, Deb helped picked the perfect places for us to enjoy. Communication up until the tour and the day of the tour was prompt and courteous, always with our best intentions in mind (example: Deb texted us and offered to pick us up even earlier than planned due to the heat at one of the outdoor locations). The drive in between locations was full of great conversation, and we were thankful they provided cold water for us. The van was immaculate and the drive was very comfortable - I didn't know the luxury that a private vs public tour would offer! Deb was so knowledgeable (she's a local, of course!) and so sweet with helping us newbies figure out what to do. Her service went above and beyond, and she made us feel like celebrities. It was an absolute pleasure to work with them - do yourself the best favor and book with them!!"

                "description": "I like their hustle. Wife and I wanted a private custom tour (because COVID). But the best we could find was a limo driver that would charge us almost what it would for 4 people. Then we found 830 Elevated. They're filling a niche most tour companies aren't by providing an affordable private tour option for couples. They were great. Small, young company. They don't have deep knowledge on wine like veteran companies but they are personable in that they also tour wineries themselves and can share their inputs."

                "description": "The worst experience. Here's my story-   I booked with this company over a month in advance prior to my trip to Fredericksburg for my fiancé and I's anniversary, as well as his birthday. After booking, the company was very communicative for the first few days. After the first few days, I did not hear a word from them until the week of our trip. I had told them a month in advance which places we wanted to go. The week of, they inform us that Augusta vin is not taking people for reservations. Which was fine, we went ahead with the other vineyard they had suggested. We had booked for a Saturday. That Friday at 3:00AM, they had informed us of a change of driver due to a family emergency which we completely understood, and now that our pickup time had changed to 11:30AM instead of 1:30PM. I wake up to that email Saturday still understanding, and we changed our plans to be at the pickup destination by 11:30AM. We are waiting there over 15 minutes for them to show, and no one does. We call, leave voicemails, and still hear from no one. 30 minutes passed, they send a TEXT MESSAGE informing us they aren't showing up for the entire time and that we are on our own for the entire day. LEAVING OUR PLANS FOR THE ENTIRE DAY RUINED. Incredibly horrid communication from this company. DO NOT BOOK WITH THIS COMPANY!!!! I seriously am understanding that situations happen in life, but they had guaranteed us a driver for the day regardless of what had happened. I was truly heartbroken to have not received a personal phone call from the company, instead they just send us a text that they are not coming. I have NEVER written a review for a company before, but this needed to be shared. We discussed the situation with multiple locals in the town, no one had ever heard of this company. Whatever you do, save your money and time."

                "description": "My husband and Mom decided to stop and do a wine tasting today $4 for 4 flavors which in my opinion is a steal. You could take the glass home for an extra $2 if you wanted which had their logo on the side.  We've had a really hard time finding wine we like in Texas and I believe we finally did.  They said that every flavor they tried was smooth, balanced, and the fruit flavors actually resembled the fruit they were supposed to be.  They're both still talking about the lil cranberry flavor and the blackberry flavor. Crisp and refreshing were the words I heard coming out of their mouths multiple times.  Prices for their bottles are well worth it at about $16 for the reds and $12 for the fruit flavors. They had a deal today where you got a discount if you purchased 3 or more bottles of wine so of course we had to splurge.  Even being pregnant, the staff was super nice to me and included me even though I couldn't drink. We talked about mixing wine flavors to make interesting combos and wines we thought I would like once I could drink again.  Great experience, will definitely be returning."

If you've been to Gruene you know parking can be a little bit of a nightmare, that is why we love to come to this place since they have their own parking and is also located near the entrance to the town. They have both indoor and outdoor seating, with a cute little garden which is great for photos during spring. They have a decent selection of wines, which you can purchase by the glass or a bottle. If you are hungry, they also have a BBQ food truck but is not always open. Last but no least, if you are parent searching for a changing table, this is not the place for you. We had to change our baby inside our car, which was a little annoying since it was 90+ degrees outside."

They're right on the Guadalupe River in downtown historic Gruene TX. If you're having a bridal party, etc. this is an ideal spot with great social distancing and a recently added BBQ Food Truck. I'm not giving it more stars because 1) they're not growing grapes and 2) I'm really not impressed with their products BUT I don't like sweet wines which they specialize in from the looks of their menu. Their service was impeccable and quick and attentive even though it was a busy Saturday. Dog and kid friendly. Cheese and crackers available."

I gave her a $5 tip on a $5 glass of wine. She poured it in a plastic cup and I asked for a glass. She told me a wine glass would be $2 additional. OK! I just gave you a $100% tip, not happening.  Only reason this place is getting an additional star is bc the hostess was sweet. Don't waste your time on this place, it's crap. Also, be prepared to wear a mask and not get good service."

                "description": "Recall when I said I had reviews in my drafts? Ughs, this one is from 2018 (don't judge me).   Winery on the Gruene is a small 'boutique' style winery that makes vino on the premise. There are a variety of vino's to sample at a reasonable price (4 tastings for only $4.00). If you know what you want and are a true vino drinker like me, you can 'go for it' and just order a glass (Vino Blanco in my case, $5.00 per glass; see my receipt).  The vino selection here is decent and the customer service is even better. The only facet about this location that is not great is the lack of room inside when you go for a tasting. However, if you have time to come here and have a glass of vino while you sit outside and enjoy a nice spring day, you will not be sorry.   Happy Drinking!"

Pictured is the wine-a-rita, mix your favorite wine with a frozen margarita mix. These wines are seriously delicious. I'm usually not into fruity wines, but these are done right and are amazing. The employees are super friendly and it's a good time every time we go. There's even a bbq food truck in the parking lot if you get hungry!  Dog friendly patio, with some more secluded picnic benches if you'd like. Highly recommend!"

                "description": "Wow, how have I not written a review about Winery on the Gruene?! It's like my best friend's favorite place to go in Gruene so I've actually been so many times... We've been visiting since they were at the original location down the street like ten years ago in one of the new strip centers on the outskirts of the little village of Gruene! Winery on the Gruene got lucky when this location became available, right in the center of Gruene!  Winery on the Gruene is located just up the hill from Guadalupe River about a block west of Gruene Hall. Great location, easy to find. Lots of room to sit inside or out. There is even space upstairs to sit or rent out for private parties.  All the staff have always been amazing... Thank you! That is always one of the reasons to go back to any business.   Winery on the Gruene is not a vineyard. Most grapes are not from Texas. Maybe not even any. That is my only complaint as I like to keep my wines local, although that is what works for these guys. They are not limited in their creations. They purchase grapes from all across the country to make their wines. They have a large selection on their menu, so you will find something you like. Winery on Gruene specializes in these sweet fruity wines, which is one of the reasons why my bestie LOVE them!  My favorite is Blackberrry Merlot. On my last visit for Tami C.'s birthday surprise, that is all I had... no need to sample, just give me a big full glass and I'll be a happy camper!   Yeah, you  know I'll be back for some of that Blackberry Merlot!"

Very charming staff and was helpful on wine tasting. We choose four wines to taste from their menu and have different emo fave on what we thought of the wine. I must say the tasting serving are healthy pour and provide the opportunity to enjoy a little more of each wine.  For me most of the wine was somewhat sweet and berry tasting as the Merlot wine has a hint of sweet berry. Reminded me of when I was had my first drink of Boonesfarm wine but not that sweet...lol.  Charming with that modern industrial farm decor.  I would come back to just sit on the porch with glass of vino. Cheers."

                "description": "Totally chill relaxing place to enjoy some wine with friends.  Nestled back among the oak trees off 46, this place is a little gem.  Patio has a view of the vineyard, and when the weather cools off there is nothing better than sitting under the trees enjoying the fire pits. Community tables make for great conversation and an easy way to meet people when new to the area. Check Facebook for date nights and various events. To really get the feel for this spot, it's best to go when there is a band and food trucks.   Experienced friendly staff really make this place stand out. I don't know much about wine so staff was great about helping me select an excellent \"Wurst Red\" wine. This place probably deserves a 5 star for good time, but I lowered it to 4 since seating indoors is limited.   And chairs on the patio are not very comfortable. I will certainly update my review if changes are made. Would love to see some comfy coffee house style couches indoors to make it more comfortable.   Pro Tip:  Order the red or white frozen sangria. It is the BOMB!!  Tastes like a fruit slushy in the most delicious way."

We didn't realize we needed a reservation until after we arrived, but the sweet lady at the entrance helped us make a reservation so we could get seated. The outdoor seating was very spread out, and there was a lot of shade from all the large trees. Our server helped us choose a bottle, and brought us any sample we wanted before purchasing a bottle. The wine was so good we left with a couple bottles to bring home. The pricing is very affordable ($20-$30 a bottle). I would highly recommend visiting this gem near New Braunfels."

My fiancee and I have come out here several times on a motorcycle ride to enjoy the peaceful surroundings and get away from the traffic in the city. We love their frozen sangria and the Comal Red. They offer a plastic boot for $20 that they fill with their delicious frozen Sangria. Bring the boot back and refills are only $10!   The staff here are so nice and helpful too. On our last visit we were going to each have a glass of wine and the lady told us for a few dollars more we could buy the whole bottle. You don't have to tell me twice! Grab a seat outside, either by one of the many oak trees, or under the shaded pavilion and enjoy the beautiful surroundings."

They are dog friendly too. I really appreciated the hospitality of the servers, who were kind enough to give the hubby our tasting outside since we had the pup. We ended up getting the cheese plate (which was yummy) and ordered two glasses of wine. We also bought a bottle of rose for the road. Great spot!"

                "description": "Very quaint and peaceful winery. There is a gift shop, indoor seating as well as outdoor seating (in the shade and in the sun). There are a bunch of wines to sample as well as one champagne and their famous sangria slush (my favorite).  The ladies are so helpful with the samplings and very knowledgable about the wines and where the grapes come from (not all can be grown on site due to certain bugs and climate reasons). I was very intrigued that they decanter their wine when you buy a bottle. I have always heard of this but have never seen a place do it. We were able to taste a wine before and after decantering and WOA what a difference!! I'm not sure why more places don't do this  This is a fun place to get away to with the country feel and relaxing atmosphere."

                "description": "So this was an absolute lovely vineyard.  We really liked the grounds, the out door gazebo and the building.  The furniture made of wine barrels was really nice.  We paid 15.00 for these really tiny tastes. We didn't really like their wines and do not enjoy sweet wines. We ended getting 3 glasses of their Sangiovese. Total bill was over 50.00.  This was pricy for a tasting and 3 glasses.  Normally if you end up buying glasses most wineries don't charge especially if the tasting pours were so non committing I don't think we even got through our tasting before deciding just to buy full glasses. So you should Be a little more generous with your pours if you are going to charge 15.00.  You all need something a little dryer and bolder."

                "description": "I love this vineyard. Just picked up the 2017 Foot pressed red wine. It is not available to the public but available to those that participated in last years stomping event. People are very friendly and outgoing. The different wines are delicious. I like all of the reds, especially the Black Spanish Dark Red Lenoir 2012 Reserve , which has a nice bold berry flavorI am not a fan of white wines but their French Colombard is amazing. It is a great light summer wine that is soft, fruity and mellow and so is the Spanish black and white wine. The vineyard is a great place for weddings and parties. It is a very quiet and restful place."

                "description": "This store/wine local is in the center of Gruene. It is across from Gruene Hall and Mozies restaurant.  The store is filled w wine glasses and coasters (other items relating to wine) w funny quotes. They have a very large variety of wine that they sell by the glass and by the bottle.  We got 2 glasses of their \"best seller\", the Texas Southwind Blackberry Wine and one of my friends bought a bottle ($29) bc she loved it so much. Each \"glass\" was $9 and it came in a small plastic cup. I have an eye for a serving of wine and this was DEFINITELY short. Our cup wasn't even HALF way full.  Unfortunately, they do not do offer Wine Flights. I'm not sure why. This could be such a great addition to their business. They have a huge variety of wine. It'd be nice to try 4-5 wines and then be able to buy a bottle (or 3 ) of your favorite wines to take home w you. IMO, they are hurting their business by not offering flights. If we had been able to try more wines and not have to pay so much for each tiny glass just to TRY the wine, I'm sure our group would've walked out w more than one bottle.   There is a small courtyard next to the store where you could just sit and drink if you wanted to. There were numerous dogs w their owners. (So, dog friendly! ) We chose to walk around w our tiny glasses  and find a place w live music. (and find a place that offered wine flights...lol)"

It's covered with trees so mostly shaded but I thought it was really cool that they had misting fans going for muggy hot days like today.  If you're in town and want to hang out with the girls or spend time with your significant other, this would be an amazing place to come and try something new while relaxing.  Everything was also labeled: sweet, red, white, rosé, and even organic. I didn't know organic wine was a thing but apparently it is and they have it.   The guy working today was not the nicest. He barely said anything and didn't really help us out much. It seemed like he didn't want to be there."

We visited on a Saturday, which it wasnt too busy, and enjoyed people watching while waiting for a table to become available at the Gristmill.  I enjoyed the frozen sangria and my husband enjoyed a beer while live music started playing outside in the court yard. Great weather although a little warm for a fall day in October. They did have misters and a bar outside so people didn't have to go inside if they didn't want too.   Plenty of parking nearby. Clean restrooms. Friendly and Quick service."

                "description": "The Grapevine is a great place to a cool drink or a glass of vino, catch some music, or people watch. We did not partake of their wine but on a hot October, Saturday a cold beer or two was in order.   The beer line moves fast and there is a good selection of local and corporate beers. Masks are required indoors while you order and the outside tables are set pretty far apart.   There is a good-sized shaded courtyard with live music (on this Sat afternoon). We opted for the people watching section by the street and we were not disappointed.   Like most places in Gruene everything is a bit overpriced but if you know where to go there are good (nontourist priced) deals. The Grapevine is a cool place to hang while planning your next stop in Gruene."

While there was plenty of out door seating, and a live band playing...definitely still crowded.   Drink wise...we got the frozen wine-a-rita - sangria and peach bellini......very sugary.. but very good if you like sugary drinks. Also kinda on the pricier side for 2 slushy type drinks after tip.  You'll probably make your way here while waiting for your table at the Gristmill to be ready."

Just thought I would throw that out there since most people like to go to actual wineries when up in the hill country region. This is a super cute spot (that can get extremely busy) where you can sit outside and enjoy sipping on fermented grapes while listening to live music. It's dog friendly. It's family/children friendly. There are plenty of seat options outside. And it's very reasonably priced! Especially when you consider that your 3 wine tastings are FREE. I recommend!"

                "description": "What better stop while you're in Gruene than to stop in to taste a few wines.  You never know what you'll find.  My friend and I had gone in for a tasting to see what might be tempting.  It never hurts to buy a bottle of wine, right?  Well, it was fairly crowded, being such a beautiful day out.  However I have seen it busier.  Anyway, we had walked up to the counter and were greeted and asked what we would like.  We took a few minutes to decide and got our sample.  A little dry for me, so we got another.  Now a few minutes have gone by as we've been standing there.  People come up to the counter and get help.  We finally decide what to get and the person who is been helping us keeps on walking by, as she is helping others.  But there are a few other people working the counter, including a gentleman less than four feet away.  Well, we stand there, just looking, waiting for someone to help us.  That help never came, so we decided to walk out without a purchase.  It's always important to keep track of everyone that comes into your business.    Because I did like the wine I will be back at some point in the future, hopefully to get the bottle that had caught my attention."

It is my favorite place to go, especially this time of year when the weather starts to cool off they will light up a fire pit. It is the perfect place for a date or group of friends to hang out. Before ordering, you are aloud to taste three wines. There is a wide selection to choose from with categories: sweet/dessert, red, and white. My husband and I usually will take one small sip of our glass and then switch so that we can try six and then buy a bottle of the one we love the most. They give you the option of having a chilled wine in a bucket of ice. In the summertime, we will do this with one of the sweeter wines. Our favorite thing to do is to get them to open the wine and bag it, then give us two plastic cups. This allows us to carry the bottle around and sip on the wine while we walk around town to the different shops."

The customer service here cannot be beat. On a weekend day, you will find it to be a happening place, but you won't be waiting in line as you would expect. Sometimes they even have Peach-A-Ritas and Frozen Sangria!   The Grapevine offers a plethora of bottled wines for sale, or you can buy a glass..   There is ample seating outside of the Grapbine building, where you can enjoy a glass of wine, beer or maybe you bought a bottle to share. They will give you a bucket with ice to keep your wine cool in.   The bathroom situation can get a bit tight, as there is 1 male restroom and 1 female. But there are plenty of restrooms available at Gruene Hall which is not far at all.   I like that you can open a tab, so you can grab a beer or glass of wine, walking around Gruene and shop, then stop by when you need a refill.   I was bummed they no longer offer any of the wines from Val Verde in Del Rio, but the waiter did suggest a few wines for me to try that were comparable.   They also have small cheese and cracker boards available."

                "description": "What an incredible hidden gem!  I have lived in the area for 20 years and just recently found Blue Lotus Winery.  This is by far, my favorite Texas Winery.  The wines and mead were wonderful, Allie and Katy were fantastic behind the counter and there was even a Cajun food truck there serving up some of the best gumbo I've ever had.   Although I'm not a huge fan of Strawberries, the Wild Strawberry Melomel is a must try!  There is even a Jalapeno Mead which I will be purchasing to bring with me when I visit out of state friends!  The main tasting room is beautiful with full views of the vineyards.  There was even a Loggerhead Shrike putting on a show for us on the shrubs along the driveway.  I can only imangine how specular the grounds will be in the spring once the vines have leaves.  We left with a bottles of Strawberry and Red Lotus.  We also grabbed a 64oz refillable jug full of Blackberry Mead.  In addition to the tasting, we had a bottle of Raspberry mead with lunch.    Everything we tried (with the assistance of the Allie and Katy) were incredible!  I have a feeling we'll be back very soon to refill that big jug of Blackberry Mead!  My new favorite winery!"

                "description": "What a lovely experience! We went on a Thursday afternoon (3/34/2022) and the woman working there was an absolute joy, very personable and knowledgeable considering she hadn't been working there very long. We did a sampler and tried some of the meads, which were lovely and we bought a few bottles as well as some other swag. We talked about other local places to get food and drinks and site seeing. They do serve food, appetizers and pizzas and have a BBQ truck on the weekends as well as other special weekend events seasonally. They recently updated their hours, she mentioned being opened on Wednesdays too though yelp and Apple Maps have not updated with the new hours so be sure to check out the website for hour and other fascinating information about the actual winery."

                "description": "As far as I could tell, at the time of writing this review this is the only winery in the immediate area of Seguin. After visiting wineries in Fredericksburg/Hye/Stonewall area, this one falls a little short. The wine itself is okay, but I didn't like it enough to buy a bottle. The building is a little strange, as is the decor inside. There's a lot going on in there. There were tons of kids running around which for a kid-free date weekend sort of dampened the mood for us.  I failed to get her name, but the young woman behind the bar serving was working hard, helped all the customers, and was courteous and friendly - probably the best thing about this place.  All said, we do not regret the visit, but there are definitely areas for this business to improve on."

                "description": "Whoa! A winery in Seguin? I had not idea. Met friends here for a surprise birthday get together. The tasting room is quaint with 4-5 tables. Was very shocked to find out they started as a meadery. And very impressed by the mead selection. There was 3 meads on tap, raspberry champagne on tap, and a plethora of wine and meads by the bottle available for tasting or a glass.  They do sell growlers, so you can enjoy the tapped mead and champagne at home. I was impressed with the meads and champagne. I did not try any of the wines.  Beautiful landscaping and large windows, which allow you to look out into the vineyard and at the property."

                "description": "They have the best mead and one of the best wines I've ever tasted!!!!  If you like sweet wines (like I do) they have great wines, especially their white wines. They flavors are so complex and have underlying subtle flavors that come out as well.   The meads are really sweet and very smooth.   The wine tastings are 5 tastings for $5 which is an amazing deal. Their selection is somewhat limited so if you go with someone else you practically get to try everything they have.   The only downside is that t is out in the country, and looks a bit shady... But they are expanding so it's starting to look more legit.   If you're ever in Seguin area, I definitely suggest this be one of your stops."

Mead wines are based with honey. They offer delicious food and a beautiful property to walk. They will even show you things like fresh picked grapes fermenting from the morning to unbottled wine tastings in their winery.  The couple that runs this winery are amazing and down to earth. I will definitely be coming back."

The cranberry orange spice is a must try for the fall season.  Our server was nice, knowledgeable and made good conversation.   We'll definitely go back.  The only recommendation that I would make to the owner is to put chairs at the bar.  The tasting room opened earlier this year so that may already be in the works."

I love old historic buildings and this is the perfect place to come learn some history and see how well they preserved their town. Tons of restaurants, wineries, and little shops to explore. I wouldn't say it's necessarily kid friendly but a nice romantic getaway or girls trip would be perfect here. Everything is within a five minute walk of each other which was nice.  Parking was easy for us to find, the biggest parking area we found was behind the grapevine winery so I would head there first before wasting time circling in front of the store you wanna go into."

                "description": "Too much traffic and too noisy (not talking about the music). I was born and raised in New Braunfels and now live only 20 minutes from the city. We come to Gruene often, to shop and/or eat. Recently we stayed for a couple of nights during the week just for a get away. We stayed at the Gruene Mansion Inn which was fantastic. Gruene itself, however was awful. I walked early in the morning and it was like walking on the side of the freeway. The traffic was non-stop, including big trucks. Cars were moving fast. I had to run to cross the street, in between cars, no one stopped. After my walk (probably around 0800), I headed back to my room and noticed that there were lawn workers cleaning at Gruene Hall with leaf blowers. At around 0930, we walked to go shop and they were still blowing leaves at all the shops in the area......lunch at Mozie's......still blowing. Tried to go back to our room at 1300, still blowing. My husband tried to take a nap at 1430, couldn't because of the leaf blowing. It was ridiculous! Not so cozy or peaceful."

                "description": "It's pronounced, \"Green\" Gruene is a historic district outside of New Braunfels, along the Guadalupe River. It's an old Civil War era cotton town that was once somewhat of a ghost town. It's bounced back with tourism!  Gruene is a place to go to hang out for an afternoon, and take in the antique shops along Gruene's main street. They also have a wine sampling spot. The Gristmill is a great place to get some German food, and then head to Gruene Hall for some live music at Texas' oldest dance hall.  Gruene, Texas was founded in the 1840's by German settlers. The entire area is all German. The downtown area is mainly made of old brick buildings that have been restored. They're cool architectural designs that make up the shopping district. During Gruene Market Days, local vendors come out for a public market in the streets. As far as I know, you can't really go tubing through Gruene, as it's a bit out from all the tubing spots. The water comes rushing through here, and it seems like it might be difficult to tube it here. Try closer to downtown New Braunfels."

                "description": "Located between New Braunfels and San Marcos is a beautiful and quaint little gem named Gruene (\"Green\"). Gruene Historic District is embellished with historic buildings, antique stores, specialty shops, quirky restaurants, and beautiful landscapes. It is small enough to walk by foot, but big enough to discover new things to do and see for an entire day. There are restaurants for coffee, pecan candies, ice cream, and even pickles! And there are shops for toys, unique t-shirts, plants, and pottery. The possibilities are endless.  There are a few unconventional hotel and cottages conveniently located nearby that are walk-able distance. Otherwise the drive from New Braunfels is about 10 minutes. I came here on a Sunday and there were quite a few people walking around, but it wasnt so crowded that I couldn't feel a breeze. There are also plenty of street and parking lots scattered throughout, but there is a main lot located near Got Toys and Typsy Gypsy."

But it's a nice cool, overcast day. Shops, food, wine. . . enough to make everyone happy.  If you've never visited, do.  If you've visited before, what's taking you so long to come back?  I promise you'll find something to enjoy."

                "description": "About 45 minutes outside Austin.  Gruene is my new favorite getaway from it all weekend day spot.  My friend and I were early coming back to Austin from a weekend getaway in San Antonio on a Sunday afternoon.  Being newish to the area I wasn't familiar with Gruene.  We saw the highway signs advertising Gruene, and usually my curiosity gets the better of me and I will find myself driving out to these places that end up being nothing.  However, Gruene is the first time the signs haven't lied.  My friend and I fell in love instantly with the magic of Gruene's historic wooden downtown main street buildings.  There is something for everyone here,  restaurants and cafes galore, an amazing historic music hall that has some fantastic bands regularly playing, little boutique shops, a winery, a wine tasting room highlighting the best of Texas wines + a couple of beers on tap, numerous adorable BandB's, outdoor market days highlighting local artisans, and of course the token water tower.   I recently spent an afternoon here enjoying the market days, tasting great food, and sipping some great wine.    Time moves a bit slower here, and even though you are 45 minutes from home, you are on a mini holiday."

A few times a month they have something called Gruene Market Days where artists/bakers/creators of all things hand crafted come out and sell their goods.  Restaurants like Gruene River Grill, Grist Mill, Adobe Berde and La Cantina offer great dining and nice views. Gruene Hall is a must stop! Lots of antique shops too. Parking can be hard but be patient and something will open up."

                "description": "I am new to the area and wanted to check this place out and grab a dry cappuccino after pizza yesterday, Monday October 18th around 7pm. I was unenthusiastically greeted by a girl who acted as if I was bothering her by coming into get coffee. I was asking her questions about the place and what they had and she was incredibly rude and continue to answer my questions with one word answers. No smile ever came across her face and she really made me feel uncomfortable as I was just trying to get some information about the store. My family is really big on cigars /coffee/ whiskey and I was very disappointed in the customer service or lack of customer service. I decided to push through and continue with ordering a coffee and when I asked her for a dry cappuccino she proceeded to roll her eyes and told me she didn't know how to make it and asked me what a dry cappuccino was. When I asked her \"isn't this a coffee place?\" she said \"I don't know how to make the coffee I just push the buttons\". As somebody that has been a barista and worked at a coffee shop I tried to explain to her how to make it and she just increasingly became annoyed with me. I decided to scratch the dry cappuccino just ordered a double shot of espresso which was awful by the way. As I continued to try to make small talk it was very apparent that I was not welcome there. I even asked her if she wasn't having a good day because of the way I was being treated. As I was paying, I asked her if there was a place that I could leave a review for the store she looked me dead in my eyes and said no. I confusingly asked her, \" oh you don't have a Yelp?\" She straight up told me no. As somebody that has worked in customer service I have got to say this is the worst customer service I've ever experienced and I would never treat a customer the way that I was treated. I just hope that the owners can see this and know what goes on in their store when they're not there because if I was the owner of the store I would want to know about one of my employees making people feel very uncomfortable And not being helpful at all. I made several attempts to try to turn this experience around and give her the opportunity to create a pleasant experience for me but she just acted like I was interrupting her day of sitting on the stool behind the counter. Customer service was awful coffee was awful she didn't even know how to make a dry cappuccino. If I were you I would steer clear of this place it's not worth it."

                "description": "Short visit reaped great rewards.  Mr R had called ahead and been told they had no snack bar/restaurant on site but standard cheese/fruit/charcuterie were available for tastings.  Circumstances changed and I arrived alone at the tasting room's last hour of business. No offer of munchies but the employee was personable, knowledgeable, enjoys his work and I got to taste some *great* stuff in short order. If I'd arrived earlier I'd have asked about a few solids or in hindsight packed a bento box of them in the car to visit between flights.  In wines I tend towards dry, Pinot Grigio's what you can always find at my house and usually in my glass. I also love mead, although what I've consumed over the years is quantum territory compared to my impressive wine quaffing.  I tried four meads and one wine, enjoyed them all. A tasting of 5 selections as I got is $15 and you get to keep the glass. Took home traditional mead (drier), raspberry, Oatmeal Monster, and Vermentino (a drier white wine).  Seriously, if you have a friend who likes sweet wines, you have a shower or other small party on your calendar, come stock up on this oatmeal monster. It's like drinking an oatmeal cookie, it's ridiculously satisfying and giggle-inducing.  The drive's less than 40 minutes from San Marcos, it's near 123 in Seguin not far off my usual path to my parents' and the landscape's as nice as any in this part of Tx. As I said, I didn't have time to wander about on an extensive tour but it looked nice. The map option through Yelp was quite sufficient to get me there easily for a first visit.  They have events throughout the year, the wine club (quarterly delivery/pickup) has no membership fee and I think I'm going to sign up for it. Bottles start around $15 each and there are discounts offered on certain labels/quantities; I saw a few postings for those. The facility's nice if you are making an event of it and there's reasonable parking for split parties to meet up here.  What more can I say? Highlight of my day and now I have new hostess gifts or treats for myself stocked away."

                "description": "So, really I am surprised that this meadery exists in the middle of \"nowhere I'd be going randomly\". My mom has been getting into making mead with the fruit trees back home and so, when in Texas, try Texas Mead. Again, this place is way off the beaten road so unless you're aware of their existence, I'm not sure there will be too many coming here.  To start, it was nice and quiet the day my mom and I stopped in, which meant that we got the undivided attention of our hostess. She was highly informative and gracious. My mom had many questions on account of making mead herself, so I just quietly sampled my mead.   Mead is traditionally quite sweet, so if you're not much of a sweet person, find yourself to the wine menu with some drier options. (Yes, along with mead, they have wine here.) The unfortunate ending to our tasting was that the tasting was not comped upon purchase of bottles of wine. (Hmm, maybe with time an popularity this one will go?) Anyway, small gripes, small gripes. So, there is definitely a selection if you're not one who is traditionally into mead.  The last little tidbit I must relish again was their \"Hopped Mead\". My mom and I decided to drink a glass outside, wandering the winery, and it was incredible. Think somewhat sweet mead but carbonated (that doesn't happen often folks) and hopped for taste. It was so good, my mother bought a growler and we went on our way hoppy. And maybe a little loopy."

                "description": "Passed this store many times and wondered how serious could a store named \"lol\" be. Finally stopped and was I wrong! This place super surprised me, it is decked out with liquor from top to bottom, pretty much anything you could ask for. And if they don't have it, they'll get it, just for you. I was looking for a bottle of a special Asian wine, this location didn't have it but another did... and the owner, Paras, delivered it himself within an hour to the store. Owner, Paras, great person, super knowledgable, and way cool. It was Friday night and he had about 6-8 bottles out for samples and gave recommendations on best ways to drink and mix. Gotta try this place. And if you want \"high-end\" bottles, Paras is the man to talk to."
