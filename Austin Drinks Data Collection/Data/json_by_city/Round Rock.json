                "description": "We had heard about Bluebonnet for a while and finally decided to check them out on a Friday evening. We were shocked to find a packed house! The picnic tables outside are plentiful but were all full when we arrived. Luckily two guys let us join them. I had the Raspberry Berliner Weisse and it quickly became my new favorite. It is sweet and crisp without being overly sweet. Our friends both got the Cream Ale and loved it. We all walked out with growlers. Everyone there is super friendly and very welcoming. We had the baby with us which was fine (there were a few kids there)...but every time a car was exiting we would have to wrangle him down (minor downfall of basically sitting alongside the parking lot). We are looking forward to visiting again."

                "description": "Bluebonnet Beer Company is simply amazing. They are a little difficult to find, look for the side street behind the post office and you should notice it on the right.  Their beers are super delicious, I had the wit, pecan brown ale , cream ale and hef. Out of all of them, the cream ale and wit come highly recommended. They are so smooth and drinkable.  There is a schnitzel food trailer that serves some pretty decent food. The place is small but all of the employees I encountered were nice and friendly. For seating, there is only plastic benches avaliable located in the front of the brewery. Not really any kind  of shade or landacaping but this is expected since it is such a small brewery.  It may not have all of the amenities and backyard space that other larger breweries in Austin have. But if you love beer and want to interact with some awesome, friendly people then Bluebonnet Beer Company is the way to go. Everything is tasty and pints are currently at $5 each, you can't beat that price."

We go when it's raining and all tables are outside for the exception of the owners table that was inside. We asked if we could move our table in and was rejected instantly because \"there was no room\" (there was enough). Hospitality was at a negative and we were highly considering the beer mug club but the lost a customer and a loyaled customer.  Bluebonnet Brewery you all need to focus on customer Hospitality and not just your sales."

                "description": "Great little brewery in my hometown of Round Rock!  My family and I came here on a Friday around 6:30 to grab a few beers and relax. If it's cold outside, I highly recommend bringing a layer or two as there is only a bit of seating inside but about four picnic tables outside. Also, wait to grab dinner at the brewery as they have rotating food trucks Thursday-Saturdays. When we went, they had a lobster roll truck that served amazing rolls.   I started out with their Oktoberfest beer, which was very good! My mom, who is not a big beer drinker, got their shandy and thought it would be great for a hot day. The beers are $5 a pint, and I thought it was really cool they have a series related to the Immortal 10.   Parking is not a hassle, the beer is very good, the people are friendly, and your hardest job will be finding a seat. Enjoy!"

Beer is tasteful and I don't always love IPA. Their indoor seating is limited by this isn't normally a problem in Texas. They have plenty of tables outside and also have tents in the summer. No food but there is always a food truck - if you follow them on Facebook you can see what it is ahead of time.   Staff is always friendly and accommodating. Plenty of space for puppies here too.   They are only open Friday evenings and Saturday! I wish they had some openings on Sunday."

Firstly, Marga (aka the Beer Snob), and I checked out a Pale...and their Pale was Very Good...asked for a sample of their IPA,...and before even drinking it....getting the nose of the beer -- already knew that it was -- Spot On and the-way-it-should-be!  Their Cream Ale was a new beer idea to me...tried that and WOW, creamy and light...Very Good.  What a Great Place and Team!!!  Thank You soo Much!!!

                "description": "I'm rating Blue Bonnet 3 stars because while we love their beer and have enjoyed it the very much during their Oktoberfest, we were pretty bummed when we went on a Saturday night. We know that they are popular and were even excited to try Jimmy Vega's Smokehouse but when we arrived half of the available tables were set as reserved. There was literally no where to sit. Every table was packed. We had our 3 yr old son with us, so standing wasn't an option, especially since we wanted to eat too. We asked anyway if any of the tables were available and was told no, they are all reserved for 5pm, but you could squeeze in anywhere else. In the end, we left irritated and disappointed, while I understand reserving tables, but when you only have 10 tables and you reserve 5 of them, that doesn't leave much room for anyone else."

They have a solid line up across a wide style of beers. The summer wit is a favorite along with the Kolsch styles they release during the fall. I would love to see them expand to a new location  with a climate controlled tasting room which I think would bring in a lot more clientele."

I don't think I've ever been in a bar with such nice and professional staff. They have an epic beer selection. Though beer isn't my thing, the selection still impressed me! They helped me select a beer, as I said, beer isn't my thing. They were patient and actually found me an option to \"get me through the night\". I did move on to margaritas though, and were these delicious! So why the 4 starts, well, they kept running out of things. For instance, my margarita went skinny when they ran out of the regular mix they use. Then, they ran out of limes! The margaritas, even the skinny ones, were fantastic! They use A LOT of ice, but still tasted delicious. Decor was wonderful for Christmas. It was just a warm and inviting space. We will definitely go back if we are ever back in that area! Parking was sufficient, as it was a weeknight. I'm sure that helped for it not to be too crowded. Everything was very clean also. Just a great place to go and meet with friends over drinks. If you're expecting tapas, call ahead to see when the kitchen closes. The kitchen had closed shortly after we got there, which was a bummer. Regardless, check this place out if you're in the area!"

                "description": "I've been coming to The Brass Tap for a few years now and love it! The back courtyard has giant Jenga and other games and there are plenty of seating options both indoors and outdoors. Just recently tried their food and the loaded fries were pretty good! I was looking around at surrounding tables and their food all looked great. Can't wait to try more here in the future. Tons of beer on tap and very knowledgeable bartenders who make great recommendations. I will say that their cocktail availability is slim but definitely a good spot for beer."

                "description": "This is our second time trying this restaurant chain. Our first one was on South Congress in Austin and was a terrible experience. We thought would give the round rock location of try. Came in happy hour and were pleased with the bartenders from the friendlyness and helpfulness. Our food met our expectation in time and quality as well as the drinks. However when I went to pay for our $40 bill with $100 cash we were told \"we don't take cash\". Number one, probably should tell someone that before they eat and drink your food and beverage, and number two, why? Is cash dirtier than a credit card you've never sanitized? I don't understand businesses that say \"I don't want your cash\". And I don't plan on patronizing them again either."

Service is outstanding, they always have A great selection of beer on tap and if you are confused or just can't decide, ask, staff is great and matching your preferences to their current selections. Over the last couple weeks my friends and I have enjoyed flatbreads and sandwiches - Tasty and fresh. The options these days in this area, post Covid, are rather slim - But it is definitely worth you stopping in and staying for a while... They have a nice sitting area out back when it's not too warm outside."

                "description": "I was looking forward to returning to the Brass Tap because I have had a good experience on a prior visit. There were a couple of mistakes by our server at first, but I chalked it up to him possibly being new or simply having an off night. Unfortunately, the service progressively got worse throughout the dinner. From spilling a drink on the table, to telling us he wasn't focused, to the bartender remaking the drink and under pouring it, and it taking almost 20 minutes to receive our check after we asked three times for it, you can't blame it on anything but a lack of effort. Continuous poor service can truly ruin an evening if you let it."

                "description": "My Fiancee' and two friends of ours visiting from Dallas area decided to check this place out on Friday night.  I read the reviews on Yelp (as I always do before going), and suggested this place to them.  I am sorry for doing so. We got there, in what seems to be happening area of downtown Round Rock, which I did not know existed.  There are several bars in this same stretch of road.  Parking was easy on the street.  Once we got in, it has the bar and lot of the front area filled (no social distancing here).  Sign at the front read, \"Seat yourself, and we will find ya\".  We sat at a table/booth section across from the bar near the back.  Our waiter, seems like he did not know much.  We asked him questions, and he was not sure.  We found out though, if you don't want beer, they are limited on other alcohol.  I wanted a Grey Goose and tonic.  They did not have Grey Goose.  I asked for Ketel One.  They did not have.  They said they only have local vodkas, \"Dripping Springs\" and \"Titos\".  I went with \"Titos\" and waiter asked three times, what I wanted with the vodka.  My friend got a \"Apple-tini\".  It came in a very small v-shapped glass, that looked like not much more then a shot...and it had ice chips floating in her drink.  She used to be a bartender, and knew that is not what you are supposed to have there.  Also, her boyfriend had a Long Island Ice tea.  He sipped it, and it was not tasting right.  So, she walked up to the bar to get it fixed.  They told her to go back and get her mask and come back (*mind you, no patrons at bar were wearing a mask).  She did so, and ask if they could remake it.  They did so, and brought to our table by different waitress person, and he tasted it, and still not right.  So, my friend asked the waitress if they knew what they put in it.  They went thru all the ingredients and found out they use \"lemonade\" instead of  \"sweet and sour\" , which made it taste really sweet.  The food was just ok.  My friend got a salad, and looked like left over pieces of lettuce they had lying around. The nachos were just ok, and the reuben and cuban were ok.  It took us about 15 min or more just to get our waiter to come back to get bill.  They pay attention to bar area, but not much in area around it.  Sorry, won't be back."

                "description": "After enjoying delicious food and well poured drinks from my favorite bartender Tanya, I was blindsided for having a political opinion. I was shushed and shunned by the staff for having any kind of point of view. I decided to move to the main bar to be by myself and was then questioned by the staff, who blew the whole thing out of proportion. I was told that I needed to leave the premises by some screening bartender because I was \"disturbing other people\"; all while never raising my voice. If the staff had not perpetuated drama, it would have been dropped. I would not suggest this bar unless you're absolutely certain that you're going to be quiet and pay for over price drinks for underwhelming service from the newer waitstaff. Weak management."

I fully understand markup and a business making a profit, but come on. Could still make a killing at $40, and I wouldve actually bought it. Need to take a calculus class at ACC to learn about price optimization.   Good beers on tap, too."

I'll never understand why a server would bring the appetizer with the entree. I also heard complaints from adjacent tables about incorrect orders.  The food is overpriced. It's pub grub. It's not even good pub grub. The chicken was over cooked and dry. The house made chips were stale and greasy.  The beer/wine list is average at best. The two \"house brews\" I tried weren't bad but nothing to overcome everything else.  Overall it's just overpriced bad service and food in a beautiful setting."

They have covered seating under a pavilion which is equipped with heaters and fans for any time of year. They have some uncovered seating as well and a mini amphitheater vibe for live music. They also have picnic tables on the grass and a ton of room for kids to run wild and free. They are dog friendly outside. Today we opted for the back patio and had the pleasure of being helped by Aniya. She has such a kind, gentle, and engaging energy. She impressed me with her knowledge of both the bar and food menu down to knowing the size of the pours. Aniya also had some killer recommendations! If you're in the area, you've got to try them out and ask for Aniya!"

We had reservations but switcheroooed on her with the table and she was super nice. Found us the perfect spot.  Angel was our waitress and she was just as great! Larger group... kept her cool... recommended great choices for us.. I had half arugula salad and sandwich and 2 glasses of Sauv Blanc ... the managers came by and checked on us... one lady and one man...  Great service, great outdoors... good filtered water... yes I can tell...  I will be back to try out patio and bar in the very near future!  Would love to try more items on the menu. And I did tell Angel I would be back to see her... I love that it's dog friendly and the outdoor seating is amazing... love the string lights... good ambiance... clean bathrooms...

We had an excellent server and really liked the \"Snug\" we sat in.  The seating options are pretty and a unique feature actually.   Seating: Large tables, small tables, \"Snugs\"(private little cubby with plenty of room), bar seating, outdoor tables and cozy seating around a fireplace outside.   The food: Pretzel w/ dipping trio. Yes! These are excellent w/ an awesome sourdough flavor.  The fish and chips was pretty good. Great batter with a ton of flavor in it. The pizza (ordered without the pepperoni). The dough was under proved and under cooked. Ok at best.  The irish stew was pretty to look at but had none of the heart or depth of flavor that you'd expect from a stew. My soul was craving a hot heart stew, no luck. Disappointing.   Drinks: No wells here!! Just a quality selection of excellent wines and spirits.   We'll definitely be back and try a new selection of foods! If you're looking for a place to visit/meet up, this is a great venue. Plentyyyyyy of room!!"

I want to start off by saying I hadn't eaten breakfast, lunch, or dinner prior to arriving there which you could only imagine I was hangry(hungry + angry)    So I park my car and Soon as I step on the curb to make my way towards the door the hostess had already opened the door and was greeting my wife and I with a warm and friendly greeting.   As a manager myself, I always preached that our customers should never have to touch the door and I was so glad to see this establishment have the same values about it as I do.   We sat down and in no time our waiter Homer was at our table greeting us. I must say he was very personable. He truly grasp the concept of building rapport with his customers.   The food came out pretty quick which was a huge plus because a I stayed before I was \"Hangry\"  My fries were cold, but then again they're fries so I just asked for some fresh ones that had some heat to it lol.  My wife order the 8HR Braised Short Rib and she stated it was just ok.  I asked for lemon pepper wings, My receipt shows that's what I got, but I can tell you that want what came in my plate. Was I made about it NO, why you ask? Because whatever the heck it was taste pretty darn good. I should have asked what was I given because I wouldn't mind ordering it again.  My fish and chips was freaking AMAZING and whatever little SAUCE they give you to dip you food into.... AMAZING!!! make sure you ask for extra so you get enough to dip your fries in it to lol. My wife tried my fish and chips and said she couldn't wait to come back to get that next time.   On our way out the door the host struck again with grabbing the door for us and she did it with a smile. As I was walking my way to the car another employee told me how much they appreciated our business and I'm thinking to myself write your done working your on your way to your own car to head home and you still take the time out to make is feel special. I feel that the friendly service has us excited to come back and eat here again and we are looking forward to it."

                "description": "Cool spot for inside and outside dining. The outside patio has strings of lights everywhere and a cute \"whiskey barrel\" table for a couple to sit at.   We had their lemon thyme wings and there so awesome. So crunchy and flavorful. We also had their special pizza and it was good! A little too greasy for us but you can tell everything was extremely fresh.  Our server was super friendly and she even let me sample the Bloody Mary mix that I asked about.  The charcuterie board looked tasty, we definitely want to go back and try it!"

                "description": "They brew their own beer and have a massive selection of good wines and provisions. It wouldn't be an Irish pub without these yummy fish and chips, now would it?!  It's the only time I'm down to go to a pub - I'm not a beer person but I love a good beer battered Irish fish and chips. The only way I'd take beer.  The place is gorgeous, spacious (big groups are welcome!)  We wished we didn't have to leave. Their back patio is beautifully by a creek. They also control the mosquitoes which could ruin any patio dining experience for me. It's a win all around!  I can't wait to come back to this piece of Ireland in Round Rock, the managers told us that a lot of their restaurant decor are from Ireland shipped here. That's pretty personal and lovely in my book."

                "description": "Was very excited to try this place because of the pictures we saw online. Coming into it, it actually looked very casual like a sports bar almost. We meant to come in for quick lunch. However, quick it was not. We waited 45 minutes before we said anything. The server kept coming to us and saying \"your food will be right out\" every 10 minutes but nothing more. We saw people getting food after us which raised concerns so we asked our waiter who just said \"its coming\"  and finally asked to see to a manager. Manager came and explained that the cook dropped the food and had to remake it.  In conclusion, we told them that we would have wanted them communicate that to us from the start so we knew why others got their food first. The manager just shrugged it off and we were so upset that we couldn't even finish our food. Thumbs down on service and management."

                "description": "This place has so much potential but on my visit it was a total and complete disaster.    Parking - Small parking lot for the size of the venue, saw a sign that said additional parking at Dell diamond which is a good ways up the street.  They do not have any valet parking. I ended up parking at the R Bank lot (about 1/2 between the two spots) that had a sign that said towing was enforced from 5p - 8A but we were assured they had an arrangement and that we would not be towed. It worked out but still was quite a hike.  Atmosphere and decor  The architecture and furnishings are outstanding and really are enticing.  Round Rock does not have many restaurants of this style. The place is packed and you need to make a reservation.  We sat by the window in the bar, a little after 630 and we were baking because of the heat. The air conditioning was not working well enough to keep everyone comfortable, several in our party were visibly sweating.  Adding ceiling fans and putting some type of treatment on the windows would help considerably, this is only going to get worse as summer temperatures begin to return to the 100 +.  The windows face the west,  Service  They are terribly understaffed. Typically for a new restaurant, owners over staff and make sure that the service is beyond good. The service here was beyond bad. Our server was working her tail off and trying to maintain her very large group of tables.  Everything was taking too much time.  There were large gaps of time between ordering and receiving, especially on the drinks.  Two of our rounds were forgotten and upon reminding our server, she quickly darted to the bar and then returned in short order.  Sadly, some of the drinks were no longer chilled and cold  but warm - obviously has been sitting unattended for some period of time.  Drinks  The drinks were overpriced. For example, a vodka martini (Tito's) small demanded a $15 price tag. As mentioned above, the drink was warm and did not taste good at all.  The typical turnaround from placing an order for drinks to receiving them was at least 10 minutes.  On the positive side they have some unique drinks on the menu, an old fashion that comes to the table actually smoking, when they remove the cover. A neighboring table ordered one and it was quite the sight.  Again, some great potential, but because of under staffing and other issues they fall short.  Food  Several of my dining companions had been here before and strongly recommended the Reuben sandwich, saying when they had it a few weeks ago it was fantastic and perhaps one of the best they had ever had eaten. Well, for me, not so much.  The meat was not sliced well, was chunky and tough, the Reuben arrived luke warm and did not taste all that great.    Others in my dining party, ordered the pretzel appetizer and the pepperoni pizza.  The food met expectations, but nothing spectacular.  The dipping sauces for he pretzel were unique - beer cheese, red wine tarragon butter and a garlic cream cheese.  They asked for some small plates, everyone of the plates had to be wiped clean.     One dining companion ordered the charred vegetables.  We were all surprised at the how small the serving was for the $14 price tag - and the comment was they were over charred.    They do have a patio that does not take reservations and seating is first come first serve.  The bar and food are different from the indoor main venue.  Interestingly, they have a food truck that is serving a different menu from what is inside."

                "description": "First of all, the place is beautiful inside and out. That's the main sell 100%. The food is good and so are the drinks but a little overpriced for their outdoor menu. A guiness draught at any type of irish pub shouldn't go for $9 nor any bar for that matter in my opinion. All food and drink prices could be $1-2 less, especially if it's a limited outdoor menu. If we were dining in (and it's beautiful inside + full menu offered), I could see those prices being fair. If the drinks were to be $1-2 less in the future, we could see ourselves being regulars, but definitely not until then.  Two of our friends ordered the wagyu burger, when asked on how it compares to a non-wagyu burger, they said they wouldn't have noticed anything especially different to a regular burger in comparison if they had not read the menu.  Nonetheless, they seemed to enjoy it.   I would order the reuben sandwich again with the kimchi slaw. I thought the kimchi slaw was very creative and it added nice flavor contrast to the otherwise classical meaty cheesy aspects of the reuben. The kimchi by itself was good, they use older more fermented kimchi, which gave the sandwich a bit of sourness to it.   My wife ordered the fish n' chips, one of her favorite barfoods. The fish itself was very moist and tender and it appears much larger in portion size than what we were expecting when looking at other user's yelp photos. The chile-lime tartar sauce wasn't very 'chile-limey' at all, it tasted just like regular tartar sauce, don't get me wrong - we LOVE any tartar sauce, but they could dial up the chile and lime all the way to the moon if that's what they're advertising.   Lastly, the staff was nice, although our waitress basically dissappeared for the second half of our stay and kept forgetting/taking an unquestionably and questionably long time to get our drinks and takeout box. Service was just OK, there is always next time.   Bonus points for the restrooms, very neat, clean and well decorated."

The Fish and Chips  and Reuben Sandwich are delicious and portions generous. The craft beer is also the best (Huckleberry wheat).  Plus the place is filled with great atmosphere, and plenty of history. Our server (Jewels) pointed out the wall plaques located all along the restaurant filled with tidbits of information. This contributes to the experience. The music is great and staff friendly. A very happy place! We drove from South Austin to visit, definitely retuning soon!"

The space is large and the beer is good. I tried an IPA and a pilsner. There are a few arcades in the back and enough TVs throughout to keep everyone interested. My only complaint is that the game sound was not turned on, so I was distracted by people talking, dogs barking, etc."

The Meridian Hive Blackberry Mead was my favorite, but the other three choices in the flight including Hefeweizen, Strawberry Limeade Ale, and Magonada with a tajin rim were delicious as well! The seating area was comfortable and well shaded. The on-site food truck served up an amazing chipotle steak quesadilla; it had the right blend of savory and spice. Together, the beverages at BA and the lineup at the food truck were a great pairing! We are on vacation here in Texas and we're hoping to return to the Barking Armadillo before we head home!"

Husband had the Witbier (one of his go to styles) and I had the Hefe and (limited) strawberry farmadillo.  We ordered chips and queso and tacos from the taco truck onsite. We enjoyed those as well. Very solid meat in those tacos and very filling!  We will return, but try to come earlier so we can sit on the patio instead of inside. Some of the guests inside were not vigilant about masking when leaving their table. I would suggest some signage on the interior tables (at least) reminding them of this request.  There are dogs allowed inside which did not bother us at all (we have 2 at home). But, some people are not as comfortable with dogs inside so I feel it needs to be mentioned.  Looking forward to trying more beers in the future!"

There is nice shaded outdoor seating. Inside has a few video games and pinball. There is plenty of seating insight with high tops and tables. There is a nice couch and a couple of comfy chairs.   The bartenders are great. The beer selection changes with a handful or regular lagers and IPAs. The stout is coffee based. The Belgian heavy is fantastic, better than Devil's Backbone. Prices are fair. People might argue about the single kind of glassware, but I'm unbothered.  Would be good to have a few more interesting board games their for more of a social atmosphere, but hard to argue with success."

                "description": "I was working in Round Rock and we were looking for somewhere for lunch - spotted place on Yelp and bring British and sporting some old faves on the menu, decided to give it a try ! Very glad we did.  Full of cool British decor, we were met by the owner ( Tim?), really nice bloke and super friendly! It made me feel like I was at the local ( pub) back home.  Went with the curry and being vegetarian, was excited they had a cauliflower version which was great and very authentic! Loved the naan bread too.  My colleague got a burger but after spotting the fish and chips wanted to rest that - so we tried that and it was crazy authentic. Loved the mushy peas, curry sauce and the delicious tarter sauce . The dish is huge so easily enough for 2 !  Lovely place , great owner and fabulous food"

                "description": "Anything short of amazing would be doing this pub an injustice! A colleague of mine recommended Kenney Fort Pub for their brews and food. We finally got over there today for lunch to try it out and holy cow were we impressed! The location is tucked away in a commercial development and their frontage faces interior to the subdivision. When you get to the entrance you can feel the attention to detail and hospitality the second you walk in. The owner immediately greeted us and seated us right away. The dining area was spacious and airy. The  bar had a nice open feel, with visibility to all the brews on tap. We accessed the menu on our phones and were able to quickly place our order. We enjoyed vanilla beers which were full of flavor, just thought they might be a porter which they weren't. Only recommendation I would make to the owners is to list their beers by category on their menu so folks will gavitate to what they like. The names by themselves of the beers can be a hair unclear on whether they are a stout versus a pilsner kinda thing.   We enjoyed the hot pretzels with beer cheese that was super flavorful. For entrees we had the Kenney Fort Burger which was served on a warm pretzel bun with string fries and an amazing chargrilled burger which was super juicy. My husband has the fish and chips which came with fantastic wedge fries (I would sub for those with my burger next time) and several different dips for the crispy flaky fish. What we found most amazing was that this all happened with the owner running the entire restaurant and bar. He was on point the entire time and we had an amazing experience.  Lastly (and my personal favor), when he brought us the check, it had an RFID to pay on our phones using Toast. For anyone during this pandemic who has eaten out and either had to wait forever for a server to process your payment...or worse, had a server standing over you awkwardly handing you a device for you to pay your bill and put their tip in, you will appreciate this user-friendly and easy option to complete your check and close out your meal. LOVE LOVE LOVED THIS!  Enjoyed our entire experience and most definitely this is our go-to place going forward. Can't wait to try more beer selections and other menu items!"

This definitely brought me back to my Navy days of Portsmouth and London Pub style fish and chips! Perfectly battered and fried with that nice light crunch when you bite into it. The buffalo cauliflower bites was a first time try for me also. All vegetables need too be made this way. Not too spicy but just right.  This was a takeout order and everything was still hot and crispy when I got home. Perfect spot for any occasion."

                "description": "I've always been told that British food is boring and bland.  After eating it for the first time at The Kenney Fort British Pub, I can undoubtedly tell you, that is not the case.  The first British food item I had become really curious of is a Scotch Egg and I was finally able to get my hands on one here.  A Scotch Egg is a boiled egg wrapped in sausage, coated in bread crumbs and then deep fried or baked.  Simple enough, but Kenney Fort serves it on top of chopped and pickled veggies that takes it to another level.  I would come back here just for the Scotch Egg alone.  My wife ordered Fish and Chips which was battered and fried to perfection.  I'm not big on fish, but I asked for more than just one bite and enjoyed it very much.  It came with a side of tartar, curry, as well as mushy peas, which were delicious.  I ordered Bangers and Mash, which came with three sausage links, mashed potatoes, and peas in a tasty, tasty gravy.  This dish was top notch and surpassed my expectations.  Every bite was packed with flavor and very enjoyable.  The beer options here are plentiful, which also contains many local brewery selections.  Unfortunately, it was noon when we came, and a bit too early for me to crack one open.  However, we are both very excited to try them out as well as some of Kenney Fort's other food items."

                "description": "Was there about 9 pm last night. My companion wanted a really good burger and Yelp gave us this place.   We were the only patrons eating at tables. There were a few guys at the bar. Since I wasn't really hungry, we decided to order their signature burger which is made with ground brisket and ground meat from short ribs. I asked for it to not be overcooked. We talked about the cooking temperature with the waitress and she assured us it would be cooked medium. When it came out it was more like well-done. Pretty dry meat and not all that tasty. The bun seemed like it was homemade and was good, as were all the veggies they put on it. Fries were nothing special.   We will be back and I will try their fish and chips.   Service was good and the prices for what we had were consistent with 2021 inflation prices. I am sure this would be the place to be when a soccer game was on.   Music playing on their sound system was very good too."

I came across the Fort Kenney Pub in Yelp and knew that the following Saturday would start with a fry up!  When we walked in, the staff were all super friendly and welcoming. It wasn't busy as it was still early but there was plenty of seating and the football could be seen from most of them.  The food was great and everything I had hoped for! I subbed black pudding for an extra sausage which our server was more than happy to do. The sausages were really delicious!  Really enjoyed spending my Saturday morning here eating a yummy breakfast. I would love to come back to try some of the other meals on the menu!"

                "description": "Today, on this lazy, rainy, gloomy, post-#AustinBlizzard2021 Sunday, Hubs and I were on the hunt for some true comfort food! Thus, we knew that crossing the proverbial pond was a must! This is how we found ourselves at Kenney Fort Pub. Can I just say, y'all, that what we had here was just what we needed? This is true English pub food, and it warmed the very cockles of our very recently frigid hearts!   Hubby went with the English Breakfast! As he was wolfing it down, he looked up at me with an actual sparkle in his eyes, and he said, \"Do you know what this reminds me of most recently, honey?\", and I said, \"Yep!\"! I knew right away that he was referring to that Irish Breakfast that he got at the military part of the airport in Shannon, Ireland, on the way to his too long deployment in Afghanistan in 2018! The picture that he sent me on WhatsApp of that breakfast in that airport is burned in my memory forever!   I went with the Sunday Roast, and it was bloody fantastic, as well! The picture tells the whole story! So good! Chris ate 3/4ths of it, which is our usual division of restaurant food, but I just loved everything about it! The horseradish sauce was MAGIC! I could bathe in it!   We ended with the Sticky Toffee Pudding, and damn, y'all! Just damn!  Bottom line: if you've never tasted either of these traditional plates across the pond, but you're the sort that likes little tastes of many things, both of these dishes will be RIGHT up your alley!   And, even if you're not down for little tastes of many things, you'll absolutely wax poetic about that pudding!   What a fantastic find!   p.s. Our server was Noah, and he was a gem!"

                "description": "A solid 4 star experience!  I loved the fish (the chips were ok!). The burger was smokey and the meat was fresh. The fries that came with the burger were tasty. Everything was well seasoned. The kids fish and chips was great and my 5 year old ate it up.   I did not like the tikka masala. It was not creamy and felt heavy on the cumin. It was a smaller portion and not very much sauce. This was the only dish I didn't care for.     Also, when you pack up a to go order, please package the naan separate from thee sauce. It was packed together and the naan was all covered in the sauce that I didn't like so I didn't eat that either.    They need clearer instructions on what their pickup curbside process is. It was a little confusing but we just called and the man who answered brought our food out.  Maybe we were supposed to go get it inside?  I don't know.    I'm glad Kenney Fort Pub is in our neighborhood. I am sure  that we will be ordering curbside from them frequently."

I feel they either put an Texas flare or their own take on what British food taste like.    The burger was good, you  can't really mess up a burger.. well, maybe. The banger and mash, yall.... no. It tasted like a warmed up Slim Jim, the mashed potatoes had an odd flavor that none of could place. Maybe the mustard?  The staff was very helpful but it kinda sucked I couldn't even get a paper menu, my QR reader wasn't working on my phone.   I'll give it another try but will definitely not get B and M again!"

I feel like they could have done better to give it a pub feel. It feels nothing like a pub which was disappointing.  I'm docking one star for the Pimm's Cup. It's made with that awful soda machine Minute Laud Lemonade. It was horrendous! That was all I could taste. Simple syrup and Minute Made Lemonade.  I also docked a star for the music. It was SO LOUD. My husband and I couldn't talk. Literally. Couldn't hear each other. We were starting to question whether we're hitting an age where we say things like \"the music is too loud\", but no. No no no. This was freaking ridiculous! They had a lady there playing it for an hour before she started what I think was a quiz or game. Music should add ambiance. This felt like we were sitting front row at a concert. It was insanity. To the point I'm totally okay removing a star because of it.  We'll probably go back for the food, but if we're in the mood for a cocktail, or conversation, it won't be high on our list."

                "description": "Can't believe I haven't written a review here yet.  I went out of my way to get here. Was so looking forward to eating real British food.   I was going to be out this way during my first vaccine shot at Dell Diamond.  It was around lunch that I arrived here.  Waited a short time until they opened. Yes, I was the first one there.  First stop was to the loo.  Yes, it was labeled Loo. Started off with an order of iced tea.  Sorry, Brits no hot tea on a hot day. I asked the server if I could possible try the Black pudding they serve with breakfast. Turns out the server was one of the owner. So I got a slice. Ordered up a Scottish Egg and a plate of Bangers and mash.  I have had Scottish eggs before. These were a bit different because they used British sausage.   British sausage is very much leaner than US sausage.  The sausage meat surrounding the soft boiled egg was denser.  And it was served with picalilli (British salsa).  Loved these starters. Next up the bangers and mash and a slice of black pudding. Had to try the black pudding first.  Trust me it is not a pudding but a blood, oatmeal, pork fat, spices sausage. Before you turn your nose up, try it. A little nibble and interesting flavor. Bigger bite and it was good, before I knew it I finished it off and wish I had more. The banger was a Cumberland made sausage.  Lean pork shoulder meat makes it different than US sausages. Once you get over the difference, It is really good. But the mash potatoes, oh wow. They add mustard and cheddar cheese to theirs. Next batch of mash, I plan on adding mustard to mine. Now if that isn't enough, Red Onion gravy.  Take a slice of sausage, dip into the mash and make sure you have the gravy on it.... Prefect bite. I keep thinking the next time I go, I will get the fish and chips. But as I am writing this, all I can think about is the Bangers and Mash."

They also have different visiting food trucks which makes it fun and interesting. We went for Oktoberfest and really enjoyed the German food truck and had BBQ another day. Rentsch has plenty of outdoor, shaded seating and the beer selection is impressive with lots of interesting seasonal offerings - I really enjoyed the apple streusel seasonal beer. We'll absolutely be back."

We always bring games to play or invite friends to spend a few hours with. They have great seating inside and outside, with covered areas and fans. A beautiful garden with trees and a nice country view surrounding the brewery. Husband and I even had a small, intimate wedding here last fall! The staff are also very kind and always put a smile on our faces. 10/10 recommend if you're just visiting or a local looking for a new spot."

They have a good variety of beer on the menu and have a really nice, relaxing outdoor space. the service is fast and friendly. They rotate food trucks so there is always something available to munch on.  We had such a good experience that we decided to join the 2021 mug club. Ask about it!"

The blonde was really good also and my husband had the one up from the Hefeweizen, \"hef's  big brother\", and it was also tasty but too heavy for me. I'm more of a wine drinker but if you like beer you'd love it. We took our two kids and they had fun being outdoors with us. We ate at the food truck and had a family Sunday funday. Highly recommend!"

                "description": "Cool little brewpub in Georgetown. They have two IPAs that caught my attention. Their Rentsch IPA is quite malty east coast style. Plus one had her usual lite Blonde ale and she was OK with it. She was not thrilled with the crisp finish but she did empty her pint. There is a cozy bar area with TVs and with the Temps reaching 100 degrees we chilled out there. There is also a nice beer garden with fans on the deck but even with the abundance of shade trees, it was too darn hot to be outside.  Lastly, the bartenders are pleasant and knowledgeable and will provide excellent guidance if you are a newbie. They do have some interesting specialty/seasonal beers that I must go back and try. Solid 4 stars!"

                "description": "I will preface this review with three biases.  1. I love beer 2. I love outdoor setups in Texas rural areas 3. I am a Red Raider  This is was our first trip out and loved it!  The beers were delicious.  I had the IPA, the double IPA, and the Amber.  Wife had the blonde and the Hefe.    My favorite was the IPA then the Hefe and then the Double.  Can't wait to go back and try more.  I missed the details on the mug club,  but like the concept and will have to check it out.  A little far from my house so not sure if the bang is worth the buck based on my frequency.  The atmosphere was fantastic.  Great patio and open space areas.  There was a Youngman playing cover music but there was enough space to where he didn't seem loud.  There was plenty of games and we brought some toys and our kid and others had a blast running around.  It was beautiful and spacious, yet plenty of space inside for when it it gets to crazy Texas temps in the summer.  Only bummer was the food truck was broke down so we just ordered Dominos instead! How easy is that?!  Looking forward to the next visit and recommend you check it out too"

Had a great time, mother's day specials. Tried the Poppy Fest Red Ale. Right down my alley. Great place, great beer. I was a little disappointed w Pat's BBQ. Seemed to be over cooked. It was later in day and they were running out. I would give them another go. Can't  bash Rentsch for food truck."

Especially since I'm not the biggest \"craft-beer drinker\" he suggested the blonde which was just what I was looking for.  My friends had the doublerumtoberfest and rate it 10/10!!  I love the open concept that makes the space seem larger than it is. We came at 1pm on A Saturday, not too many people just A few family's enjoying their day. Their patio area looks super cozy but it's too cold today so I'll be back!"

                "description": "I was recently in Georgetown for the 20th Anniversary Annual Meeting of the Texas Master Naturalists. I stayed in my camper at Cedar Breaks and commuted daily to the conference at the Sheraton. I was at the Sheraton from dark to dark attending classes every day but the last. The conference ended at noon, and I headed straight to Rentsch.  I got a flight of beers and went outside to drink them. I was the only one there for the first twenty minutes or so. That gave me the freedom to move around from place to place. The outside area is really nice. I tried full sun areas and shaded areas. There were several bees in the area that pestered me, adding to my moves. The wind chimes were also a nice touch.  I liked all of the beers I tried. But two of them were amazing. They were the Bourbon Barrel Double Oktoberfest (2017) and the Double Rumtoberfest. Believe me, if I weren't alone and responsible for my own transportation back to camp, I would have stayed and had a few more Rumtoberfests. It was everything I like in a craft beer.  Georgetown was such a great to visit. I know I will be back to camp at Cedar Breaks. That obviously means that I will be back to the brewery. I only hope they have another beer as awesome as the Oktoberfest and Rumtoberfest. I am sure they are seasonal, and probably won't be on tap next time."

The food truck out back is far better than it has any right to be, with delicious mexican food at a reasonable price.   I highly recommend the fish and barbacoa tacos, as well as the burrito+quesadilla. The chips/salsa aren't too shabby either.   Haven't tried the burgers so can't comment on those.   If you want an affordable spot to come eat, drink, and be merry in the Austin area, look no further!   Plenty of space to sit inside, or if the weather is nicer, even more space out back! You order everything at the bar, get your beer immediately, and pick up your food from the truck out back if you ordered that."

I think it's the hazy kind, and they mix it up with melony goodness (love melons - all kinds of melons). Your palate ends up fielding a fruity punch; no getting your jaw kicked in by puckering hops. Great shit. They made it year round too, with the badass stylized can design and all (most of those ones are seasonal only).  With that being said, please offer La Verdad year round. Please  These dudes' merch game is on point, they really need to take their little stylized logo print for the cans and sell it on more apparel. Whoever does their art is a fucking genius. I love my Cold Glory shirt and my Megaflora mask. I love my Lazer Salad pint glass cup thing. They have a bunch of badass koozie designs. Basically, their merch game is next level already, but I see so much potential. I guess they are keeping their operation relatively small scale, and there are only so many ppl who are going to buy brewery merchandise in central Texas, but I dunno. Love the art.   At the end of the day, though, nobody is going to buy any merchandise if the beer sucks. Beerworks' beer does not suck. The new Eastern Philosophy beer they came out with is a great example of Austin Beerworks' beer not sucking. When I read it was a jasmine tea infused lager (I love jasmine tea) I had to check it out. Super solid, 7.5% but doesn't taste like it. You're supposed to drink it over ice. So novel, so well thought out, and so well executed. ABW's motto (I think) is \"Hellbent on Excellence\" and they are certainly living up to that standard. I'm so fortunate to live here in Austin with great breweries like ABW. I'll be even more fortunate when I can walk into HEB and buy La Verdad year round, but that'll come in time. Thanks, Austin Beerworks."

                "description": "I  came here the other day with a friend to have a chat and really get ready to center ourselves for the week ahead. I ordered a Lazer Salad which is a double IPA.   Here is the breakdown:   The beer appears as a golden amber color with a one finger head of white  foam. The aroma of the brew gives a tropical fruit vibe with hints of tangerine and mango mixed with some  undertones of a grapefruit hop and a little bit of pine. The taste begins with a tropical fruit sweetness mixed with a  doughy taste. As the taste lingers, more and more hop comes to the  tongue starting out with grapefruit followed by some flavors of an herbal and pine hop. The body of the brew is average in thickness and creaminess  with a carbonation level that is lighter. Overall this is a well-balanced fruity IPA that if you are not careful can put you on your ass!  #supportlocal"

                "description": "Excellent brewery, parking can be a challenge during the weekend. They have some the finest craft brews on tap in Austin. I have enjoyed their Mexican style lager and other Pilsner style brews. They have some nice tropical IPA to satisfy even the most discerning of beer drinking palates. At least 8 tables outside that have shade, which provide a nice social gathering space to enjoy a sunny Austin afternoon with a beer and some fresh air as you contemplate the mysteries of the Universe. There is also a food truck that serves some decent fish tacos."

I had 2 of the cranberry frozen mimosas, which I could have sipped on all day. I was glad to see they offered other things besides just their beer. The space was perfect for our fundraiser. My kid enjoyed the play area with the hill/tunnel and there were plenty of other kids for her to play with. I'd definitely come back here to hang out with friends or family."

Your staff was amazing. It was a perfect way to pay tribute to our friend, and y'all were so great as everyone struggled to leave on time. You could have been rigid about shooing us out the door on the dot, but your staff showed great generosity of spirit toward a grieving group, many of whom were in from out of state. Thanks for creating such a warm, welcoming space for this event. You demonstrated the best of Austin, Texas hospitality and friendliness."

                "description": "I feel conflicted giving a fairly low rating given I consistently think of ABW as one of the top handful of breweries in Austin, but I'm giving this as a rating of the taproom experience moreso than a rating of their beers. I've also only gone during Covid, so I'm looking forward to giving them a try in the future when I can comfortably get the full experience.   Compared to other patios in the area I find theirs to be pretty lacking. There were no fans in the summer and no heat lamps in the winter. Their space isn't particularly large so there are fewer tables than other locations. This leads it to be uncomfortably packed on weekends, both in terms of how close tables are and the lack of distancing enforced in lines.   One weird thing working against them is just how available their beer is around town. Every HEB and bar will have at least a couple of ABW's beers available, so they lose out on the necessity of going to the taproom to try their beers. Even their seasonals get around town pretty well both in stores and on tap elsewhere.   On that note, and to not make this review totally negative, their beer is absolutely phenomenal. All their flagships are good to great examples of the style, my personal favorites are the Sun Shovel (think blue moon but with some hop prescence) and Fire Eagle (leans more towards West Coast IPA, but has enough juiciness to be really refreshing in the summer time).   Their seasonals also absolutely knock it out of the park. Sputnik (Coffee Oatmeal Stout) is an absolute must if you're in Austin in December and is probably the best beer I've had since moving here. The Heisenberg (a combination of a Pilsner and Hef) and Black Thunder (Black Lager) are two other stand outs to me.  The food truck is good enough that if you need something to snack on while you're there you won't be totally dissatisfied, but I've usually felt compelled to go elsewhere for food.  Overall, can't recommend their beer enough, but you don't need to visit the taproom to get the full experience."

                "description": "After three months of sheltering at home, Austin Beer Works was a first outing.  They did an excellent job with social distancing, wiping down each table after guests left, and mask enforcement (when not seated at table) in a firm but polite way.    No inside seating right now and the outdoor tables are shaded and a good distance apart. It is reservations only. depending on the time you make the reservation for, you will either get an hour to enjoy your table or two hours.  They go over all the rules with you when you arrive.  They have some great beers, both on tap and in cans. You can purchase some to take home with you as well!  I ordered a sour raspberry-lemon Einhorn.  So summery and refreshing!  I ended up drinking two.  My husband had an Essential IPA and the Small Spoon session IPA.   We didn't care for the Heisenberg Heff-lager (a bit too banana-ish).  The only thing that would have made the difference from 4 stars to 5 would have been some kind of food! Even a bag of chips or pretzels to go with the beer would have been awesome! We saw a food truck parked there but unfortunately it was not open."

This place is so beautiful and spacious inside! Was pretty crowded since I went during rush hour. Also, parking was a bit difficult to get. There are 3 other big restaurants near by and it gets packed to where people park on the sides.   Same exact menu as what I could remember from the one on Burnet rd. Their service was pretty fast for all the food we got. Started off with the appetizer - Beer mates, basically a cheesy bread. Nothing too special but a good starter if everyone wants more food. Had two medium sized pizza for the 3 of us. Ordered \"The Works\" \"Ohh Lala\". The works is basically their deluxe pizza, can't go wrong with that! The Ohh lala was on the sweeter side with the delicious arugula.   There were plenty of beer choices to choose from. Grabbed an IPA (completely forgot the name). Would definitely come back again! ;)"

Expect a bit of an adventure trying to find a seat at this location during busy hours. It's a chill place to sit, eat and watch sports or hang out with friends and have a couple of drinks.

Walk in and turn left to place your order at the counter.  If you want to drink .. walk in and go straight to the bar.  They have salads, apps and several speciality pizzas ... sized from individual to family. You get soda from the fountain (cherry, cream, cola, etc) or beer from the tap (too many to cover here).   There are a few booths and tables but mainly it is community seating at 20' long tables. Kind of cool I think.  TVs everywhere ... watched baseball and ESPN. I bet this place is lit on Sat and Sun for football.  So the food? I really liked the beer mates .. garlic cheese bread. Good size and flavor for just $5. I had the pear honey pizza .. add blue cheese, basil and pancetta. I really liked the way the flavors all stuck out .. sweet, herby, salty ... love it!!"

The bartender, without my consent, reversed those charges and put them all on a new single charge. Without honoring our tokens. I saw all this once I had gone home and saw my bank account. I only asked to either give us two tokens or refund us the price of two drinks. I reached out twice to management with hearing only crickets. At this point my entire tab should be refunded for lack of consideration and loyalty of a company."

I tried their Electric Jellyfish Beer and recommend it highly. My wife ordered the gluten free crust and said it was the best gluten free pizza she has had. If you are retired and looking for a great place for a long lunch go after 1:30 to avoid the  lunch crowd."

                "description": "This is a good spot to come hang and catch a game on the TV while you enjoy some craft pizzas and beers. You order the food and beer separately, food from a walkup counter and beer from the bar in the middle of the restaurant. You get a buzzer puck when you order food so the servers can locate you and bring it to your table. We ordered the Beer Mates and Pizza Roll appetizers to start and two pizzas, the Oo La La and the Shroomin' Goat. Food timing was staggered and the only real hiccup was that the Beer Mates appetizer order seemed to have gotten lost because we had to ask for it after all the rest of our order had trickled out, and it then took about 15min more for it to finally arrive. But, when it did, it was piping hot and fresh, so that's good. Food quality was very good and we enjoyed everything we ordered."

                "description": "I thought the name referred to the beers they serve and while that is probably the inspiration, I find it sad that it also refers to the amount of grease in their pizza (about a pint).  If you love pepperoni or sausage  grease then this is the place for you.   If you don't then don't get these meats on your pizza.  I hope the kitchen learns about skimming  fat off their more flavor proteins to prevent the crust from being a fatty sponge.  Happy Sunday everyone."

I love Hefeweizen and have drank my fair share while stationed in Germany for four years as well as here in the USA. This was the worst glass of Hefeweizen that I've ever had. It was very disappointing, tasted watered down, and had very little flavor. The Live Oak Brewing Company Hefeweizen is much better, and it's the best I've had in the Austin area. Other than that, the place was clean and the staff was friendly. Again, this review is solely based on their Cedrela Hefeweizen."

Only reason for the 4 starts is today we came for what had to be the 6th or 7th  time and got kicked to the outside patio for having a dog. This is ALWAYS the brewery I go to when it's hot because they allowed dogs inside. I've had every other bartender let my dog in, love on him and have had zero problem sitting inside with him. Even their Facebook has a picture of a dog inside. Today we were told that was never allowed and should have been told to go outside. We have also seen many other dogs inside during past visits. I hate inconsistent rules. Also, super sad that we'll have to find a new brewery this summer. It's too hot to be outside and my dogs nickname is the the brewery dog.  I'll still support them during cooler months-- but dog owners should know the rules have changed. Very sad. Wish they would have posted something about this change."

We got a selection of beers, I personally really enjoyed the Mango Crazy wheat beer and the Keyboard Gansta IPA. The service was also very friendly and they offered some samples if you are in between choices.   The taco truck outside was also very good! I highly recommend one of their loaded fries. The fries were perfectly crispy and tender in the middle, and super flavorful toppings. The tacos were also yummy and I'm a huge corn lover so the elote bowl was perfect.   I will definitely be back to try more of their seasonal beers!"

                "description": "It's been a hot minute since I visited Whitestone- I think the last time I was here was in 2016, when it was quieter and a lot more laid back.  Fast forward to 2021 - the city of cedar park and Leander are booming.  There is a huge influx of population. The tables at Whitestone are full, there is a food truck (which is awesome) as a permanent fixture BUT the overall customer experience has left me disappointed.  Maybe because it's a Sunday with lovely weather, the guy behind the bar is done with people, or, he isn't a people person , or, he just didn't like the way I looked? But man was it hard to get him to give me an effing beer without getting hateful glances. Yeesh. Im kinda scared of coming back here now!  That aside, im not really a fan of their beer selection either - the kolsch is OK but I've had better. I guess the biggest advantage is the proximity to both CP and Leander and for the people who live around here.  So, this isn't much of a review rather than a semi rant ?   Also guys- kids have a tendency to move around from one side of the table to the other. They're not capable of sitting still and neither are you. If you'd rather than families stay away, just tell us to our faces."

                "description": "Austin is rich with craft breweries and 4th Tap is an excellent addition to the mix. I went there recently with my son and DIL to enjoy their beer and treat ourselves to some outstanding Laotian street for from the SXSE food truck. My favorite was the coffee stout but the amber ale was worthy of another taste.   Located in the obligatory warehouse area the facilities encourage family and pet attendance. Inside seating has a wide variety of games for those at  a loss for words. Outside seating is ample with umbrellaed picnic tables.   Also, it's within walking distance of Q2 Stadium.   Will I be back?  Youbetcha."

Now that businesses are starting to reopen they've begun reintroducing some of their staple events like Good Set. Love seeing local comedians while enjoying a delicious flight.

                "description": "First, I must profess.  As much as I love my hometown of San Antonio, Austin really has it going on regarding the microbrewery/brewpub scene.   There are so many options in the ATX and 4th Tap Brewing should NOT be overlooked. From their awesome craft beers, to their homemade pizzas, this place has it going on!  Beer - they have precanned beers, crowlers and growlers to go, as well as a handful of fresh beer on tap if you want to hang out in this cool joint/  On my visit, they had nine beers on tap, and I settled on the \"Can You Dig It\" amber ale.  It was definitely good, and I would get it again the next time I visit, but it was pretty similar to an amber ale you can find anywhere else. A little sweet, a little caramel taste to it, and just the right amount of hops - but not too much!  I didn't sample them, but they also have a could of IPAs, a sour, and a couple of different stout types.  Now, let's talk about the food! The pizza is SUPERB! They have several pizzas geared toward carnivores and herbivores alike.  If you don't see a prebuilt pizza that appeals to you, you can always build your own custom pizza.  They also have a handful of salads.  My friends from the ATX shared the 12\" \"Backdraft\" pizza for $12.99 with me.  It was LOADED with huge slices of pepperoni, jalapenos, and house made spicy Italian style sausage. The crust was thin and crispy.  Even if you don't like beer, I recommend stopping by here for a pizza - it.was.that.good!"

We booked a table a couple hours before we were planning to meet up.  Staff was super friendly. Beer was great...loved the Running Man, didn't really care for the gingerbread. Outdoor space was nice and spacious. Definitely felt safe during covid times. Food from the truck was delicious. Props to SXSE because their food is absolutely delicious. I had the beef skewers and upgraded to crispy rice. It was so flavorful and delicious.  Thanks 4th tap for the ease of booking a table, keeping things safe during covid, serving delicious beer and having such a great food truck."

                "description": "Here's why I luv 4th Tap  1.) Great drinkable, delicious beer!  My current favs are: ALL OF THEM!  haha I'm kidding.  Try Stay Gold and Kung Fu Robot.  They're so good you will want more.    2.) Great staff.  Really nice, accommodating, and they keep everyone's safety in mind by wearing masks and sanitizing ALL THE TIME!  So no CardiB, I won't get Corona virus here!   3.) Great vibe.  As a woman, I often think of, \"is it safe for me to drink here alone?\"  when out at bars.  I've never had this concern at 4th Tap.  4th Tap is open and bright and has lots of space to be alone or hang with guests.   As I mentioned the staff are great and wear masks and they look out for their guests in other ways, too.    4.) Great bar seats. Great bar seats are an unrated variable and let me tell y'all, I don't slide off these seats!  They're comfy and allow me to drink more beer.  Cause it's all about the beer!"

Offering eight taps to choose from at any given time, including their four core beers and four orbitals. Can order by pint, half pint, and/or flight. Very reasonably priced... and several little options for self entertainment including board games, a TV, and a piano. A must stop if visiting the now named \"Austin Craft Beer Corridor\" (i.e., there are several breweries in the adjacent area). Support local! Cheers to the shared love of good beers!"

You can also sit in the production area as long as you follow the rules such as \"1. Be Cool\" and of course, others like don't touch the equipment. The parking area is very limited but the location can be accessed by public transportation. Outside they also had a pizza food truck.    Fun place to hang out!"

                "description": "Solid brewery, but I wish there was more varieties of beer offered.  I opted for the flight, which is 5 for $12, but you have to go for the 3 core and can only choose 2 orbitals. It's a shame because I didn't care for 1 of the core items, a really fruity gluten-free beer. (I had a sample and didn't really like it).  Fortunately, I asked really nicely if I could swap it out for an orbital, and the employee said she could. But when my cousin tried the same, she was denied.  +2 Vitality (Core): Spring Ale-and their lightest beer they offer. Smooth and good flavor. Perfect for if you're looking for a light beer.  Zephyr (Core): American Pale Ale-A little more hop to it, but still a smooth and light option.   Long Walk-Grapefruit IPA-Light notes of citrus, hoppy, and refreshing. But in an increasingly crowded market of grapefruit beers, this one gets lost.  Mega-Citrus One-Double IPA-Basically a stronger version of Long Walk. To me, it tasted almost identical, which makes me wonder with such a limited menu, this one is offered. (But then again, why did I choose to sample it? Not too sure myself.)  Brick Top-Robust Porter. I'm not a porter drinker. At all. But once I started sipping, I really enjoyed it. This is a popular and enjoyable one.  Sample cup pours are generous and the prices are really good for the amount you get. (I couldn't finish my entire sample flight!). There indoor seating as well as seating 'outside' in the brewery area. There is a ping-pong table, plenty of board games, and apparently, rambunctious wrestling matches that happening quarterly that brings the whole neighborhood out.  I didn't get to see any wrestling happen this time around, so all in all 4th Tap offers good beer at good prices, but I'm looking for something more to wow."

The space is nice and the AC was turned up, so it was a great respite from the heat. Got a flight of their beers and not a bad one in the bunch! The bartenders were very friendly and knowledgeable and were able to make some solid and informed beer recs for my date who had no idea what beer he wanted.   There is even a piano randomly sitting amongst the tables and a random patron got up from his table, chugged the rest of his pint, waltzed over the piano, took a seat and then started playing and belting out Billy's Joel's \"Pianoman\". A pint w/free entertainment is always a plus!   Can see myself coming back in periodically to check out the new stuff on the rotation"

                "description": "Another unassuming microbrewery in a warehouse that opens into a glorious playground for adults. I wish I had gotten the names of the bartenders because they were so sweet to my mother, who is a lightweight and does not drink alcohol, but was feeling adventurous :) They even went out of their way to grab a beer they were out of on tap, but had a can of it in the back for her to try. She loved it, so she got it on the house. Incredible customer service.   There are plenty of large picnic tables in the taproom, and a whole shelf of board games to keep you and guests entertained. There is a grand piano off to the side of the room, so you know fun times are had here.   In the brew house, there is more seating, a wrestling ring (not sure I get it?), and a ping pong table! Game on.   I really enjoyed the grapefruit hints of the Longwalk as well as the tamarind acidity of the Renewal. Tasting is highly encouraged here as well. My family and I enjoyed ourselves immensely. At the end of the night, I paid a $12 tab! Great drinkin' to do on a budget!  Thanks for taking care of us and for being awesome at life!   -xoxo"

Not your traditional pupusa or cortido, but I still enjoyed it. The flour tortillas were really good. Cubano is the perfect beer food though.

Lots of little games and lighting. I love a place that offers 4oz pours so you can buy ole your own flights. The food was good and fast. Will be back!"

Plenty of tables and areas to social distance, while supporting a local business!   While we only visited during the soft opening, we know that Willards will be a fantastic addition to the Pflugerville area!   Willards Brewery features the Mojo Austin Food Truck!! (Separate IG accounts by the way) The Cubano Quesadilla, Braised Beef Taco, and Beef and Cheese Pupusa are allllll a must have!!  I recommend the green salsa since it's nice and hot, as well!"

                "description": "Willards is my new favorite neighborhood brewery. Their beers are all solid and the taproom is a great place to get out of the house safely during covid. I really appreciate that they have a menu that caters to everyone, not just beer drinkers. I love their hard seltzer cocktails and they also have mead and a few guest taps from other breweries. The Mojo food truck is amazing - their pork tacos are to die for!  As far as the physical space goes, the patio is gorgeous and they have campfires going at night to keep you cozy. Everything is very well spaced out, too."

                "description": "Willard's is right around the corner from our home, but we tried it for the first time last night (it won't be the last). The first thing you notice as you walk into the beer garden is the nice outdoor space with a pleasant ambiance. They have picnic style tables in and outside, they keep the indoor space very open (making us feel safer during COVID era). The lights outside provide a nice touch, as well as the music- played at a low enough volume that we don't have to raise our voices to hear one another.   Now as for the drinks: their stout is amazing and smooth and very chocolatey. Their seltzers all have such unique taste combinations and are NOT overly sweet, like some of the big name brands. The strawberry tangerine reminded me of a Haribo gummy bear! The coconut papaya was delicious and I went back and forth between tasting the coconut and the papaya most. They even have cocktail like drinks that are good for those who don't enjoy beer or seltzer. My partner ordered the Hazy IPA and liked it enough to buy a six-pack to take home. George was our bartender. He has such a calm and respectful demeanor. He was really great and made the experience of tasting some of the drinks for the first time so pleasant.   The food truck is so reasonable in price and was delicious! It was so nice to have something other than typical bar food. Austin (chef) brings out the orders so quickly and is super kind! Their guacamole is really interesting and we all devoured it, their salsas are spicy and fresh, and they even have a mushroom taco with a black bean puree for those of us who don't eat meat. Everyone at our table enjoyed the food (other items ordered were pork nachos, Cuban quesadilla, and the pupusa).   Overall we loved our experience, and will definitely be back to visit this hidden treasure."

Tried the place on a Sunday afternoon and expected more patrons there were only 3 other tables. Great service from the employees offering tasting of different beers and seltzer's and you've got to try the Mojo Cuban food truck - can recommend the quesadilla for sure. Look for us on a Sunday with our Am Staf puppy named Daisy."

Soccer, basketball, etc. We want to make sure this great option for watching sports is supported and sticks around! Call ahead if you like to make sure your game is on, and invite lots of friends! Long haul: We started going as a covid-friendly option and came to love everything about it. I can't speak to the beer, but I drink the small but good selection of wine and eat the food. The food is really special, honestly. Small but perfect menu. Elevated cuisine for a casual setting. The space outside is so cute. It's thoughtfully landscaped to feel like a getaway whether you're at a picnic table or sitting around the fire. The dog watching is ON POINT too. The people make the place, as everyone that works there has been so kind to us during covid and now beyond. It was nice to have a home away from home in unexpected times, and we are still going! It's a fun place to be, so get a group together for HH or dinner!"

Skip the crowd at Rock Rose Ave and come to Adlbert's instead. Not a single thing I would change about Adelbert's!    Adelbert's serves more than just brews, they also serve ciders, meads, wines, and non-alcoholic beverages. If you have never had meads, I'd start slow with a sample, as it's very potent in flavor! The Dale was refreshing, while the Sauvignon Blanc was a crisp white wine.   If you are wanting to host events of any kind, Adelbert's is here for it. Scott, the owner and Sean, the manager are incredibly accommodating!! They were so sweet to open early and to even allow the food truck on site to help cater to us. If you are looking for a quick tour, you can ask them as well to check out their facilities."

Unfortunately, they do not allow dogs inside. As a dog owner who lives in the brewery district, this establishment is simply off my list anytime I go out with my little gal.   I do love this place but it's hard to give a perfect score to a place I can't frequent. Especially when they have ~10 competitors in a 5 minute radius and none of them share the same policy. As a result, I am updating my review from 5 to 4 stars."

They have an outdoors area that's shaded for those with doggos or who want to enjoy the heat and eat from their food truck. I had the Triple B, which was surprisingly crisp and floral for a belgian. They had a variety of beers which I wanted to taste, but we arrived late with one hour to spare before closing. That just means I need to pay another visit to truly enjoy the place.  They have a private parking area shared with neighboring businesses and strong wifi. The best part is the indoors games like 4-player Mario Kart (WHAT!), darts, and a bunch of board games. They also give free stickers, plus our lady taptender that day was so kind and welcoming."

However I checked out their site, saw they had some wine options and a food truck--so I happily tagged along. The bartender who greeted us gave us the rundown of everything. Served us with a smile and was very informative about the beers, of course. I had a great bottle of pinot grigio while my friends enjoyed the various beers available. I had a great time checking out the art that they have on the walls for sale. We also played a game of jumbo sized connect four and Mario Kart on the big screen. A large collection of board games are also available to borrow while hanging out enjoying your drink in the taproom. Very cool place, warm vibes. Great food truck on site as well.

                "description": "Three words: Belgium style brews! Oh my goodness, where have you been hiding from me Adelbert's?! This is by far one of my most favorite craft breweries in all of Austin, if not in the United States. For those of you that really know me, you know that I L.O.V.E. Belgian beers...so much so that, yes, I traveled to Belgium JUST for the beers (okay, I ate some mussels and saw some pretty cool stuff too, but...). For those of you not in the know (no insult meant for those who are), Belgian style beers are pretty high in ABV, so amateurs enter gently. Just looking out for my Yeeps! :D  Adelbert's doesn't look like much at all from the outside. Tucked away in a warehouse district, it can a tad difficult to find, particularly at night - just look for the little white lights and the picnic tables outside. Park, walk through the plastic flat \"doors\" and you will discover a beautiful huge space with stacks and stacks of barrels, merchandise for sale, lots of local art hanging on the walls to purchase adds to the ambiance; plus games to play such as giant Jenga, foosball, and darts and that's one fine outing.   But the beer! Oh my gosh - the beer. Handcrafted at its best. So amazingly fantastic and such a great deal. On your first visit be certain to buy the 6 half pour (really close to full pours - yay) tastings for $13. You get to keep the glass and get $2 off beers when you bring it back on your next visit. Regular prices range from $4-6 a glass, which is phenominal in the first place for such high quality ale.   ALL great, two personal standouts for me were: *Flyin' Monks Quadrupel: 10.9%ABV, aged in rum barrels with hints of spice, deep, dark, and lovely. *Philosophizer Saison: An easy choice. 7.8% ABV, very mild carbonation with a hint of pepper. Fantastic.     To add some icing to this already oh so sweet find, the founder and brewmaster Scott and staff cannot be any more friendly or knowledgeable about the beers and brewery.   Highly highly highly recommend. Simply doesn't get better than this IMHO. Cheers!  TIPS:  *The brewery has a license so you can take a large bottle home for a reasonable price of about $9 to $12, which is average. They also sell retail at area Austin locations (visit their website for exact locations).  *Tours are available (see website for details).   *They typically have a food truck on site on Saturdays.  *Fido friendly pergola area - not allowed inside."

                "description": "Ya'll are probably already aware of my latest and greatest obsession with collecting pint glasses from assorted breweries. For our first stop in Austin, we stopped by this unassuming warehouse. As we walked in, the live jazz band was jammin' and the beer taps were flowin'.   Michael and his bearded friend were fantastic bartenders. I really appreciated their hospitality. Michael instantly could tell I was new to this particular brewery and proceeded to explain the process to tasting their beer samples. He even noted that I had a minor with me and offered a brewed hibiscus tea for him. They really cater to all ages! We paid $13 for six half poured samples from a souvenir Belgian tasting glass. One yellow wristband later, my siblings and I were playing ping-pong and giant Jenga in the back of the warehouse.  The stringed lights on the ceiling made it feel welcome and homey. They had a wall of local art for sale ranging from $30-$300! I had my eye on a Sinatra painting, and as luck would have it, it was indeed the $300 piece lol. I stared at it longingly for most of the night, but couldn't bring myself to throw down on it. My favorite craft brews of the night were the Naked Nun and the Philosophizer. Brilliant names and great hoppy flavors.  Once it got too muggy in the taproom, we ventured out to get some grub. The food truck of the night was Emoji Grilled Cheese. (See their yelp site for my review) It was mouthwatering and delicious. We visited a couple other breweries throughout our trip, but Adelbert's was my all-time favorite.   Thanks for a great time!   -xoxoxo"

                "description": "Great place to spend an afternoon. This another place where you pay a fee, get a glass and then you get 6 pours of whatever they have on tap. I could only do 4 pours due to a time constraint but what I had was very tasty. The mango wit was a standout for me as I could actually taste the mango unlike some other brews which lose that flavor in the process. Black Rhino was also very tasty. Besides the good beers the place has TVs and games and most importantly art to sell! If I hadn't been flying on that trip there were a couple of pieces I was interested in. Overall a worthy stop in Austin instead of having to drive to Dripping Springs for good beer."

We went during the weekday so it wasn't too busy. Seating: its a small location, best estimate is (six tables inside and three tables outside with umbrellas) 50ish. Not including bar seating (several stools). Drinks options: more of a beer location (great options). Food: Pizza and Wings. Star ratings on the food experience...? Four. Why did i give the Yelp rating five stars, you ask? For the overall experience and result of trying a new place.--I hope this rating contributes to your dining decision. :-)"

                "description": "A revisit to one of my favorite spots in Texas, the Growler Bar - 2022 review.   I love coming here when it's not busy, which I'm finding is becoming more and more difficult as time passes. The place has built up a solid base of loyal customers that seem to return week after week and I can't blame them. There is consistency at work here, the staff is always excellent - they make great recommendations to the ever-changing list of beers on tap, the selection of beers is constantly rotating, and best of all - the food is delicious. We often consider ordering take-out for only the pizza/pizza rolls here.   This place has adapted to changing times, they have more outdoor seating so we're able to socially distance ourselves most of the time and feel safe during our visit. I'm happy to see this place thrive."

BUT, the wings were not ready and had to wait longer. By the time I got the phone order home, the pizza and pizza rolls were cold, tasted very average and doughy.

                "description": "I was in the Pflugerville area and craving pizza. I checked Yelp and this place had great reviews so I headed that way. So first, for some reason, my GPS kept taking me across the street where the Zaxbys and Arbys are located. I finally had the sense to check across the street and there it was! Hard to see from the street, but it's there. Anyways, this is a cool neighborhood pizza and beer bar. Apparently, they change the drafts all the time so you can try different types of beer. Brett at the counter helped me and was very nice. I ordered a pizza to go (pepperoni, Canadian bacon, bacon bits, mushrooms), lemon pepper wings and two Live Oak Hefenweizen beers (yes! You can get two beers to go!). While I waited, I enjoyed yuengling on tap and Brett also let me sample a few beers. The pizza and wings were delicious! I was so hungry that I forgot to take pics, but just trust me, it looked as good as it tasted! I will definitely be back when I'm in the area again."

There's also plenty of tables outside with umbrellas for those with dogs or don't mind the scorching Texas heat.  The pizza is delicious. I can't remember the name of it but it had Canadian bacon, bacon and a sriracha bbq drizzle on it. Crust was delicious, the bottom wasn't soggy near the center.  Also tried the pretzels with beer cheese. Mmmmmm.   A really big beer selection available as well.   Service was great. You order at the bar, get a number and they bring to your table.   Def worth a visit if you're nearby."

                "description": "In my previous review, I neglected to mention something important. This is one of those businesses which require you to pay first and they hit you with the gratuity percentage upfront before you receive your food and service.  The gratuity should come at the end of the meal and service, not at the beginning and I have found this practice puts more money in the business' pocket at your expense.  Now with that said, their pizza, wings and pizza rolls are quite exceptional. they have an extensive beer selection which is always changing around to keep up with the seasons. So if paying upfront along with the gratuity doesn't bother you then we do recommend the fare, however I find it a turn off. Especially since they forgot half of our order and didn't get it to us until we were ready to leave. So basically, one star for the payment practice, but four stars for the food and beer."

We had a beer called Nola- next time we go I'll get a growler but since we weren't going straight home and forgot a cooler that had to wait. Their beer cheese looks like gravy.. it doesn't taste like gravy though- highly suggest! We will definitely be back next time he visits. Nice large patio and clean bathrooms as well."

                "description": "Decent selection of craft beers, but one thing unique about this bar is that they do not allow customers to sample any beers, unlike most of their competitors.  I undetstand the policy to a certain extent, especially if you had very knowledgeable bartenders, but that is not the case here.  During my most recent visit, one person I was with asked for an IPA that was very hoppy, But instead got something but was very sour and totally did not like the taste of the beer. She was stuck with paying for the pint, despite the bartender's error.  The pizza (bbq chicken) was decent, but pretty bready - took away from the tasty toppings - left me feeling like we were served a glorified frozen pizza - we were hungry so we devoured the pizza, but we were disappointed and will thing twice before  ordering it again.  They had some live music, a young man with the guitar singing cover songs, did a very decent job. It helped make the dying experience enjoyable.  It was a great night to sit on the patio, with a nice breeze, some decent music being played, and the company of good friends.  Perhaps they could think about modifying their policy so that you're entitled to one beer sample, as long as you order a full beer.  The bartender stated the reason for the no sample policy was because of Covid... I just do not buy it, given the fact that None of the bars/restaurants that I have gone to the last couple of months have this type of policy."

Unfortunately I didn't get a pic of the wall of beers since I ate outside to enjoy the cool Texas breeze. The pretzel sticks were hot from the oven. The carnivore pizza had enough meat for four pizzas so come ready to eat. I must say the Hefeweizen was very good and close enough to remind you of Germany if you've been. They have have local bands playing nightly so there's also entertainment. The locals know and if you ever take a trip to the area now you do too."

First time coming here - you order at the bar, they give you a number, and then you take it to whatever table is available and that you choose. Look at the food menu before you come because the food menu is only visible at the counter/bar that you order from. The only bummer to the whole experience was that the number they gave us was not the number they gave the kitchen so the food got lost for a little bit because they were looking for a different number.

They split the calzone so it was two separate smaller calzones instead which was awesome. The only thing we recommend is the calzone and pizza rolls might have been slightly over cooked as the top of the crusts were very dark and tough. Probably because they cooked it in the same oven and temperature as the pizzas which makes sense. But this wasn't an issue and the food was still great. Loved our experience"

The pizza is actually quite good (and I'm a midwestern pizza snob) and the service honestly really makes it. Their servers are so friendly and all throughout the COVID restrictions, they followed the protocols and managed to still make it a fun place to go to. We even hit up a couple of Trivia nights with friends on accident and scored some gift cards and had a blast. My only reason for taking a star off were the wings. We tried them a couple of times but the thick, rubbery fat and lack of crispiness were big turnoffs - seemed like they weren't fried but maybe baked? In any case not good. We've got plenty of other deliciousness there, though, so we just order everything else!"

This last time, the beertender sat taking our order (yes, he was sitting behind the bar) and had no suggestions or enthusiasm.  There is no way to order without going inside the bar. During covid, there should be options for this!  The pizza is okay. If you are looking for pepperoni rolls, Pinthouse are much better in my opinion.  We may return for specific beers, but it won't be on our regular rotation with other options in the area."

Walking in gave me comforting coffeeshop vibes, with mostly tables of small parties 2-3 drinking beer and socializing.  Having no idea what to order, staff made some recommendations for a flight that were all fantastic. My favorites were the Cuerno Rojo (lightly carbonated and very smooth) and the Continental Breakfast (heavier stout but tastes just like French Toast and Maple syrup). I had to do a double take that I wasn't just drinking syrup but the flavors were spot on!  I'll be back again with friends/family and hopefully get to enjoy the great coffee I was smelling as well!"

The options here were so amazing and such a fun mix. I did enjoy that even when I ordered coffee they asked if I wanted to start a tab as if I was at a bar. This place was loud and seemed like a great place to enjoy some fun. They do have outdoor seating with heaters and covered. All in all I'd say I will go back again but maybe not on a weekend next time."

                "description": "Just wanted to update this one. Red Horn just gets better and better with age and has really turned into a community institution - especially during the pandemic when they switched to \"to go\" beers that we could all take out to the parking lot and drink while socially distanced. Fortunately those days are past us but I think I will always have a soft spot in my heart for this place that was a little bit of sanity amidst all the insanity.   As for the fare itself? The beers rotate and you can't  go wrong because they will always let you sample (I'm a strawberry pop-tart ravioli fan - and yes that's a beer). Pair that beer (or wine) with a meat and cheese tray or maybe a panini and you have absolutely nothing to complain about. They even have food trucks on most days...  Thanks for being here Red Horn."

I got the Gordon Ramsey coffee and it was obviously made by someone who knows how to craft a latte. I do wish the flavor complimented the espresso more or punched above the espresso. It was too balanced, if that's even a thing. I will definitely return next time i'm in town to see what pieces of coffee art they come up with next!"

Red Horn was very highly rated and the photos looked like they offered genuine espresso beverages. Red Horn offered a number of non-dairy options so I would not destroy my stomach on my pending road trip. We ordered Americans with a half inch of steamed oat milk. The coffee was very smooth. The espresso taste was still solid enough that I knew I was drinking espresso. I.e. Not watered down at all. All-in-all a great cup of coffee that hit the spot."

But I don't believe in spending $12 a glass for wine -- especially at a coffee/brew  pub.  While they listed an $8 or $9 red wine (on a menu in front of register), they conveniently only had the $12  wine.  It is a neat place, I \"get\" that people like it, but I don't plan to return.  I can go across the street, get good food and drinks at happy hour, or lunch.  And not feel ripped off.  (the serving size seemed less than average, too)."

The interior ambiance was dark, cozy, and perfect for an intimate convo, remote work, or even games with friends. I have two small children so helped myself to the outdoor covered and heated patio. The kids enjoyed the chips and salsa while we sipped our stellar brews. Excited to try the Leander location that is actually closer to us. 10/10 plan to come back, especially to try the coffee."

It's hard to find decaf that isn't boring and the decaf here is strong and full of flavor! I even purchased a pound of decaf beans to take home.   I pulled up and my first thought was that the vibe was more brewery than coffee shop and I was right, but I was wrong that the coffee would just be an afterthought. When I went on a Saturday early afternoon, there was a taco truck and people hanging out in the beer garden. Lots of bicyclists and not sure if it's a popular rest stop or because there's a bike shop in the same parking lot or both or something else. Once you step inside there is a giant section of beer taps and beer menu, and a small coffee and pastry menu. They also sell ice cream here which was tempting but I stuck to my americano and later a vanilla latte.   The inside has plenty of socially distanced seating as does the outside and I lucked out with a parking spot right out front. There's a large lot of shared parking for the businesses.   I want to come back to check out their beers!!"

Anytime you stop by, you'll meet either the owner or his wife and they are both nice and very helpful. You can pretty much buy anything they have in singles and they always have their inventory listed online along with the untapped rating for each beer, which I find very useful. They have a solid selection of local stuff and occasionally some more rare stuff as well. If you're immunocompromised, you can call your order in and they'll bring it to your car; they also have a very sanitary setup inside and require masks (of course) and make everyone use the hand sanitizer when you come in. We've been there about 5 times mixing that in with buying direct from breweries but I really love the diversity you can get while supporting local at the Brewtique"

Taco Truck pilsner was great, Mama Pisner, and there was a pickle beer that was probably a tad too pickley for me (go figure).  Great/fun selection, good prices, knowledgeable staff, and lots of picnic tables out to keep you spread out and safe. You can get snacks too, or play Starship Troopers pinball (Do You Want To Know More?!?). We had  a good time just chilling there on a Sunday afternoon.  Oh, and they recycle those plastic can holders that craft breweries use. Bring yours back to help out the brewers in town!"

This place is totally chill with a few picnic tables to relax and converse with friends. There is also a couple of other chairs if that's your thing. Sampling on sight is totally cool too.  On to the selection of beers. All I can say is,if you can't find something here that you would like, go home,empty handed and admit you have no taste. That's right, I threw the blame squarely on you! Why? Because they must have better than 300-400 different beers to choose from!  Now go, prove me wrong and try that chocolate oatmeal stout or triple ipa !!"

The team is incredibly helpful, very knowledgeable about their products, and all around just a couple of really cool folks.  Just tell them what you're in the mood for, and you'll absolutely receive a satisfying recommendation.  They're dog-friendly both in and outside, and are super welcoming to well-behaved pooches. They also do some really cool charity events on behalf of some great organizations. There's almost always something going on in the evenings -- live music, comedy shows, football games, game night, beer tastings.  They also have some neat retro arcade games and board games on hand to entertain.  There's always a reason to pop in and have a drinks!"

Owner(s?) seem to care a bunch, and have been available to point out new releases/limited beers, make recommendations, and take pics of my dog.   Prices slightly higher than other big retailers, but selection is much better (tip: check their Instagram for limited beers and new stock). Also, a good selection of CBD products for those interested. I have never hung around to drink there, but you can for a small per-beer charge if you want.   Hope this place keeps getting tasty limited beverages and doesn't turn into a vape emporium like the last one!"

All you have to do is to ask, and they'll give a great recommendation. It's probably the thing you'll always want to do as they carry seemingly hundreds of brands of beer.

Wonderful, attentive service and conversation. All staff keeps busy even on slow days and makes sure everything looks spotless and that everyone is helped.   Decent craft beer selections on draft and they run affordable specials. Food is fairly average in flavor, but comes out hot and fresh. The atmosphere, service, and prices have us coming back often."

They have a small but decent selection of beer on tap that we're bound to revisit.   All the food we ordered was very average -  we could find better pizza, fries, fried mushrooms,10 minutes in any direction. However, it's very spacious inside and even during lunch time on a weekend, the mood felt pretty relaxed (maybe it was an off-day?). A good spot to bring friends for having a few drinks and a conversation."

First of all they don't offer jalapeños on their pizzas which is a unpardonable sin in Texas, and an instant turn off for me. I guess they do realize they're doing business in Texas ?!?! I had the Carnivore which was alright at best. It has Salami, Pepperoni, Sausage, Meatballs, Pizza Sauce, Mozzarella, and Calabrian Peppers. I did add several shakes of the red pepper flakes to at least give it some kick. The fried mushrooms were good as was the Hefeweizen. My son had the Bianco which has Cream, Olive Oil, Fresh Mozzarella, Ricotta, Roasted Garlic, and Basil. He said it was very good. He also had the Sublimely Self-Righteous beer. They offer several menu choices for food as well as several beers. The staff was very friendly and the place was very clean. We might return but it won't be anytime soon as we won't be rushing to return."

Super friendly staff, fresh ingredients, and all public areas are spotlessly clean! This visit The Mr. ordered a small house side salad, which was was a very generous size. He ordered Build Your Own Pizza: pepperoni, salami, mushrooms, and red onions. I ordered the meat lasagna...large enough portion to feed two people. Love the marinara used in the lasagna. It was very light, fresh, and not sweet. (Some places add a lot of sugar to their pasta sauce not Tony C's). Not ordered this visit, but make sure you get the mozzarella sticks, made fresh in house, not Sysco Foods frozen. Photos of those beauties are in my previous review."

That's why, up until now, I only have two favorite pizza places (Home Slice and Slap box). But now Tony C's is added to that very small list.   Really good pizza slices with the right balance of meat, cheese and crust. And really great flavor throughout.   Sorry I haven't tried the other menu items ( I'll get to them eventually) but the pizza is so damn good, that it's hard to deviate.   The Round Rock locations is huge with plenty of places to sit and a nice bar area. Highly recommended to pizza lovers.   Oh, and I cleared out an entire Cesar salad. Which is saying a lot for me."

The pizza was very different than anything I've had in Austin. Excellent crust, quality toppings and definitely all fresh ingredients. The Carnivore was just spicy enough to make you want to keep going back for more and the Truffle was not your average fake truffle oil flavored pizza.

Half off beer pitchers on Thursday's and half off sangria on sundays.   I've never been one to rave about a salad, but omg the dressing on the Greek salad was out of this world. Even my man was in love and ended up hogging it from me.   I was there to kill time before a baseball, but will most definitely be back for pizza and game watching!"

Nearby, newly-opened LaQuinta Hotel's guests , including sports teams, families, conference attendees, and other large parties, will love coming here, not just for the seating and atmosphere, BUT FOR THE PIZZA!!!

We ordered the chicken Parmesan pizza as recommended by our cashier and an order of garlic knots. It was a great recommendation.   The garlic knots came out first. They were so warm, soft and garlic buttery! They came with their house made marinara, which was sooo good! Those poor garlic knots were gone just as quick as they arrived.  When the pizza came out, it looked amazing but I was a little concerned the chicken Parmesan might be a bit dry because it kind of looked that way. Let me tell you, the pizza was spot on! The chicken was well seasoned and cooked, definitely not dry. The crust on the pizza was amazing!!! I'm craving it again as I write this review!  The atmosphere was also laid back. They had beautiful wood bench seating, which could accommodate a large party/gathering if the place is not to busy. Service was also excellent.  Honestly, the best pizza I've had in a while! I highly recommend this place if you're in the mood for delicious pizza!"

                "description": "We were starving so the pizza isn't full and a picture of the fried ravioli is absent. My boyfriend and I had a great time at the the new local pizza joint. We shared the largest size pizza, split a fried ravioli app, and gelato. We also enjoyed a few drinks on HH.  We usually go to slapbox for local pizza, but dare I say it, this place has better pizza in my opinion! Not as greasy and it's closer to us. Their HH runs from 5-7. My boyfriend got 2 October fest beers and I had a glass of PG, a frozen bellini and a sangria, which were all $2-3 off depending on the drink. The frozen bellini was very good and I don't normally drink frozen drinks. I did not care for the sangria at all, though.   Everyone was very friendly. In regards to COVID, everything was very clean from what I saw.   Shoutout to the manager, Catalina! She was very genuine in her table checks and we both believe she's a great asset to their team in QC."

                "description": "Stopped for lunch here today. This has kind of a Pinthouse Pizza vibe (but more sterile/family oriented and less Austin-ie). Service was great, place was clean, and they seem to be taking COVID restrictions seriously.   The pizza was pretty good. Not as good as Slapbox/600 Degrees but just a notch below (on par with Pinthouse). Came out quick and was hot. Beer selection was pretty good - had a local brewery Oktoberfest.   All in all, worth returning and will try to nudge my kids into agreeing to go here instead of Hat Creek next door."

                "description": "Made our way in last weekend to give this place a try. The restaurant was extremely clean and nicely decorated.   Food: we tried the toasted ravioli, garlic knots, Italian chopped salad and pizza. The food came out quickly and was very tasty. While the prices were not cheap, I do think you get a good value for what you pay for.   The only improvement we'd suggest is letting customers open a tab and be able to order both food and drinks on it. We were told they're already working on this though!"

Since it was cold weather, we ate inside but they have great patio seating for warmer weather.  Decor is modern, not fancy but nice. Owners source from local vendors which I respect and highly support. Service is always good as well.  We all ordered the double cut pork chops and they were flippin' fantastic!! Haven't had them that good in years (Perry's Downtown Austin.) This is an easy to get to hidden gem in downtown Round Rock and definitely worth the drive and absolutely a repeater in my book.

We ran out of coffee and water several times and had to wait 10+ min, even with asking other servers. The table decided to order a round of drinks but couldn't get him to take our order before we were done with our food. He bodily ran into my mothers wheelchair twice and didn't apologize or say anything - she has bone cancer and it really hurt.  The food was alright, but when you have to ask three people for syrup for pancakes it doesn't really matter because they will be cold by the time you eat.  My husband and I used to really like this place, seems to have really gone downhill."

                "description": "Such a great little spot! Round Rock is full of adorable local restaurants and shops and this is definitely a must if you're settling down or just passing through. I placed an order to go but sat at the bar to wait for a little while. Smallish inside with a great patio space, nice staff, and amazing food! I got the sweet and spicy burger with sweet potato fries and it was exactly what I needed on a Friday. Beware of the habanero paste! My lips were on fire but in a good way. Wish I took a picture but trust me, it was a beautiful burger. My only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was waiting longer than expected for my food. I placed my order at 4:45, before the dinner rush, and they said about 20 minutes. I got a text saying my order was ready after 20 minutes, arrived, and they said it would be a couple more minutes... or rather another 20 minutes. But I was still very pleased with the quality for the price!"

The brunch food was just average, I think this might be a better spot for dinner. I had a Bloody Mary and it tasted like watery tomato juice with no spice or horseradish. My boyfriend had the shrimp and grits - he really liked the shrimp on it but the grits didn't have much flavor. The best item that we had was the appetizer of chips and queso but we subbed fries instead of chips - SO yummy. The queso was spicy and the fries were so crispy.   We would probably go back for dinner and drinks to see if it's better!"

I wasn't really feeling anything crazy but the items i got were delicious! The biscuit was fluffy and flakey and everything i wanted.   The sausages were actually huge and so filling. There was a nice flakey crunch to the outside of them which i wasn't expecting but enjoyed. The service was great and so were the portion to cost ratios! Well worth it!"

I ordered Shrimp and Grits and she ordered the Full Monty (American sampler)  Our food was all cold nothing hot or remotely warm. They didn't seem too busy so maybe they are working out some expediting issues. My grits were mediocre at best maybe if they were warm that would be different and the shrimp was fishy and rubbery. I've never had grits that were like a smear on the bottom of the bowl/plate but that's exactly what this was.  My daughter said her eggs tasted off and her fruit was clearly on the brink of, if not already spoiled. The best thing on the plate was the potatoes  I'd give them another shot just maybe not for brunch this time."

                "description": "We hadn't been by here in a little while and we're looking to go somewhere different than \"the usual\".   The good: We were seated quickly and there were quite a few staff in the restaurant to help so we didn't have to really wait that long for anything. In fact, once's we're done my wife said, \"we should start looking for the bill\" and here comes the waitress with the bill. This is really surprising in light of the challenges that other restaurants are having with staffing.   I like that this place is in downtown round rock and I like the overall aesthetic with wood beams on the ceilings and the house converted to restaurant feel.   I got a special off of their hatch chili menu and it was very tasty and a pretty decent sized piece of fish.   The not so good: While the food was tasty, I was missing some of the expected hatch chili flavor that I would expect to find when ordering something off a hatch chili menu  My wife's fish was a little tough, but again the flavor was good  If you get cold easily, make sure to bring a sweater. The temperature was pretty frigid and because of the small floor for the restaurant there wasn't really a way to find a spot where the you don't get blown on by the AC.   Wrap-up: All in all the food and service were good. A few tweaks and I think this could be a 5-star review."

Staff were friendly but noticeably uninterested as some were preoccupied scrolling on their phones and others even hanging out at the bar. Our waitress was at least attentive.   For food I ordered the salmon frittata, and the hubs got the pork belly hash and a $5 orange juice that was clearly brand made and from a bottle that probably cost just as much as the charge of the 8oz we were served. Flavor wise, my food was delicious tho slightly salty. However upon arriving to the table, the pork belly hash looked smaller than my entree. For $16 you'd expect strips of pork belly on top of the sweet potato hash - what you really get is 10% protein, 20% dry biscuit, 30% hash, and 40% arugula garnish. Redeeming quality was the perfectly poached egg.   Definitely a happy hour/small bites spot but wouldn't recommend for brunch or a full meal. For $50, much left to be desired"

                "description": "My fiancé, baby and I came here for a nice Friday night on the town. We had heard how great it was and was anxious to check it out for ourselves. Upon checking in we were told there was a 45 minute wait...fair enough. We walked to Finley's to grab a quick drink. We were both surprised when we got a text only within 20 mins! When we came back we were greeted by the hostess who was an absolute doll and showed to our table up front. Let me just say - customer service was top notch. Exactly was we hoped for. Our waiter Chandler was amazing! For an appetizer we ordered the bacon wrapped quail. It was superb. We both enjoyed it very much. For our entrees I had a side Caesar salad and the Dry Aged Ribeye (with asparagus and a cheddar potato cake), my fiancé had the Pecan Smoked Pork Chop (with asparagus and a cheddar potato cake) and for our 2 year old we ordered a kids meal with Mac and Cheese and Fries.  Let's start with the Pecan Smoked Pork Chop. While it was the tastiest of our entrees it was just a bit slightly overcooked...but delicious despite that. Okay on to the ribeye. I get this is not a steakhouse so I probably shouldn't have ordered it, but I had a craving. For the $45 price tag we were very disappointed. The thin cut steak very under-seasoned. The \"cheddar potato cake\" was just okay...its basically a mound of mashed potatoes with a cheddar crisp on top. The asparagus was okay but I like the small asparagus better and these were ginormous.  I noticed the baby wasn't eating his mac and cheese and wondered why. It looked like it came from a generic box and once I tasted it I learned why. Oddly enough the dish tasted like it had vinegar in it!! My fiancé tasted it and said the same thing. We even let Chandler know when we were leaving."

Come early! It was pretty cold, but they had little gas fireplaces all over to keep warm. There is a half indoor area that had heaters. Big area for kids to do their thing. My dogs enjoyed the turf to sun bathe. Beer, wine, and seltzer selection were decent. Unisex restrooms. No TVs! Simply a good spot to chill  Service was great! Can't wait to come back!"

                "description": "I've probably been to the Good Lot at least 5 times since moving out to the Cedar Park area. It's an awesome beer garden with stellar staff and food trucks that are great for any occasion.   The bar area has tons of local beers that they do let you sample. The staff have typically made some great drink suggestions that I always attempt to look out for when buying larger packs at my nearest liquor store.   At this point, I think I've had food from each of their more permanent  food trucks and will say that you really can't go wrong with what you choose. My top favs are the arepas from Four Brothers and the 50/50 burger from the Oink Mobile...in case you have an issue deciding!"

Children annoy me so this is not my favorite place ATM, but we'll be back during the school day or later on at night.   Glad to have something like this in CP.   To the owner: please discourage remote control cars and soccer balls. Pretty annoying to have my beer knocked over by some kid who thinks he's at the park. Plus the remote control cars are just obnoxious."

They have astro turfed the big outdoor area and added more fire pits and tables and it is so freakin beautiful. Another good selection of food trucks , I had shrimp tacos from Redfin and two different draft beers (Again, served in glasses, not paper or plastic. The vibes were very relaxed. I have only one suggestion; Considering the number of little people and the traffic on New Hope, Some sort of a fence along New Hope is in order. I suggest simple metal poles and the green, plastic stuff that comes in rolls that you can get from Lowes or HD. there is a hedge row but there are spaces between. At least until the bushes grow up."

                "description": "I made the drive up to Cedar Park and my friend was excited to take me here as it had just opened up and seemed to add a streak of cool to my friend's new neighborhood. So, it was midweek around 8pm and while the patio had plenty of folks and there was music going the food trucks were done and they weren't too courteous about letting it be known they were closed or out of food or closing up.   So, the taps were open which allowed me to try out a beer. The staff pouring were definitely friendly, letting me know some of their personal favorites on tap as well as letting me try some out. I did also appreciate that they had some NA options as well and I liked the kombucha they had on tap so much I had two more of those instead of the more adult beverage options they had.  If there was a way to have some of the bar staff cross train with the food truck staff it would make a huge improvement."

                "description": "The Good Lot is a wonderful addition to the CP area. Bring your kiddos and your hounds sit outside under the shade or on their covered patio.    Cocktails anyone? I was surprised at their expansive craft beer options. Check out their rotating taps at: https://thegoodlotcp.com/beergarden/drinks/  There are wine, seltzer, and non-acholohol options as well.  When we visited there were 3 food truck options; Yard Bird, Oink, and our favorite The Rice is Right.    Be aware on weekends and when there is live music parking will be a challenge. This has been a point of contention with the neighbors and according to the Good Lot, they are looking to expand the parking area.    Pro tip: Don't park in the adjoining neighborhood park 5 minutes away at the Veterans Memorial Park. Stretch your legs on the way there and work off that beer on the way back."

                "description": "As far as I can tell, The Good Lot only has 5 star reviews and for good reason.  It is a great beer garden with plenty of non-beer options as well.  I have always passed by the place and noticed how busy it is most weeknights and especially weekends, but I am certainly pleased with what it brings to the community.  Generally it gets pretty busy after 6PM until close, and parking can be difficult to find.  Carpooling or taking a rideshare would be the best way to do it in my opinion as I would hate to park in front of someone else's house in the nice neighborhoods nearby.  Certainly a parking lot expansion is something the owners are considering as that is my only issue with the place especially when it gets busy.  That being said, it is always a great atmosphere with a variety of food and drink options.  There are also always lots of dogs in the grassy area by the patio and it is nice to see how family-friendly the place is.  I will certainly be back and bring some friends in the future!"

                "description": "This is such a cool place! I planned an outing in Cedar Park with a group of my girlfriends. After our outing at the Ecuadorian chocolate factory, we needed a place that could accommodate a fairly large group of friends during lunch time on a Friday (a task that seemed.... yikes). I am very thankful I stumbled across The Good Lot on Yelp! I reached out to make sure The Good Lot could accommodate us, and they said \"Of Course\" and let me know that all of the trucks would be out on Friday.    When we arrived, we were pleasantly surprised to find several open food trucks and a large building (see, beer bar). People had their dogs outside and everyone seemed to be having a good time.   Between all of us, we tried every food truck. I personally got Four Brothers Venezuelan Kitchen. I am a sucker for good Venezuelan food. I got a Pulled pork Bowl with extra garlic sauce, black beans, avocado, sweet plantains, and all the fixings. I would definitely eat here again. I tried a few samples from other food trucks as well.   Everyone left super happy. This is a great place to go if you have a casual group looking for a quick bite and place to hang out.    The next day (Saturday), I swung by the dog park across the street and stopped by again for lunch on my way home. They have trivia nights, live music over the weekends, and happy hour all day on Monday. Please build another location close to Fort Hood. A copy and paste of exactly what you already created would be great. ;). I promise to stop by weekly."

(sorry guys, we were the last ones to leave)  Parking is nuts so plan ahead and maybe carpool... We drive a jeep so we had no issues ... live music and plenty of smiling faces.. service was great, bathrooms were clean... dogs welcome! Plenty of good beers, wines and ciders... gals were so nice behind the bar.. offered samples and were super sweet... good folks, good music and good grub.... my son joined us and grabbed some food from the food trucks... cauliflower wings, shrimp fried rice and macaroni and cheese... so so good.... bring your chairs/ blanket to sit on because tables and chairs are hard to snag... the lines are long for drinks but they go fast.... We will be back for sure! We feel right at home here. If you like fresh air and freedom... come here.. if you are afraid of fresh air and human contact, probably should go to Austin and be amongst others who feel that way... Merica!"

                "description": "My daughter and I visited The Good Lot yesterday (8/8/21).  It's the new and hot food truck and bar spot in Cedar Park TX (2500 W New Hope). The Good Lot has a main building with a large dining area enclosed by glass garage doors that open and a bar that has numerous beers, ales, ciders, and craft sodas.  It's nestled among the oak trees. There is a nice amount of paved parking and gravel lot parking.   The Good Lot also has dining areas under the oaks along with a game area (corn hole) and a playground for the kids with a large wooden teepee for climbing.  They are dog friendly.   The Good Lot had 4 food trucks.  We chose The Rice Is Right that serves Korean inspired rice boxes and other items.  We ordered the crispy chicken box and the cauliflower box.  Both items were perfectly fried and coated in a sweet and spicy Korean sauce.  Flavor was amazing.  The boxes came with steamed white rice and a purple cabbage slaw.  The portions were large and more than enough food for us. There were other food trucks that served Mediterranean, Pork, and Chicken.  The menus look good and I will explore those in the future.  The Good Lot and The Rice Is Right are on 'My Keepers List'."

Food trailers here, beer on tap, covered patio, great outdoor seats and space, place for kids and pets. It has only been open for 3 weeks and the word is getting out. As we were leaving tonight, the park lot was pretty full. Great place to relax with buddies after work or with the family with a wooden teepee for the kids to climb and corn hole. Head over to The Good Lot and get some food from The Rice is Right and Oink Mobile."

The beer selection was great, lots of locals including Whitestone, Hedgehog, Red Horn, Family Brewing and (of course) some lovely PHP Jellyfish on tap.  We decided to tried Yaadbird, since we hadn't had any fried chicken in a while. The lemon pepper chicken was on point, crispy, juicy, peppery, a 'lil salty, and everything you need in your fried chicken!  The property is beautiful and well landscaped. The lawn was amazing! It was so fluffy! When we first arrived we just admired the live oak trees and the quality of the grass.. Lawn lovers, you will understand...  The bartenders were very nice and very excited to introduce so many new people to the Good Lot. The owner was all over the bar, pouring drinks, helping staff, and checking with guests, seeming to have time for everyone.  We are looking forward to coming back here and trying the 3 other food trucks, along with the rotating beer menu. Hope they are planning to host more events, as we would love to do an anniversary party here at some point!"

                "description": "Finally, a really great beer garden in Cedar Park. I came on their first \"soft public open\" day and I'm so glad I did. I've been to about 20 pubs and bars in CP and this one stands head and shoulders above the rest. It's an open air (no AC but there is heat in the winter) with big garage doors that were open and a huge ceiling fan so it was comfortable. There were about 20 taps and 3 of them were not filled yet. I chatted with the owner and she said she was looking for ideas so my friend Greg gave her some. :)  There is plenty of indoor seating. Plus, there is a huge grassy area with picnic tables and even a fire pit. It's family-friendly so no smoking.  There is a playground for the kids and spots for four food trucks although only two were filled.   Beer was about $6 on average so not cheap but not expensive either. $1 off all day on Mondays.   It was an enjoyable experience and a really great ambience. I'll definitely be back!"

This place is non-smoking, dog-friendly (leashed) and kid-friendly, with a unique play area, six sets of cornhole, and plenty of shaded grassy area to run around in. Tables are wide and comfortable, and the entire patio was open-air, so social distancing is a breeze. We ate at the Oinkmobile truck (delicious) and grabbed local beers and ciders at the patio desk. We walked the fifteen minutes from our house, but it looks like they have a decent-sized parking lot and are working on creating more space. The only downside is that there's no ramp down to the grass/play area, but hopefully they'll make it more accessible in the future. Staff was super friendly, and I can't wait to come back for open mic night. Because yes, we'll be back!!"

Once we got a drink, we were lucky enough to snag a table under the fans and the breeze was so nice. They had live music while we were there, which I believe will continue on weekends so that's fun. The lawn looked so nice, chairs to sit in, trees for shade, lawn games for entertainment! There were 4 or 5 food truck options while we were there and while we didn't get any food, all the food we saw coming out looked so good! Definitely recommend stopping by and checking it out!"

The environment has the ability to feel casual and formal at the same time. We couldn't score a table as a walk in, but they do have community tables which we ended up having to ourselves as a group of four. Our server had the memory of an elephant and had a way of elegantly displaying all the ingredients and preparations of any dish in question without feeling like he's reading a script. I ordered quite a bit and got to sample a generous variety of items.   They have a modest selection of raw oysters, with almost all of them being from the east coast and residing from PEI. I imagine this has to do more with what their distributors can get their hands on, but I'm gonna guess they mostly stick to east coast oysters.   The crab fried rice doesn't look like anything special, but goddamn is this good! They use huge chunks of crab meat! The rice was fluffy, buttery, and the black garlic was a nice touch. I like that this isnt a mountain of a dish but rather an appetizer. Absolutely worth getting.   The Tuna tartare stack was much better than anything I imagined! Avocado slices on the bottom are aesthetically pleasing, but are an annoyance when your sharing among friends and don't want to destroy the structure of the stack to divide up the slices.  The peel and eat shrimp were my least favorite part of the meal. I really couldn't taste much of a shrimp flavor. You had to use the cocktail sauce in order to taste anything. Perhaps they didn't get the best batch in from their distributor, but I expect fresh shrimp to have more flavor than my ice water.   The Snapper collard was not exactly what I was expecting, so removing my expectations, it was good for what it was. I thought I was getting Hamachi Kama. What they serve is the whole collar of a snapper, breaded and deep fried. The meat off the jowls (if you can classify it as that) was flaky soft and juicy. The breading is reminiscing of a typical fish fry. It was good, but for my personal preference, its not something Id go out of my way to order.  They offer some good guacamole. They give you what seems like three whole avocados worth in the bowl. The chips they provide do taste good, but they have terrible structure for the thick guacamole you're attempting to scoop up. I ended up having to use a spoon to distribute the guac on any chip I ate.   Bbq shrimp was not at all what I was expecting. Yes the shrimp itself was good, but the sauce they use in it was a umami explosion of flavor. I could drank a gallon of that stuff. I keep the plate and sopped up as much sauce as I could with the grilled bread they provided.   Ceviche tostada was excellent. Well dressed, plenty of meat, plenty of veggies, and full of flavor. They give you two small tostadas, rather than one large chip.    The bread and butter was ok, but I personally think the bread was a little tough. I do like that it was sourdough and could smell it. The whipped butter is standard and nothing to comment on.   I didn't order any of their cocktails, since none of them interested me, but my friends told me they make well concocted drinks.  While the experience itself had some tiny missteps, it would be a misrepresentation not to give this place glowing accolades, especially considering the other options nearby."

                "description": "I came across Salt Traders while looking for some good eats in the Round Rock area and after eating there I felt the experience was underwhelming. The food wasn't bad, but not as good as I was expecting. My fish and shrimp platter had pretty decent flavor but barely had much shrimp or fries.   The grilled oysters were the biggest highlight of my experience here. I enjoyed those more than I thought I would and would recommend ordering them as a starter. I am assuming they don't use the gulf oysters that they serve for these because the texture, size, and flavor felt pretty different."

                "description": "We were headed to IKEA and decided to have lunch nearby. I was able to convince my husband to try something new and he is very thankful for that  It was past 1pm on a Friday and this place was already packed. The decor is pretty nice. It has this coastal vibe that immediately transports you to the shore.  I asked for a gluten free menu and they do have one! Win!  Right away our server brought us the smoked salmon sampler. For my husband with chips, for me with a cucumber as I'm gf. I ordered the clam chowda and it was simply AMAZING. The best one I have eva had! It is very creamy, a bit on the salty side which is never a problem for me, the clam wasn't chewy and the bacon was a great addition. The leeks just added a bit more flavor to that. It's perfect. I would highly recommend you try it.  For mains my husband went with the fried shrimp , fish and fries and he said it was phenomenal. I could only take a picture when he had already had all the shrimp. As you can see the fish fillet is very thick, therefore it's really moist inside. He also said the tartar sauce was outstanding with the perfect addition of lime to break the fat of the mayo.  I had the pan seared scallops with butternut squash purée, roasted sweet corn and bacon bits. The flavor profile was really interesting. Scallops were very fresh and with that awesome sear on the outside, but still very moist on the inside. The butternut squash brings some sweetness to play which goes very well with the corn and we have the crispy bacon to add some saltiness and also some more texture to the plate. Just wish there was a bit more food.  For dessert we had the flourless chocolate cherry pie. Thank God for gf options!!! And also some decaf coffee. The towelettes just add that additional care to the whole service and more charm to the place.  I highly recommend this place!"

I guess Texas folks ain't about this cold life (me either, truth be told). Anyways, we had reservations for 3:30 but arrived like 2:45 and was seated immediately. If you know me, then you know I love my seafood. And I literally come and binge on the appetizers.   Well nothing have changed, seafood is still amazing, drinks are great and services is outstanding!"

                "description": "This restaurant is a 5 out of 5 for me. I absolutely enjoy eating here. The raw oysters are always my favorite to snack on (tip: on Mondays, their gulf oysters are only $1). I've also tried their chowda fries which are delicious. It's everything you would expect with chowder but better because you also get fries (this dish itself can be heavy and filling). Definitely one to try if you're looking for something to warm your soul. Their lobster roll is good too. I love the lobster meat but I wish they served it as a warm, hot sandwich rather than the chilled one. Nonetheless, still delicious!   Now don't get me started on their dessert which is also worth noting here. All their desserts are made in-house but there is one that really hits the spot. This dessert has a warm chocolate brownie topped with a scoop of Vanilla ice cream and drizzled with caramel. If heaven was a dish, that would be it because it just transports you into another world. Worth saving some room in your stomach for!"

                "description": "We've been a fan of Salt Trader's Costal Cooking in RR since their opening five years ago and not surprisingly we dine there 2-1 over Jack Allen's, our previous go-to place. We've never had a less than wonderful experience there with the diverse menu and bold bright flavors and textures of amazingly prepared seafood and American cuisine and wonderful drinks.  The newly transformed Flat Top Fish Tacos are unbelievably good as the two hearty tacos are prepared Birria style with caramelized cheese crust on the flour tortilla and with substantial amount of grilled black drum with a street corn filling along with the cup of aromatic tomato-shrimp soppin broth and tomatillo-lime rice with pickled chilis.   Other favorites include Grilled Oysters and Fried Oyster Lettuce Wraps for Starters and the  Fish Enchiladas and of course fresh Oysters and Daily Specials and Seasonal Deserts.  FLAT TOP FISH TACOS 17 crispy cheese flour tortilla, street corn,  tomatillo lime rice, pickled chilis,  charred tomato-shrimp soppin' broth"

I also wish they had a stronger horseradish. Their horseradish came shredded instead of as a sauce, and it barely had a taste. The ceviche was great and so were the hush puppies, but I personally wish the hush puppies had more corn. We also ordered drinks- The Rum Around and Frozen Grapefruit Rita- which were really good and strong."

                "description": "We found ourselves in Round Rock, TX on a recent Saturday, early evening, so we decided to stop by Salt Traders Costal Cooking on IH 35.  We found a couple of open seats at the bar.  Our first orders were a couple of craft cocktails, the Gin and Housemaid Tonic and The Rum Around.  Both were good, but upon reflection, for the price, regular cocktails would have sufficed.    We kind of went crazy on appetizers, having Gulf oysters, grilled oysters, crab fingers, and the crudo plate, which was yellowfin.  All of those dishes were \"off the chart\" crazy good, with the exception of the crudo ... the white sauce used was way too sweet for the awesome fish.    When we finally ended up at the main section of the menu, we ordered the fried oyster lettuce wraps and the simply grilled fish of the day, which was redfish.  The tartar sauce served with the lettuce wraps was delicious, but a bit too much was slathered on the wraps.  IMHO put a dash on the lettuce leaves and let the patron add as desired from the small cup of tartar sauce that comes with the dish.  The redfish was terrific, but no one knew why the place would have farm-raised redfish from the Indian Ocean when we have fresh redfish 200 miles away in the Gulf of Mexico?    Keeping it local, we ordered the Becker Vineyard Reserve Viognier, and it was delicious.  In closing, a special shout out to our waiter Nathan behind the bar, service was attentive but not intrusive, so nice to have a great waiter with a great attitude!"

North Round Rock really isn't the place you'd think of for high quality seafood and a great classy bar scene, but that's exactly what this place had.  My wife had the scallops and they were seared perfectly and tender in the middle. Couldn't ask for better.  I had a fish sandwich, but I'm picky so I did it without the slaw, which was a mistake because it needed the crunch and the sauce. I'm sure it would be a 10/10 with that.  Definitely go to this place. We were treated like gold and the food was excellent!"

                "description": "For my birthday, I chose to visit Salt Traders. We hadn't been there in a little while, and good seafood is always a treat.   My husband and I arrived in the early side, during happy hour (3:30-6:30 on a Thursday), so we could enjoy a leisurely meal. We started with drinks. I had the frozen grapefruit margarita, which tasted like a regular margarita. I loved that the salt on the glass also had citrus peel.  Our appetizer ($5 off during happy hour) was pot stickers. They were excellent, and the portion size (6) just right for sharing. The sauce was wonderful.   I ordered one of the day's specials for dinner, seared monkfish. It was served over fingerling potatoes and topped with a great salsa. The monkfish was tasty  but a bit on the chewy side... and the potatoes were barely undercooked. My husband had fish and chips, always a good choice at Salt Traders.  Dessert was vanilla creme brulee topped with peach sorbet. Excellent!   Service was excellent. We enjoyed Patrick's sense of humor and the stories he told.   We will be back again, without a doubt!"

Right level of heat, smoke, and sweetness  Teriyaki- Sweet and tasted exactly how teriyaki sauce should taste. Deep notes of ginger which was amazing  Lemon pepper- could have been a lot better. It was almost as if they just sprinkled a little bit of essence of the seasoning.  Honestly couldn't tell the difference between the lemon pepper and the following wings.  Taco- I could see the seasoning but they were basically naked wings. The only flavor I could sort of taste was cumin, which was kinda blah. I wouldn't call these Taco Flavor. A good idea to market these as taco flavor would be to market the as \"carnita wings\" fry them up until they are super crunchy like chicharrón crunchy then serve them with side of salsa. If you use this please credit me! Lol free wings with a year would be nice too lol ;)"

You can also order a whole pizza or order by the slice which my wife loved since she usually doesn't eat too much.   We ordered the Orig Mama Gallo and it came with sliced meatballs and pepperoni. The combination of meats were great. The crust and dough were amazing and so soft. Their beer selection is quite extensive, I found a local beer from a small brewery I had never heard of before. I loved it so much that I ended up visiting the local brewery in Pflugerville.  Definitely give it a shot if you are a pizza lover like I am."

All around great. T.vs and games playing full bar and delicious food!"

                "description": "I honestly do not know where to begin with this review......I get it, possibly short staffed, since I did see a sign out front, but management should adjust how many patrons are seated if that's the case. 1. We signed up for space available seating for six people, mind you, two were planning to order single slices. We get to the restaurant and the first thing that strikes four of us as odd is the fact that the \"greeter\" had the emotions of Wednesday Addams...zero expressions nor cordiality. Did not see a smile one from this person. She should reconsider her position, but I'd suggest she work BOH the way she appeared.  2. Our waiter/order taker person, whatever the pronoun is today was flat out.....Terrible! His name was AJ, AJ was not attentive, didn't write ANYTHING down, did not take our drink orders(he was reminded by the bar staff). After he \"mental\" took our order down l noticed the \"I got you look\", AJ did not have us. Nope, ordered sweet tea, got unsweetened, came back with an excuse, we brushed it off. Ten minutes later, came back and asked my wife and I what pizza we ordered(again, he wrote it down mentally), I asked him to guess...when I told him a number 12 he replied, \"I knew it, was just checking.\" I honestly could keep going on number two, as the service was just that....shit.  3. Nothing, I mean nothing arrived on time. My Brother received his pizza before ANY of the the reheat and serve slices came out. My wife and I got ours after he'd finished half of the pizza. After the complete shit show for service, as soon as our pizza came out we got a to-go box. I could expound on every one of these points, but I won't.   All in all the bill was $145, only one beer was ordered. I was \"fine\" with leaving a $20 tip for the service we received, but was talked into being generous. My old self would not have been so nice. Maybe folks are used to this service at this establishment, but for the money we paid I would have been happier with a PJ pizza and some good garlic butter sauce! Oh, I attached a pic of my pizza from last night...."

                "description": "Slap Box is an interesting name for a Pizzaria with an included drafthouse. I stumbled upon this spot after Google searching \"pizza near me\". I was sawyer by the 4 star Yelp reviews, I had detour from my original plan to visit Pinthouse Pizza.   There's plenty of parking in fact there's an indoor covered parking lot on the same block around the corner. Upon entry the ambiance is well wonderful. There's enough tables and an ample amount of TV's to watch any of your heart's desire for sports.  I proceeded directly to the bar to order my pizza and beer to go.  When I sat down at the bar I ordered a pepperoni pizza and some water. After the pizza arrived after about 15 minutes or so I decided to sample a couple of ciders. I tried the Meridian Hive Cherry and the Meridian Hive Rhapsody. I ended up buying the Meridian Hive Cherry. It was on the sweeter side think like a wine.  When I finally tried the pizza it was pretty good. It was above average and I would try it again. The wings were really good. The sauce was flavorful and robust. The chicken was very good too. I definitely recommend Slap Box!"

                "description": "Located in downtown Round Rock, this pizza place is right next to the Main Street plaza.  During CoVid times, we ordered to-go and ate in the plaza next door since it was a lovely afternoon.   Be forewarned, if you get a slice... it is a BIG slice!  See the La Jolla slice picture. It's huge!  The kids loved their pizza. Not a surprise there since it was your typical pepperoni.   I had a GF, vegan pizza for the first time and it was pretty good. I'm so glad they had this option on the menu so I didn't have to order a salad.   They had lots of beer options on tap but we didn't partake this time. Next time, we will. Give them a try!"

One time we ordered it for delivery and were charged mega bucks by the delivery service, so we'll never do that again.  Another time I placed an order over the phone to go and had to wait outside for about 15-20 minutes past the pickup time because there were so many people in line."

HUGE slices! Lots of variety and interesting toppings. AND this is a pizza restaurant but do not overlook the wings. They are sooo good. I love the dry rub ranch and recently tried the bourbon glaze which was super tasty. They have a great variety of beers on tap and attentive service. Also, a great place for take away. Slapbox is a fantastic addition to downtown Round Rock."

Ordering online was easy, we reached there early before the specified time but still our order was done already. Garlic knots was not good, no flavors, it dint even feel fresh, could taste garlic but not even a hint of butter but the sauce it came with was so good. Pesto cheese pizza was awesome, pesto was so fresh and flavorful. crust, cheese, everything was just delicious. Will be back again soon for more pizza!"

The bartender said the service was slow because they were short staffed but he spent quite a bit of time talking about March Madness games with some guys who were either regulars or his friends. I also saw 3 or 4 wait staff/bartenders doing side duties while people sat at the bar and tables who hadn't been greeted. There were 2 hostesses that never moved from the door, yet it wasn't that busy.   Their beer selection was great. I asked the bartender if their pizza by the slice was pretty good or should I just order a whole pizza. He assured me the slices were very fresh and just as delicious. It was just ok. They bake it as cheese pizza then add the toppings by the order. The pepperoni was very salty. Luckily the caprese salad was delicious.   It just seems like they need better procedures and staff awareness so that customers aren't being ignored as they enter. Maybe I'll try it again someday."

I thought about a nearby place that has a great beer selection and pizza.  So, I went there.  But I went in a different direction. Hot wings.  I asked about them.  The servers were attentive and described everything.  Even the bartender came over to check and make sure I was OK after I ordered and suggested beers and said it will be worth the wait.    Then the wings came to my table. They glistened in sauce and fat and were luscious.  Even the shiny foil underneath made them look like a gift   And then I ate.    Tender, juicy, the perfect spice.  The heat and meat!  Sooo good!!  The perfect chili/orange/Buffalo sauce color was gorgeous but tasted even better.  My palate was singing! My hands were messy. But, I ignored napkins, my friends!  I licked my fingers instead.  I don't regret it!   I thought at first the size of the wings order would be too much. It. Was. Not.   The server asked if I wanted a pizza. But, no, I ordered another beer and wings.  I don't want the pizza. I want the wings!!!!"

We popped in to 600 degrees after talking about needing to try it for months and it did NOT disappoint.  We were going to try a traditional pie, but ended up branching out to try the Royale with Cheese and we are so glad we did! The pizza was incredible, we split it and still had a few slices left over. We did it with the additional mustard and pickles, which is an absolute must.  The crust was to die for, and I say this as a person who normally throws crust away. It was so fluffy and soft, truly a 10/10 dough experience.  They had Maine Root soda on the fountain and a ton of beers on tap that they are more than willing to let you sample.   It isn't a big place and it can get pretty packed. There was a 25 minute wait when we arrived, but we ended up just sitting at the bar.  The service was great, the food was phenomenal, and the atmosphere was fun and friendly."

                "description": "That's not a slice..This is a slice! References aside if you want giant slices of pizza this is the place. Think as large a slice that you have to fold like a sandwich to eat. Perfect for any pizza or cheese cravings.   Atmosphere: Had the chance to dine outside of here. Given the location within Georgetown, you get the feeling of a family pizzeria. A place one would bring their friends for a casual dine out. Complete with patio.  Food: As mentioned above, big big slices. Perfect for any pizza lover of all sorts. I ended up going with the Pirate which is one of their speciality slices that comes as pictured below with a pickle too. The only complaint I'd have is that since the pizza's come out so fresh they also come out very hot. I unashamedly had to eat the pizza with a knife and fork as I just couldn't wait for such a prize to just sit there.   Service: Friendly service, given the significant amount of speciality slices I had a few questions and the server was happily able to answer any I had. Especially if you are unsure of what pizza slice you may want.  Overall: Now that I've tasted whenever I have pizza cravings I just want to return here to try all their other speciality slices. Give this place a try, and have a slice day!"

You can do pizza by the slice and customize it with your own toppings much like a whole pizza except it's a slice, a slice that is the size of a small pizza or Texas? Go figure.   Everything is bigger.   Just cheese pizza would be rather bland here add your toppings and go with it.  Everyone gets what they want and it's fast.   Good stuff.  The garlic knots need some more garlic too them that's just me.   Definite unique spot to get that pizza fix."

Definitely has the college town feel.   ***Didn't see any actual menus so be prepared to use your camera on your phone to look at the menu.   Service: Food was slow to come out. I didn't time it but we were there about an hour.  Our waitress was nice and did come by and check on us a couple times.   Food: Ordered the Caesar salad to start and it was tasty. The size for the salad was big enough you could share if you are looking for a smaller side salad.   I will say if the time it took to get our slices it was worth no sharing.  We ordered #6 pirate and #23 number 23 as slices and shared them.  Oh my!! They were both delicious and honestly for us worth the wait.   Even with the little bit of the wait I think still worth the 5 stars.   ** please forgive my pictures, I got so excited about them I ate the point of the slices. And we sliced them in half after we got them so they would be entire piece if when you get them.    ENJOY"

I always get a slice of the basil pesto and it is absolutely delicious. And very filling. My husband and daughter like the pepperoni, and we usually get a side salad that's good too."

The pizza was good along with my Greek salad. I've been looking for a replacement for Austin's Pizza since moving to Georgetown in December. This may be my new pizza place. Friendly staff although the young lady who greeted me at the main restaurant couldn't tell me the address to where my food was located."

                "description": "Being many of the pizza's are named after the bay area, I thought this is going to be interesting. Some family here said to try this place so we ordered 3 pizzas' to go and tried to order the garlic knots but they were out.  I am pretty picky growing up with pizzas places, old school ones, so crust, sauce and cheese blends and topping stand out...  Before I add my review here is another really good pizza combo from the bay area; Large Gilroy Special: White garlic Sauce, Garlic, Pepperoni, Mushroom, Italian Sausage, Fresh Green Onion, Fresh Tomatoes.  Now for the 2 other pizza I didn't try them, my copart did and she wasn't all fired up, so I gave her my feedback for my go to pizza, Pepperoni and Pineapple pizza, it's pretty simple combo of hopefully sweet and spicy, if they use the right pepperoni. In this case I liked the crust, the sauce just didn't cut it and the cheese was OK, but nothing that fired me up, the part I hated besides the taste was the topping, I paid a good amount of money for the pizza and the topping were almost non existence, I mean really missing, everyone looked at my pizza and said did you ask them for light toppings or something..  Ahh No of course, so not happy, needless to say I wasn't happy with the product."

Our first time here, we were obviously newbies. We looked over the menu for a while, and both wanted to try different things, so we decided to get two slices each. Big mistake, because these slices are absolutely massive. Way bigger than anything I've ever seen. I expected big, but not massive. Our server didn't prepare us or warn us about the size when we ordered two each, so we each left with a whole slice. That part was disappointing. Also quite greasy.  (The royale/hamburger pizza is not good)"

They should have some outdoor heaters and covering from the on/off drizzle.  We ordered a pizza and wings. The pizza names were curious as I'm from the area these towns are located in. I ordered my birthplace pizza (San Jose). The Lemmon pepper wings came out about 20 minutes before the pizza. The wings were PERFECT! I mean damn they were good! The pizza came out and it's a spicy one. The pizza was bigger than I expected and is made for at least two people. Flavor was good but it had a bit too much of some sort of creamy white sauce on top. The beers were on point as I tried out several local ones.  I will definitely come back and try more of their delicious menu!"

The long: we visited 600 as a last minute whim and were greeted with excellent service. We sat on their small cute patio outside with our pup; took a little while to get a spot but it moved surprisingly quick while we explored downtown georgetown. We had a pie (split in half with 2 flavors since we are indecisive) which were great, but the wings.... The wings were amazing. They were spicy, perfectly cooked. And they gave us the spicy rub on the side which may kill you but totally worth dying over."

If the space was more open and inviting, but it's so crammed that you're almost a part of everyone's conversation if you're sitting inside. Service is always great though, if you can get in without having to wait and you have the time to kill, give it a try at least once."

It's perfect because my wife and I will grab two beers to go, drop a tip, and walk the square/walking trail up the street to get our steps in on our Fitbit. It's always exciting because the beers change daily to weekly. We've hung out inside on occasion which is perfect for card games and relaxing. The apparel for sale is typical of a REI/Bass Pro Shop. Expensive but quality.   Bar: rotating beer, wine, white claws  Bonus: Very dog friendly! And one of the only places open late."

The sweet girl behind the counter was left to be the \"burden of bad news.\" The owner didn't even bother to come out to apologize. So because I lost the receipt (it had the tags on it) I'm stuck with a defective $40 shirt that I ended up just GIVING back to them because what am I going to do with it?!?! Needless to say, I will not be shopping here again.  Side note: This is where I get my fiancés clothes since they carry Howler (my favorite), Duck Camp, and the lovely Sendero Provisions. I've probably spent over $1,000 in clothing because of the brands they carry, not to mention I spent $300 the day I purchased the shirt. Seriously do better. If your going to carry higher end outdoor gear maybe realize that you're dealing with customers who actually appreciate that."

Luckily there are a few outdoor tables and chairs for overflow but even the sidewalks get crowded with people just standing around drinking. One evening we managed to make it in and see what all the excitement was about and it's a cute little beer and wine bar/outdoors gear store. Cute merchandise but pretty pricey. The bartender told us occasionally a food truck will park behind their store so you can enjoy yummy eats with your drinks, otherwise no food menu. I liked the atmosphere of this place... cute little date night drink spot on the square. But I am a little confused by why it's so crowded all the time. The beer and wine list is good, but not anything spectacular. I don't get it. I'm sure we'll be back at some point if we can find a place to sit."

I didn't try the beer, so I can't comment on that, but the clothing selection was good. They carry Howler Brothers apparel, which is a company out of Austin that my fisherman husband likes, and Texas Standard clothing, which is a TX-based brand with cool (not kitschy) Texas-themed clothing that gives back to Texas non-profs. They also carry another local brand - Kermode Outdoors - which is new to me, but evidently founded by Georgetown residents. The store has a great vibe and the bar is a place I could see spending a few hours on a Saturday afternoon. Stores like this are what I look for whenever I shop local - a place that sells unique, cool stuff that someone has spent time thinking about.   4 not 5 stars because I didn't try the beer.

I wont lie to you yelp, I am not much for drinking beers but for this brewery, I might knock one beer out and enjoy the patio more than anything. shout out to the staff for being awesome and helping me find the right beer for me."

Had 2 beers, 1 was really good and 1 was eh. They had a Mexican food truck in the back and it was meh, I wouldn't recommend. Line inside to get a beer was ridiculous... I would have had more if it wasn't such a wait. Seems they could use a bit of logistical help."

                "description": "This is a very wide-open brewery with plenty of places to sit, stand, chill out, hang out, etc.  I had the Cowboy Bevo (which is a brown ale).  I usually love the sweet, malty taste of a brown ale, but the IBU rating on this one was a little high for my tastes.  Not terrible, mind you, and I would consider it again. Just a little hoppy for my tastes.    It's in an industrial park, like many breweries are, but it was a nice, spacious, and clean set up. Service was quick too - so was parking.  On my last visit, they even had a local band playing from within one of the loading dock doors.   Bottom line, great tastes, services, parking easy, and some good live tunes.  Check them out!"

She had been, but it was my first time - although I'd been eyeing Hopsquad as it was building up and it had been on my list to visit. The parking is limited, so plan ahead. The space is bigger than it looks from the outside - as it has an indoor bar as well as an outdoor picnic table area. I tried two beers (can't remember which ones) and they were both very good. The menu had good variety, so I feel like it's a good spot to bring a group that could have diverse beer tastes. The staff was friendly and seemed to be happy working there. I would definitely visit again!"

                "description": "Design aesthetic on fleek. Open ro ALL customers--dog and kid-friendly! Strong wifi and food truck supported, Hopsquad is going places.  We walked in excited to try their beers. We heard about this spot and it was so easy to find off the main road. It's connected to Circle Brewing and separated by an easily-crossed chain fence. UGH! How convenient. Beer nerds unite! The mural art is very instagrammable and the interior is even more of a design paradise. The chairs, tables, succulents, artwork and all-around ambiance is so calming, zen and open. It's the perfect place to get work done or enjoy a sunny day with your furry friends. We were a group of four, and all of us loved the space. They also have strong wifi, so y'all know this girl would rather get studying/work done with a beer over cafe drinks any day.  The restrooms are also very clean and GET THIS...they have tampons, pads and AVEENO LOTION IN THE WOMENS' RESTROOM. Yee-haw! They have flights of four for the typical Austin price of $10. Everything is wonderful about this place. They also have a little strip of grass for dogs to do their business--and they have a poop bag station too. The food truck looks like omakase (I'm not entirely sure), but they have so many outdoor games/picnic tables as well as indoor activities like fooseball and dog treats.  The aspects that could be improved are parking. Yes, they have additional parking that's a few lots away...but immediate parking is a drag. We got lucky and squeezed in on the side by the large trash receptacles. The beers also weren't everybody's favorites. They did have a selection, but they only have a few beers on tap. However, Hopsquad is so very green still...that variety will take time. GREAT new brewery providing a hip space for all folks!"

                "description": "I stopped in this past Friday for some crowlers to-go. As this was my first visit, I tried three different offerings. First off, their online ordering is slick and seamless. Secondly, they seem to have adapted well to the pandemic with adequate spacing between their outdoor tables. I would definitely feel comfortable having some pints in their beer-garden. If you are as excited about Austin FC (soon-to-be season ticket holder) these guys are within easy walking distance to the gorgeous new stadium. I can see myself having pre-match beers here before taking the short walk to the stadium.  Now on to the important stuff: the beer!  I opted for their Kate la Quimica SMaSH IPA, Professor Pleasant pale ale, and my personal favorite style Sir Winsor ESB. I found the SMaSH to be my favorite, it was a fantastic representation of the style, 9/10. My second favorite was the ESB, major kudos for carrying this style that is far too rare state-side. It was delicious and my second favorite of that style in town 8/10 (bonus point for a well-done obscure style). I thought the pale ale was fair, I found it to be a bit one-note. Though pleasant on the nose, it lacked a similar nuance on the palate 6/10. All said, I will definitely be back to try their extensive and varied roster of brews. As a bonus, the staff I spoke with were extremely friendly and happy to talk about both their brews and Austin FC. Keep up the great work!"

As the name suggests they are very much hops forward. I am not. I came in and asked the woman about non-hop forward beers. She suggested one and I tried it. It was very hop forward. The bar, if you call it that, is very pretentious. Would not come here again if traveling through Austin."

There is a decent amount of space both indoors and out, but I could still see how this place could get packed.   We went around 5 on a Friday and it wasn't empty but also wasn't too crowded. It was nice out so we sat outside. I got a flight which was only $10 for 4 smaller beers and I could pick any of the options on tap.   I'm not a big beer drinker so I don't know that it's fair for me to detailed review each beer, but from the variety I'm sure any one that likes beer could find something they enjoy.   Great place to bring a group! They also have a little food truck/ restaurant out back that looked really good but I haven't tried yet."

The problem is that it takes longer to get a beer here on Austin FC game days than any of the other places. I know there's a big crowd on game day, but how dumb not to anticipate that and bring in more staff. A brewery exists to sell beer. And you'll wait 45 minutes in line to get one here. Hopsquad just hasn't figured out how to serve beer at a reasonable speed so they are selling half as many as they could while inconveniencing everyone."

                "description": "We chanced upon Hopsquad recently, and I don't think I've ever been more comfortable at any other brewery in Austin. I do agree that their beer is still probably finding its footing (Austin does have a competitive craft beer scene, after all), but I don't think other places can hold a candle to Hopsquad's absolutely chilled out homey vibes.   I'll do a pros and cons list.   Pros:  - I can bring my human +canine children and seat them indoors.  - the staff actually don't mind human children.  -cider and wine available for non-beer drinkers   -the staff like my canine child (and there are plenty of other dog parents who visit which means you can play \"I pet that dog!\")  - board games  - foosball table  - plenty of space   Cons  - I truly believe there are better beers out there.  - cider portions are small - from a can and a little steep , price wise  So when you weigh the two, the pros beat the cons by a mile. As for the beer- give them time. I mean, no one really cared about a few other noted breweries 5 years ago but look how popular they've become now ! Here's to Hopsquad becoming Austin's next too brewery.   - food truck outside  - plenty of parking"

Good beer and some wine, which is nice considering a lot of breweries around town don't have wine. Indoor space is large, and there are garage-like doors that stay open in nice weather, so it's as if you're outdoors but get the benefit of shade."

My husband and BiL got the patty melt and I ordered the chicken sandwich. I was very pleased with my sandwich and tots as were the boys.

And I was a little \"hangey\" having to wait a half hour to be seated. But it was worth it. The waiter checked back with us every few minutes (mandatory for a good restaurant). And our order was delivered hot and fresh in a reasonable amount of time (a little slow because they were very busy - but in a reasonable amount of time).  We had chips and queso as an appetizer. The chips were the thick, homemade type. And the queso was their own recipe with ancho cili drizzle, crema, some sort of pico de gallo, etc. Really good - exceptional.  I had a chicken sandwich. It had a lot going on (in a good way). It was not just a run of the mill chicken sandwich. And the sidewinder fries are fresh and homemade.   My wife had the watermelon, which she also said was really good.  Overall, some creative foods that were well executed, and on point service  Definitely give this place a try."

We ordered Texas on Horseback, Queso Blanco, and The Republic Rustler. All so delicious! Great atmosphere. County music playing. Family friendly crowd. We'll be back."

                "description": "I've had take out and dine in. After 3 consistent visits I can truly say this is my new favorite neighborhood bar. Eliana has been my bartender every time. She is amazing at referring a menu item or drink. All of the staff are pleasant and the vibe is definitely upbeat and happy. They are inclusive and go above and beyond to make sure each guest has a pleasant experience. I hade a Hell or High Water cocktail followed by a Pineapple Express. The drinks are fairly priced and worth the price. For food I had a Wrangler Patty Melt that knocked my socks off. I did substitute the Texas Toast for a regular toasted bun. The Jalapeño mousse gives me all of the feels and the carmelized onion gave the burger a sweet smokey taste. I'm not a french fry fan so I opted for the Mesquite-Sriracha Tater Tots. All I can say is ORDER THE TOTS! Even the side house salad was delicious. They toss the salad in a sweet and tangy dressing that's just enough. I love that this place is so close to home and does takeout. I will become a regular!"

                "description": "Sorry this is a little late but I wanted to give a review. I stopped by here a couple weeks ago for dinner. The place was full, but they squeezed me in at the bar. I asked for a menu and a beer. The bar tender let me sample one of the beers on tap. I liked it so I ordered one to drink. I also ordered a patty melt with tater tots. The burger was think and made to order. I had to cut the burger because I did not want a big mess from trying to get a bite into my mouth. The burger was juicy since I ordered it medium and very tasty. I can say it filled me up. The beer was cold, nothing better than a cold beer, well almost nothing.  The atmosphere was as most sports bars are, a little noisy but people seems to know each other and they were friendly. The bartenders were busy but kept getting those drinks. The servers were also busy taking food and refilling cups of the patrons. There is outdoor seating but it was one of those HOT Days so I was glad I was inside. The parking is decent but they share with several other businesses. It was not too far away from the entrance so no need to wear the sneakers unless you want to.  Thank you Republic Kitchen + Bar for being a good neighbor and giving us another option to dine in Leander, Texas."

The Kids corn dog was tasty. The chicken steak dish was devoured, as was the watermelon salad.  All in all it was a good afternoon lunch."

The kids had chicken strips and mac n cheese. The beers were good and cold. I love how they bring the beer in icy glasses.   We chose to sit outside but soon discovered the flies were way too many to be able to eat in peace. We couldn't stop waving our hands or the flies would land on the food. I'll go back, but sit inside next time."

                "description": "Decided to try a new place tonight, and glad we did! I had the patty melt, it was good. The only complaint I have about it is that they put the bread on the grill to get grill marks, but all I tasted was burnt toast. They do the top if the burger bun the same but it's not as grill marked. So next time I will ask for them not to do that, I hate black charred burnt toast. My husbands burger was good as well and both the tots and fries were tasty and perfect portion. They have a big bar with a good variety. I had a Hell or High Water to drink, and will definitely order that again. Delish! And last but def not least the service was great! Our server Kelsey was attentive and very sweet. Definitely looking forward to the next visit...word is they have a good weekend brunch, so we'll be checking that out."

                "description": "The chicken fried steak needs seasoning. It was missing some salt and the sauce over it was so much it took off the breading. But the mash and veggies had great flavor and tasted good!  Texas Smash is good if you like a honey whiskey, I don't.  But the old fashion was just how I like it!  Overall good place to try, the service was good. They have tvs on but I'd recommend that they put subtitles on all of them so since we can't hear them we can at least read and know what is going on."

                "description": "Ordered the chicken sandwich and honestly it was great until I got to the bottom of the second piece of chicken and it was completely raw. I almost threw up because I was worried how much raw chicken I had eaten. I wish I would've take a picture but I got so grossed out I tossed it immediately. I understand sometimes cooks can be rushed and I'm sure this rarely ever happens. Everything else was great but I couldn't get over the meat being raw."

                "description": "The atmosphere here is great. Everything seemed good at the start. Then we went to order food. Out of steak. Out of salmon. Out of wings. Out of shrimp. Out of some Cabernets. They were out of everything we went to order. The server could not have been more kind and sweet. She said it was because they run out of a lot of things on Saturday nights so Sundays they're just out. Well, I did a quick review of the comments on this restaurant and this is apparently a running theme. 1. Shame on me for not checking the comments before we came, 2. Shame on them for not resolving this clearly on-going issue. I know times are tough, but just close on Sunday nights if you cannot have more product delivered. We finished our drinks and left without ordering dinner at all."

A brownie on top of graham cracker crumbs topped with a toasted marshmallow.

                "description": "I didn't love this place. I totally understand that with COVID, many restaurants have had to cut back their menus.   With that being said, it seemed like breakfast-y food definitely prevailed during our Sunday afternoon visit. Seeing that they do a Sunday brunch, I get it, but always pictured that included a few other options not focused around eggs or waffles.   My husband ended up ordering their burger (which isn't even obviously advertised as a burger), and said it wasn't anything to write home about. My mother-in-law had their chicken sandwich and seemed to be okay with it. Not much fanfare from my husband's stepfather or his girls.  I ended up ordering the chili and didn't have any major complaints. I would've loved to see more in the \"siesta\" part of the menu that wasn't a salad.   My other complaint was the noise. The music was so loud that we could barely hear each other across the table, which pretty much awkwardly split our party in half. At first, we tried to get past it by borderline yelling, but that got old.   In between waiting for condiments, I asked our waitress if there was any way to knock the volume down by a click or two. She mentioned that she would see what she could do, but that it wasn't guaranteed since \"people pay for it\". My brother in law ended up seeing the jukebox in the corner, and while that's fantastic, I don't think it's too much to ask to keep music at a reasonable level in a place where you'd expect your guests to socialize at their table."

Tasted said salad and immediately my mouth was on fire. Asked waitress to verify if it was ranch and she says... \"oh we don't have regular ranch, just a spicy one...\" that would've been nice to know. I CANT EAT SPICY FOOD!! She proceeded to suggest I use another dressing to bring down the heat. Word of advice to owner... put the dressing on the side. I was sick all day from this incident.   Partner got French toast and it was amazing. Sadly we won't be back.."

                "description": "This was one of the worst experiences we've had in a restaurant in a long time.  The server was rude, the manager condescending (strangely, I don't remember him being so rude at Texican) and the place was dirty.  The table was sticky, and they knew it, even said there was nothing they could do about it because it was \"resin\"...it wasn't.  We ordered four entrees, and they came out in stages. The first ones to hit the table were cold.  The third followed five minutes later, and mine didn't show up for another five minutes, at which time I told them to just keep it.  The \"hash\" was runny and not at all hash, the scrambled eggs cold, bacon underdone, and no condiments available; when we asked for them, they acted like it was an imposition.    $92 worth of bad food and crap service.  Very disappointing considering the executive chef was wearing a Fox Hole chef's coat, and Fox Hole is one of my favorite places in this area; I assumed from the get it would be extraordinary after seeing that...I guess not.  Oh, and word of caution, when the server handed my fiancé the mobile payment device, she selected the 20% tip option.  Make sure you watch out for that...there is no signage indicating there is an automatic gratuity so the servers have NO business choosing their own tip amount.  Update: while we were out of town, we discovered my fiancé's debit card had been hacked.  Oddly, the odd charges started AFTER using the mobile payment device, which was WiFi powered.  I cannot stress this enough...BEWARE!"

                "description": "We waited until Slackers released their own brews to visit. It's great to have another brewpub open in the CP area. Slackers is located hard off 620 in the same strip mall as Interstellar BBQ.Hmmmm BBQ and beer, OK.  Slackers currently have 3 Slacker brews available and a slew of local and not so local taps. Their Belgium lager is a perfect beer to sip on a sunny day.  Round 2 was a Brooklyn amber lager. This brought back memories of our NYC trip and discovering the Brooklyn Brewery. This is a great representation of what an amber beer should be.   There are alternatives to beer such as wine. Got the munchies they have you covered. Check out their menu online.  The brewpub is very welcoming with a bar area and plenty of seating. Games are available and even a foosball table. Outside there are a few picnic benches where you can enjoy the sunshine and bring your mutt. Folks on both sides of the bar are friendly and if you are there for more than 10 minutes you are engaged in a conversation with a fellow pubster (sic)  One nit servers should be able to answer questions regarding their guest taps.   A solid 4 plus stars and Slackers is now in our brewpub rotation. Support Local!"

Oh yah and coffee too. We got to meet Derek and his wife, the owners. This is such a great spot to go and work or to relax at after work! Will definitely be back and can't wait to watch this business grow.  We were having so much fun I forgot to take pictures! I'll update with pictures next time I go."

                "description": "We really wanted to like this place... we live really close by. I didn't want to make dinner and my husband suggested that we try BackDraft.  It took over an hour to get our order. The brewery was having trivia night so maybe they were swamped with orders? Regardless, while the food tasted great, the portions (pizza and pizza rolls) were pricey for what we got. Paid over $50 for dinner (one salad, one small pizza, 3 very small pizza rolls and one dessert.)"

                "description": "BackDraft Pizzeria would have gotten 5 stars for the flavors of the pizza and pizza rolls but the timing was so slow, it left me wondering if I was just starving when the pizza was finally ready. They were so busy that they ran out of cheese and took about 40 minutes to prep the ingredients. I did enjoy the dough and the selections of pizza."

                "description": "On a slow afternoon trying to use their app. Asked the guy if he could help and he is every kind of rude. Place the order wait 40 minutes. No text so I go check and get snapped at. At 1 hour I go back to tell him to forget it. OH its ready now. All I ordered was pizza rolls. They were burned on the outside and cold in the middle. Terrible just terrible."

                "description": "Terrific pizza, but painful service.  BackDraft Pizza is wonderful pizza.  But, ordering it, customizing it, and paying for it is a pure pain in the ass.   I've gotten their pizza on at least three or four times over the past year.  And each time, the ordering process is a bad joke.    For example, last night, with a windchill of about 20 degrees, I stood in the ordering window for roughly 10 minutes, because the ordering app would not work.   After entering my debit card info including cell number and email address, there was no \"submit\" button on the app.  I handed my phone to the clerk and asked him to show me where to click it.    After getting my phone, he squinted at the screen, stating he didn't have his glasses, and couldn't read it.   We fumble with the app for another five minutes, with no success.  Meanwhile, I'm freezing my ass off.   Finally, after almost 15 minutes, the guy grabs the iPad, takes my card and enters the order manually, and then has to re-insert my debit card. Once they finally get the order, I ask how long it will be.  \"About 20 minutes\" he answers.  I look at my watch and it's 7:15.   At 7:40, 25 minutes later, I had not gotten a text yet.  Since I had waited more than 25 minutes, I went out to check on it.    I figured they'd have it ready by then.   Oh no!  It'd be another 5 minutes.  This was like the Seinfeld episode at the Chinese Restaurant.  \"Another 5 minutes.\"  I had to duck around the corner, to get out of the wind.  I had left my coat inside, as they had led me to expect the pie to be ready.   These as**holes  kept me waiting another 15 minutes, before they finally delivered the pizza, about 40 minutes after I first ordered it.  I thought I would freeze to death before they handed over the pizza.   It was terrific, as usual, but I won't be subjecting myself this type of suffering, because the Company can't get its app to work--and then subjects the customer to a consistent routine of misery, just to order one of their pizzas.  It's great pizza, but definitely NOT worth the labor required to simply ORDER ONE ONLINE.  The pandemic's nearly over. Perhaps it's time to junk the app, and TRAIN THEIR STAFF HOW ACCEPT ORDERS MANUALLY."

                "description": "BackDraft keeps switching up their home on us, but we will follow them all over Metric. Our favorites are the Shrooms to the Moon (Mushrooms, Caramelized Onions, Sausage) and the Backdraft (Sausage, Pepperoni, Jalapeños) pizzas.   They are the perfect accompaniment to a pint of draft beer from whichever brewery is housing them at the moment. But if you're looking to just bring their pizza home, you can also order online ahead of time to skip that 20 min wait on site."

                "description": "Ordered a few pizzas over the weekend, and thoroughly enjoyed them!  If you like pizzas that are lighter and refreshing, then this is a place to try. My favorites were the Twisted Rita and Sweet Sow. The Shrooms to the Moon had some good umami to it -- it's the most flavorful, but a bit heavier than the first two. Also -- if you like pizza rolls, then I would definitely try the Rollin' Ronies.  I will definitely be ordering these again in the near future.  Note about ordering: I ordered online and picked up the food. I will say, however, that the order was not ready by the estimated time. Instead, you can wait for a text notification to pick up the order. I didn't know that, but now I do!"

                "description": "Looking at recent Yelp reviews, I was nervous about how this place would turn out. BackDraft did NOT disappoint.   First off, where is it? There is conflicting info on Yelp and their website. I called ahead because going to the wrong pickup spot would turn me into a hangry rage. They did not answer the phone but the host breweries did. CONFIRMED: They are currently located at Celis brewery.   We ordered 2 pizzas for pickup on Grubhub on a Friday night. BackDraft and pepperoni. They were ready in about 30 minutes. CONFIRMED: The pizzas were AMAZING. Like... hands down some of the best pizza I've ever had. Their homemade sausage and humongous thin pepperoni slices were phenomenal.  I can't speak for anyone else's experiences recently. It sounds like delivery may be questionable? But as of April 2021, if you can drive to pick up a pie, this is the place you need to go."

                "description": "Oh man.  The pizza here is fire.    It's located right in front of 4th Tap Brewing Co-Op  which is a perfect pair.  We ordered their signature pizza, The Backdraft.  It's topped with House Made Spicy Sausage, Pepperoni, Fresh Jalapeños, but we also added mushrooms on ours.  It's a thin crust style pizza that is PACKED with flavor.  Our buddy ordered the Kale Yeah Caesar salad which he was very pleased with.  The guys that run this truck are really cool and definitely dedicated to their craft.  Backdraft Pizzeria is definitely up there on the short list of Austin's best pizza.  I'd be surprised if they didn't branch out and open up another location in the near future, especially in the downtown Austin area.  I would highly recommend giving them a visit and try their food.  How can you say no to a fantastic pizza and a frothy craft beer to go with it?"

We quickly ordered the Backdraft pizza, a pepperoni pizza, and wings. The order was delivered contactless and on time, hot and ready to eat. We've lived in Austin for almost 2 years and I've been disappointed by all the Austin favorite pizza spots but my days of yearning for good pizza are DONE. My husband and I are both now completely obsessed with Backdraft and I'm sure will be ordering it again very, very soon."

                "description": "TLDR: BackDraft is back, and they're better than ev-VAH!  I'm a longtime fan of BackDraft, even once calling it 'the best pizza you can get off a truck'.  That's damning with faint praise, as this is some of the best pizza in all of Austin.    Back when I first tried them, the food truck was parked down on 360 near Bee Cave.  But now that both I and they have moved to the north quadrant of Austin, and they're attached to an excellent brewery to boot!  By far, my favorite is a slightly altered 'Shrooms to the Moon', which is a triple-whammy combo of homemade spicy sausage, mushrooms, and carmelized onion. If you look at the picture, you'll see that the crust has the  right amount of 'char' or 'leoparding' as some call it.   Whoever's doing the pizza-slinging at BackDraft knows their stuff. Get down here when they're open, grab a brewski, and you're in for one of the best lunch combos that Austin can serve up!  Some Tips:  1) I said 'best lunch', but be sure to check their hours before you come. I'm pretty sure they just do lunch Friday and Saturday.  Otherwise, they follow brewery peak hours and just do evenings.  2) Try the Shrooms to the Moon but ask them to hold the caramelized onions.  Without the onions, you get a spicier, hotter pizza which goes perfectly with a pale ale beer to wash it down.  You'll end up with a pizza-nirvana feeling of a warm glow in your tummy.  This place scores a 5 out of 5 on the 'CTJ Scale', as noted below.  5 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Jesus good. Would be OK passing away after finishing a plate here. 4 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Mary good. Would be OK being seen eating here by Mother Mary. 3 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Joseph good. Would be OK having a beer here with Jesus' Dad. 2 out of 5 stars: Come-to-the-Apostles good. Meh. Wouldn't have my last supper here. 1 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Nobody good. I wouldn't have my penultimate supper here, either."

                "description": "At noon on a Friday, it only took 13 minutes to get my food. I got pizza and wings to go. This is one of the best pizzas I have had in Austin so far. The crust was very thin and had a good crunch to it. The sauce for the wings had a slight sweetness and wasn't too hot. I also appreciate that they put the buffalo sauce for my wings on the side, so that they wouldn't get soggy before I got home."

The Bourbon Berry Cocktail was my favorite! We also enjoyed sampling many different beers and wines on tap. Their crispy chicken sandwich was delicious! Very crispy on the outside and moist on in the inside.   They have crowlers and growlers for 25% off everyday. I really wish they had a smaller to go container as I would've loved to have taken some of the Berry cocktail home - I can't justify the cost of it to take home a crowler or growler. We would definitely go back if we were in the area again."

                "description": "We really enjoyed this place which was an accidental find on our way back from one of our activities in Austin. It is a self-serve concept, so basically you are given a card to scan anytime you want to order a wine, beer, or a cocktail from one of their many taps. You also place your food order at the counter and they bring it out to you.   The fried avocado tacos were amazing and my significant other really enjoyed whatever tacos he had, which I believe were the Carnitas. Why four stars then? Two reasons. One is I was really confused on how much I should tip. I usually don't struggle with this being a bartender, but since we had to pour our own drinks and order food at the counter , I wasn't comfortable leaving a full 20%. Second, when you are pouring your beer, the price adds up very quick. There was one point my boyfriend poured a pint glass and the beer ended up being $22. That was a bit of a letdown. Otherwise the staff is VERY friendly and welcoming -they run a very tight ship. The bathrooms were exceptionally clean and the layout with a big outdoor patio is a bonus. Highly recommend, just watch the higher ABV beers because they add up fast!"

                "description": "The uniqueness of this place really sets it apart. You are given a card to pour any of the beers on top yourself, which I had seen before and always love. What I hadn't seen was also you can pour wine or cocktails! This experience is perfect for all of those people crawling out of quarantine and not knowing what to do when they cant pour their own drinks. But now you can! And despite the setup involving many hands, Oz. keeps the place sparkling clean.  I can't speak much to the food menu. It's mostly a meat-forward fare. They have a vegan burger patty, but I was told neither of the buns are vegan. Since the patty was really soft, I am not sure it would work as a lettuce wrap. It seems weird to have a vegan patty when you can't have a full vegan burger, but at least there is a vegetarian option.  My mom liked her fish and chips.   I am really just here for the taps though!"

                "description": "How lucky are we to arrive in Texas and meet this amazing place! It was like stepping in paradise. Delicious food and a whole variety of beers.   We tried a few of the beers and had some Tex-Mex.   I tried the sangria beer. I believe it was number 32 on the panel. If you like sangria and bubbles go for it, It's like sangria with bubbles (GF)  Husband had a few other kinds of beers which I tried and oh Man, It was very good! Nothing like I ever had before.   I also had the house tacos (3) with chicken, steak and fried avocado. The fried avocado was definitely a hit for me. It was full of flavor, creamy and crunchy at the same time.   If you are visiting Austin like us and want to drive away from the city you won't regret going to Oz Tap House.   Also, one of the owners is supper friendly we had the pleasure to speak with Sean briefly. Staff is also very nice, patiently explained to us how tap works.   Thanks Oz Tap House for such a memorable welcome!   I recommend this place to everyone!!"

                "description": "I just ordered lunch from Oz tap house. We got fish and chips, fried pickles,  a baked pretzel, a Caesar salad and a cheesesteak.   The pro's: The ranch dressing that came with the fried pickles was pretty good, As was the coleslaw.   The cons:  The fish and chips portion was small and soggy. It was two pieces of greasy fish, that iterally had no flavor. Fish and Chips is one of my favorite foods and I've had it all over the world. Never had I gotten it without flavor. How do you make something taste like nothing? Granted. I asked that the fish and chips have no hot pepper on it. Unfortunately, Hot pepper is the only spice Oz uses.  The fries were cold inside - clearly not hand-cut. The Caesar salad, was spicy in a weird way. It was not good.  The Philly Cheesesteak was very very spicy and greasy.  The Baked Pretzel - Auntie Ann's does a better job, this was a VERY basic, previously frozen pretzel. Nothing special and not worth the price.  The fried pickles - under seasoned and instead of crisp, they were chewy. Again not good.    Everything was extremely spicy, from the fish and chips to the Caesar salad. Food items that traditionally aren't spicy, were all grossly over spiced with hot peppers. Oz Tap House needs to learn how to use spices without making things spicy. Go back to cooking school - Spiced and Spicy! There is a difference! One more thing,  Read dietary notes. There's a reason why people write them."

We were greeted when we walked in,had the process explained etc.  Beers, a couple of ciders,and wines on tap. Pretty cool. I did semi accidentally pour myself 9 oz of wine, so it was a $12 glass, not what I'd typically spend on a glass of wine, but I also typically wouldn't be served 9 oz.  Our food came out quickly and it was really good!  I don't know much it was (folks mentioned auomatic gratuity) bc my husband paid, but it was great and we will definitely come back. They had a playground in the back that we saw,which would be great to come to with our lil people."

                "description": "Stopped by Oz. Tap House for the first time after a Vandegrift H.S. football game, recommended to us by a family member.  \"Go to Oz (pronounced Oz, like wizard of Oz) Tap House, is great.  First things first, we realized later it's not Oz it's Oz.  Notice the period after the z.  Oz. = ounce!  Makes perfect sense when you see the concept.  Dozens of self-serve taps, pouring cocktails, beer, wine, etc.  Way cool!  We couldn't tell how much vodka was actually in the Cosmos we had, but they were tasty!  The Community brand ice tea off the charts too.  Any place serving Community products knows their stuff ... oh yeah, the food.  Definitely \"gotta go back for more\" fare.  Fried cauliflower and jalapeños, nice ranch sauce.  Our server, unprompted, brought some buffalo wing sauce, \"dip a little in here, then the ranch.\"  Awesomeness!  House tacos and cod tacos were delicious, depths of sublime flavors layered into top shelf flour tortillas.  Our only observation was using the house taco slaw on the cod tacos may be a better pairing than the sautéed cabbage... at any rate, the tacos were outstanding.  We'll definitely be back, lots more on the menu to explore.  And a special shout out to James working the register.  Explained the concept, led us through the process, and answered quite a few \"newbie\" questions.  He was great, no need to hire more employees, clone James!"

They are also dog friendly outside as long as they're leashed. I had a half order of carnitas nachos which was pretty good sized. Some of the chips were a little stale so that was my only nagative feedback. We also tried a house burger with fries which was solid. Overall they have good food and the patio is nice. Try it out!"

                "description": "One of the closest breweries, in North Austin, to the Austin FC Q Stadium Oskar Blues Brewery is the best spots to stop and have some pre-game beers all in the air conditioning!  Plenty of space to come in with a large group of peeps and even catch some live music on a fantastic and great sounding stage!   My best friend and I came in on a busy Saturday afternoon on a game day so there were plenty of people enjoying beer by the pints and all dressed up in their verde gear. We ended up finding a cool spot near the stage to partake in the flight of beers we ordered.  I couldn't decide on what to get so we opted for the flights to get us started.    Beers - boy oh boy I have never had a smoothie hard seltzer beer ever and Oskar Blues knocked my socks off when I tried their L.A.B. Juice which was super refreshing and looked like a smoothie I make at home. Unsure what was in it but I bet strawberries, banana, and maybe some seltzer apple juice? Either way do not sleep on any of the beers they have on tap that are special to Austin as I am finding out that the beers on tap here differ from their other taprooms in Colorado!  What a special thing for Austin!  One of the biggest perks of Oskar Blues is the space, the live music, and the air conditioning! Texas has at least 9 months out of the year where it is consistently over 89 degrees even in the Fall. Oskar Blues has the air pumping on hot days like when we visited and had plenty of games and shade outside for us to hang under.   We will definitely be back especially to see some live music again. The stage is super professional, large, and the sound man was doing an excellent job for the acoustic performer we saw play that day. I am sure they have epic great shows here."

First thing that stood out to me was how quiet everything was. it was early afternoon, and the place was relatively empty. it does have an extremely large open room, which lends itself to this. if you are looking for a more laid back experience, this place is probably a good bet. the beer itself was good. there wasn't anything that really stood out as fantastic, but nothing that really stood out as bad either.

                "description": "Recently stopped in for a farewell party for a coworker. The atmosphere is relaxed - open and large, with lots of space both indoors and out. I wouldn't personally choose to revisit. I didn't really feel they had a large selection of beer, especially for a brewery that really only serves beer. Water is self-serve from a sink, into tiny cups, and they don't have ice. If you're the DD, they don't have many options to drink besides tap water in very small cups (I think someone in our group got a bottled root beer). If you aren't a big drinker or enjoy your water cold, you won't enjoy your time here. One of our group had to essentially beg for a normal sized cup to serve herself water from the sink, and when a different girl asked, she was told she couldn't have a bigger cup.  The thing that really sealed the deal and added this place to our company blacklist is that at the end of the night, after our VP paid the tab (which included a 20% gratuity), a bartender came out and intentionally tried to shame her for not tipping more by making two very snarky comments to embarrass her in front of everyone. A different person in our group spoke to the manager about this and the bartender came out and pretended to apologize, while continuing to tell our VP that she didn't tip enough \"because we busted our a**es for you guys\".  At a brewery where the only things you serve are beer on tap and hard seltzer in a can, and every patron is responsible for going up to the bar and getting their own drinks. You don't have to mix drinks or serve food (or ice) or bring drinks out to the table... 20% seems fair for pouring beers and nothing else.  The reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 is the manager (owner?) did really try to make it right after the non-apology, and offered gift cards and free drinks cards, which was appreciated (and they were given to the person who chose this place and left before the rudeness). I honestly don't think any of us who were there when it happened would ever go back."

As a first timer, the bar tender gave me several samples to try. I went with the Dallas Blonde Ale and was not disappointed... it was actually very good.   There were plenty of hightops indoors for seating and the place was packed on a Thursday afternoon (5pm happy hour). I chose to sit on the patio outside where there were more picnic tables, tents, and even cornhole!   Fair warning, the parking lot is a bunch of rocks and dirt, so expect your car to be dirty when you leave. It also looks like a giant warehouse from the outside, but the entrance is along the far right side.  Definitely try Oskar Blues if you're in the area. One of my favorite breweries so far!"

She came back out 3 minutes later and repeated herself, claiming that she had a baby dog she had to get back to. Don't think I'll ever go back there, plenty of other places where I can enjoy my beer in peace and not get yelled at. Only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the beer was good."

                "description": "Compared to other breweries in the area I feel like Oskar Blues doesn't get a ton of love but I've really enjoyed my experiences when coming here! They do a great job of utilizing their massive space, they're one of the few breweries with tvs (when indoor dining/drinking is available) and they have a massive stage for live music (again when indoor is a viable option).   I recommend trying more of their seasonal or offshoot beers if you visit than their staples. For one, their flagship beers are available nationwide and I haven't found any of them to be particularly noteworthy.   The seasonal beers cast a really wide net and have had more hits than misses in my experience. Their Death by Coconut Porter and Slow Chill Dunkel were both fantastic and they do a pretty good job with their various juicy IPAs.   The food truck has some really tasty tacos and I like that they've partnered with the brewery to give 4$ off a food order for every full pour of beer you order. This does come with the caveat that the prices are kind of outrageous if you don't utilize this option, but it becomes a pretty good deal with it. The tacos are more traditional street taco style, so if that's not your thing they do have some more typical bar fare like burgers, fries, and nachos.   Overall, I think it's a great hang out spot. They are reliably not super packed, they have a wide variety of mostly good beers, and have a food truck that will keep you satisfied while you hang out. I don't think any of the other breweries in this part of Austin can boast all three of those, so I highly recommend!"

Dog friendly outdoors. Lots of beer choices available for ~$5 per pint. Because of COVID they added an extra $5 charge to our tab, but we could use that credit at the food truck. Gives free bag of chips with the beer. Good music. Would recommend!"

                "description": "This is a fun Brewery that we go to frequently.  Not only is the beer tasty but they have a large stage with live music throughout the week.  There are plenty of tables and even a few very comfy high-backed vinyl booths.   Also, the typical beer garden area outside with strung lights, roomy tables and corn hole games.   The bands that play are varied with an emphasis to blues and rock. We have discovered a few local bands we like just from going for a beer on a Friday evening.  For certain bands, they will clear a small area in front of the stage for dancing.  The beers they offer are good, but its a smaller selection than some breweries. They stick to a few classics like several IPAs, a couple stouts, a pilsner. Have yet to seen any kind of sours offered. Would love to see a specialty sour.  There is a Wunderpig barbecue truck on site with very tasty sandwiches. Be sure and grab napkins!  Large clean bathrooms, friendly bartenders, and plenty of parking too. Can't go wrong here."

                "description": "I've officially been to Oscar Blues a handful of times and I love it! Out of the 3 or 4 Breweries that I've been to in the area, this one is my favorite!   They have free, live music very frequently with a great stage and sound set up.   The staff is awesome and to say that they are friendly would be an understatement. A couple of occasions I've been here with my boyfriend's band and they treated the members and their guests with top notch service.   Last but not least, their beer is awesome! My go-to is always the Rose for Dayz just because I'm a fruity/citrusy kind of girl haha.   This has definitely turned into a regular hangout place."

                "description": "Looking for a local brewery to grab a drink and have good barbecue, I picked this place because it was close to the office and hotel and it had a decent ranking on everyone's favorite food app, \"Yelp\".  Arriving to the site, I was a little concerned that I may have read the Yelp review wrong. The opening is a driveway to a parking lot behind an industrial warehouse. So you might find it a little disconcerting as you drive over 100 feet of driveway and then cross into a chain-link surrounded dirt parking lot.   What hit me in the face was the taproom essence, which smelled of old beer and sanitizer fluid. Not a big fan of the smell. Then the décor of the taproom reminded me of a mix of a 1970's New Year's party and a crushed velvet weekend band cave. (Lol, I don't know how good the bands are that play there but they had it set up like it.) What I thought was strange was the noise level which was almost whisper-like and the lack of any music playing over the speakers. I may have gone at an off time but still, there should have been some music playing in the background.  The beer was tasty. I had the Can-O-Bliss Citra and the G-Knight. The bouquet off the Can-O-Bliss was amazing but lamentably, the flavor wasn't there to back it up. I preferred the G-Knight much more. It was good go-to IPA.   Sitting there I was hungry and asked to see the menu. They handed me a short menu and told me that I had to order outside at a food truck that was parked in the parking lot. It was raining and I wasn't too keen on ordering outside but I was hungry so I sucked it up and did it. You can see my review at Wunder Pig Barbecue - Yelp. But the long and short of it is the food was a big disappointment. And there was no bar food available. No finger foods! Bummer.   I realize you aren't a restaurant but please kick that food truck off the parking lot and get one that serves bar/finger food and better barbecue."

                "description": "Oskar Blues Brewery is located in Austin, TX right next to Caliber Collision on Metric Blvd. Luckily-- my father in law works right next door to this Brewery. He was the very one that introduced us to this place. I love craft beer and I must say I love Oskar Blue's beers!!! What I enjoy the most about this place is that they offer beer-flights! My top favs has got to be Mamas Little Yella Pils and Can-O-Bliss IPA!  I love that they also have live music here. I believe when a band is performing, that's the only time they won't be able to sell you a beer flight.. Music could get super loud so luckily they have outside seating as well. It's crazy how busy they could get! Lol. All the tables inside fill up super quickly because of the live music.  Overall experience: fantastic. I love the atmosphere, also this brewery is clean and spacious. The workers are very friendly and I always have a good time conversing with them. Great music and even better beers! Until next time"

                "description": "Out of the handful of breweries I've visited in the ATX, this one is hands down my favorite!  It's VERY spacious, and has plenty of room to sit at the large bar, or one of the many tables in the venue.    They have a decent size stage for live music, but I was there on an early evening, so nothing was going on at that time.  There was a decent sized crowd in the place, but it wasn't too loud and it didn't make you feel cramped.  I mentioned the spacious seating area - they have quite a few long tables that are great for group get togethers.   Nice apparel shop with brewery t-shirts, hats, koozies, stickers, and more.  They have 16 beers on tap.  You can get a sampler flight of four beers for eight bucks - you just can't beat that with a stick!  They have six choices of non alcoholic soda and a sparkling water option.  Nice sized patio with a covered tarp to keep the sun off of you and keep you out of the rain.  Giant Jenga and other games to play out on the patio - it's really a fun place to hang out.''  There's usually a food truck parked outside - I was told it's a permanent fixture and their \"home base\", so check them out.  It's called  \"Cluck n Burger\" and it was awesome.  Look for my review for that one coming soon.  The beers I had inside were Mama's Little Yella Pils (I've had it before and it's OK).  But the one that blew my socks off was the the Old Chub Scotch Ale.  This really surprised me, because I'm not usually into the heavier flavored beers.  But this one was just so divine and delectable.  I'm gonna have to begin a search for this one in my local beer joints in SA.  They're open from noon to 8pm Sunday and Monday and from noon to 10pm every other day of the week.  Wi-Fi password is Oskarblues"

Driving there at night, you might think you are driving into a forbidden, industrial area but turning on the street where the brewery is, you will see the lights.  I happened to come on a night where there was live music. The stage is in a great location and there are table and chairs for people to sit and enjoy the show. The decor is very unique and you can tell you are in a brewery.   The staff was very nice and I truly enjoyed talking to the friendly bartenders. The outside area has long picnic type tables were a large party or group of friends can come and hang.  I went alone, but a cute programmer by the name of Daniel came and chat to keep me company!  I will definitely visit this location again for a beer!"

We had quail and guacamole for appetizers. It was my first time ever eating quail and oh man it was delicious! Very flavorful! The guacamole was okay but needed more salt to it.  I ordered the double angus beef burger. I was full from the quail, quac, along with chips and salsa. However, I did attempt to eat most of my burger! The patties on these burgers we are juicy and delicious!  The staff were very friendly and the manager would check on us periodically. Our waiter kept up with us and would make sure we had our drink consistently filled and not empty.  I also learned they have happy hour and heard it's worth coming to.  Parking can be a pain in the area but is a parking garage by the hotel across from this place. So not too bad."

                "description": "It was good, it wasn't bad... I need a 3.5.  We stayed at the Sheraton right there for a GALA and hit up Hard Count both for late night drinks and again for brunch. It wasn't exactly what I expected. I'll admit I didn't look into it too much but we have eaten at the sushi place there a few times and I'd seen pictures of HC's food, I just assumed it was a nice restaurant. It's not, it's a sports bar....which is fine, just not what I was hoping for. Anyways our server Friday night was fantastic, we chose to sit outside to escape the bar, it was freezing but with the heaters and cute outdoor space it was great. We ordered the Cuban nachos and they got mixed reviews. Half of us LOVED them and half did not care for them. Even though I didn't exactly care for them I loved that they were different, made with house potato chips rather than tortilla chips.   We had serval drinks and ended with some green tea shots our server suggested, they must have been good since we ordered another round. We closed our tab and walked back to the hotel when they closed at 11pm. Georgetown is still up and coming, hopefully someday a sports bar can stay open until 12/1am but for now I can see why they have to close as there were only a handful of people inside.    Brunch, at brunch, after asking the hostess what her favorite was she told us she'd honestly never tried the food, we sampled several things. We LOVE calamari, so of course went with that after our servers' recommendation. I'm shocked to say I did not care for it, they come with a warm red sauce with sort of an applesauce texture that wasn't for me. I asked for a side of Serrano ranch and ate their house friend pickle slices that were mixed in with the calamari instead. I had the French onion soup that was my favorite! It was outstanding, super buttery not just salty like most places. Their hash browns were described on the menu as crispy (that's how we love them) and they weren't lying they were crisp-E! My husband absolutely LOVED the chicken and waffles! We also got 3 kids meals to go: macaroni and cheese looked amazing but no one cared for it was basically cheese fondue with noodles of that makes sense, not a creamy sauce more just melted cheese that doesn't stay on the noodles so it was too fancy for my kids and myself so that went to waste. Grilled cheese with fries went over okay with our son, he didn't care for the Texas toast he said it was too thick for his mouth he said it hurt to eat (kids, lol) and the fries are seasoned waffle fries which I loved but not so much the kids, lastly the chicken fingers those they fought over!  Our bill for brunch with tip was $85 and I didn't even order a real meal. We won't be back for the ambiance, if this were a nice restaurant with a warm, cozy welcoming atmosphere maybe just for the French onion soup and chicken and waffles or to sit outside.  Bloody Mary Calamari French onion soup Side of bacon Side of hash browns Chicken and waffles 3 kids meals (no drinks)  Overall I'll still recommend it to friends! It's a great little area over there with a cute waiting area with games and such for all the restaurants. I hope to see that area flourish and survive for decades."

My boyfriend was pleased with the abundance of sports on the many large screen TVs.   The food was good, especially his chicken enchiladas, which had a nice little bite. I opted for the seared salmon Caesar which was recommended by our server. The salmon was fresh, they have seafood shipped in fresh never frozen, but was a little bland. I enjoyed the salad all the same. It was a nice alternative on a day where we were unwilling to wait."

The valet parking is a nice option, although we prefer not to use it since we really have no reason to. I like that there are casual outdoor recreational areas for kids and adults alike! Now, onto the restaurant itself. It's a really nice place and presents an open atmosphere. It is family-friendly and although we have not been at night, I am most sure it's more for adults at that time. Our server was great and checked on us regularly. The food was really good and offers atypical flavors. For instance, their salsa is not Tex-Mex, but more tomato-like and on the sweeter side...there's really no spice to it at all. The queso was tasty, but don't let it sit too long or it will harden and break a chip while trying to give it a dip! Again, not Tex-Mex, so don't expect it, especially if you're a Tex-Mex snob like me. Ha! We'll give it another shot in the evening to compare with our afternoon experience. Give it a try yourself!"

In my opinion the only thing I did not like was the waffle fries were crunchy, mainly because there's some weird additives they added to them, looks like some kind of sesame seeds or something.  Waffle fries are just fine by themselves with great seasoning no need to add weird crunchy stuff, I literally thought I was going to check my teeth only reason why I didn't go five stars here.  My wife got the blackened salmon Caesar salad which I must say was above and beyond with a ton of flavor! I will probably get this next time.  On another note their coleslaw is unlike anything I've had before some kind of a cilantro vinaigrette highbred but I must say I do anything to learn this recipe!  Decent draft beer selection and a handful of wines this place is worth a visit especially if it's game day and you're looking for a good game there's TVs in every direction you look pretty good sports bar especially at an upscale level I would recommend it definitely give this place a shot!"

                "description": "This is one of the newer Georgetown spots and we finally made it out for a late lunch. I've been craving fish and chips - which I've heard is one of their specialties.    We started with the Calamari Diablo - it wasn't as spicy as I expected, but it was delish! The calamari pieces were sliced thinner and crispy.  Peppered thru the dish were fried pickles and shaved Parmesan that complemented the appetizer nicely!  The dip was \"marinara-ish\" with sliced onions - Yummy!   The menu had plenty of great options but we both got fish and chips.  The plate was loaded with 3 large battered/fried cod pieces.   The crunch to fish ratio was on point!  The dish came with a unique slaw made from cabbage, apple slices and apple cider Vinegar- I couldn't place my finger on the spices but it was very tasty!  The thin sliced apples popped in the slaw.   The waffle fries were crunchy (I normally don't like waffle fries but these were thinner and possibly light battered/double fried with perfect seasoning.   We will definitely return ~ looking forward to trying more options from the menu and bringing friends with us next time."

                "description": "This is a true hidden gem in Georgetown and I'm so glad we found it! We came here for a late lunch today. I got the Joey's el Classico margarita and my fiancé got the roadrunner. Unfortunately my margarita was way too sour for me and I hate to be this person, but I asked if I could trade it out. Our waitress said yes and I got the jalapeño martini which was way more enjoyable. For an appetizer we got the Cuban nachos, which was basically the fillings of a Cuban sandwich served over a bed of homemade chips with a swiss queso. I'm salivating just writing this because it was so good we cleaned the plate!  For my meal I ordered the chicken fried steak that came with mashed potatoes, bacon green beans and Texas toast. Y'all....as a southern girl I consider myself a chicken fried steak aficionado, and they know what they're doing. The serving was huge, the breading  flavorful and crispy, and the gravy was so good I wanted to dip everything in it. You can also really tell that their sides are not an afterthought because the green beans were so good I couldn't stop eating them even well after I was full. My fiancé got the fish and chips and while I didn't personally try it he said it was delicious, and again, the portions were huge! You definitely get your money's worth here. Along with the great food we also had great service so next time we're in Georgetown we will definitely be back!"

I would HIGHLY recommend to management to change your classification to include restaurant as well because when searching for that this place won't pop up. BUT the fish and chips is killer, very crispy and great flavor. The slaw on the side is some of the best slaw I've had. Also love all the sauces it comes with. Will def be back."

Everything was great! The service was excellent! We split the Wedge Salad and it was great. I absolutely loved the Chicken Piccata Pasta!!! It was the very best I have ever had! My husband ordered the Chicken Fried Steak and he said the steak, the gravy and the mashed potatoes and green beans were all amazing! For Lunch 1 day I had the Chicken Cobb and it was SOOO good and my husband had the Prime Rib Dip and said it was delicious! We ordered a Pepperoni Pie to split one night and it was great as well. I wish there was a Hard Count restaurant  close to where we live! If we are back in Georgetown we will definitely be eating here again!"

                "description": "Wow! What an amazing meal. I stumbled upon this hidden gem while in the area grabbing thing at a near by Home Depot. I was hungry and had already tried some near by restaurants. This place was not busy and the ambiance seemed nice.  My friends and I were a starving and boy did we come to the right place. We started with cooked oysters that were absolutely mouth watering. One of my friends had never had oysters so I was excited that he enjoyed them. We also got the pork belly queso, it was a bit thick but full of flavor. The chips were crispy and seasoned which helped with the thick cheese. One friend got the Buffalo chicken sandwich, the biggest juiciest chicken breast I'd ever seen. He left nothing on his plate! My other friend go the fish and chips, he does not like coleslaw but this was no ordinary slaw. The head chef explained they don't use vinegar and they do add celery seed. I was the big girl and ordered the pork chop, large portion but I ate it down to the bone. I wish I had another option besides mashed potatoes but overall it was awesome. We did order cocktails, peach martini and margaritas. Our server was knowledgeable and very pleasant. We were immediately greeted and seated. Our food was fresh and hot and the wait wasn't long at all. I can't wait to go back and try desserts."

And the restaurant was also a new dining experience. We ordered \"regular\" food including a hamburger and fish dinner.  But they were very good. The waiter was outstanding and made us feel like we got special service.  We will go there again soon."

                "description": "My wife and I love slab, but we were extremely upset that the Burnet location decided to close 15 minutes early on a Saturday. Closing at 8pm is already a bit early for a weekend night, but shutting off the open sign at least 15 minutes early is crazy. It could have been longer, but it was off when we got there, so who knows when they did shut it down.   The new phone and order system also sucks. You can't talk to anyone, it just sent us to voicemail. Even the online now shuts off early due to toast tab not taking pickup orders when we tried to put one in on our way there.   You are not the only place in town that sells great bbq, guys. If you keep making it difficult to buy yours, people will just go elsewhere."

Second, as you can see in my pictures my sliced beef sandwich was drrrrry! So d@'-dry I got beef stuck In my throat from trying to wash that dry ass beef down and that was without the bread!! I felt some foul vibes when we approached the counter but I just thought I was tripping. I truly believe the meat cutter knew he sold us that dry ass sandwich as well, so 1 star jerk!"

                "description": "Great BBQ for an even greater price! I was really impressed with everything we tried, and for it all being just under $50, it was worth it. It's not your \"traditional\" BBQ stop - the menu is really fun and there are some pretty creative treats to try, from Texas-sized sandwiches to habanero strawberry glazed ribs. The meats were tender as could be, the flavor was incredible, and the sauces were amazing. Will definitely be visiting again!   Service: 5/5 Food: 5/5  Individual food ratings: - Habanero Strawberry Glazed ribs (5/5): sweet and spicy (but more sweet), these ribs were perfectly tender and had really great flavor! You can get them without the glaze, or get the glaze on the side. - Smoked Gouda Mac'n'cheese (4/5): pretty tasty mac, very cheesy and creamy, would be great with hot sauce or meat. - BBQ nachos w/brisket (5/5): super loaded, huge shareable portion, and great flavors! Add extra sauces on top to get saucy. - El Jefe sammie (5/5): brisket, onions, peppers, and Fritos for some crunch, this was a great sandwich and super filling! - Twice baked potato casserole (3/5): needed a kick or maybe some more salt/pepper, but was good overall with the dank white sauce on top."

I had the chicken and the brisket and both were really good , seasoned well and very moist - cooked to perfection. I couldn't finish my salad and took maybe half of it home. So, portion wise, this is also a win. My daughter had the 1/2 ribs and we were all taken by surprise on the flavor. Seriously, TRY their RIBS!!!  They have a selection of different sauces, including a strawberry one that came with the ribs. I was very skeptical at first, but it worked pretty well. However, their mustard based one is my favorite.  We can't wait to be back!"

Our party of three started with the double meat bbq brisket nachos, then we shared 1/2 # of ribs, a Texas Tornado wrap with double brisket (absolutely LOVE their brisket) then added an extra large order of the smoked Gouda Mac and cheese, green bean casserole and finished up with a banana pudding .  Gotta say I haven't eaten such great bbq for years AND took home enough for another meal.  This is my new go-to for Austin BBQ! They have a nice selection of regular and craft beers as well.

                "description": "I've now been here 3 times and if it wasn't for my last visit, it would probably be a 5 star but the last trip was definitely not ideal. The first two times I came here, I ordered the nachos and walked out so satisfied. It is a massive portion that includes all the toppings you could ever want.  They are truly some of my favorite nachos in all of Austin.   This most recent time, I decided to switch it up and went for the trio slider.  My buddy ordered the same thing and both of us walked out of there, not sure if we would come back.  The bread was hard, and the meat was room temp at best. We came in around 12:30 on a Saturday which I would have assumed is a pretty popular time with some of the freshest food but I was definitely wrong. It almost seemed like they were trying to get rid of food from the day before.  I will probably be back at some point but I don't think I would ever order the sliders again (which is such a bummer for a place 100% known for their sandwiches)  All that being said, the first two trips made a great impression and the workers there are all fantastic so I'm still happy to support this place."

The St. Louis ribs are some of the most tender I've had.  I wasn't a huge fan of the bbq sauce that came with the ribs but it's on the side and they have other sauces available as well- the one it came with was a little sweet for me. Planning on bringing my small rib aficionado this weekend after the pumpkin patch.  One complaint... the kids meal ribs says it comes with two.. TWO. Mine will be asking where the rest are if I ordered him a kids meal  they do have a great amount of meat on them but I have a 3 year old that eats like a teenager when he has ribs in front of him so these kids meals won't work for us  we will be getting a whole rack and I'll be lucky if *I* get to have two."

The staff  is welcoming and friendly on top of it all. 10/10. Next time I'm going to order the Chiknwa."

                "description": "Stopped by for the Yelp Texas Trending Machine today around 11:30 and it was clear that this plce already has a place in the heart of locals. The line was long, but luckily I was able to head to the to-go desk and place my order fairly quickly...Brisket Nachos packaged with all the ingredients separated so as not to get soggy. They easily survived the drive home to Cedar Park and were super delicious and unique! Like a chopped brisket sandwich on tortilla chips with queso. Um, yes, please.  This barbecue place has a vibe like no other. The walls and music combine hip hop with classic Texas in a way I would not have dreamed possible, but it works. Pretty trendy spot. I really appreciated the clear partitions separating tables as a covid precaution."

The sliders, brisket nachos and chicken sandwich were all delicious. The max n cheese was good, it had a smoky flavor, like it was cooked on the grill. The potato salad didn't have any flavor but we just know not to order it, it was a side and not the star of the show like the meats. The music was great! If I lived here, I would definitely be here once a week! Great food and vibe!"

And we are loving the new Cedar Park location as well. Grab a great beer, (so many options you can't go wrong), and a taco! Tacos at Cedar Park. (Get the deli salad at the Parmer location. Its simple  but amazing!)  Who doesn't love an amazing taco! Vegan options too! Bring your pooch along and sit outside and enjoy the sunset."

                "description": "Okay this is my favorite coffee shop in the Austin area period.  I love how big and spacious this new location is, but the coffee is WHERE IT'S AT.  Definitely come here if you're looking for the perfect date spot, study/get work done, or just to enjoy a nice morning coffee and breakfast.  We ordered a hand pour over, a Chemex, and a double espresso.  The double espresso came out first and this one definitely packed a punch - don't let the espresso size cup fool you.  If I was just here for the caffeine content, this one definitely would've done the job alone.   The hand pour over came out next and the presentation was super impressive!  They bring you the entire carafe with the dripper on top, so it's definitely a lot.  Considering this is only $4, you definitely get your money's worth!  This one was so flavorful and the fruity notes definitely stood out while drinking it.  Now the Chemex...just wow.  For $5, they bring the entire Chemex setup to your table and you pour our of it as you drink.  The fact that they trust their patrons with the Chemex really speaks volumes about how much they care about the presentation piece!  Looks aside, this coffee (I believe we got Ethiopian) tasted amazing and on-par with the pour over.  Don't let me forget the breakfast tacos.  This was such a treat.  I got the Migas breakfast taco and this one was stuffed FULL with eggs, tortilla strips, and pico.  It was delicious and filling and for $3, this one definitely hit the spot alongside the coffee.  I also bought one of their coffee beer stouts to take home...I believe it was the House United coffee milk stout.  If taking home, you either order beer in a Crowler (two pint cans) or a Growler (64 oz).  I can't wait to try their coffee IN THEIR BEER.  But most of all, can't wait to come back here every time I'm in the area!"

Unfortunately, the $7 queso was basically Cheez Wiz with some jalapeños, and the beef fajita on my taco was all gristle and had no seasoning.  They could have at least cooked the bell peppers.  The other Red Horn location is much cozier for enjoying a beer.  I'll just go there next time."

                "description": "I've been here for a Sunday funday and more recently did the 2021 Cookies and Craft Brews at-home virtual tasting with Circle Brewing Beers and Girl Scout Cookies. The vibe at the tasting room is casual and approachable - the staff is friendly and unpretentious. For the virtual tasting I did, they had the packages ready for pickup and hosted the tasting on Zoom. It was fun even if I was tasting solo from home as there were others on the Zoom and the two who guided the tasting were informative and engaging. Here were some notes I took during the tasting:  Alibi Blonde and Shortbread - a nice blend of the maltiness and breadiness of the cookie. The beer is a blending of German Maibock style with American Blonde Ale, resulting in a rich, malty flavor with a clean, crisp finish.  Blue Texas Hefe and Caramel deLits and Peanut Butter Sandwich - this is their best-selling beer (about 2x any other) and is a traditional German Wheat beer with a touch of caramel malt and an emphasis on citrus notes. It's refreshing and definitely a Texas twist on one of my favorite types of beers.  Envy Amber and Toast-yay! - this is a new cookie this year and they paired it with the first beer they ever brewed, although it's not the first beer they released. The cinnamon toast crunch flavor of the cookie worked well with the robustness of the amber. It's an English style amber with an emphasis on dried fruit notes - they use two types of British caramel malts to contribute to the well-rounded flavor of the beer.  Ladybird American IPA and Lemonades - this was one of the pairing favorites of the crowd and I definitely liked it a lot too. It's a West Coast style IPA that is very hoppy, but not overly bitter. Solid pairing and solid beer.  Tuxedo Shirt Black IPA and Thin Mints - the hops in this beer are changed annually, so it never really has the same flavor profile year to year. I was not familiar with roasted IPA malts, but it's basically an IPA with black malt. It has a bold, roasty flavor, with a solid body. It was a smooth pairing with the Thin Mints.  Nightlight Dry Irish Stout and S'mores and Peanut Butter Patties - this beer is the CO2 version of Guinness. There is a slight bitterness to this, but it has a rich flavor with a very light body.   A few other bonus takeaways shared in the tasting conversation: * Epic Playlist is a beer that they created to interact with their fans in the market. It has a QR code on it that connects the drinker to the Circle Brewing Spotify playlist. * Devil's XX is a barrel-aged version of the beer (XX) and is sold in bottles. * They are keeping this tasting room, but also expanding and moving to a location in Elgin where they can grow their own ingredients to put in their beer on the 23-acre property."

                "description": "Came in this past weekend to celebrate the weekend with my friend at Circle Brewing.  I love their beers and have had them at bars and restaurants around town but had never been to the brewery until this past weekend.   Circle Brewing had easy parking as soon as we pulled up even on an Austin FC Saturday game day. It was pleasant to not have to figure out where to park when they have their own parking lot with plenty of space.   Easy ordering but hard decisions to make on what pitcher of beer we were wanting to try. We noticed they have Austin FC game specials that includes their Austin Anthem draft for $18 a pitcher which is a great deal! I also saw signage on the tables that indicated 1/2 pints during the Austin FC games. Double check that is right because it almost sounds too good to be true, right? I even saw a green cup special going on - ask the bartender what they have on special just to be sure.  They have a lovely and large screen set up right in the middle of their taproom to watch any games including those Austin FC games. They have a couple of tv's as well located above the bar to keep your gaze on during any game not just Austin FC.    If you are coming in the summer especially day time be sure to wear loose clothing and/or be ready to sweat. Even at the bar top with the fans going we came out of here sweaty which is typical anywhere you are during Texas summers. Just want to give you a heads up!  Huckleberry is the food truck that slings all sorts of seafood and burgers (surf and turf!) with some easy ordering from inside the brewery.  We didn't get a chance to try out their food as we ended up brewery hopping around right after we had our pitcher of Blur (hefe) at Circle.  This may be the closest brewery to the stadium (?) but if not it sure looks like it as you can see the Austin FC stadium right from their parking lot.  Excited to come back when I am headed to a game and/or in the area as Circle Brewing beers are divine!"

                "description": "This brewery had a nice indoor-outdoor atmosphere. We were a bit divided on how we felt about the beers themselves. Some in our group loved certain beers, including some of the lighter bodied and hoppier beers. Others in our group liked the beers but didn't find any favorites from among the fight. Overall it was a nice experience - perhaps not our favorite stop on the brewery tour- but one worth going to again."

                "description": "I've come by a few times and always found it to be a good experience. The staff is friendly, the beer is consistently good and they go for styles that are much less popular from Austin breweries. They also participate in some fun events throughout the year, in particular I really enjoyed the beer/girl scout cookie pairing event and the red line brewery tour.  Highly recommend trying the Blur, its a Hefeweizen and their staple beer. I would put it up there with Live Oak's Hef as a common point of comparison. If you're around in the winter time their Doppel Blur is probably the best Hef I've ever had; Imagine if your alcoholic grandmother made banana bread in liquid form. If you're looking for something darker the Tuxedo T-shirt is a black IPA, I really liked the combination of roastiness and hoppiness. It sounds like it would clash but I found the hop flavor subtle enough to work really well.    The one negative I would have is that the interior really makes it feel like they're trying to get you to sit outside, which given the vast amount of space available in the parking lot makes sense. However I don't feel like they do a great job of utilizing it, there aren't nearly as many tables as you would think and the ones they do have aren't particularly well spaced out.  The food truck situation seems to rotate pretty frequently, I've found most of them to be misses but it's a roll of the dice depending on the day. There's also plenty of good food options in close proximity that it doesn't feel like a major negative.  Overall I think Circle makes for a good hang out spot and a change of pace from the typical Austin brewery experience."

They're known for the Circle Blur, a hazy hefeweizen, but all of their beers are good. The Austin Anthem golden ale is refreshing and \"crushable\" and the kolsch and IPAs are good too. They have both indoor and outdoor seating and host free pre-events for Austin FC games next door."

                "description": "Beer is good, staff always friendly... but damn does it get hot as the third ring of hell during the summer in there. Maybe \"stuffy\" or \"swampass humid\" is more accurate, but it's uncomfy when busy. I'm from southern Texas, so I'm used to it.. but it's even hot for me. Need some big ass fans or something. But.. the cold beer does help! And the food truck outside always looks good, but I've never partook in the tasty treats.   Gonna be a go to for many (including myself) pre-FC games, just hope they're OK with me only wearing my FC boxers once I've been there for 20 and sweat through my less-than-fancy Target shorts I got for $20, so I'd have more $$ to spend on their tasty beer."

It just so happened it was a special beer release event and charity donation (for Pink Boots Society and Pink Velvet Collaboration IPA), so it was crowded.  We lucked into a table inside and tried a sampling of beers while we played a game and listened to a few interesting sounding bands that played (standing on the loading platform).  Because it was so crowded, it took a while to get served and the line for the single person bathroom was very long.  The beers we tried were good, and we would definitely stop back by on a day that wasn't quite so crowded."

                "description": "Perfect day to celebrate Circle's 6th anniversary. With the Temps hovering around 90 degrees what better way to while away a Sat afternoon than having a few scrumptious craft beers, street tacos and listening to some great music.  My companions opted for their Alibi Blonde it is a German-inspired beer but it drinks pretty light but with a hint of flowery hops that gives it a good aftertaste. I opted for their Ladybird IPA that also drank surprisingly light for an IPA and was perfect for a hot early spring day. I did see a lot of folks drinking their black IPA but it was too warm a day for that, next time.  The event was top notch 15 bucks, American, got you a cool pilsner type anniversary glass and 3 beer tokens. We gave 3 tokens away at the end as we were getting full and we !had! to attend a friends crawfish party later that afternoon. Got to leave room for dem bugs and more brews!   The first band was a Go Gos inspired female band that rocked and the second band played some great 70s, 80, and 90s cover songs. Since I was wearing a Boston Sports shirt I got to meet some other Massholes which only added to the fun.   Good times, great beer, and a wonderful event!"

                "description": "I was so pumped to check our Circle during a brew-crawl, but the ambiance left me feeling unimpressed.  I had my first sips of Circle after being introduced by every Texan's good friend HEB. I believe it was the hefe that reeled me in, so I was excited to go to Circle during the Red Line Brew tour (check it out online if you've never done it). I was so excited to try a few beers, but knew I could only focus my tastes on one since we were on a crawl. I went with their Cereal Keller kellerbier which I've never tried before. It was described as \"unhinged\" probably because this stuff is unfiltered and not clarified! I was psyched to try a grittier version of the lager. It wasn't as funky as I thought it would be, but instead felt light, simple and slightly malty/sweet. I enjoyed it. I was pretty curious about all their others like their IPA's and the Doppel Blur, but that's for next time.  The space itself is definitely reminiscent of your small-production and grassroots taproom. They had two porta-potties outside (along with a food truck), but only one restroom inside. It got pretty crazy with our crawl of beer lovers. I can't imagine the staff members sharing one restroom, especially when the brewers are in there doing their thang. Someone's bench with weights and press station was still out, and there wasn't that much open space indoors for the lot of us to all be in there, so outdoors it was! They allow dogs which is awesome and they also have wifi. Parking seemed a-plenty, but we took public transport so that's that. Their gigantic chalkboard menu is beautiful and fully rounds out their super relaxed and earthy vibes. The people here are friendly, chill and the brewery gives off a neighborly essence. It's not an instagram-hotspot like their new next door neighbor Hopsquad. And that's the beauty of it!"

Not only are there tons of events that are always happening there, just for fun or to support local organizations, all the employees there are so kind and really attentive. They also change/add different beer options often which is great if you're looking to maybe get your favorites and try something new. I'd highly recommend the doppel blur and although it isn't on tap, you can still get a can in a glass of you want. If you're really wanting something on tap then I'd go with the blur! I'd definitely recommend going and bringing your pup because they are very pup friendly everywhere !"

Not only is the beer great, but the location and setting speak to the nostalgic part of me that's seen a few little start up breweries begin to flourish out of industrial parks, and often with their taprooms in the brewery space itself. That's what this space is--Utilitarian is too strong a word, but it's comfortable, practical, and cozy. We've enjoyed days playing games out on the picnic tables, and others indoors on the barrel tables. The staff is friendly, and there's always parking available, or you can take the light rail or easily bike from this brewery to others nearby!"

                "description": "Not sure why people are giving more stars than this place deserves. If you actually read the peoples' reviews, they really meant to give less stars.   Here's why:  The pizza is just bar pizza. It's nothing special and if I'm being honest, I would have been much happier just going to Costco for pizza   Imagine your pizza covered in melted plastic that has cheese flavor. That's what's the pizza is like; bar pizza. Pizza you'd love to eat when hammered. It tasted like Red Baron.   Let's talk about the cocktails. I can't speak over every cocktail in existence but if they're anything like the margaritas... lol... don't order a cocktail. The margarita here was so bad, I'm sure my husband could make one better with margarita mix and Jose Cuervo. Gross .   I wish I could tell you that our experience here was fluffed with great service... unfortunately, that isn't the case. I understand being understaffed because of the C word, but I watched my waitress, and she was so inefficient, I was very tempted to get up and serve myself. Also, they weren't understaffed. There were plenty of servers for the lack of people that were present. Be prepared to sit for awhile staring at your feet until you can order anything. Be prepared to stay thirsty while you eat. Ask for everything you need from the start, or be prepared to not need it by the time you receive help.   Last but not least, the bathrooms. Those things are important, are they not?  they are to me. I will say, they are definitely public bathrooms. Have you ever been to a really gross gas station bathroom? Ok, then you know what these bathrooms are like. I wonder, does anyone even clean them? Oh well, we will just blame it on the C word this time around. ‍"

I also learned two things I've been missing in pizza, too.  I've passed this place dozens of times.  It sits on the fringe of a west Austin neighborhood and several apartments/condos between them and 183.  I believe it is affiliated with a restaurant that has a place in Fort Worth, too, but I might be wrong.  What I'm sure of my first visit there was killer!  I'm planning on going back when I can eat and drink a whole day away!  They have a great outdoor area with plenty of umbrellas and we chose a table.  The server acknowledged us right away.  We QR'd the menu and by the time we'd made a choice of food our beers were on the table and cold (good pour on the Guinness, btw).    We ordered a pizza of our own:  Sausage, mushroom, green peppers and spicy marinara sauce.  Okay, first... You know how some chain pizzas you have the ingredients all coming off together leaving you with less than even a cheese pizza?  Not here.  Every thing is chopped into small pieces and spread evenly over the entire pizza.  Every bite comes with a mouthful of exactly what you ordered.  Second, put some of that marinara on a piece of canvas and I'd eat it.  The spices brought everything together.  We got wings too.  Golden Buffalo.  Perfect heat! Crispy.  Meaty. Those wings were gone so fast I was looking at other tables to see if someone had snatch a couple off our plate LOL  We were licking the hot sauce off the plate.  I'M DOUBLING THE ORDER NEXT TIME!  Great service, cool vibe, good food!  Did I get lucky or find bar food Nirvana?  I dunno.  I'm going to rock a five star and adjust as I need to, but I'm not going to deprive myself of another visit here for sure!!"

                "description": "Fun Neighborhood joint.  This feels like a place where you'd walk in and they'd say, \"Norm!\"...if that were your name and you were on an episode of Cheers.  The beer was deliciously cold served in a thick glass to keep it that way. The pizza was generously embellished with toppings, and the crust was above average. The service was timely and courteous. I really liked the outdoor patio. Part of it is covered with fans, and part was uncovered with tables with umbrellas. The only drawback is there's a lot of road noise. We sat at a table as far away from the road as possible, and it was acceptable noise-wise. When our world health situation is better, I hope to see all the tables filled with large groups of friends enjoying pints and pizzas. For now, come check it out with your close friends and/or significant other."

It was way more laid back then I expected (place is always popping outside!!) which was great, I'm not for the \"pay twice what it's worth because we are fancy pants\".  Everything was very reasonably priced, and freaking delicious! We tried a few of the drinks (I tried a few of the beers) and it's safe to say I left tipsy and happy! Can't wait to visit this place again and try some new pizzas and beer!"

                "description": "My friends like this place, but I don't see the draw. The pizza is mediocre. Fortunately tonight I discovered their sandwiches are good. I got the Pourboy, with Fries. Everyone else in our group who wanted food ended up being in a sandwich mood, so the Chicken Parm sandwich got good reviews from two of the guys. The fries were well-seasoned and looked promising, but were a little cold and soft. Other times I liked the Fried Pickle Chips, but could only eat a few pieces before they got overpowering. It's not like we'd eat that many pickles out of the jar in one sitting! I think the server mixed up my friend's beer order. The final blow to this spot is that their outdoor chairs are wildly uncomfortable. I even brought my own seat cushion the last few times I came! This time it saved my butt, but my back still hurts. I'd give Pour House a 3.5 but I'm in a generous mood so I'm rounding up."

                "description": "At first glance, the interior of Pour House looked a little un-maintained. But, then of course, Austin. Where everything is underground. I was excited about the local beer list, though the stout selection was a bit thin. I went with Redhorn, a coffee stout that was a little short on stoutness for me. But, the flavor was good.  We ordered three 8\" pizzas to share: El Supremo, Hawaiian, and a Veggie pizza, providing plenty for two adults and two children. The pizza was quite good, as in Austin-good. I couldn't put my finger on it, but there was something unique about the flavor.    Our server was very good, personable and informative. We ate a late lunch, during which a growing number of what appeared to be regulars gathered mostly around the bar. The location is a bit secluded from the rest of Austin. But, it's near the technology district, where I was working for the day.  Parking was a little confusing because we approached the building from a side where the entrance wasn't visible. It's a private parking lot with plenty of space. Outdoor seating is available. Highly recommended!"

The environment was chill and not too busy during lunch time so that was a plus for us because we needed to be back for training within the hour.  Three of us ordered the Cubano and it was so tasty! I definitely enjoyed the pickles and pork amongst other fine ingredients they packed on that pizza! One of guys ordered the regular pepperoni pizza and he said he liked it a lot. The crust and dough of the pizza was cooked perfectly thoroughly.  There salads were delicious and portioned perfectly. When you arrive the parking is all in the back area pretty much, and you enter through the patio area. They have signs for you and that guide you to entrance."

                "description": "In a world where work (regular or enjoyable) in the hospitality industry is hard AF to come by, this place exceeds expectations! It's truly a Cheers-esque environment where everyone feels welcome and everyone knows your name (and drink)! Marissa, Kiyani, Sophia and Aaron all make everyone feel welcomed and valued. We've lived here (6 minutes away) for 10 years and this is BY FAR the best regular crew they've ever had! Management is a revolving door, though, and there have been some great ones along with dozens of others (good and bad) who are no longer at this location or with the company. Drew, who is newish, though, is awesome and one of the best to ever grace this location's presence.  All I can say is, if you're local and haven't been but are considering stopping in - go here. If you're out of town and visiting - go here. If you're a regular - write a review. You know the folks here who make this your regular spot deserve the shout out. I, personally, feel bad it's taken me so long to give them a public shout out!  Management - you're lucky to have a team like this during this time. Treat them as the valued people that they are!  Thanks y'all!"

Went tonight finally to get some fare on patio since it was such a nice evening, and omg, we were blown away.  Stated with the fried pickles, I don't even care for pickles, but with the Buffalo sauce! Uhmmm yass these were amazing! Perfectly crispy, crunch of the pickle, and the zip of the sauce, it was pretty darn good!  I had the spicy passion fruit margarita, it was more sweet than spicy, but still tasty. I liked the blood orange Bellini a little better, and the house margarita was also good.   I got the coconut shrimp for dinner, again, perfectly fried, with a nice crunch. The coconut was subtle but I really enjoyed the chile sauce with it. I got a \"side\" of fries to go with it, the fries could have been my meal. Super generous portion, and do yourself a favor, add the truffle, Holy moly!    Our waitress was great, as long as every other member of the wait staff that touched our table. We came on the recommendation of friend and I feel I have to spread the love. This place is a must try, and I can't wait to come back!"

We came at lunch and though I was initially hesitant to bring in kids, there ended up being plenty off other families in there. The menu was upscale American. Given it was lunch time, we went with hamburgers and sandwiches. The main dishes were all really good and a decent portion (not too big, not too small). The sides we got were a bit under seasoned though. Lastly, there should really be a hamburger on the kids menu.   Overall, really enjoyed this place. Will come back for dinner to try more of the menu."

                "description": "The League is part neighborhood bar, part gastro-pub and I love both parts!    The bar and dinning areas are separated.  Despite both being relatively small, there's plenty of seating.  Choose from high-tops to semi-circular booths to high-back swivel bar stools.  And they have an outdoor patio as well, but not much of a view.   The League is a great place to meet a friend for drinks, a casual date, weekend brunch, watch Sunday football, or to just to ride the bar solo.    Excellent food with new, weekly specials, including a burger-of-the-week. On Mondays they have 2-for-1 burgers for dine in - can't beat that!  They also have cocktail specials to go along with their food specials (in addition to their menu and drink standards).  I wish they had a bigger beer wall, but the selection is serviceable.   The League is one on my regular spots and I've yet to be disappointed with their food, drinks, or service."

Sometimes we eat here and sometimes not.   Upside; Bartenders are always friendly and welcoming, they have great happy hour prices on drinks and apps. Also weekly food specials.   Food can be hit or miss. Between the two of us we've had everything on the menu. Club sandwich is always as hit and so is the spinach artichoke dip. Burgers sometimes a bit dry. The salmon is usually perfectly cooked. Fish and chips over battered and greasy. Prime rib sandwich is hit or miss.  Burger of the week this visit was Frito Pie Burger. I had the garlic butter grouper, which was a huge portion, but lacked seasoning on both the fish and couscous. Garlic butter was on the side, but was just melted butter with a chopped garlic at the bottom. No other seasonings.   We will continue to come hang at the bar and eat here occasionally."

I'd give her service 5 stars.   For our food we ordered the chicken fried pork chop, the full rack of ribs, the southern burger, and the kids Mac and cheese.   Our little guy loved the Mac snd cheese. It was decent and definitely not out of a box. It didn't come with anything else but was only $5.   Hubby had the Southern burger with truffle fries ($2 up charge). The burger was solid. It could have been a slight bit juicer but it was a good burger. The \"truffle\" fries were not. The fries were limp and soggy and sprinkled with Parmesan but had no truffle flavor at all. Actually when you picked up a fry the cheese all fell off too. Pretty bad fries to be honest.   Older son ordered the baby back ribs and enjoyed them. They were your standard fair. Similar to what you'd find at Chili's but they cost $30 and come with a side of mashed potatoes.  I had the  chicken fried pork chop. It was very over cooked and dry and was topped with jalapeño gravy but there was no heat or jalapeño flavor at all. The gravy made the pork chop less dry though. I subbed Brussels sprouts instead of mashed potatoes ($2). They lacked seasoning or flavor. I like the taste of Brussels sprouts so I ate them but they had no other seasoning that I could detect.   The food was all fine. Not bad but at their prices I would definitely not run back."

                "description": "Tonight I met a friend to taste their Prime and Wine deal. Half price bottles of wine and two sizes of Prime Rib. The beef was perfectly cooked, nicely seasoned and fork tender. The mushrooms cooked in a savory salty balsamic sauce were the perfect accompaniment to the prime rib. I asked for fries rather than the Yukon mashed because I know their fries are fresh and hand cut. Some people complain about soggy fries. Well, if you put them in a cardboard box to take home, they WILL steam in the box and get soggy. Duh! But ours were nice and crispy. The cut of beef was thick which I really appreciated as opposed to a wide thin-cut slice. I think it was maybe 3/4 of an inch thick? Maybe more. I'm posting a pick but I had already dug in when I remembered to take a photo. Sorry. I like The league a lot. Even the Mgr came by to ensure we were happy. Nice young man was our waiter. This was all good!"

The Sunday crew in the bar was super fun, our server Aaron was really kind   Their Sunday drink special is $3 mimosa and bloody Mary's.   Their gluten free bun is the best I've had at a restaurant, it is nice and chewy and stays together.   The chicken sandwich was great, a huge chicken breast with lots of bacon and avocado. They do a \"first timer\" complimentary dessert of their chocolate dump cake, my husband said it was great!"

The sandwich was not an adult version and not elevated. Cold congealed cheese on what looked like white bread. No spreads or bacon jam or fig or combination of cheeses.. nothing to elevate this sandwich to justify the $13.00 price tag.  I make 'em better at home."

As a former restaurant owner / operator, I appreciate the consistency and quality of the menu offerings. The facility is always clean and tables are cleared immediately when a party leaves. They have some really good deals, like burger Monday where you buy one and get one free. They also have a mouth watering prime rib special on Thursday that we can't wait to try.  One more attraction is , if you are into science or astronomy, you might be waited on by Galileo."

We had no clue about this place until tonight when I was looking for a family friendly restaurant, Little did we know it's only 10 minutes away from our house that we lived at for over two years. We were greeted as soon as we came in, it looked upscale and as soon as we sat down my husband said \"are you sure this is kid friendly\"  it ABSOLUTELY is. The food was amazing from the appetizers, main course and dessert. The customer service here was outstanding, I've waitressed myself for many years and have been to many restaurants and have never had service like this. Sam took care of us tonight and was so accommodating to us and our 1 year sassy daughter. Zach the manager on duty was also outstanding as well, he took care of us well for it being our first time there, We left in disbelief with the service we received... thanks yall! We look forward to many more dinners here.   Plus I got a nice tote for the to go food"

                "description": "There is a lot of breweries in the area but Celis is one of my favorite. They are family and women owned and very receptive and kind to their customers. They have reposted my pictures on social media and allowed a close friend to film a short film there for free. The beers are unique and delicious, with lots of options on tap! They have nightly specials and events, all of which are fun! For example trivia on mondays and Thursday, and they have little long horn saloon come do chicken shit bingo once a month there as well. At one point I was going every week for the Tuesday 99c east coast oysters. Among many other specials. There has been some miscommunication in the past with showing games but the manager working at the time is always very quick to help out. For example none of the TVs had sound on when they advertised they all did, there was confusion inside but the manager was outside and apologized and immediately turned on the sound inside and changed to social media to reflect inside. I also noticed that someone had paid to play the juke box and he paused their songs and gave them a free beer for rhe inconvenience. The dog park is also very nice and spacious and the new beer patio is very well put together! I am looking forward to live music!   Unrelated to Celis itself, but Black draft pizza truck is good there but overpriced. I am excited to try the new con todo truck!"

This place should be pretty chill - there's nine people here either chatting (or trying to) or working as I type - but they're blasting the music as always. It's kind of bizarre, doesn't fit the vibe, but they always do it. Thus I knocked off a star.  Look for oyster nights, a real highlight here."

I think the food trailers consisted of pizza, tacos, German sausages, and sliders. I loved the ample seating, mixed crowd of people, and the decent variety of beers.

They were blaring music so loud - outside - that we couldn't have a conversation across the table. Every customer looked like they were only there for Instagram pictures and the perfume was so thick you could see it hanging in the air. The waitress inside is ummm... dressed to get big tips. Ahem. Then you go back to the outdoor concert area, and it's a lot of families with kids and regular people. Weird. Beer was okay, but after the cloud of perfume I was honestly too sick to drink. Maybe someday I'll come back and avoid the front entirely. Then I went to cash out and the walking cloud of perfume was in front of me in line."

They also have events pretty regularly like weekly trivia and I saw posters for a democratic debate viewing party happening the next day.   The vibe here is very relaxed, they're dog friendly, have a couple of board games and a ping pong table. They had a food truck outside that seems to rotate fairly often. If you're up around the area and looking for a chill place to hang out after work you can't beat the vibe.   The only thing I had to give them a small knock for was the beer. I tried a flight and went mostly with the (very friendly I might add) bartenders recommendations. Outside of their standard witte they were all quite extreme versions of their respective flavors.   Their hazy ipa was super biter and lacked that usual juicy quality you'd expect from the name. The lime Berliner weisse and raspberry wheat were both missing much non fruit flavor. If you has given them to me blind I would have thought they were both sours."

Celis, as y'all know, is an Austin institution- steeped in history, the first craft brewer to bring Belgian beer to the craft world in ATX (I think), so y'all can rest knowing that their wheat beers are AWESOME.  The tap room is large, airy, albeit a little dimly lit. There's patio seating outside and get this- DOGS ALLOWED INSIDE AND OUT!   They also welcome kids! Actually I think everyone is welcome here. It's one of the friendlier breweries in ATX IMHO.  We've visited almost every Sunday during covid and I can say that they're taking every precaution. There's live music on the weekends from 6-9pm.  Beer wise - I like the options. If you're a sour beer connoisseur, you'll enjoy the raspberry sour. Light beer? Lo Lo Lager. Safe, easy drinking? Celis White.  I know this place has had its ups and down but as Austinites, we need to show support to our local businesses and just be cool with each other."

                "description": "This has been one of our favorite local places for years now. The new owner, who previously worked here, is a real stand-up guy and has been nothing but awesome towards us. He has taken on a lot more than being an owner; he actually works his business and takes serious pride in the place. Having taken over just before the pandemic, and knowing what that did to restaurants all over, it is hard to see people leave such horrible reviews. You can tell some of the reviews might reflect the person leaving them and not the place itself. Do not let those deter you from trying this place. You will not regret it. The area outside was a great addition for the dogs and kids run around. We have favorites but like try something new from the menu when we go and have yet to be disappointed. Also, pretzels and beer cheese with beers...mmmm!!! My husband likes big beers and I like Kolsch. Want wine? They have that too. They always have something that makes us both happy and that is what keeps us going back for more. Every time we have friends or family in town, this is always on the list to take them. Help keep this local gem afloat! They deserve it! And remember, the more we go now, means the better the place will be in the future. He has plans up his sleeve but that takes revenue :) Keep it up, Dig Pub!"

                "description": "Not too much to say.  The workers are very friendly and the beer selection is okay. It's a strip mall, suburban kind of bar.   The manager told us she was the manager like 50 times so we'll never forget that she's the manager.    \"I'm the manager\". \"So I'm the manager and I can add beer to our menu if you like\". \"I'm the manager, so I make decisions\". \"So I'm the new manager here and I can make things happen\".   It was definitely a laughable but enjoyable experience. Nothing to special.  Just convenient because it's located nearby.   The guests were mostly old white people. The outdoor area is nice.  At least they have that, so you're not cooped up inside a small space with die hard Trumpers who hate everyone and everything different than them.  ."

                "description": "Evening in the suburbs and the dining options were dwindling. I was getting hungry and being out with my buddy meant that I'd have at least one more beer. My friend went through his mental list of places and came up with The Dig.   We arrived there and fortunately got there in time, it was a slow night and the kitchen was about to close so we quickly made our choices. I saw that they had Scotch Eggs and I'm a sucker for Scotch eggs, but unless you're a vegetarian/vegan what's not to like about an egg wrapped in sausage that's then deep fried?  I also ended up getting their Buffalo Chicken Sandwich because...actually why do you need a reason?  The egg was good, a little thin on the sausage side but the mustard dip added a little more savory. The sandwich had a good amount of spice but the sauce was pretty runny so it was messy but otherwise good.  They do have a lot of taps and I appreciate that they try to have a little bit of everything and focus on locals. I get that they have to strike a balance between locals who want a beer that's cold, yellow, fizzy and domestic and crazy whale chasing beer nerds that are into barrel aged, wild/lacto, hopheads but for my visit it was a little more on the tame side. I had a sour from Prairie and a local mead which was great and at the time, that was about it."

                "description": "Drove by here today and thought I would check it out and I liked it! I ordered a Peacemaker Beer, an ale that tasted good. The next time I want to try the Blackberry beer. The name itself is appealing. Since it was close to dinner I figured I should order food instead of going home and cooking. I got the fish and chips. You can order the 2 piece or 4. I got the 2 piece with cut fries. It was cooked good. The fish was flaky and not oily. The pubs tarter sauce was good.. the fries were very good too..   The service was very good. There was a sign to sit yourself which I did and within 1 or 2 minutes my server stopped by to get me started. She showed me the ropes and got my beer and food quickly. I was really surprised at how fast my food came out. I can say it was just under 10 minutes but I was still surprised at the promptness. There was quite a few customers but the servers were on top of it. They talked to the customers as if they were family.   The place was clean and there was good parking. The beer menu had several types of craft and IPA beers. I'm  pretty sure I will return when I have time. My total cost including the food and beer was only $14, amazing! Thank you Dig Pub for being in Cedar Park and giving up another place to get a beer and some grub in a friendly way!"

The Sunday brunch is fabulous and should be famous, and the hollandaise sauce is definitely the best I've ever had. Topped off by Guinness and fried pickles, brunch was a hit. The chef hinted at more things in the works, like beer pairings and monthly specials, so we can't wait! Way to rock the craft beer, and now the food is being perfected by the chef, formerly of Snooze, Loro, and now the Dig! Awesome, mate."

And I've broken my tailbone twice while playing sports. My wife and I reported this to several staff and received shrugs!! We stayed long enough to finish our beers and while we were drinking, staff propped the booth bench back together. I disassembled it twice but they kept putting it back.

                "description": "This place is interesting. The right side of the restaurant looks pretty nice and lively and the left side of the restaurant looks like they gave up or ran out of money on decorating and just put a few tables out. They also have an outdoor area but no shade so I didn't want to sit out there unprotected, otherwise, it would have been nice because I had my dog. It was a bit busy so unfortunately had to sit on the left side (maybe everyone else there agrees the right side is better and that's why they all preferred to sit there). It didn't look or feel particularly clean and I'm a clean freak so I didn't particularly enjoy sitting there.   The service was fine; the waitress was nice. The food was pretty decent, but nothing outstanding or memorable where I feel I have to come back again. It was fresh though and I appreciate that for comfort food, it wasn't soaked in oil. I think the ambiance had already turned me off so I didn't enjoy my food as much as I would have it was clean.   They are known for their beer but I don't drink beer so take my review with a grain of salt. Clearly I'm not a dive bar kind of girl (unless it's out for drinks and bar hopping) but plenty of people are fine/really like those types of places so if you do, you'll enjoy this place. I'm not knocking this place and I would come back if friends wanted to go but I like more of an ambiance when I go out to eat."

The adults got the Thor's Hammer and BLTA with fries and the table shared scotch eggs and pickle chips for apps. Sandwiches were straightforward and tasty and the fries were thick but crispy outside and soft inside.   Scotch eggs were better than Renaissance festival... but could have more sausage.  Pickle chips were average bar food. Overall, good meal and fair prices!"

It was real doughy and lacked a lot of flavor. Minimal sausage and the mushrooms. I bit off a piece and the cheese completely came off the pizza and there was barely any sauce holding the cheese on.  It was heavy on the dough and nothing else.   Unless they change the recipes and use more fresh ingredients, I won't be back."

I do prefer more sauce but, still good.   The pepperoni had the crunchy edges I like   Took home a piece of red velvet and Italian cream for my last    We both loved it all   Only one register so slow going but I recommend you try this out if the was gas station pub.   Serve alcohol on site and sell NUMEROUS types of beers microbrew stuff-more than I've seen most places."

Brought in a group of four, and bar tender insulted me and my beer choice after I sampled a hazy ale, asked if he had a pale ale, and settled on a Yuengling.   He then ignored my wife when she tried to place order. The place was dead slow on a Monday night. I used to come more often, probably won't be back. There are plenty of places to grab a beer."

Our go-to pizzas are the pepperoni and the Hawaiian with pineapple and ham. We always ask for extra crispy crust and it never disappoints.  This time I got a great local craft growler that we enjoyed when we got home with the pizza.  Really hate to see our local neighborhood places struggling to stay afloat with just take out. Glad the stay at home orders are easing up.  I still ask fellow Yelpers to tip extra these days.  We'll continue to be regulars here.  Cheers!"

I showed up at 7:30pm they says kitchens closed, as the guy just finished putting down food in front of another customer.  I've worked food service back end. I didn't in any way want them to cook for me after closing the kitchen. It's not the cooks fault, but the front end had no explanation other than tough luck.

                "description": "Wow pleasantly surprised by this recommendation and now I tell everyone who lives nearby about this.   High Country is a gas station..... with a bar in it, food, oh and casually 100s of different kinds of craft beer. Need I say more?   We stopped in on a Sunday to check out the selection and ended up staying for a beer and a burger.   The food: amazing and fresh. We did the $5 Sunday burger special, and might I mention the KETCHUP. I believe it's truffle ketchup, has me drooling about when I get to try it again.   The bar: great selection of beers on tap, they also have a whole selection of wine. In addition to the tap they have a variety of bottles in the fridge you can also pick from. They do Monday ALL DAY pint happy hour for $3.50, which is as cheap as they come by and local brewery tap takeovers on Thursday. Speaking my language.   The beer Togo: gosh almighty this is the place to get craft beer, but careful they aren't all cheap! They also have Pacifico in a can and a fabulous selection of commercial and domestic beer. They have fridges full of cans from breweries EVERYWHERE, not just Texas beer. They then have a whole large bottle section and more. If you like to try new brews - get here now!   If this didn't sell you ^ the people were also tremendously helpful and personable. Stop in if you are nearby and be ready to turn from skeptical to a regular. Shout out to the owners of Southern Heights (my fave brewery if you read that review) for introducing us to this place."

They have the coolest draft beers on tap of just about any place I have been! And they do not cost a ton either!  I got the temptress mole and at 13% alcohol it was only 6$!!!! WOWZERS!  They constantly roll in and out different beers on tap and have a large cooler filled with other interesting types too... just can't go wrong!  Their wine selection is something to be cherished too... seriously... you have got to try this place!  Since the last time I was here it does seem to have slipped a bit in maintenance... light in hall way not working, icee machines down... cooler for sodas really low... and the extra TVs in eating area are off... I think we need to rally for this establishment!  For a gas station restaurant it is really so very very cool! You can't beat the selection! I don't want to see this place fold up... it truly is a coo cool coo place!"

So we ordered a glass of Sauvignon Blanc and they said they didn't have that either.  My Son came and asked me what else I wanted since they didn't have either so I walked up and asked what they had.  The guy brings a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon and said I have this. I laughed and said ok let me get a glass please. So if you specialize in wine, why not educate your bartenders on wine. There seemed to be only 3 bottles out of wine they were pouring.  Pizza was good. It was a busy Friday and everyone just seemed too busy and not customer friendly at all. I guess you have to be a regular and sit at the bar to get smiles."

The train had plenty of free snacks and we had our open table to play cards on the way up and back.  The Crew Chief even stopped by to give us some history on the different train cars which we really enjoyed.  It was a cold, rainy day but we still enjoyed the views on the way up and back and had a ton of fun exploring Burnet. We stopped by the Warehouse BBQ for lunch and also grabbed a coffee in town as well!  Well worth the trip and an overall fun experience!"

I booked that groupon for the North Flyer as my kids are in love with trains so this would be a nice treat for them.  They enjoyed Santa and the hot chocolate, I didn't mind the scenery as it was pretty.  Santa, Mrs. Claus, and the story telling was only for a few minutes of the 2 hour ride.    The biggest issue is, I really thought the ride will be in motion for the most part.  I know there are stops but it really felt like we moved for 30 minutes and sat still for the rest o the trip.  It was really annoying and boring to just be sitting for most of the two hours on the train.  In fact, I believe you don't even leave the small town of where the train first left.    They should consider playing Christmas music (I saw speakers on the train) to keep people entertained if we are going to be sitting for 90% of the time.  Overall this trip didn't feel worth it for the price we paid.  2 stars~"

The train was actually pretty cool, I've never been in a proper train before, I mean, it was old fashioned but still just a really really cool experience. We paid for the private suite and it was worth it, we also walked throughout the train which was a bit old west feeling. My favorite part was walking between cars to see the view unencumbered by windows.   We walked through all the cars (like most people on the train did) to see what the other cars were like. The giftshop car was the nicestest with big windows and plenty of room to walk around while balancing yourself on a rocking and rolling moving train.   Some of the private rooms give you an idea of what is was really like to ride a train across country with a sleeper car, teeny tiny shower, and narrow hallways. It was such a great experience.   Not sure why people complain about the views because mine were fantastic! I mean, c'mon. We live in Texas not Denver. I know what the hill country looks like. There's no mountains but where the hills meet the sky is expansive. It was beautiful."

                "description": "Easy to book your tickets online. Usually depart on time. Cart sections depends on price range. Very family friendly.  You pick up tickets on a building near by (about 25 meters). You just give your name and how many in your party and you'll get your tickets. Once you get your tickets, you'll walk to where the train is located, show your tickets and they will direct you to your cart. Once you find your seat/section...relax and enjoy the ride! The view to Borne is very relaxing and enjoyable. The train does provide drinks and snacks and some alcohol. Mask as of Jan 22, 2022 is required during the train ride. Bathrooms are located throughout various train carts."

                "description": "Full disclosure - I love trains, so I may be a bit biased around this experience. Having taken lots of scenic trains in Colorado/the West, I can see where some would be disappointed by the views provided on this ride - the route follows a state highway and what was probably pastures 20+ years ago is now developed as Austin sprawls outwards. The main selling point on this train is just getting to enjoy the most fun mode of transportation out there - a train! We don't often find ourselves in situations where we get to relax and enjoy a train ride, so any opportunity to do so is a winner in my book. However, there are some small improvements that could be made to the train cars/experience that I think would help overall: clean the windows both inside and out, re-upholster the seats, and add in PA voice-over announcements to give some brief history of the train line/cars instead of the volunteer attendant trying to yell it at a busy car. The time in Burnet is fine, we packed a picnic and enjoyed it at a park nearby the town square. Overall, I am glad to have done the Hill Country Flyer experience from Cedar Park to Burnet, but would say to manage expectations in terms of scenery."

                "description": "I liked my visit! I paid for the Cedar Park to Burnett ride. It's about 6.5 hours including a 2 hour stop in Burnett. I paid $60 per person for one of the more expensive carts the Rippling Stream one of the Adults Only lounges. And I'm glad I did. My cart had a lot of complimentary refreshments to choose from. And since we only had 10 people in my cart we pretty much had as many drinks as we wanted. I will admit we were the youngest people in our cart. So our fellow ride goers had higher expectations and were pretty disappointed with the look and feel of the train. But my boyfriend and I haven't experienced something like this before so we were excited and happy for the ride. So everything was new and great. I feel we're prepared for longer, faster train rides now. I really liked being in a cart with less people. We got to know almost everyone and we had great conversations. Daniel was absolutely amazing. His love for trains showed. And he was great to have conversations with. Great guy who answered everyone's questions and concerns.  We toured the entire train and it's nice seeing the other carts. There are definitely way more seats in the others. And they're nice too. My picture below was taken in one of the carts I toured in. (I only have videos of the one I was actually in). I will admit the city of Burnett didn't have much to see or do. I purposely brought my own food. After researching some menus I gave up on vegan options. Which is normal in small towns. It's a VERY small town. The best part was the little show the city of Burnett put on for us. The actors were great, friendly, and funny. A really great crew and was happy to watch their show. We were very tired by the time we had to get back on the train. We board at 8:15 and start the ride at 9. Because of waking up early and walking around the small town we pretty much fell asleep when the excitement died down. If you've been on a train before you might have high expectations. But if not and love new experiences and trying new things I think you'll really like this trip. I really enjoyed it. Thank you to all the volunteers for making this trip absolutely amazing."

I was disappointed in the destination but not the ride.   The silver pine car was very clean and the seats were very comfortable, Noah who was in charge of our car was very friendly and had a good sense humor, even offered to get me a sign up sheet when I showed interest in volunteering."

                "description": "Booked a sunset train ride for my husband and I and it was such a fun experience! We loved all the fun facts the volunteers had to share about the train cars and lifestyles of some of the riders back 100+ years. The sunset was magical and the night portion of the ride was really neat, having the moonlight illuminate the tracks in front of us. One of the cars is a dedicated gift shop/concession stand with a variety of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages to choose from. Everyone we came in contact with was so kind and made the experience that much more memorable. Overall such a great time - we would definitely book this experience again!"

                "description": "We had a great time on the Beer Train last night that was advertised as a sunset tour that was 2.5 hours long.  Note that you have about 45 mins moving time, then 40 mins stopped for the engine to be brought from the back to the front and then 45 mins back again. You don't really see much of the sunset, and you aren't moving for 2.5 hours. They also assign seats ahead of time, some of the cars were nicer and louder than others, so just depends what you're looking for. The association was responsive on social media when I had questions, staff and crew on board were all very friendly. They dont really follow any of their own posted rules about masks, no personal coolers, etc. so just something to be aware of- but I think this also varied by car. Overall we had a great time and would go again!"

Dirty cars, dirty seats, dirty windows with bleak scenery outside and Santa who gives a broken whistle. That is all for 2 hours trip. Even an obsessed with trains 4 years old was bored.  If you decide to go don't forget to take a mask or a respirator, it's hard to breathe inside because of dust."

                "description": "I'm pretty sure this is the tourism equivalent of chicken-and-waffles: another empty promise meant to separate me from my hard earned monies. Fortunately for me the plague was in top form. Was in the area looking for sustenance and 'Steam Train Association' showed on the map so I figured to pop in for a quick viddy before lunch. pulled up on a nearly empty lot, a shackled gate, and a locked door, the sign had the now common 'Closed for Plague' message which softened the blow of discovering \"...that the train and rail yard are not open for public tours or photography\" which meant the entirety of the museum was contained in the double-wide corner space in the strip. There's nothing inherently wrong with scenic train rides on vintage rolling stock, I've done it before and it's OK but that's just not my cup of meat. I was here for a bit of museuming but there was no museum to be had - nor postcarding nor touchable cars nor engines :-( sad face"

                "description": "My husband and I went on the Hill Country Flyer for our anniversary weekend and we were in the \"Rippling Stream\" train car. The Train itself is quite impressive and was my first time on a real train not subway. The First Class Coach option was really nice and the seats were spread out along with social distancing, we felt really comfortable. My only complaint was it was VERY cold outside and though they are climate controlled, it was really cold the first half of the ride - coming back was much more comfortable. I also wished the lay over time perhaps had been 3 hours to provide a little more browsing time in Burnet. It would be cute to do music in each train car from the era the train was made. Ours was built in the late 30's so it would be a nice little touch that's simple to do! They had complimentary snacks and drinks which was a plus. Can't wait to do it again in a private suite!"

                "description": "This was an excellent experience. We took the train from Bertram to Burnet for one of the special events (Wedding Oaks wine trip). The staff was friendly and seemed very knowledgeable about the history of each train car. If you have a chance to walk to the very last car and look out the back, I definitely recommend taking in that view. I would have loved to take a longer trip and will look for other chances to ride.  The website is a little hard to use. We would have really liked a private cabin for our trip but didn't see how to book that on the website.   I wish the volunteer in our car would have been a little less Chatty Cathy when we weren't talking about the ride. It was a bit of a distraction from our enjoyment of the ride. Also, riding during COVID was a bit out of our comfort zone already so we were sad to see at least two volunteers wearing their masks covering only their mouth, not their mouth and nose. The website goes into great detail about precautions and that is a basic one not being taken. (That being said, they did a great job with social distancing and I felt like the train was very clean.)"

                "description": "Enjoyed my first ASTA experience today.  Here's my recap:  - Purchased a First Class Lounge ticket so I had my own room in Rippling Stream  - Train left the station on time, arrived at Burnet on time, and left for Cedar Park on time.   We were only an hour late reaching Cedar Park because a car thought it could outrun the train, but it could not.  Once the accident reporting was complete the train resumed.   - Personal note:  I am a train nerd and love riding trains, so my threshold of being annoyed on a train is higher than most.  This will affect my review below.    THE GOOD:  - clean cars, fun to walk in between them, and if you're without children, the adults only first class cars are a must - Rippling Stream and Nambe.   Otherwise with kids, I would recommend the Maurice Beckham or Eagle Cliff.    - the trip itself is smooth and the volunteers are friendly and helpful.  You can tell they enjoy being there, informing and helping others.     - Burnet has an abundance of antique shops if that's you're thing.  Also the soups at the downtown coffee shop are wonderful.     - The shootout show in Burnet, while not having a worry about winning any acting awards, is fun for the kids and has a good ending.  They could trim some of the fat from it, and make it a more concise / engaging story - there were a few too many awkward pauses.  But I applaud the folks who are likely doing this for free.  And the kids loved it.     THE NOT SO GOOD  - The scenic ride - if you're from the area this should not come as a shocker - is not that scenic.  There's a great bridge over the San Gab river but otherwise it's unremarkable trees, backyards, roads, and strip malls.    But again, none of this bothers me that much because I'm on a train relaxing.    - Burnet:  This is a sleepy, very conservative town.  One sign to deter thieves in a store said, \"We got an alarm.  We got video.  We got guns.  DON'T BE DUMB.\"    While the downtown is a short walk from the train station, 2.5 hours here is way too much time unless you love antiques.   There isn't much else.   And as far as lunch goes, I highly recommend walking a bit farther past the first couple restaurants or else you'll have long wait times.   I went to a deli just a couple blocks away and it had no line.      - Announcements:  there are few.  Nothing along the way to alert you to landmarks or scenic opportunities (there is really just one, the bridge over the river).   But it would be nice to hear more than the pre recorded departure / arrival ones.    - The warm soft drinks:  no one wants green tea or apple juice at room temp.  There was literally an ice bucket next to these (but for scoping ice).  A second one to put these beverages on ice would go a long way.    - Lack of variety in snacks:  for a first class experience, at least more than the mini lemon cakes and mini cinnamon rolls would be nice.  Some savory, perhaps?   - chairs in the RS lounge car are what you'd find at your local dentist's waiting room.  I expected something that would at least remain comfy for 1.5 hours at a time.      OVERALL. - for the price I paid, it's 4/5 stars.  I knew the scenery wasn't going to awe, so most of my ranking is based on the train experience inside.  The quibbles above are all minor; chill the drinks, add some pretzels, get someone to donate an old leather chair or 2, and be a bit more chatty with us.    Those who really ranked their train ride low usually fall into the following categories, so please take them with a grain of salt:  - a/c sucked because it was Austin in the summer (hopefully fixable but not all that surprising) - solution is to go when it's not hot, the 60 days out of the year it's under 99 degrees.  I also think they have ironed out most of the a/c issues by now.    - Burnet was terrible, Burnet food was terrible, etc.  It's Burnet.  There's a reason it's not as well known as Fredericksburg.  You walk a bit father to get away from the crowds, you cross check their list of lunch spots they give you when you board  with a quick glance of Yelp reviews and you roll the dice.    - scenery sucked, super ghetto, etc.   Maybe because I grew up in St Louis, but using the word ghetto here is laughable at best.  It's junky, yes.  Unkempt, sure.   And truly, if you live in the region, you should know better than to expect breathtaking views.  You've driven on 183 east of 35?.  Same views.   If you're from out of town I could see valid point here since the website pushes it hard that it's scenic - but us locals know how much lipstick you can put on this pig.   So go check it out!  But go First Class if possible.  And be flexible about being home on time; like with any train, delays can happen."

                "description": "We rode the Hill Country Flyer which departs from the Cedar Park station and goes to Burnet, Texas,  where there is a two-hour layover so that passengers can disembark, do some shopping or grab some lunch or both.   Before leaving, the Burnet Gunfighters put on a show which is free to passengers, although they do accept donations.   The scenery leaves a lot to be desired, however that is not something that the Steam Train Foundation can control, they have a designated track and can not control who builds subdivisions or places gravel pits along the route.   If you are looking for a beautiful scenic ride, this probably isn't for you.  However, if you want to experience riding on a passenger train, and learning about the history of the railroads, it is a great experience.     They are very careful with social distancing and we felt completely safe riding the train.  I spoke with a couple of families that had young children and they loved it!   All in all, I would recommend it as a very enjoyable way to spend the day."

                "description": "I rode the Sunset Express on 5-29-21 with my family, while on a trip to visit Austin. I'm from Southern California (this is important later). The scenery was certainly nice in some spots, but not enough. The sunset was awesome, but the experience wasn't that great. We paid for first class and rode aboard Eagle Cliff. Some basic drinks and snacks were provided, but the train was understaffed. No attendant for our car. One very sweet elderly volunteer was doing her best to handle two cars at once. I decided to offer to help, which she was very appreciative of. She said it was great that I wanted to help and so I did. I helped stock drinks and snacks as well as stocked ice to keep the drinks cold. Later on, a female volunteer who looked to be in her 40s came up to the counter said \"Sir, you cannot be back there, what do you need?\" I explained the situation, and she kind of had an attitude. I was informed in a rude tone that I had to be a member to help, and was given no thank you. Being that I live in Southern California, there's no way I could really be a member. While all this was happening, the AC in the car was doing a very poor job at keeping the car cold. It was unbearably hot in there, and everyone in the car was complaining. The excuse given was that the car is vintage and has a lot of runtime. The car was very original, and you could tell. That roughly translates to \"we don't have the money or people to keep this car in tip top shape, and we don't have the money to upgrade it\".  Eventually, my family was re-seated to the Rippling Stream. That was much better, but it didn't change the overall experience. Cherry on top was we were over an hour late returning to the Cedar Park station.   Not worth the money."

                "description": "We also did the Xmas Polar Express train ride. Tickets were about $50 each. We also went with a friend and their kids too.   I'll give this train ride 4 stars. The kids were excited to see Santa and the ride was slow at times.   To start, one of the first things was a balloon guy. Ours was awesome. He was funny and overall entertaining. He had me laughing my @ss off.   Next came hot chocolate... it's hot chocolate.   After that was, singing Christmas Carols. They had 2 girls from McNeil high school. I felt sorry for them. They were nice, but they couldn't just get our car interested in singing.  A few of us sang, but overall it was a failure. I'm sure adult beverages if allowed/served would help the spirit. Great job to them but our car was mostly interested. It probably didn't help that they gave us a cookie just before they arrived so everyone was stuffing their face.   After that was story time, the lady reading the Story was animated and funny. Kudos to her.   She visited just before Santa.   Then Santa came. We were in one of the last cars so his visit was a bit rushed. He was nice and gave everyone a wooden train whistle.   ***********The entire operation is run by volunteers. So I'd like to thank all of them for their time!*******  This was he first time my son was not afraid of Santa:-)"

                "description": "This review is based on my customer service experience with Zena, not the train ride itself (although I may come back and give an update!)  Zena is a lifesaver. Not literally, but she has made my train experience 2x as good. I bought a Groupon because I didn't even realize there was a train experience in Austin. After the headache of scheduling, our trip got canceled. Zena came in to save the day. She mailed me another gift certificate that expired in a year (vs the next week per my Groupon) AND she gifted us a little extra!  Sounds great, right? Unfortunately, the GC could not be redeemed online. After multiple tries of calling in (and getting a forever ring - no pick up), I was getting irritated.   I emailed Zena back asking for her advice. She wrote back in 24 hours and apologized for their phone service. She even offered to reserve me herself. After a few back-and-forth emails, she answered all my questions and got us all squared away.  Our train ride happens this weekend and I can only hope that the experience is similar to Zena's customer service."

                "description": "Popped into the area looking for lunch and stumbled upon this place. Glad I did!   Loved the atmosphere with it half outside dining and inside dining. I think it's so versatile you could bring family and kids here, or turn down in the evening with a hot date for a nice dinner.   The cocktails are very good. I had the \"Room Service\" which is a refreshing gin cocktail.   The smoked salmon appetizer was sooooo good with the saltiness from the capers, perfected toasted ciabatta, and perfectly cooked egg. Highly recommend!   The Shaved Prime Rib sandwich was very good as well, and my son had ordered the Turkey pastrami sandwich, which was also very good!   We sat at the bar and the staff was top-notch. Friendly, attentive, intuitive and on their game!   I recommend this place for any occasion."

(there was a 5 min wait for tables not bad )  I ordered the peachy mimosa and added a tequila shot it was perfect . My boyfriend ordered the breakfast sandwich he  loved it For food I ordered the hash bowl another great choice no complaints ( it did take a while to get your food which is the only reason for my 4 star review ) but the wait worth it . Bartenders were friendly and available."

                "description": "Culinary Dropout, more like you'll wanna Drop In...bad puns aside, easily one of the best places in the Domain to gather a group of friends and enjoy their very spacious patio. Certainly compliments the great food they have to serve as well.  Atmosphere: Very fitting of the domain and Austin, modern hipster style so very open with a nice view of the domain surroundings. Live music is played on occasion as well, which really makes for that feel of a local flavor styled joint.  Food: Having come here several times and trying most their food items, you can't really go wrong with any particular choice, just whichever suits your craving for that moment. My personal favorites though is the Fried Chicken. Most certainly worth the wait, and comes with flavorful mashed potatoes and gravy mmmhmmm. Meat is well cooked with good texture and doesn't have an overly heavy taste or feel that most deep fried foods commonly come with.  Service: Every time I've gone services has been great. Staff is friendly and can help accommodate any assistance or questions you may have.   Hungry around the domain and need a place that will leave you full with a good experience? Drop-in to Culinary Dropout. Perfect for anyone seeking a casual and enjoyable night."

                "description": "Joined folks for lunch and I think I went wild on the appetizers that I was full when it came time for the main dish. We ordered the Brussels, deviled eggs, and  bread, my sister ordered the kale salad with steak and my friend ordered the chicken bbq salad.   So I'll start with the bread - it's grilled and has some balsamic on it. A little salty but good. The deviled eggs came 3 to an order and I love a good deviled egg but this was \"meh\" at best. Seems like it needed a little more seasoning and there wasn't anything special about it. I will say I'm not usually a fan of brussel sprouts but these aren't mom's brussels. These were fried and then tossed in a sauce (Korean go-guchang) and is a little spicy but oh so good. The kale salad was a lot of small pieces of kale, the steak was tender but I can't say I'd order it again (or steal it off my sister plate). The chicken salad was good and came with a deviled egg.   Overall, it was a good lunch - we did order 4 drinks and the total came up to about $100.   We were able to sit outside on the porch under a heater which made it a great atmosphere. I will say that I saw the chips and dip and will come back to try that."

                "description": "Culinary Drop Out is a good place to recommended for a hang out spot with good food and drinks. Very trendy place, and there's usually live music on the weekends. The outside patio \"pre-COVID\" had lots of games for guest to play. There's enough TV's to watch sports from anywhere you're sitting. I recommend ordering the fried chicken and homemade mash potatoes. I think it's their most popular dish. The dish is fried to the perfect level of crisp, and it's very juicy!  I also like their salmon!  As far as the drinks, if I'm not ordering my usual Austin Eastcider, I'm getting their jalapeño margarita! One of the best in town!   The vibes are always good here."

                "description": "I originally discovered CD when I used to live in Arizona. It was always THE spot to hang out on the weekends with large groups. I was happy to see CD had an Austin location!  We came on a week night and it was still pretty crowded. Wait time was about 30 minutes, so that gave us some time to walk around and do some window shopping at the Domain. Once we were seated, we put it our order right away.  Pretzels and Fondue: The softest pretzels!!! Perfect for dipping in the provolone cheese sauce. We actually got 2 rounds of these as they were that good.  El Matador: tequila, elderflower, ginger agave, and orange bitters. This is my favorite drink here. Has enough of a fruit taste without being overly sweet. And the bartender made it with a lot of love. Lol. Only 2 drinks and I was finished for the night.  Our server was really great and kept checking on us throughout the night. Fun crowd. Fun music. And a really fun time."

                "description": "Just tried to eat here tonight (Tuesday 2/15). Got here around 7:30pm and was told there was a 30 minute wait- no problem we waited. At 8pm on the dot we got a text our table was ready. We were seated and already knew what we wanted so the second our server came over we ordered, maybe 8:05pm. We saw tons of dishes coming out but figured with how busy it was it might be a bit. At 8:35pm someone (not our server) came over and told us \"so sorry about the wait, you're up next\" we waited 15 more minutes after at least 15 orders came out and finally couldn't stand it anymore and left. We wasted an hour and a half and still left hungry.   The sad part is this is not the first time we've experienced bad service here. Last time we came here with a reservation and were sat outdoors when we reserved an indoor table. 20 minutes passed and no one came to our table even though multiple servers passed us. We asked a girl who was clearing tables if there was someone who could take our order and she came back and said no one wanted to so she took our order. I guess that should've been our red flag last time not to visit again but we love the food and gave it another chance.   We've been to Culinary Dropout at several locations in Arizona and never experienced anything like this. The Austin location definitely doesn't hold the standards of the others. We won't be returning and suggest you don't either unless you have 2-3 hours to spare to wait for your food."

                "description": "Seems like more of a young person drinking place than a good food place.   I didn't love the pretzel bread with cheese \"fondue.\" The cheese seemed like the fake cheese you get in prepackaged containers/baseball games. The pretzels were slightly warm but were a bit dry. Would not recommend.   We both had the Turkey pastrami and didn't love or finish them. I had the French fries and they were good and friend had the side salad and said it was good."

                "description": "Originally was going to stop for a quick lunch but got ahead of ourselves when looking at the menu.   Brussel Sprouts (3/5): not crispy like I expected it to be but the flavor was solid and unique.  Salad (4/5): they made kale taste good. that's impressive!   36-hour Pork Ribs (3/5): very sauce-y and therefore, very messy. At least the flavor was decent. The ribs itself were are not very tender.   Steak Frites (3.5/5): not bad but also not great. The salad on the side was great tho.   Korean BBQ Skirt Steak (4/5): lots of flavorrrr. Better than the Steak Frites. The meats on these two dishes actually tasted the same but this one had sauce. I actually liked this main the most out of the ones that we tried!   Overall, chill spot for a nice dinner with friends. I would rate this place a 3/5 for the food but probably bump it up because of the ambiance. There's lots of space and a few games to play so the vibes probably make up for the food."

                "description": "Located in the Domain, this is a hoppin' place on an evening for a weekend dinner. Bit of a wait for a table for 4, but no worries.  Eventually we were  seated and our server was super friendly.  We ordered a couple of drinks to start. I didn't care for my cocktail two to mango at all. Hardly tasted the fruit flavors of pineapple, guava, orange or the mango white claw, since it was so overpowered by the vodka. I just passed the drink onto my son. We put our order in for our meals and it took quite a bit of time for the meals to come out. We had to flag down our server to find out what was going on. She mentioned they had many orders and were backed up.  We were a bit disappointed when our meals arrived. My burger was super dry and my son's salmon dish looked like an appetizer. The portion size of the salmon was small and the amount of risotto it was sitting on sad. We left very hungry. Service was slow, food and drinks are overpriced. Not sure we'll come back."

Here's what I tried: - Evil Jungle Princess ($13): This fruity rum drink was good! - Soft Pretzels and Provolone Fondue ($13.25): The pretzel bread was good. The cheese was good. $13.25 is a lot for what it is though. - Gojuchang Brussels Sprouts ($6): It maybe came with 5-6 total brussels sprouts. It tasted good, but super not worth it. - The M.A.C. Burger ($14.50): Their take on a McDonald's Big Mac. It was good!  Fun vibes. Convenient if you're staying in the Domain."

Culinary dropout is great. We love their grilled asparagus, it comes chilled and their seasoning plus whatever methods used really brings out the sweetness of asparagus.  Fish and chip is the real deal, been to many places and felt disappointed, NOT here. Pure deliciousness and we can't wait to come back for more!

                "description": "10-25-21  Quality/Quantity - Gochujang Brussels Sprout - I would have preferred the brussel sprouts to have been a little more crispy. Could not really taste the gochujang flavor, not spicy at all. Kurobuta Pork Ribs - My favorite, good flavor. Would have preferred more fries though. Spicy Vegan Curry - My daughter's choice, I guess it was good, but not something I would have ordered. Had a hint of lemon grass after taste, which is a little different from Indian or Thai Curry. Separated rice versus rice combined in the sauce is also preferred, so we can control the flavor.  Atmosphere - This is a very good spot. I like both the indoor and outdoor space. There were a few activities (cornhole, etc) for the guests. I like the choices of seating - regular tables, high top tables, bar seating, couches, etc. Additionally, your huge wrap around bar was nice. Lastly, I am always a fan of an open kitchen concept.  Service - Julia did a good job; she came back and refilled our water often. It was really busy and the entire team seemed to be working hard. I also noticed 2 employees picking up garbage as they walked back and forth serving customers, this is always a positive plus.  Price - $49.80 + tip  Owner Suggestion - Seems like you are very successful, owning quite a few restaurants. Congrats on all your success, and wish you many more. I look forward to trying your other restaurants in the future."

They have indoor seating and half outdoor seating (it's \"outside\" of the restaurant but still covered on all sides - great for when it's cold out!   It's a cool bar with live music and games but my favorite part is the food!   We got the cheese fondue that came with a bowl of pretzels and it was nothing I expected at all - pretzels are okay at best usually and most places has cheese that taste gross but this was the best pretzel/cheese combo I've ever had!! The pretzel balls were pretty big in size from what I was expecting, they were warm and perfectly seasoned and delicious! And then the cheese - wow I could literally drink a jar of it if I wasn't my age and getting heartburn everyday as is. I haven't stopped thinking about the pretzels and cheese since my first bite! I definitely want to go back to Austin just for this dish.   And then for entree my boyfriend and I split the butternut lasagna and they were so nice enough to split the dish for us without us having to ask.   Oh yeah and for drinks (I forgot to take a pic) but we got the Smashed Irishman and it was so good we ordered 5 through out dinner.   The staff was really nice and the place was super busy so some things took a little longer to come out and we were forewarned before ordering anyway."

                "description": "Been here a few times. I must say that the waiters and waitresses here are phenomenal. During my most recent experience our waitress was Karisha.  Late 30s early 40s generation like me will LOVE the music selection here - I felt like they were playing my old playlists from high school or something!   (And they actually have a barcode to listen to their playlist on Spotify which I thought was cool)  I ordered the 20 oz ribeye. (I had a very paltry breakfast and had recently worked out so my body was lusting for some bovine carnage)  My better half ordered truffle fries and the Gardein Buffalo chicken - which she absolutely loved - and trust me that's a rare sight - so Thank You Yard House!  Meanwhile, this steak had everything I hoped for - it was bone-in, juicy and cooked to perfection. The server even asked me to cut into it to ensure it was to my liking - I had to ask her to repeat herself because I've never had someone ask me before.. how thoughtful! And cut into it I did, again and again until all that was left was the bone.   The Parmesan mashed potatoes were also scrumptious! Just the right texture and not too cheesy at all, the right touch of Parmesan.   Oh and there was also the healthy baby broccoli. The heads were very good, the stem was a little tough for me to chew but that's probably because they are grilled (as opposed to steamed) but that's fine because I usually only eat the heads anyways.   I don't usually drink but they are supposed to have a large selection on tap as well as bottled beers. I had the Heineken 0 (0% alcohol) and for those who used to drink Heineken I recommend it because it tastes exactly like the real thing! I was amazed they had it, so I guess there's something for everyone here.  I think this place is a keeper and I will return to see what other delicious adventures are lurking inside that menu. I've had the steak bowl before and it always hits the spot! The burgers are also delicious - though sadly I'm watching my carb intake recently.   In the end, you can't go wrong with this place! It can get pretty busy but all you have to do is give your name and number and they text you when your table is ready! Just go walk to Restoration Hardware and look at extremely expensive furniture you'll never buy in the meantime or stroll on over to Amazon books and play with their toys :) the possibilities are endless"

                "description": "I have always seen this place but never really made it in until recently. I will add the disclaimer that we did go during SXSW as well as Spring break. On top of understanding most places are dealing with coming out of covid restrictions and labor storages.  We went while walking around the Domain. It was busy, but not packed. We were sat with no wait, but then sat for almost 15 min before someone came to greet us and get our drink order. We had already decided on trying several of the apps and then maybe splitting a pizza. So we ordered our apps with our drinks. We got the pretzel, edamame, cheese curds, and calamari. Another 10 min go by and our drinks (literally a coke, water, and tea) are finally brought and the food about 15 min later. We didn't see our server again. Calamari was very rubbery and cold and bland. The pretzel was ok on it's own but the beer cheese they made with it was really beer forward and couldn't taste much else. The cheese curds were a little over cooked but not horrible. And the edamame was almost inedible. A different server came after about 45 min and asked if we wanted refills, our glasses being empty for more than 30 min. We decided to not order the pizza and just pay and leave.  I gave them 3 stars because like I said I totally understand the staff shortages and it being SXSW and all that. But really not great food or service. Their bar menu looked very detailed for those who drink, and we might give them a shot later down the road to see if things are better without a big event going on. But not any time soon."

                "description": "We've come here almost every week, sometimes multiple times a week since we moved to Austin 3 months ago. The hours are great and the food has always been good, you get a full menu and happy hour specials. I'm not sure if we've been here any other Sunday but this past Sunday the food was absolutely awful. I'm not sure if the head chef, kitchen manager, etc. is off or what but both our meals and appetizer tasted like they were microwaved leftovers.   We got the ahi tuna and it was very strange this time, so strange I didn't want to really eat it but the portion was so small this time we just ate it. I guess that kind of shows we're really not picky so when I say something was terrible it's really-really bad. I know anyone reading this will say that's your fault for getting ahi tuna from a sports bar but we've got it dozens of times and it was always surprisingly good. The tuna sandwich and poke nachos are great as well, but we didn't get them this time. We did get the fish and chips and the hot chicken sandwich. The fish was 100% microwaved, it was rubbery and had no crisp to the breading so they're dead giveaways. Also, the coleslaw was brown so that was nice. The chicken sandwich tasted nothing like the chicken sandwiches we've had from there before, and the taste of this one was not pleasant. We still ate most of our food so I wasn't going to complain that it was terrible unless our waitress asked and to my surprise she never did. lol. I think she knew so she avoided that question.   The cocktails and beer selection is great from here and they make great drinks for a sports bar. During happy hour they have small discounts on drinks and larger discounts on food. I don't remember what they all are but I know the cocktails are 2 dollars off, nothing crazy but hey I'll take it. I ordered my first cocktail during happy hour and about 30-40 minutes later another. The waitress took my order for the drink and came back later maybe 10-15 minutes and asked if I still want the drink I ordered. I was confused and said yeah so another 10 minutes or so I got my drink. My girlfriend was on her phone and noticed she came back to ask right after 11 PM when happy hour is done. So I was charged 2 dollars extra for one drink, I could care less. But it was really weird for her to do that.   I don't think we'll stop coming here because of our bad experience. I figured I would take my time to at least let the establishment know of our experience. So they can improve - if they want to. I know a lot of restaurants have staffing issues and there is a massive amount of competition in Austin. A bad meal isn't the end of the world by any means."

                "description": "This place was busy on a Saturday night! I think this place is just alright. I think it's overly hyped perhaps because of the location. But overall the service was good and the food was ok. I got the steak bowl but had it sent back to the kitchen because the steak was so extremely tough! The meat in the picture looks red but it was so tough. The best part of our meal was probably the truffle fries. They had a nice truffle flavor but other than that, nothing too spectacular about our meal."

                "description": "Exceptional service(two waiters were both checking on our tables and made sure we had everything we needed!) and pretty solid food! I got the KBBQ Cheesesteak sandwich, which had decent flavors and nice presentation. I would personally have preferred a stronger tasting gochujang sauce, but it was still tasty as is. My friend got the whiskey salmon, which had great sauce! The sweetness and whisky flavors mixed very well. I had a pretty good experience overall and was really happy with the atmosphere and waiters! Tim and Noah, you guys were cool!  I also had Yard House in the past once at maybe 1am and ordered their pepperoni mushroom pizza and Margherita pizza, both which tasted great! Definitely a great meal after being out with friends. Would recommend as a fun, laidback place to eat and drink!"

                "description": "We absolutely love yard houses HH! We have tried bunch of there appetizers and they are all pretty good, and most of there appetizers are 50% off and pizzas too. But if it's outside the HH time, I this it's bit pricey.  Chicken nachos: skimpy on the chicken and too much of sour cream.  Korean chicken wings: it was pretty good, it had a nice hint with a hint of sweetness and our kiddo loved it.  Onion rings: I mostly don't like onion rings because it's greasy and feels heavy, but at the YH, it's light, crispy and non greasy.  Chicken strips: chicken strips comes with the small basket of fries, chicken stripes itself doesn't have much flavors or seasoning, but it's good if you dip it in some sauce.  They don't have online reservations, so that sucks. Ordering and paying is with the tablet they have on the table and that's not convenient either, we had to try atleast 4-5 times for payment to go through and it's so confusing, otherwise everything else is good."

The staff is Amazing and professional but not so much where they're snobby.  Just a kick back place.  While my husband and I sat down at the bar there was a guy watching a game..GO DODGERS!! To our left.. a couple to our right and a blind date across the way. I feeds everyone's needs.   Our bartender KEITH was fantastic...  if your ever so luck for him to make you a drink... you'll be in mixer heaven. He recommended a beer to my hubby some kind of blonde.  Jez I wish I can remember the name... any who, he's gave himself a sample and that was the end of that.  Also, we ordered shots and I ordered a dirty martini.  EVERY.  SINGLE.  DRINK.  Was delicious haha. But also, he was  good company and made sure we're taken care of.   Pros: EVERYTHING!!!! FOOD IS ON ANOTHER LEVEL.  CHEERS TO THE KITCHEN  Cons: nothing.

                "description": "Yard House in my opinion, is a chain that is highly underrated especially when it comes to their happy hour. In case you didn't know, during happy hour all their apps are half off.! Unfortunately I only took pictures of the calamari and nachos, however some of my appetizer favorites are the ahi sashimi, poke nachos, fried calamari, and the chicken lettuce wraps. I also like the chicken nachos, classic sliders, and have heard great things about the cheese curds. Often times, I come here for the happy hour and don't even end up ordering an entre just get a few half priced apps!"

The waitress that assisted me was attentive, knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. My order came out in a timely manner. I ordered blackened shrimp tacos that came with rice and beans. The sauce that is on the tacos is spicy. For my drink I ordered a Sangria. The food and drink were great!   I sat outside on the patio because it was a nice day outside. The patio is a nice size that has a lot of tables. The restrooms were clean and they are unisex. It's a parking garage across from Yard House which is convenient."

                "description": "My fiancé and I were looking to have lunch at the Domain and happened to see this place close to where we parked. The main reason he wanted to try it was to watch hockey.  We were immediately greeted and told to take a seat anywhere we wanted, a precursor to the excellent service that we received the entire time we were there.  The place is very spacious with a bunch of tables and bar seating, as well as plenty of outdoor seating, and a bunch of TVs. There is also what appears to be a stage space, most likely for their events like trivia and bingo. We sat at the bar and ordered drinks. It was a Sunday early afternoon so it was pretty quiet. We ordered a side of Buffalo roasted cauliflower per recommendation. My fiancé got the impossible burger with a side Caesar salad and I got the smoked pork quesadilla also with a side Caesar salad.  All the food came out relatively quickly and pretty much all at once. I obviously was too excited for the food because I forgot to take pictures of them! The portions were the perfect size and the side salads were not sad like some other watery small portions that you might get elsewhere. My fiancé enjoyed his burger and my quesadilla had a great texture and came with pickled onions, sour cream, jalapeño slices, and shredded lettuce.  Shout out to the service for being extremely friendly and fast, constantly checking in on us. We definitely want to come back to this place!"

                "description": "Just can't get beyond these pretzel bites SOAKED in oil. Squishy.... you could pinch them and drip the oil out. I'm at a loss for words in regard to the preparation of this. Check the oil pools in the pictures. I wouldn't recommend this appetizer at all.   - PRETZELS - $10 Fresh baked pieces with white queso and spicy brown mustard (680 CAL.) -   Sooo..... Baked and then dipped in Oil? Also, avoid that queso. As far as ambiance... It was noticeably hard to ignore a certain mildew type odor while sitting. Sit outside if you must! But, plenty of other places you can go instead in that area."

                "description": "For our anniversary we were excited about the other Yelp! Reviews. The queso looked amazing in the pictures.   First off, the service was nice and attentive.  The chips were warm and the queso was fine but not the start we expected. Disappointing.  We were hoping to try several of their beers but since the appetizer was less than average, we had a beer each. The Lagunitas Sumpin Sumpin was nice and the 512 IPA was wonderful.   One of the best IPAs hands down.   We each had a beverage, ate our chips and moved on."

                "description": "My girlfriend and I stopped by the Brass Tap on a Wednesday night after getting our nails done across the street. Cool vibe, big tables, seat yourself social distancing, and quite a few TVs. Servers kind of rotate between tables to make sure everyone is taken care of so they're super attentive. We had one main server though and she was sweet and personable. They had three different menus, which was kind of confusing, but we realized one was their main menu, the second was someone they partnered with, and the third was for their Smokehouse BBQ only served on Wednesday nights.   Go for the bbq! I was pleasantly surprised how delicious the bbq was. I got the two meat plate that came with two sides. The sweet potato fries and brussel sprouts were both delicious. My friend got the loaded sweet potatoes and really enjoyed it. Overall, we had a good time with some good eats! Would definitely go back again!"

                "description": "This is a difficult review of the Brass Tap Beer and Food restaurant at the Domain. Why you say?  I am getting out more and the Domain is one of my favorite places to shop(carefully), eat and people watch! Sunday I met my two adult grandchildren at the awesome Domain Shopping Center. After completing our initial agenda of a haircut and some shopping we were starving. When the three of us get together and we're going to eat 99% of the time we choose a place we haven't tried before.  There sat the Brass Tap Tavern.  As always, I took a look at yelp for reviews and the majority were very positive-always a good sign! We've gone to a small handful of restaurants that are available at the Domain but in the spirit of adventure we decided to try The Brass Tap.  It was a Sunday afternoon around 430 ... so absolutely not what I would consider prime time for eating. The Decor was beautiful. The interior huge, lots of brass which is beautiful, and a very smart, but earthy feel. A large screen TV on the wall which is standard these days but often takes away from the beauty of an establishment. They also have a decent size patio available and since the tavern is on a corner it wraps around it. At that time of the day on a Sunday there was one table inside that was occupied, and probably about eight tables occupied outside where we sat down. It took us a bit to see our waiter approaching with a huge front and back beer menu, along with a very cool looking food menu. It was obvious that he was feeling rushed however he did take the time to answer a couple of questions we had about the beer menu and he took our order. I let him know we would be eating also as he was already rushing off and said he would be right back to take it. 20+ minutes later he stopped back after delivering beer to at least two tables on that trip. We decided to order an appetizer to share. Due to our elevated hunger level everything sounded delicious so we opted to get the combo platter. It consisted of Boom Boom Shrimp, House-Made Tots with beer cheese or jalapeño beer cheese and Chicken Tenders with BBQ sauce on a bed of House-Made Angry Onion Straws - $15 this was an average size appetizer. I personally ate a couple tater tot's and some onion strings. There were also three different dipping sauces, one a barbecue sauce, one a queso cheese sauce and one that was kind of tangy with a little bit of heat. My grands polished off everything else that was on the platter. Our main dishes arrived shortly after we had gotten our appetizer. My grandson ordered a half pound Angus burger called The Pub it was  Jalapeño cream cheese, smoked Gouda, Applewood bacon, lettuce, tomato, cowboy sauce on a butter brioche bun - 11\rit came with french fries. The fries looked great as was the construction of the burger and toppings. Sadly the burger was requested medium rare and arrived medium to well done. After waiting on our food over 1/2 hr. the grandson decided not to request it be redone. My granddaughter ordered the PERI PERI GRILLED CHICKEN PANINI with Goat cheese, hummus on grilled Ciabatta bread - 10. It also came with fries. It looked good and my granddaughter really enjoyed it. When I asked her what \"Peri Peri sauce was She couldn't explain. Since I didn't want something that heavy(The Panini) but I wanted to know what that sauce was I ordered  the 3 BEER BATTERED COD  Tacos. They were dressed with lettuce , cheddar jack and pepper jack cheeses, Peppadew peppers and drizzled with Peri Peri aioli - 8.5 ,my tacos were served with some chips and tiny salsa on the side. I was glad the Peri Peri was only drizzled over my fish tacos as I didn't care for it. To each his own! So our tab for our appetizer,meal, one nonalcoholic bottled beer one draft beer and one beer described as more like wine was $61.86. For us the food rang out at about a 3.9 (out of 5.0), the beverages, we really didn't think my granddaughter would like the nonalcoholic beer but she tried it and as it turns out she doesn't like it. I ordered what was described to me as NOT tasting like a beer at all but like a sweet wine (I guess I must've missed the wine list because the website says they offer it)-after two sips that was enough of that. This is definitely not the Brass Taps fault as I am not a beer drinker but since I said that out loud before ordering off a two sided menu that looks like all beer I would've wished our waiter would have advised me that they did serve wine. All  of us rated the service a 1.5 out of 5.0.    I am not mentioning the name of the server purposefully. Although he could have told me they had wine that really is all I can say related to him.  The major faux pas for us was how long it took to get anything to eat or drink."

Come during happy hour where flights are $7. You really can't beat that since they're heavy pours. I'd highly recommend the Texas flight.  The atmosphere and vibe was dope. They had live music and she sang EVERYTHING under the sun.. from 70s to Michael Jackson to The Weeknd. Definitely made the place awesome.   Our server was great too! Highly recommend to stop by and grab a beer."

                "description": "We chose to celebrate our New Year's Eve at the Brass Tap after snagging a few tickets for the 'Silent Rave' being hosted there that night. Since it was our first time attending such an event, going into it we thought things were going to be awkward, when in fact it was the complete opposite. Everyone had their headphones on, singing and dancing to one of three DJ's that were playing simultaneously on different radio channels. Even on this special night, the drinks were priced normally so kudos to that. This event turned out to be a very social affair.   If you're planning on going to an event like this, especially at the Brass Tap (Domain), I would recommend coming earlier than most to 1) grab a table to have a place to set drinks, otherwise how are you going to dance the way you want to dance? and 2) the line to get event headphones gets decently long and checking out the devices isn't a quick process.   5/5 for a fun organized event, clean venue, friendly bartenders, and a great night out."

                "description": "My review is mostly based on service.  I came here with the husband on a Monday night because I wanted a post-dinner beer. I marked this place in my bookmarks as a place I wanted to try based off the reviews. I generally try to be open-minded about my experiences at new places, but honestly I was just rubbed the wrong way here. We walked inside around 7 pm and I only noticed the list of cocktails on the wall behind the bar. I looked at the tap handles to see if I could tell what they had and the bartender finally came over. I figured I'd ask for something easy and see if they had Dos Equis on draft and was told they didn't with a snarky attitude that I guess he thought was witty or funny. I asked where the list of beers was and he stared at me and just pointed up...ok where am I supposed to be looking? OH. Apparently I'm supposed to know there are individual beer names hanging not only above the bar seats, but also sticking out slightly over the seating where you have to get up to see them. I tell him I haven't been there before and wouldn't know those were there. I order the beer he suggested (Alstadt Kölsch) based off of me asking for Dos Equis. He asks if I want to open a tab and I say no. His response: \"Only one beer?\" with what may as well have been an eye roll. You would think with me telling someone that I'm a new patron the attitude would be better. He probably doesn't care since A) it probably isn't his business, B) I'm sure they have regulars and C) he was probably in a hurry to come outside to vape with his friends on the patio that says \"No Smoking\".  Side note: if you want to sit outside be prepared to listen to cornhole games underneath the same covering as the seating which causes it to echo so loud you can't hear your own conversation."

                "description": "On this past Saturday, we made the adult decision to venture out as LB was open. We decided to visit as they were not busy and were following the separation guidelines. The service is always friendly and it was even better on this visit. Our guest puppy was treated to snacks and fresh water. We sat on the covered patio and watched rerun sporting events and just enjoyed being outside.   I've been an LB patron since day 1 and I remember when it was difficult to find a local venue that offered a large variety of craft beer options.  LB has changed a lot of the years as they now serve cocktails and their patio has been expanded. Venues come and go (see Sheas and AJs across the street) but LB has a loyal following and has remained our go-to venue to have a brew or two and some pub grub.   It's a misnomer to call their food pub grub as you can order a pretty darn good pizza, meatball casserole, fried calamari, artichoke dip, or our favorite their homemade fried pickles. Yes, they pickle on site!   Nice folks, great beer, good cocktails (check out their specials), and food."

The hurricane that I order that was off of there board on drinks that they made was not a good drink.   The garlic bread we ordered was overdone and almost fully burnt on the bottom.   We ordered pizza also. One side was barely done while the other side was burnt. They put a lot of Italian season on top the pizza after it was cooked. Some times you just get a bite full of seasoning, not good.  First bits we thought the pizza had a good flavor but the more you ate the pizza the less tasty it was."

Of course we know that's what to expect from Georgetown lol, but they're kitchen is open until like 11:30 which is fire honestly. Fried pickles were amazing, very nice patio, the music was a little loud but it was busy. Loved that they're dog friendly"

Everything was really good, came out quick and didn't seem like \"frozen\" meat at all. The meatball casserole was probably the best. The food won't blow you away, but it's great for bar munchies. A solid 4 stars   If they realigned their pool table and got some better sticks it wouldn't hurt."

                "description": "Seek and ye shall find. This tiny hidden spot in old Leander checks off lots of my boxes - but doesn't impress. First off. This is a nice place dont get me wrong. I have been 3 times now just to see maybe it was an OFF day. Good menu , sports , decent tunes. So - those are pretty solid. Let me start with the menu. Pub grub for the most part with $10 pizzas unlimited toppings. So- naturally this is what i ordered each time. Each time it comes out it looks amazing and I'm excited. Like a Pointer Sister ( I 'm so excited ) . But the pizza never tastes cooked. The dough is mushy. Not a big deal. NExt time around I tell them to leave it in a bit longer for me. Comes out -- same. Not a deal breaker. Just need to change what I am eating. My belly prob says same thing. Next lets move onto the staff. For the most part the lady running the joint is on point. Friendly- helpful and witty. The remainder of the staff is quite the opposite. I have noticed this during a lunch visit with us being one of 2 people in the place, and in the evenings like during the sports games and crowds. Just abrasive . Again- I'm not there to make friends. I'm there to have a cold beer ( maybe 3) watch baseball or the slew of people who still have to think if they need to be wearing a mask when they enter an establishment( smh). So - The beer. They have a pretty typical tap list with 1-2 silver and gold medal choices. I saw Aldelberts there last night.. sweet!. But behind the bar is a ghostbuster lunchbox treasure chest of cans and bottles. WARNING! don't try to figure out what's in there. Hard to see them all... and after learning  how friendly the bar staff(see above ) is - I gave up asking and went with an IPA. The crowds are not bad and for the most part follow distancing rules.. but - nothing enforced. This scares me. While I know its MY choice to patron , I would still like to see ppl adhere to the 6ft. Outside- good seating - tv;s good parking and over all fantastic. I will prob go back, just not order the pizza and maybe try and get a spy camera behind the bar to see the other options as -- that's what life is all about. Options. Thanks for eating with me today, and I'll see you next time.  -M"

I like this place. The food is good the beer selection is passable and I can watch any sporting event live or read a book or both. But these two are killing the place for me. Ordered a beer and sat for 20 minutes with no one asking me if I might like to order food. Had to literally flag someone down to order a meal. That is not how this business works.   Wearing a mask under your chin until you walk up to a customer is not how this works either. And the tall one did that all night long. Now looking for a different place to spend an evening eating a meal and enjoying a beer."

Person who had seated me brought me a drink then nothing. Though a minimum of 5 different servers were standing right next to my booth.  I understand a restaurant may be short staffed but limit your seating if you cannot handle it.  I've had the similar experience here multiple times.  Last time I patron any of the restaurants in this local chain.  And \"the remedy\" after speaking to a manager when I asked for the check for my half drank coke...oh no need to pay for the coke.

Apparently you get service that way.   Literally just walked in and got sat, was busy due to a UT game no problem. And then we just sit and wait and wait and wait. The supposed waiter for our area literally helped everyone around us and kept skipping us. Idk if it was because we didn't have UT gear on or I was basically the only black person there at the time but ppl that just walked in the door got greeted before we did.   We just got up and left. There's no way the dude in the area didn't know we had not been helped as he purposely kept ignoring the table and was serving EVERYONE around us.   Terrible service."

We fancied burgers and thought that a sports bar would serve delicious burgers! What a mistaken idea!! We started with a cup of onion soup: it was edible, not delicious, a little strong on the acid side, but ok. Then came the burgers: a 3mm leather sole burnt to death!! Awful! Horrible!! My husband had to leave the restaurant and was sick in the car park!! The fries were smothered in fat... yak! The waiter on the other hand was a sweetheart!! VERY professional! When I mentioned it wasn't good, he immediately offered to comp them, which he did! I am tempted to say that he had been through a similar situation before, maybe several times!!! He didn't hesitate and didn't offer an alternative: he KNEW the food was bad! Shame on management to allow this to happen! It's a Burger after all, and we are in Texas!! Land of Beef!!

                "description": "Cover 2 off research always hits the spot it's got the best shoe string fries I can't seem to find anywhere else in Austin . Even though they may just be French fries and not a main course there is something so satisfying about them . My favorite dish is the buffalo chicken sliders , I personally get the blue cheese on the side with ranch to dip . These are amazing and have the perfect thin not to thick cut of chicken that's battered nice and crispy but stays juicy tossed in tangy but not spicy buffalo sauce. The bread doesn't take over the sandwich so that's not all you get full on and is super soft . They also have a buffalo chicken salad that has a good amount of chicken if your not wanting a sandwich but need to cure that buffalo craving . I've only had the burgers other than that and they are equally delicious again especially with those shoe string fries that are always crispy .  This place is relaxed and a good place to have a beer while you cool off after a long day or just dining with the family.  The staff is pleasant and the deserts are huge . Well at least the brownie is . If you like bars and burgers are in the area and don't know what to eat stop in and try the buffalo sandwich it's my go to and recommendation for cover 2 . If not that than at least grab a beer and some shoe string fries and relax a minute ."

They have rotating specials, soups and flatbreads. The servers and staff are all very friendly and hard workers. I also bring friends here and they have all loved it as well! They have great deals on their happy hour and a good variety of beers and wine that are not crazy overpriced. I have loved everything I have ordered and they have great portion sizes! We usually come for lunch or dinner, but we recently had brunch which was also fabulous. I had the chilaquiles and they were amazing! The portions are also super generous so I've left with leftovers multiple times. If you're a sports person, they have a ton of really nice TVs and always have games on. I am honestly so happy this place is close by and will continue giving them my business! I would also like to add that like many places these days, they have also experienced shortages with staff and when that happens, we have seen the managers out on the floor helping out and also working their butte off! This restaurant has amazing food, service and is such a great place to have a nice dinner, go hang with friends or just pop by for a drink! Thanks for rocking it Cover 2! Oh and the Round Rock location is also awesome as I went their with a group of work friends once they also had excellent service and the food was equally as delicious!!!"

                "description": "So today was my first day in Austin. I searched Yelp. I drove by a number of joints. I even walked through Whole Foods. Alas nothing struck my fancy. Heading back, I swung into Cover2. I'm glad I did.  The greeting, Silvana as server, and the whole support staff weekend terrific.  I started with a cup of French onion soup. It was just a tad too sweet for my taste. I'm also a purist in looking for a single crouton under the  hood (of cheese).   The fries and prime rib sandwich were a pleasant surprise. I will typically keg wrestle you to keep the horseradish sauce off the plate. The sauce here actually was mellowed very nicely and didn't fight the meat. The fries were great! Nothing more need be said.   This was a terrific first meal in a new town. This might become my extended kitchen it was that solid of aa performance!"

I try to give servers the benefit of the doubt cause maybe they're short staffed but after multiple issues with the same server and seeing tables sat after us putting their orders in and getting their food, I'm getting disappointed with the downhill service at Cover 2.   We received our drinks at 6:45 pm. Left money on the table for the drinks and left the establishment at 7:20 pm after our server ghosted us with empty drinks and no food order placed."

                "description": "Some notes for anyone trying to sit outside/be COVID-safe:   They have outdoor seating but to access it you have to go through the indoor bar first. To exit, same thing.  The staff doesn't wear masks (some do but not all) inside.  They do not allow dogs in their outdoor patio.  They have picnic tables spaced out.  You can only order food at the bar; they don't have QR codes on their outdoor tables to allow remote ordering. They do bring out your food to your table, though. If you go during winter, come prepared to bundle up because they have no space heaters in the open-air patio.   TLDR; bring your mask because you're going to have to go inside at some point. Leave Fido at home, bring a jacket."

First noticed the harsh increase in wing prices (before the shortage) a couple years ago. I understand prices increase, inflation blah blah.   But they used to advertise it as wing Wednesday, and they were cheaper that day. And it was fun. Now, the overpriced wings come out with very little sauce, and the sauce tastes/looks different than what it used to?(referring to blazing sauce, my fav.) Meh, guess the crowd is changing."

                "description": "I finally got a chance to checkout Cat's infamous hideout, and it did not disappoint. It's the typical neighborhood dive bar that I expected it to be, but that's not a bad thing.  Some of the best things happen in a place like this!  TRUST me, it's nothing but fun, fun, fun, with a capital F-U-N!  It's a good place to do some day drinking, or hang out until the wee hours of the morn'.  As Tina R said in her review, lots of interesting characters lurk in this place.  Including \"that\" guy who likes to butt into your conversation, and then carry the conversation and not give anyone else a chance to talk.  But I won't dock 'em a star for that.  Every neighborhood bar has \"that\" guy in it.  It's a package deal.  Inside is kind of dark and it takes a minute for your eyeballs to adjust if you enter during the daytime. But after a few minutes, all is well and you'll soon be jamming out to the old school jukebox. You won't find any Touch Tunes here folks - yes, it still uses CDs (who would have imagined CDs would ever be considered old school?).  Here's the most important part of this review before I blather on with all of the interesting factoids:  If you learn nothing else this year, learn this my young Padawans: Many people say it's hard to find, so here's a tip - if you cross the railroad tracks on the access/frontage road, you have just passed it.  Turn right on the last street that you see right BEFORE you get to the tracks, and then take another right turn into the parking lot.  DON'T cross the railroad tracks!  There's a decent outdoor patio with plenty of picnic tables, and a few of them are shaded.  10 dollar minimum for using a credit card (pet peeve of mine).  Wi-Fi password \"cheapdr1nks\" all in lower case.  12 local and regional craft beers on tap (I counted).  They have about 30 brews in cans and bottles, most of them are from the ATX or at least regional.  The big name brews are only available in bottles and cans, not on tap.  It's a little pricey for a dive bar - pints of Thirsty Goat were 4.50  Full bar - liquor and eraythang!  Six TVs, and a large projector screen (yes I counted).  Yes, they do have food - I didn't partake, but they have tacos, a couple of salads, burgers, sammiches, and the usual bar appetizers.  Every one of the picnic tables on the patio has Cat's name carved in it (she's the current duchess but has fled the city, so it won't last long. Get out there and claim it boys and girls).  Rumor has it that this picnic table vandalism is why she had to leave the ATX, but who knows the real truth?"

                "description": "I love wing wednesday! They have great wings and all sorts of flavors. They do charge you for everything, which is quirky. It's not expensive at all, so it's really not upsetting. Just a funny thing I noticed. You're charged for condiments and celery. When you're paying 75 cents for wings and cheap drinks, it's a drop in the bucket.   The patio is great and so lively. It is fairly busy. I would even suggest getting there as early as possible because parking is limited. There is a weird gravelly lot for overflow parking, but I have a little sedan and not a 4-wheeler to get over the ditch that is there.  They do allow smoking outside, so if you're sensitive to that then the patio is not for you. At first it bothered me, but had a great time catching up with friends and eating up those wings!"

I enjoyed the look and feel of the place and the cheap booze. My only gripe is that it is on the North side of Austin for me.   I will note that my husband and I ordered the nachos here. I wasn't impressed with them but honestly you don't come here for the food. You come here for booze and maybe the people if you are feeling up to it."

                "description": "So we are in Austin for a family holiday because daughter #2 has a home 4x the size of ours (for the same amount of money!) But I digress...  Daughter #1 is here, too. She once lived in in Austin for a minute; but that was five years ago and so much has changed since then.   She asked to go somewhere quintessentially Austin. Not much of that left, especially in the northern parts, but we researched a bit and came up with The Hideout Pub.   Only juke box music during our visit, so not sure if they ever have live music, which we were hoping for. Regardless, the drinks were good and CHEAP. I mean $5.50 for a Moscow Mule cheap. And that's not even Happy Hour price.   We also had burgers. The Austin burger, ($13) with grilled onions, mushrooms and goat cheese, to which I added the sweet and delicious Moonshine BBQ sauce. Big burgers that come with fries, onion rings, tater tots, salad or chips and salsa. I got the onion rings, she ordered the tots. Both delicious. We couldn't finish our meals and brought half of it home.   Atmosphere is strictly dive bar. Love it! But not \"biker bar\" as I saw it described somewhere. Dark, low lighting, neon, plain seating, wood floors, tv screens all around. There's also an outdoor, multilevel seating area.   Our server was as sweet as pie, with a faint cute accent to boot. Mixed crowd, mostly keeping to themselves.   New neighborhood if this was my permanent neighborhood."

Its divey dark spot with plenty of room to chill and hang out. The bartenders were cute, funny and poured some very nice drinks. The long island is only 6 bucks and they had a host of cheap drinks but thats what we were drinking. Now...onto the fooood.  The wings...wangs...were delicious! I got the spicy BBQ and my friend got lemon pepper both well done (I hate a soggy wing). The only downside is that for 7 bucks you only get like 5...well damn! However I saw that they have a wing special every wednesday for like 25 cents or something like that so don't quote me.  Will have to come back on a wednesday."

                "description": "Another wonderful and flavorful dinner at El Monumento!  This has become our favorite place.  Their food is just straight up delicious- always. Had the enchilada trio in the suizas sauce; all of them excellent. And the beans cooked with bacon??  Holy hell- AMAZING.  Great sangria- get the carafe- makes sense and you will finish it.   Trevor was our waiter- what a fun guy.  Helpful, attentive and funny - loved him. Also- do yourself a favor and get the chocolate cream pie"

                "description": "I decided to come to Texas to visit two very dear friends of mine and they suggested this restaurant they're regulars at to have a good Mexican meal. To our dismay we had an awful experience dining here and had to cut it short. Before sitting to eat we had asked the hostess ahead of time if it was okay to sit on the patio with 2 service dogs. She said it was okay and sat us outside. A few minutes later a server came up to clarify and ask that the dogs were indeed service animals otherwise we'd have to leave and we confirmed they were. Then lastly we were approached by the general manager who came up to our table in the worst behavior out of everyone. She immediately spoke to us in a very rude manner and harshly said we have to leave immediately because of our dogs - after we had already ordered 3 drinks and just gotten our appetizers. We were very taken aback at her demeanor when she came up to us because there was no apology for the miscommunication, or spending $58 on food and drinks just to be kicked out, and wasting our time dining there for 30 minutes already and now needing to go drive somewhere else to have a proper meal. We had tried communicating with her how disruptive this was to our plans after multiple members of her staff had expressed the dogs were okay being there, but she wouldn't allow us a chance to speak and just talked over us stating that it didn't matter what any of the employees say and it is up to her. We still had our full drinks and asked if at least we could finish those first and wait for our food to be boxed to go, but she refused and said we had to exit the premises immediately with our dogs there. Keep in mind, I never go out of my way to leave negative reviews but this encounter was such an awful experience that I wanted future customers to be aware of the treatment from the management here, because I personally wouldn't want to support a company that doesn't care for their guests like we experienced.   P.S.  As we exited the restaurant we came across this sign up front of the entry door stating that no pets were allowed but service animals trained to aid disabled persons are ok? If service dogs are not allowed this sign should have been removed because it is very misleading."

                "description": "Dropped in for some frozen margaritas and some apps. From the outside the place looks pretty appealing, nice outdoor patio and courtyard area and with a slightly rustic feel.  Ordered some frozen margs and was more like a marg with crushed ice on the top, not exactly frozen.  Apps/quesadilla was alright, nothing to write home about but did the job.  Could see myself dropping in to see if the experience or foods and drinks change at all. First impression is it looks like it has potential but doesn't deliver."

                "description": "Second time coming here and it's a bit of a mixed bag. The staff is excellent, we were seated quickly and chips and two salsas brought out promptly.  I ordered a specialty margarita on the rocks and it was just ok.  The table ordered the chicken fajitas, enchiladas and carnitas plate. The fajitas were overcooked and dry. The edges were burnt and the onions and peppers were sliced way too thin and were over cooked as well. The portion was very small from my last visit, but shrinkflation huh?? The enchiladas were very good and the carnitas were the favorite. The charro beans were awesome. The rice was bland and one dimensional and the street corn was overly sweet. The salsa was flavorful but at least one needs a little more heat. The restaurant itself is really cool and clean. I will definitely go back but on a different night maybe try a different dish and drink"

                "description": "The food I got was not good, and borderline just plain bad. Beans watery, sour cream sauce slimy, rice tasted like cardboard. I liked the Brussels sprouts and the chocolate cake, but why would I go to a Mexican restaurant for those?  I liked our waitress a lot, as we were a big party and she did her best. But I just can't stand it when water isn't refilled timely, especially since I needed to wash down the nasty flavors I was consuming."

                "description": "We ate at El Monumento last night.  The venue is really nice, but the quality of the food doesn't match the way the place looks.  My wife had the shrimp asada and I had the beef asada and neither was very good.  The beef was really dry and overcooked.  I would have returned it, but the service was so slow and sporadic that I didn't know if I would get it back before everyone was ready to leave.  Cocktails were the best part of the experience, but not enough of a reason to go back.  This place isn't cheap either...they need to drastically improve food quality.  A Mexican restaurant in Texas that can't cook carne asada should make some serious changes asap."

                "description": "My husband and I are from the DFW area in North Texas and decided to visit here while leaving our Airbnb in Georgetown. We found out the place did not open until 3pm on a Sunday so we waited 10 mins in the parking lot. We noticed a large amount of cars and people started pulling in and waiting in line at the door! We thought that we needed to get out then and wait too. Right at 3pm, the doors opened, and waiters were lined up waiting to seat everyone. We snagged a great spot on the patio by the river. We only came for drinks and appetizers. We were happy to learn that happy hour was taking place from 3-6pm. Happy hour means you take $2 off most drinks and appetizers. It is a little disappointing you have to purchase chips and salsa, but it was only $1.50 with their happy hour special. The margaritas are very strong! The chicken flautas were so crispy and yummy. There is a type of cabbage slaw/salad that is served on top that adds extra flavor. The chips were extremely golden and crunchy, cooker to perfection. Their salsa is OK but you have two different once's (a red and green avocado). Overall the scenery is beautiful inside and out. Service overall is fantastic. I would visit here frequently if I was a local!"

                "description": "Passed this place a handful of times and decided to try it out. There's plenty of street parking nearby if the lot is full. Seating was quick for a party of three on a Wednesday night. They do take reservations so keep that in mind if you have a larger party.    ORDER  Chicken Flautas (start) Nachos (cut) Chips and Salsa (bench) Tres Leches   Food Flautas were good as were the chips and salsa. Nachos were surprising as the toppings were added to the chips and they're not the style where you can dip the chips. Not the style I'm used to but could be good for anyone trying to portion control.   Overall This would be a great place to take your out-of-town visitors because the service is good and the setting. I'd come back again and check out the bar area."

                "description": "Figured it was about time that I reviewed El Monumento. I went there for the first time a few months ago and it instantly became one of my favorite places to go for happy hour. I often try to switch it up and I pride myself in trying new fun places, but I'm a sucker for a nice patio and tasty drinks and El Monumento has both.  They also accept reservations and they have plenty of parking, so two thumbs up. We always order the queso flameado, the chicken flautas, the barbacoa street tacos and the quesadillas. Their tres leches is absolutely amazing so make sure you save room for dessert. I've liked all the drinks that I've tried and their monthly special drinks are always fun and innovative. The service has been decent every time we've been there. Nothing special, but nothing to complain about either."

We got a reservation a little earlier than normal so we could take in the Christmas lights on the nearby Georgetown square.  Paige was our server and she did a great job. She was very attentive but didn't rush us. We started with chips and salsa, followed closely by the queso flameato, gooey and yummy .  Our meals included tortilla soup, shrimp chili relleno, street tacos and one of the special plates. Needless to say we waddled out... Our experiences in the past were a little inconsistent but this time they were right on point. Looked like there were enough employees to take care of the good crowd they had. It was fairly noisy though. Lots of families and groups.  Thanks Paige, keep up the good work! As I'm prone to say when it's appropriate, this is a repeater! Happy Holidays fellow Yelpers!"

My favorite part about this restaurant is the outdoor seating and ambiance. It's relaxing, quiet shaded, and you can see the water below.   The service has always been pretty good, no complaints there.   The food is very good and the drinks too, their cucumber/jalapeno margaritas are perrrrfecccct.   I agree with many of the other reviews, it's much pricier than its competitors for very comparable tasting food.

Lighting could be a little better but it sets the mood. Our waitress Graziella was amazing!!! Super friendly and just down to earth! She's gives all the good vibes. The food is to the tee. I had the Carnitas burger and it is a must, not to mention The Wedge burger. I requested a drink that wasn't on the menu and not only did they make it for me but they put their twist on it and made it better! Let's just say after my party tasted my drink we had to order a round for the table! Thanks again Josh!! The Key Lime will make you think someone's aunt is back there making it with love  and the home made Oreo Ice Cream is something to talk about. We will definitely be seeing you guys again. Btw I won't be upset if you decided to put that drink on the menu..."

                "description": "Great expensive food! They make everything from scratch so be prepared to wait. It's a fun place to bring your friends or coworkers if you aren't in a hurry and aren't afraid to spend a bunch on appetizers. The meals range from $15-$30. I've never been disappointed. The fish and chips are currently my favorite.   Some nights it can get really loud outside, so be prepared for that. It's almost always busy, so if you want to give it a try be safe and make reservations."

                "description": "This spot is amazing!   The location is perfect, the service was great and the \"food\" was fantastic lol.  Reason for my quotation marks is because my gf and I came to hang with one of her friends and they wanted to have a \"cake and wine\" type of night so that's exactly what we did. The menu did not look disappointing so I'll definitely have to come back to try a plate.   The cheesecake I believe it was, was absolutely amazing! Definitely has a very sweet taste but I mean, if you're looking for dessert you should look no further.   We also had a couple of glasses of wine and cocktails. All fantastic. My gf ordered the fantastic beautiful and it was delicious!   If you're in the area and looking for some food or just a place to grab a couple of drinks while chit chatting, this is definitely the spot to hit up at the domain. Not loud but not too quiet, dim lighting to set the mood, and a very laid back atmosphere"

                "description": "I came here with my coworkers one afternoon for lunch. For the table, we started off with the house made Guacamole and grilled Artichokes. The Guacamole came with sweet potato chips and I ordered the number six chicken sandwich with kale slaw for the main entree. The chicken sandwich had the right amount of cajun seasoning. The burger and sandwiches here come with french fries or slaw. I feel I definitely did good by ordering the kale slaw instead of the fries because the kale slaw was out of this world. It was very good and fresh. Yum!! Highly recommend it.   Service and ambiance was outstanding."

                "description": "Currently writing with one button of my jeans undone - Doc B's food has me full to the brim.   Not usually a big American-food person but I was curious why this place was so well-rated and wanted to try it for myself.   I asked the server to let me know what are the best things on the menu. She was very familiar with the restaurants' offerings and she killed it with her recommendations. Here's what we got:   For appetizers, Housemade Guac and Oven-roasted Wings are must-gets. The Guac is great because the chips are unique: baked sweet potato chips! I could munch on these all night. Thankfully, the Oven-Roasted Wings stole my attention as soon as it landed on my table. Best. Wings. The Chimichurri sauce is addicting!   For mains, our server mentioned that the West Coast Steak Sandwich is the best. One bite in, I wholeheartedly trusted her. It's cooked to perfection and the bed of greens helps to cut the fattiness of the meat. The Chimichurri Steak was also pretty good but the steak on the West Coast Steak Sandwich was better. The fries were well-seasoned, perfectly thin, and crispy. Oh, we also threw in a Brussel Sprouts Salad, which was needed to balance the heavy meal.   - Our server was knowledgeable about the menu (+1) - Everything came out so quickly, I think in less than 20 minutes (+1) - Our server's recommendations were spot on and the food was great (+1, +1) - Very reasonably-priced for how good this restaurant is (+1)   That's a solid 5-stars in my books. Highly recommend!  p.s. I dined at the bar to skip the wait, which was going to be 45 minutes (7:30 PM on a Wednesday night). Reservations are probably needed because of how busy the Domain gets."

                "description": "Doc B's Restaurant + Bar in The Domain had good dishes. They received 4 stars because the prices were higher than I'd expect for this food. Even the apps were pricey. They have a good bar and patio with TVs for the big games. The server was clearly new to serving based on his awkward interactions with us. I ordered the Chicken Paillard (arugula, tomatoes, pickled red onion, and shaved reggiano with gold coast vinaigrette). I had to really dig for the chicken under the mound of arugula but it did have good flavors, just way too much rabbit food on top. The buttermilk fried chicken looked good so if I go back, I may have to try that."

                "description": "my boyfriend and I had dinner at a very busy time and did not have to wait at all. At first we choose this place because most of the other restaurants had a very long wait time. We were both glad we choose to eat here. I don't remember our servers name but so many other servers including ours were very attentive and kept checking on us. What made our experience over the top was when  the manager, josh stopped to talk to us about the restaurant(history with the restaurant), different recommendations around the area. We were very appreciative of the conversations with Josh during a busy dinner time.  I had the chicken parm. it was very flavorful and the right portion of pasta for the chicken. my boyfriend had the filet and he said it was great. the Potatoes that come with are delicious as well. I had a few to try!  We definitely will be back!"

So much to the point I bought sweet potatoes to try and recreate. Lol  Next was the chicken kebabs and cucumber and feta salad. Can you say I almost licked the plate!   If you have not eaten here then it's a must. I stretched my neck out for what others were ordering and it all looked so yummy. I'll be a repeat customer for sure."

Still just everything was not worth it and mediocre and not up to its ambiance feel."

                "description": "One of the places we went for my wife's birthday week. She had been hearing good things and saw great reviews, we went with another friend who also has a birthday in June.  The place was very nice, you had indoor and outdoor seating, the staff wore masks. We sat inside as it was hot, there is a parking garage, the purple one, right across the street so that was nice.  Service was great and fast. We started with some drinks and candied bacon and chips and Guac. The bacon was very good, agreed on by all three of us. The water did not come with ice which I found rather weird but maybe it's not but they keep it filled.  Our friend has the Cobb salad, Shana had the Turkey Burger, and I had Chicken. They both liked theirs, my fries were really good but unless you dipped the chicken in one of the sauces they brought it was pretty dry. Good flavor but dry.  The food was good, they raved about the chips but the guac was not as great as they were hoping. Overall it was good but not as good as many review make it sound, I admit I expect more when the food it more expensive and two of the three meals being good is great but while I am glad we went, not going to be on my normal rotation of places to go on date nights."

We have tried:  Triple Play - Served with guacamole, queso and salsa.  All three was great. The queso super creamy, the guacamole perfectly seasoned and the salsa was warm and not too spicy  Steak Salad - A large amount of steak lay on top of a freshly made salad - soo yummy  Beer Battered Fish and Chips - perfectly fried fish along side some seasoned French fries, cannot go wrong with this dish  Turkey Avocado Smash sandwich - Amazing sandwich and a must try  Blacked Fish tacos - There was pineapple in it which threw me off but otherwise, good tacos.  The fish was plentiful and you are served 3 large tacos with this dish along side some chips and that delicious salsa."

I do think there should be an employee bathroom because the gals have to hang out there and are in and out to maintenance their appearance, And as a customer it's not professional to go into a bathroom full of employees, whom are talking about customers, their hair and make up, their boyfriends etc. it makes me think that twin peaks doesn't value their employees enough to even provide them with a break/powder room."

They have a lot of specials during the weekdays, not too much during the weekend when we went though.  Clientele is varied...ranging from dudes by themselves to buddies watching the game to confederate flag t-shirt/jacket wearing fellas.   All in all, not as trashy as I was expecting and it was an interesting experience. The food was actually pretty decent so I may take out in the future but I don't think I'll be back to eat-in anytime soon."

                "description": "So I'm leaving a second review after coming here fairly regularly over a year or so period.  Im also upgrading my review to 5 stars.  This location provides consistently high quality from the food to the service, and now the environment has been upgraded!  I really enjoy the new look.  The restaurant is more open and some of the tables are cafeteria style which promotes a social atmosphere.  There are still individual tables though.  Hell I usually sit alone.  I just like seeing people having a good time.   There are some stunning as well as super nice servers here but it has pretty much always been that way since I've been coming here.    They offer a variety of food on the menu including healthy choices and a veggie burger that is just fantastic.  Best of all it won't break the bank...unless you go stupid on the tip.  P10 is down the street haha.  But the servers do seem to build rapport with repeat customers.  Overall if you haven't been here in awhile, it's worth another visit.  I suggest Friday during happy hour.  You're welcome!"

                "description": "Such a great addition to the neighborhood! Perfect place for family night. Who doesn't love pizza. There is great outdoor seating and has a playscape for the kids. The pizza is good as well, there is a combination for someone. There is plenty of seating inside too. The lunch deals are such a good deal. The staff is friendly, we like to do the curbside orders on nights when we are too lazy to cook. It's fast and easy, plus there is so many options you don't feel like you are eating the same thing over and over even if you come here weekly.   The new COVID ordering is nice though you don't have to leave your table and you can split the check among who orders what. It is annoying for those who haven't had it set up on their phones already but otherwise it's super easy after the initial set up."

                "description": "My fiancé and I have been here 3 times now, and we enjoy our visit every time. The pizza is good, the selection of beers and ciders on tap is pretty phenomenal, the soda selection is great as well, and the vibe of the place (Parmer Lane location) is family-friendly and fun!  This time, we ordered The Lazy Goat and the Buffalo Chicken pizzas. The Lazy Goat gets a 5/5 - it was perfectly balanced, and I loved the artichokes and goat cheese with red sauce. The Buffalo Chicken was just okay, I'd give it a 3/5 - it was as expected but left you wanting something more.  In the past, we've tried the Chicken Bacon Ranch (3/5), Ground Control (4/5), and The South Austin (4/5). The focaccia bread sticks are also good!   Overall, it's a nice place to drop in after work or to get Friday night pizzas from. When the weather is nice, it's fun to sit outside - though I can't recommend the high top table chairs, as they are quite uncomfortable. We will definitely be visiting again!"

I especially like the unique and earthy flavor of the cheese.  The bonus was they delivered a growler which I'll check out later...(it's later and yummy Pilsner) Will I order it again!?! Probably not. But it was a solid meal nonetheless."

My little one was occupied the entire time and barely took time to eat because she didn't want to stop playing! The pizza was delicious. We shared a simple pepperoni pizza and cheese focaccia bread. I liked that the crust held up well. It wasn't too think or thin - just right! My kid finally up ate 3 pieces when she sat down from playing. If you are a parent and looking to have a cold beer and relax then this is definitely the spot for you. They have tons of beers on tap! Beer, playground and pizza - how can you not be a fan of that?!"

I ordered the major tom, pepperoni was very crispy but the veggies were a little undercooked would've preffered them a bit more cooked.

                "description": "This is the worst experience I have had in awhile with management. To begin, with follow my pics.. I ordered a major tom (supreme pizza) with EXTRA sauce thru door dash. At 7:55 within a few min I received notification it was being picked up.  I call store to inquire how is that possible if it was freshly made. The store hung up on me. So, I worked w door dash who asked me to wait for delivery to see if there is a quality issue. I did just that, only to receive a pizza that was warm but based on the cheese amount, semi chilled veggies I knew I wasn't too off base when I had my reservations about it to begin with.  I call store - ask for manager, even though I know door dash will ultimately handle. However, I just wanted to know how you can make a pizza in 5 min and say its fresh. Manager says sorry for the hang up like she's singing to a tune of a tiny violin; then tells me they don't have base pizzas sitting around (kind of like Villa in the mall that adds toppings when u order). I ask why is there so much cheese then and no sauce. Clearly cheese is added and is already rubbered up. Short answer and ultimate answer from her was another unbelivable sorry and to work with door dash.   What's sad here..Villa Pizza (mall pizza) is better than this any day. And I'm kicking myself for not going with Salvation pizza instead. Aviator down south was awesome but this Parmer Lane site is lacking customer skills and good pizza."

                "description": "2nd favorite pizza in Austin!  I love pizza. If I were choosing my last meal it would be a toss up between pizza and beer or filet mignon and merlot (or Shiraz). I digress...pizza...it must have a great crust-never EVER soggy, a well-balanced sauce, and just the right amount of cheese. Lastly, the maker must not skimp on the chosen toppings.  Well done, Aviator! My friend and I shared the \"pizza of the day\", and it was fabulous (though I don't remember the name of it). The crust had that initial crunch followed by the perfect chewiness. We each had a light beer with hints of blueberry-um...yummy!  Aviator is new to this location, and still getting established, so it was dead inside. I suspect this will be a popular lunch place for nearby companies such as Apple, Oracle, etc. There is a huge outside play area for those of you who have kiddos-great for birthday parties.  I prefer quieter places, so it misses the mark for me regarding atmosphere. You can see the pizza makers through a glass window, and the kitchen appeared clean. There are ample choices of beer and lots of great food options too. I've been twice and suspect it will be a fav of mine. Give it a try. Let me know what you think."

It was crazy packed on a Friday evening but they had plenty of seating indoors and outdoors!  We ordered the Foccacio cheese sticks (basil, mozzarella and goat cheese) - a hit for us when we ordered to go previously. We also tried something different which was the Monty. We also ordered a Caesar salad- pricey for a salad in my opinion but this is a good option if you feel like you need that balanced meal!  The Monty was the least of my favorite. We have stuck to ordering the Flying Garlic Pizza after our first visit and it never disappoints. It has become a must order for us and will continue to stay that way!"

They also have a great outdoor area and sometimes they have live music.  The pizza looks amazing and the ingredients are fresh but the dough has no taste.  Pinthouse on the other hand has an amazing crust and severely limited outdoor seating.    I really hope the crust changes because the outdoor area and taps would keep me coming back.  However I can't see going here over Pinthouse.    If they nailed the dough I would absolutely chose this place"

                "description": "Today, I ordered a to-go order for pick-up so I could do yet ANOTHER lunch and learn... how much learning do I really need to do?????? I ordered two items: the caprese salad and the black olive and caprese pesto grinder.   Caprese-  Caprese salad is a simple Italian salad, made of sliced fresh  mozzarella, tomatoes, and sweet basil, seasoned with salt, olive oil, or  balsamic vinaigrette. This is a menu item that really can't be 'messed up'. It is simple and to the point. This caprese was accompanied by a side of vinaigrette.  Black Olive and caprese pesto grinder-  This item was unexpectedly good. This meatless Monday treat contained black olives, mozzarella, red onions, baby spinach, and a Roma tomato pesto base. This sandwich provided a balanced mixture of sweet (from the tomatoes and red onions) slightly sour (from the mozzarella) and earthy (from the pesto) bites. Although hearty in its contents, this sandwich was actually very light on the palate.   #supportlocal"

So many options but I'm not sure if this will be high in my rotation of pizza places.   I do like the restaurant space. The outdoor area is nice and kid friendly with the playground. Aviator has a wide selection of beers (at least from what I could tell). I think the pizza is good but unfortunately I think there are better places for pizza. Weirdly, I think their normal pies (with red sauce) are kind of lackluster. I did enjoy their non-traditional pies. The chicken bacon ranch and the taco pizza were pretty great!"

                "description": "On this deliciously lazy Sunday, the darling husband and I knew that pizza was just the only thing that would do. Jersey Giant Pizza, he suggested? Quick, easy, cheap, and reliably tasty. Closed on Sundays, I lamented. DeSano's, I countered? His eyes lit up, but then I remembered that, although we adore DeSano Pizzeria Napoletana to bloody distraction, we should probably try something brand-new for a little variety...and for me to review! Why not? Enter Aviator Pizza and Drafthouse!  Local? Check! Solid reviews? Check. Hubby's a helicopter pilot and trying out this place is, therefore, too hard to resist? Check. Cute pizza names? Check. Yummy pictures? Check. Let's do this!   (Note: all three are takeout 9-inch pies with no mods, except for hubby's deletion of the green peppers on his Ground Control.)  The Greek: this one was my flavor profile to an ABSOLUTE T! It reminded me a bit of Joe's Pizza at Star Pizza in Houston, but better! A riotous feta, pesto, artichoke, basil, mushroom, and kalamata olive party on a crust! Hugely flavorful! This goes on the culinary Rolodex post-haste!    The Flying Garlic: very garlicky! Shocker, right? Lol! Well, we are garlic people, so we endorse this pie whole-heartedly! The buttery crust, the garlic cloves, and the feta were just unctuous!   Ground Control (minus green peppers): Hubby liked this, but he didn't super-love it. He kept snagging pieces of the Greek and the Flying Garlic. I asked him what his least favorite part was, and he said that it really wasn't fair to judge it on such a small pie. He wants to give it one more shot with a larger pizza! His theory is that small pizzas make the fillings hard to shine. Makes sense!   As I write this, though, he's literally humming Ground Control to Major Tom as he kicks back on the couch playing Call of Duty: Cold War with a warm and happy belly, so I consider this a solid win. We'll definitely be back soon to dine in! Thanks, Aviator!"

                "description": "I've passed by Aviator several times and finally decided to try it with a friend.  We came at 8pm and the place was fairly busy. Unfortunately, the ordering process itself was very confusing. You can either follow a bunch of arrows to the counter and order (with few menus available), or you can seat yourself and order through a QR code and have someone bring your food to you.  We chose to go to the counter and ordered two Bear King beers that had great flavor- we were allowed to sample before ordering which was a plus. There were 50+ beers/wines to choose from so endless options... you can opt for a flight too. We also ordered two small pizzas (BBQ Chicken and Spinach and Artichoke) that came out in ~10 minutes. The pizzas had a thicker crust and were DELICIOUS! I'd definitely order again.   There were plenty of picnic style tables inside and out, and the outdoor patio had beautiful string lights, a playground, umbrellas, and lots of open space. Parking is easy in and easy out, and the staff were friendly.  Overall, I'd recommend Aviator. Great quality pizza in North Austin."

                "description": "This is a place that has been on my bucket list for a few years and we finally tried it and will be back again. The facility is pretty cool as far as decor. Clearly, an architect was involved in the design with ample seating in dining areas, bar and outside. The staff is young and enthusiastic. Our server whose name is pm b (Kinda funny name) was particularly nice and accommodating . My wife ordered the Ruben and I got the pimento burger and both were quite satisfying. Being a former restaurant owner/operator, I appreciated our server's knowledge of the menu. They use a team system here which I love so when your food is ready, it is delivered immediately.  I have only two suggestions that could make for a better experience: 1. people working the bar; Don't throw the empty liquor bottles in the trash. The loud crash is unsetteling. 2. Management, dont let your modern attractive facility get seedy. Our seat cushions in the bar area should have been repaired long ago. This isn't a big expense. and look for other signs of wear around the interior.  Clearly, this is a popular place and we will be back."

                "description": "Maybe I caught them on the wrong day. Maybe they caught me on the wrong day. That was a rough experience. And I don't want it to be. I live in the area and I do want this place to thrive. We are lacking in places like this. I'd like to chalk it up to staffing but I have been to dozens of restaurants in the past two years that have surely have had staffing issues and this is the first one I've written about on this medium.   The food is great, the drinks are great but I really got turned off on the service here. I just sat at the bar for a couple drinks and a small meal. The bartender was horrible. Not with the efficiency, but wow, it was all about her. I heard her say the following things to other staffers: \"welcome to hell\". \"If he's not here, I'll walk out\". Constantly criticizing the bar setup from a previous shift (which I'm sure was a result of similar staffing issues she was facing).   I asked her name and I think she said \"heather\" but she just mumbled that and walked away. So quickly that I knew she was just pissed at the world. While she was so obviously busy by the account of her commentary, she definitely had time to shake drinks in a mixer so loudly around the entire bar in a rhythmic fashion to get everyone to look at her. It was the \"heather\" show.   Couldn't handle it."

                "description": "Service here was good and loved the bar area. Brunch cocktail selection was above average. The Vietnamese espresso drink and Bloody Mary were great.   Food is what knocks this down a bit. I got the biscuits and gravy which was wayyyy to much biscuit for the amount of gravy given. Getting the chicken added is a must.   The carnitas poutine was super salty. I get that both things are meant to be like that, but this was just too much. I wish there was more pickled onions and jalapeños to balance it out.   The happy hour menu and times looked pretty good, so I'd definitely return to try that out."

The brussels spouts were tasty too.  My friend had the pastrami sandwich and she kept raving about it; the pastrami was high quality.    | Cocktails |  Again, a big win.  They were doing a bartender drink contest with several whiskey cocktails and I went for the Peach Tree.  Although petite it packs in taste and was not light on the whiskey!  | Atmosphere |  The patio is typical strip mall-ish.  It's nice that it is dog friendly."

Initially thought a little pricey but then OMG... the quality of the entrées and portions were amazing.  Definitely looking forward to dining in soon and will definitely order again.  Must have fish and chips for lovers of fish and chips.    And cheeseburger was huge win with husband and teenager.  Meatloaf was awesome but eclipsed by fish and chips and burger."

I had the wagyu steak and fritz. It was amazing and cooked perfectly. The fritz I could not leave alone. Our server Paige was such a delight. We weren't sure exactly what we wanted to try but she had lots of suggestions for food and drinks! She explained what was in everything and you could tell she really wanted us to enjoy everything we ordered. We ended up staying for quite a while because we were enjoying the atmosphere, service and drinks so much."

Ousthouse is consistent and you will never have a bad time. Recently had their Shepards Pie. Rarely have I... fantasized... about a dish; reminisced about their unique take on a classic. My wife, who lives abroad for a time, even stated that it was made better here than by our friends across the pond. We are excited to see this business grow and adapt their dishes more. As we are a multicultural household, we would love to see more Persian Cuisine take center stage on the menu. My only critique is that the cocktails could us a refresh."

We had a little difficulty finding good selections on the menu. Citrus pancakes sounded good, but they were out of them. The Bacon Beignets were the highlight, warm, freshly made and tasty. Reuben was good, with nicely salted corned beef and delicious German slaw. Pimento burger was too rich for my taste. Service was good. Overall experience was good. Would be 5 stars, but menu was not great for us. If you find things you like on the menu, then you should try it out."

However, it's laid back, chill atmosphere, and modern feel makes it a great spot for almost any occasion.  The food was pretty good. I did get something i could make at home. However everything was cooked nicely apart from the bacon. It was a little bit too charred for my taste. Potatoes were tasty, eggs standard, and the rye bread tasted more like a sour dough. But still good.   Mimosas were a good deal as well!   Overall we had a great time and most likely will return again!"

We were searching for some dog friendly spots and came across this gem! We sat on the front patio but when we left, we saw there was also a back patio that was a bit more lively! I also took a stroll around the inside and it has a super cool looking bar, great lighting and lots of seating. We loved our cocktails, apps and entrees. We had a Manhattan, Old Fashioned, and Pom of Your Hand and they were all delicious! We also had the shishito peppers as an app and I had their seasonal soup which was served in a nice cast iron bowl. My husband had the Shepard's Pie and was super impressed! I had the falafel burger and fries and it was super tasty and filling! Our server was very friendly and attentive and my husband thought it was great that she said \"awesome blossom\" since he said that's only the second person he has ever heard say that aside from me (where has he been?). Anyway, we want to come back soon and check out some more of the menu options and drinks! We highly recommend this spot that is dog, family, and happy people friendly!!!"

We came here because we found some good reviews on Yelp, but have to say I was a bit apprehensive about how long it's been since the last review posted for this place.   This restaurant seems to be a family go to place where people just eat and never care to leave a review.   This place a gem! We came in for an early dinner and were surprised by how good their food and drinks are.   I wasn't really found of the butternut squash soup but we were in the mood for trying so we did it.   I do recommend this place for anyone.  Specially if you are looking for food away from Downtown like us.   Enjoy!"

                "description": "The meal was much more attractive than it was delicious. Everything was fresh but lacked flair in the flavor department. This is the kind of place I would come to for dinner but I wouldn't bring anyone here to impress them or to treat them. I only say that because the impression of this place I got from the ambiance and the menu was that I would be in for a stellar meal. I ordered the Brie Burger believing the brie and the flavor profile would offer pizzaz but I was not razzle dazzled. It was just the feel of eating a better than average burger.  The carnitas poutine got me a little eager to taste more flavors as I had that to start.  It could have rivaled a couple of poutine offerings that I've had in Montréal aka the poutine capital of the world (sorry Quebec City).  I am happy that all the greens were fresh to round out the meals well.  I felt like portions and servings were well balanced.  If I lived in the area, I'd dine here again."

His service gets 5 stars (and we made sure his tip showed it). We started with the bacon beignets which were not really like beignets. They were crispy on the outside and more like cake donuts on the inside. Only got like two pieces of bacon in the whole serving.  The food came to the table very room temperature. My father had to send his biscuits and gravy back to reheat (no one wants congealed gravy). My mom and I got the boring breakfast plate. I asked for my eggs over medium and they definitely came fried hard. Also the house cured bacon was bland and extremely dry. My Aunt's chicken cacciatore pasta tasted good and we liked the strawberry pancake we ordered for the table a lot.  Overall, service was the highlight but the brunch options are not worth a second visit."

                "description": "First, this place is perfectly nice and probably worth going to again if I am back in the area but would easily be convinced to try something else.  My evening began with the Ancho Margarita.   Unlike some places this chili inspired drink isn't like drinking hot pepper juice and is delicious.    The fried cheese curds with ranch dressing were tasty but nothing particularly gourmet as a novice home cook could prepare this with the same results.     The disappointment came with the main meal.  The French fries were cold.   From our vantage point we could watch the kitchen workers.  They kept a big bowl of French fries that the kitchen leader would use to place portions on out going plates.   They rarely sitting it under a heat lamp, so they were cold and unmemorable.   This is probably the easiest and cheapest thing on the menu to prepare well.  The rest of the meal was perfectly ok, but noting that stuck out as particularly special.    The ambiance is nice, but extremely loud when there's a full house so you have to raise your voice to be heard across the table."

I would give it 5 stars but I can't bc of all the smoking. I smelled like cigarettes when we left after about 2 hours, and no one in my party smoked. This was my first (and unfortunately last) time here, so I was unaware.   Know b4 you go: -Dogs allowed on patio -Smoking allowed -Bring your own food or order from next door   -Great waitstaff   Overall, I won't be back due to the cigs, but that's a personal preference of mine. If you don't mind smoking, this is a good bar."

Except for a lack of delicious bar foods!   Although you can bring food into the restaurant, the selection around the area is a bit lackluster. Your only choices are a mediocre pizza place or Mexican cuisine. Brooklyn's pizza will probably be your go to dish if you do decide on italian. Their appetizers are not enjoyable for the value you'll be paying.   All in all, this place has a wide assortment of beverages and a nice place to unwind after a long day of work."

                "description": "Laid back atmosphere. Good beers/drinks. Nothing fancy, doesn't cater to one click or another. This location is new and they have it worked out fairly well. Only minor rub is that the outside patio gets direct sun, which is going to be a bit of bitch in the dead of summer, but for now it's fine. Outdoor bar, plenty of screens.  \"Jukebox\" (fancy MP3 player is nice). Allows you to bump something that is playing that isn't quite to your liking. Drink prices are fair for sure considering most watering holes are serving watered down and overpriced cough syrup.  This place is clean and seems well kept. The manager is almost constantly walking the place and fixing things. They went out of there way to find me an outlet to charge my phone.   Note: Pet friendly even having a water bowl for your four legged family as needed. Just please mind the leash, one guys dropped his momentarily to grab a beer and his dog tore through the kitchen/bar area, it was hilarious."

The management is beyond professional and they take time to hear opinions or just causally chat. The bar tenders are courteous and quick to serve.

The staff is also a big reason I keep coming back.  I just finished my first run through the Big 50 Club (50 different drafts) and there is more on tap than just those on that list.  Pretty cool!  They don't have food, but the pizza place next door delivers to your table--a slice, whole pie, salads, fries, chips n queso, wings, chicken fingers, subs, etc...so it's not only pizza.

To the juvenile waitress with an attitude: you're in customer service. That means you serve customers WITHOUT the massive chip on your shoulder. If you don't like your job, find something else to do, but DON'T take your mistakes out on your customers.  The waitress got our order wrong and pitched a massive attitude when we kindly asked her to fix it - it was a DIET COKE!!! Slammed the new drink on the table and didn't speak to us the rest of our stay there.  THEN denied it all when approached by my husband, who had to escalate the situation to a manager. Horrible, horrible, horrible. Grow up."

Could easily get their \"cocktails\" at the Bombshells down the road, with more of a kick and better attentiveness and service. The only reason I'm not leaving 1 star instead of 2 is because they don't care if you're drunk- they'll keep serving you! Lmao and the board games are a nice touch!"

                "description": "I've just come from the Alamo Drafthouse. I feel compelled to comment now on a couple of things that truly detract from my overall positive experience there.   First up is WHERE ARE YOU GLUTEN-FREE ITEMS?!?!? Even though you weren't top of the heap for GF fare, you offered at a few. Now, it's popcorn or candy and maybe the chips and queso. However, nothing is labeled GF. I do see many offerings labeled V. That's nice. You do offer a GF crust for pizzas. Yay. And that brings us to the second issue. Did someone complain that there wasn't any garlic in the marinara sauce? So to compensate for that the sauce is now garlic, with a touch of tomato? It's so strong! So the GF pizza crust is now a moot point since I cannot tolerate the killer garlic.  Lastly, I ordered the chicken tenders this evening, not GF, but I wanted something. What arrives are several enormous pieces of heavily breaded and heavily garlic-laced chicken. What is the deal? Remember when tenders were little strips of chicken? I gave up between trying to manage the huge chunks of \"tenders\" and the strong, garlicky flavor, and just ate the few fries on the plate.  I am not normally a ranter but, for the number of movies I see in a month using my Pass subscription, I am so disappointed that you are now pretty much ignoring a segment of your patrons, who only ask for options."

We went to see Ghostbusters Afterlife the Friday night after the premiere. Everything started out fine: we placed our drink and appetizer order before the show started. Got our mozzarella sticks and they were slightly underdone. Eh whatever, not a huge deal. Our beer and Bavarian Pretzel pizza were good, no complaints. However, the service not so much. On top of the fact our waitress took forever, she accused us of smoking in the theatre. I told her there was a vape cloud that came up on the row in front of us and I never saw anyone go talk to them. So maybe make sure you're accusing the right person next time. THEN our popcorn was burnt and we still got charged for it after letting them know. We'll keep going to Moviehouse in the future."

It wasn't exactly cheap ($150 for the rental, plus tickets and food/drink separately) but we missed movie theaters so much that we sprung for it. It was definitely worth it. The Alamo crew took so many precautions before and during our stay that although I was very anxious about the rental at first, I was able to relax and enjoy the show. Like others have said, all movie theaters are surely suffering right now and we need to support Alamo so that they're here when the pandemic is over. I love this theater chain so much, it'd be devastating for me personally if they were to close."

                "description": "The Alamo is awesome, and we've missed it a ton during the pandemic. But now that we have our vax, we decided to risk a super special outing -- we did a Your Own Private Alamo rental to celebrate a milestone birthday in the family. Just our inner circle, all by ourselves ... with a movie! And popcorn! And freakin' amazing buffalo cauliflower! In public, having our first normal-ish outing in over a year! Seriously, it was fun, and the Alamo took good care of us."

                "description": "I'm torn between nostalgia and the elevated level of service (and price) other theatres are offering.  This is classic Alamo.  It's like rediscovering your first car.  Fixed bar-style eating surface in front of the fixed seats, no leg rests or fully reclining seats.  The service was GREAT, albeit we were intentionally at a TERRIBLE horror movie (The Turning) that had maybe 10 people in the cinema with us.  Still, an employee could slack in that situation and they did not.    The screen and sound were good.    There was no lounge in the theater that I saw to relax and have drinks before or after the movie.    And, after many visits to other theatres, it was unusual not to have a button to press for service.  Rather, you physically put your order card up on the table for a server to see when they come by.  I was really concerned about this because I knew how bad the movie was going to be early on and drinks were part of the plan!! lol  But in retrospect, maybe having to physically check on the patrons is what made the service so attentive (I got the drinks I needed to get through the picture -- thank you, Jesus).  So, obviously I'm torn.  It is a retro experience for me having experienced my first dine-in theater at an Alamo. I would go back here again in a heartbeat.  But it is like getting in a classic car and then realizing you actually like modern bucket seats and power steering.  At the same time that classic car was less expensive and still brings a smile to your face.  I'm going to rank based on the model Alamo built and on fulfilling my memories of great service...and I'm looking forward to going back again! :)"

The drinks were tasty and strong enough. I wish I had known that the seats were so tight together, I would have left some space between myself and the occupants next to me. Other than that it was a nice experience!"

Secondly, they have the nicest staff, and their food is always delicious! If there's any issue, they handle it quickly and efficiently. They're also super clean, and have been really amazing with COVID protocols. I feel comfortable going back to the movies because of Alamo Drafthouse. Thanks for always going above and beyond!"

                "description": "My wife and I attended the Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring 3:00 p.m. showing at Lakeline Alamo on Saturday, March 27. It was our first public outing since last year before Covid-19 struck. We were excited and nervous to venture out, but trusted Alamo's protocols.  We walk into the theater and there is just one guy there, sitting a couple rows from the projector, American flag bandana for a mask sitting around his neck not covering his face, scrolling on his phone. He makes a couple calls and talks loudly, checking on his insurance apparently. He continues to do it halfway through the movie previews. My wife and I are already annoyed. Not a good start.  The movie begins and the guy behind us has been quiet for 10 minutes. Things seem to be turning for the better. That is, until a short while into the movie when he starts making comments aloud. \"No!\" to Gandalf leaving Frodo. \"Asshole!\" to Saruman betraying Gandalf. I grit my teeth and exchange glances with my wife as it continues, both of us hoping it subsides.  Nope. The loud asshole decides to keep making his commentary like it's his own personal screening. I finally have had enough of it about an hour into the film and place an order card that read \"Please tell the guy behind us to stop talking! He keeps doing it!\" The server comes five minutes later, takes it and nods. She does nothing.  Another 30 minutes goes by. This guy's behavior continues. He even plays a video on his phone for all to hear at one point. He's all I can focus on now, my enjoyment of the movie totally ruined. I storm out of the theater determined to get someone to kick him out.  I find a young guy with a pony tail who is clearly a server. I plea my case that this guy needs to go. He seems to take my request seriously and I return, hoping the Alamo's well-known policy of kicking out disruptors will finally be used on this guy ruining our movie.  Well, that wasn't the case. 10, then 20 minutes go by. I didn't see anyone come into the theater to handle it. The pest behind us makes comments aloud less frequently, probably because my wife yelled at him to shut up at one point. While I couldn't blame her for taking it into her own hands, I wanted the Alamo staff to do something about it like I know they should.  In retrospect, maybe it wasn't a bad idea because nothing was done to kick him out as I requested. The movie nears its end and the guy shouts again. Finally, we hear someone behind us address him, apparently letting him off with a warning. After all he had done throughout the course of the film to ruin the movie for us, it was far too little, far too late.  Amazingly, it actually worked that someone talked to him. He shut up for the 10 minutes left in the movie and didn't say anything during the cast reunion piece that followed the credits. So had the staff addressed this nuisance earlier like I wanted, perhaps this outing would have been salvagable. Mind you, I first brought it to the attention of the staff an hour into a THREE HOUR MOVIE. They finally say something to him with only 10-15 minutes left. Completely unacceptable, if you ask me.  Our server tells us shortly after one of her staff finally talked to the guy that she told a manager and that she was sorry the loud patron was like this. He seems \"a little 'special,' you know what I mean?\" is what she says. Whether that's true or not is frankly irrelevant. You have a policy in place that you remind patrons every single time they visit your theaters. No talking, no texting. Problem with a loud table? Raise an order card and a staff member will address it, eventually asking them to leave without a refund. Had this policy been followed as outlined, he should have been given a warning an hour into the movie and then instructed to leave without a refund 30 minutes later when I pleaded to the staff to take care of it. Case closed. The way it was handled in reality was an absolute joke and insult.  We were happy to attend this screening as our first outing. Now, after this incident, we will no longer give Alamo our business."

This is our second time for a family party and they rock! 45 minutes before the movie they have crafts for the kids (seems like usually 3-4 stations) and then they have an interactive dance or activity at the front of the theater immediately before the movie. It makes the movie an event for the kids.   Now if I could somehow watch a movie I want to see while the kids watched their cartoon!"

Even for a  vegetarian.  The best part of the experience for me is that people are told to turn off phones and be quiet. No one else is doing this and it is a thoughtful reminder.  Although some people don't quite get it and continue to talk, there was enough attention to keep the majority of chatter box's quite:-)"

Love to get there a half hour early and watch the pre-show entertainment. It's unique, nostalgic, and always funny. None of the advertisement bombardment you get at other theaters.   The food is always excellent   The 2x2 burger is my favorite and I've never been disappointed. It's a 5 star version of the Big Mac. The Colorado steak salad is also a regular favorite.   Drinks are always cold and the buttered popcorn with real butter is ridiculously delicious.   Awesome selection of adult beverages.   Love this place."

We were served pretty quickly. We loved the Pizza which was the Meat Pizza. It was hot and fresh. My wife was not a fan of the Chardonnay. My son thought his Pepperoni pizza was great and liked the Milkshake as well. We enjoyed the reserve seating. Just before the movie started we ordered some popcorn and a beer to split.   What cost them a star in my opinion was the Popcorn. It was really cold and without Salt or much Butter and taste like it was made at home. The main thing I like about the Movies is the Popcorn is always unbelievable. This was the opposite and was memorable for the worst reason. The other annoyance was the lack of under the table lighting when the bill arrived during the movie. I tried and quickly gave up so my wife finally figured out what we owed and paid in the dark. Not sure I have a fix just saying this is not good for older people with less then perfect night vision.  Definitely more to like than dislike here. We will be back."

                "description": "Delicious! The brisket and the pork belly were melt-in-your-mouth meat candy, exploding with smokey flavor. Yum!  The sausage was really good too, though I prefer more of a loose sausage like you'll get in some other central Texas BBQ joints. This was more firm but really good flavor.  I requested (fresh) jalapeños and sriracha in addition to the regular garnish of pickles, onions, and bbq sauce. The veggies were thick slices and the sauces flavorful. Plus two thick slices of white bread.  It was pricey, but any BBQ in Central Texas is. The differentiator here is the Vietnamese touches in the flavors and sauces. Two people in my party had banh mi and one had the King plate and they looked delicious too. Everyone in our party gave 5 stars for flavor, portion, and service.  Other notes: Decent parking. Good indoor seating, lots more outdoor seating. BBQ joint/bar vibe indoors, with notes of Vietnamese flair. Service was attentive and food came out quick.   Go visit Smoking Beauty and have a great meal."

The atmosphere of this establishment has a real ATX vibe as it blends central TX spirit with traditional Vietnamese cuisine. The mode last Saturday night was chill and as we walked in and were given a nod by the bartender. My companion ordered  a bozzy bobba shoot and another adult libation. I ordered a spiked tea cause \"baby, it's cold outside\". The drinks came out quick and were done right.   This is the type of place that is solid for good eats, a good time, a date night,  or to start off an evening of disorderly conduct.  #supportlocal"

We have been here a few times and love their food.    My favorite so far is the brisket banh mi and their potato salad. The brisket is smoked perfectly and the bread texture compliments the heartiness of the brisket well.  I love the fresh veggies they put in this!  The potato salad is hands down the best potato salad I have ever had at a restaurant. You have got to try this!!  We have ordered a few drinks in the past - they have a great Happy Hour.  You cant miss it - follow your nose to North Lamar and treat yourself."

Not saying that this wasn't an awesome meal, but I really wanted it to be something to write home about. And it just wasn't.   The banh mi sandwiches were very dry but the meat was insanely tender, though   lacking a lot of flavor. The cost is a little higher but the portion sizes are large and generous.   The real show stopper here though, is the bbq sauce. It's the right mix of Asian flavors and classic bbq sweetness.   It's worth the visit to see this take on two fairly different cuisines mashed together. But don't expect to be wowed away. It doesn't scream fusion to me, it just seems like they took some of the most popular parts of each cuisine and put them separately on the plate."

This Texas Tower looks intimidating but just roll up your sleeves, topple that thing over, and dive right in. The jalapeño sausage has some sneaky heat. Perfectly crispy hashbrowns with beautifully salted pork belly. Loved every bite.  We also shared the pork belly and brisket banh mi's and smokin fries. Most banh mi places we are quick to grab the Sriracha and Maggie's Sauce but not this time. It didn't even cross my mind until days after.  The brisket has the most amazing flavor and so moist. Almost a shame to lose it into anything else. But a perfect addition to any menu item.  Such warm and friendly owners and staff.   Parking was easy on a Sunday afternoon.  CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK FOR MORE!!!"

                "description": "I have had a hankering for this place for almost a year. I had seen it on the Food or Travel network, and it looked awesome. It seems like they have some sort of little drink or food special every day. On Wednesday, it was Whiskey and Wine Wednesday, with $2 off either beverage. My friend and I sat at the bar. The co-owner was bartending, and she is super friendly. She helped us with a couple of beer choices, as well as which Bahn Mi I was going to go with. We got the Smokin' Fries, the Brisket Bahn Mi, and the Smoked Pork Belly Bahn Mi. All of the food was amazing. Even after I felt like I couldn't eat another bite, I kept snacking away on those fries. This place has a great vibe, they are trying to work on managing the temperatures of outdoor seating for customers, and they have lots of little activities, like trivia and swing night, throughout the week. I will absolutely be back for brunch; I got to get my hands on that Leaning Tower of Texas."

                "description": "The high ratings for Smoking Beauty are well earned. Large portions of delicious, creative, well presented food; a variety of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages; the choice of indoor or outdoor seating with two separate outdoor areas, one covered and one open; varying table heights; great music played at a level to be noticeable without being intrusive, and attentive, friendly staff.  On my first of what will surely be many visits I came on a Saturday with my husband for a late lunch. There were a good number of people there including a small birthday celebration but with two outdoor areas and inside seating to choose from we were able to sit off on our own at a lovely table outside in front of the restaurant.  Having not had enough caffeine yet I was delighted by the Vietnamese drop coffee and was impressed that they accommodated my husband's order of part Coke and part carbonated water. He was clearly hungry and/or unprepared for the quantity of food and order both Bahn Mi and loaded fries. I chose the brisket hash off of the brunch menu which was so good I ate way too much of the generous serving. Several days later I am still thinking about how perfect the sweet potatoes and brussel sprouts were in particular.  I am looking forward to going back again later and trying one of their cocktails with my meal which are rumored to be too notch."

Then ordered the brisket banh mi, it was a really interesting taste lol... it just tastes like a banh mi with brisket slapped inside. It was pretty decent, pretty pricey though for what it is ($12). Make sure to order the green and bbq sauce for the banh mi! It gives it a little more flavor."

                "description": "Smokin Beauty is a fusion restaurant that combines Vietnamese and BBQ cuisine. They have lots of indoor and outdoor seating. They even have live music on some weeknights. You order at the bar counter and take your number to the table, and they bring out your food out to you. We sat outside, but the service was slightly lacking as we had go back into the restaurant for multiple items like silverware and napkins. The meat tasted good, I would favor the pork belly over the brisket- the bread was hard and crispy for banh mi. I definitely would view them more as a BBQ joint versus Vietnamese, although they do have some interesting drinks with Viet twists. Overall, a good place to go especially if looking for late night food. They have they own private parking lot as well."

                "description": "Came by on a Friday night to see a friend's band, the Lone Star Debonairs.  Also wanted dinner... and this is the second BBQ place I've been to in less than a week!  Smokin Beauty is in the Vietnamese area of North Austin, and is a Vietnamese/BBQ hybrid.  They're a small place but have good outdoor seating and parking, and the weather this Friday night was perfect for eating and dancing.  The food: I ordered their brisket and pork belly salad with a creamy cilantro dressing.  The brisket had nice smoke and a good bark, and the pork belly was soft without being mushy or all fat, and really lightly flavored, showing off the meat.  Fresh, crisp veggies made it perfect  They also have Banh Mi on the menu, and a Viet BBQ plate with Texas BBQ and Viet vegetables."

                "description": "Smokin Beauty fuses Texas barbecue with Vietnamese cuisine. I popped in for the Double Fantasy Bahn Mi (brisket and pork belly). Served on a crunchy, fresh baguette, the meats were perfectly smoked and flavorful, and the pickled vegetables were crisp and colorful. If you prefer a bit of added heat, ask for jalapeños and sriracha. I also tried the slaw which was fresh and bright with Asian flavors.  There is plenty of seating outside. The decor inside is plenty nice with dark wood decor. The restaurant sports a full bar. This is such a great little neighborhood spot."

I told her we always carry mail past the pits and always wanted to try it. I ordered the brisket banh mi with potato salad as well as an happy hour cocktail. My friend got a two meat plate with slaw and potato salad. The salad was incredible, we both agreed. He loved the pork belly so much!  For the price point, it was absolutely worth it! Discussing the passion Matt and Tao have for opening this business during a pandemic is inspiring nonetheless. Stop on by!"

                "description": "Smokin Beauty takes the best of both worlds by combining traditional Viet style of cooking with American BBQ to give you a fusion you didn't know you needed... until now. You can find items such as the:  - Brisket Bánh Mì: I enjoy the twist of smokey, fatty flavors from the brisket as well as the creamy cilantro and soy sauce that it comes with. The fries are amazing, too! $13.95 (4.5/5)  - Leaning Tower of Texas: a brunch special that is a stack of 3 hash browns, brisket, jalapeño cheddar sausage, pork belly, sambal hollandaise (sambal is like chile peppers), and bánh mì veggies - this is a lot more filling than it looks, I definitely would suggest you share it. I thought it was pretty good. $23.75 (4/5)  - Pho Queso: you read that right, they take veggie pho broth and mix it in with melted cheese to give you a unique take on queso. The pro here is that it's vegetarian friendly, but the con is that the flavor is a bit faint and I wish they would use a beef pho base instead. It's still good however! $7 (3.5/5)  Overall, this is a great spot to visit if you're craving BBQ, but also want to try something different. They have an outdoor patio if you prefer to sit outside. They also have awesome customer service and the prices are good too. With that said, I give them a 4.25/5."

Spaces for curbside pickup was clearly marked so it was super easy to find.  Great food and location. We got the shrimp scampi, prime rib, kids meal mac n cheese. Food was very good and quality is consistent with the many previous times I went to BJ's.  Curbside pickup was super quick and efficient. Within 10min of requesting food taken out to our car, they had a person out with food. All correct and complete."

There food is good but service is terrible and attitudes of the staff aren't friendly. Needless to say if you have a party of 15 people don't come here. They don't do reservations even though when you call you they say the will save a table you will have to wait a hour then have to be seated in two separate tables because the cut servers early knowing there's a huge party coming in. Then bring out food late and to the wrong table and other tables arriving after receiving there stiff prior and all at once. Most of us received meals at the time others ordered and got dessert. Then some of are meals were over cooked/cold or missing items because they ran out with no substitutions. The server was extremely defensive and the manager walked by hearing all the chaos didn't say a word. Sadly I worked at bjs when I was young they gave standards for service you are taught. That's completely gone out of the window when corporate won't even contact you back.    Update: We received a email that someone from corporate will be reaching out around the 16th still nothing from them two weeks later!!"

                "description": "Would give 0 stars if I could, but today I went to BJ's with my family and after an hour of waiting we get called to our table..  As we're waiting to be seated, a member from our party recognizes an employee from outside of work, Alexis, (1). As Alexis is preparing the table across the restaurant, a member from our group tells me how she doesn't like Alexis due to personal reasons outside of work. We ask the blonde hostess (2) to make sure she isn't our waiter, she responds and tells us Alexis is a a host so it won't be a problem. Cool.. As we continue to have our PRIVATE! conversation the blonde hostess is standing there, listening in, and shortly goes to her Alexis.... Alexis approaches us and tells us very rudely in front of the other guests.. \"I'm not going to seat people who have attitudes, our customers don't have attitude, if y'all have a problem y'all can leave\" then walked away...we asked to speak to her manager but before we can even get a word out she went straight towards the kitchen and ignored us.. (Blonde hostess says she can seat us immediately after creating the problem)   The manager (3) approached us, said she will handle the situation and talk to her employee..  As we're waiting for our food, eating and all, we have members of the host stand pointing at us, staring at us, clearly telling other coworkers about the situation and handling it very unprofessionally, making us feel very uncomfortable.   We finish eating and begin to walkout, as we walk out we see both hostess, manager, and hostess boyfriend(4) standing at the podium by the entrance/exit as we walk by, the boyfriend(4) says \"assholes\" under his breath AS THE MANAGER AND STAFF MEMBERS ARE RIGHT NEXT TO HIM! The manager was neglectful about her employees comments and continued on with her conversation. I AGAIN had to talk to the manager about her employee's behaviors and at this point I'm LIVID!! She(3) proceeds to respond by saying she will \"handle the situation\", shes cutting me off as I'm trying to explain why I'm upset, which causes me to get more upset and use the type of vulgar language that was used RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER upon me and my family by her employees.. she's telling us to get out, she put her hands on me to try to push me out. I responded and told her I was already leaving and not to put her hands on me. As this dispute with the manager was going on Alexis is behind the manager proceeding to run her mouth by saying \"you better watch it, you better watch yourself\"...  Im just shocked by how poorly and unprofessional some of these people are and how they handled this. Im in the food service, been here for 6+ years and don't see how ANY OF THISSS is tolerated in this restaurant..In the restaurant I work at, scratch that, AT ANY OTHER RESTAURANT none of this would have been acceptable behavior! But it seems from old reviews that it's a reoccurring problem that corporate doesn't care to fix ‍‍"

                "description": "Never again! It's been years since I last ate at BJs and now I remember why smh. This meal was horrible, if negative stars were possible that would be my rating. Ordered the \"slow roasted\" tri-tip and it was the toughest cut of meat I've ever encountered so this piece must have been \"rush roasted\". The overall flavor of the meat would have been pretty decent if the meat were actually edible. Also ordered the fettuccine alfredo, comes with chicken and broccoli. Not bad but oddly tastes exactly like a Marie Callendar's TV dinner so at this point I'm convinced they purchased a family size dinner, warmed it, placed in their own packaging then sprinkled some Parmesan on top. Normally, I'd just take the loss but in this case I want my money back, this is just unacceptable."

Half of the menu is always missing and the staff is constantly being replaced, what means we usually have to explain things to the attendants. I'm really sad to see the way it's moving to."

                "description": "Went here with my family for dinner for the Thursday $15 special (Half-rack ribs or tri-tip steak + 2 sides + pizookie) around 7. It took around 30 minutes to get seated which was understandable since they were pretty understaffed. I got the house salad with blue cheese dressing and tomato bisque soup as my sides. Both were pretty tasty although nothing super special. Portion sizes were really great though and could've been enough for dinner for me without the steak. I would definitely recommend coming for the Thursday special if you're looking for a good deal!   My family only ate one of the pizookies and got the other three to go. Our server Elias was very thoughtful and packed the ice cream and the mousse in separate containers from the pizookies to prevent them from getting soggy. I appreciated Elias providing great service despite the restaurant being understaffed."

                "description": "So underwhelming. First the waitress had a \"smart ass\" attitude when asked about the size of portions. I did not appreciate this. The entrees were all barely warm and cool to the touch. Within a few minutes we were eating cold food. The $17 Alfredo bowl was dry and cold. The garlic knot was cold. The hamburger was tasteless despite having fried jalapeños and chipotle Mayo. The meat needed seasoning. The fries, although tasty, were cold. The tea had a strange bitterness to it. They probably need to clean out their machine. The only thing palatable were the avocado egg rolls as I love the tamarind sauce. They were piping hot. We got 2 orders for a total of 12 costing $26. We should've stopped there. In the end the manager did comp the Alfredo but for high prices and below par food and service I'd say go elsewhere. BTW we loved BJ's when we lived in McAllen (this location was epic!) so this experience was very disappointing."

                "description": "My boyfriend and I visited Bombshells on St. Patrick's Day evening in pursuit of having a few drinks and something good to eat. Upon arrival, the parking lot was packed so we thought that was a sign we would have a good time. The hostess told us it would be a 30-35 minute wait. We were seated in a booth after 20-30 minutes. I ordered the Pearl Harbor per the waitress's recommendation and he ordered an Old Fashion. Our drinks took a while because apparently they only had one bar back helping the bartenders. After taking a few sips of my drink, I noticed all I tasted was pineapple juice. I'm not a heavy drinker, but I do want liquor in my cocktail when I order one; it tasted like straight juice. Also, my boyfriend's drink was DISGUSTING. It tasted horribly bitter, not at all smooth and tasty like the Old Fashions he usually gets elsewhere. Regarding food, we ordered chips and queso that tasted stale and the salsa that came with it was watery AS HELL. I was so unimpressed with their menu that I didn't even order anything else. My boyfriend ordered wings and fries for us to share. By the time that came out, the waitress had brought us someone else's wings so she had to take it back and bring the correct one. Like everything else, the wings were nothing to be desired. I don't even think I ate any fries; I was just ready to leave. We barely ate the wings and didn't even take them to go. I guess they didn't have any bussers because there were so many empty, dirty tables around and people steadily coming in to be seated. The best thing Bombshells had going for it was the music. It was also a very diverse crowd: old, young, Black, white, Hispanic, gay, straight, couples, singles, friends, families, everybody. Hence the 2 stars. It's a shame because the vibe is there and the space of the place is really nice but our first impression of it left us feeling like we wasted our time and money. Therefore, we don't recommend it and won't be returning."

I'm not sure if she was family of someone working there, but it was awkward that they let her ask for money and since she never left the table we felt pressured to donate money to her with no idea who she was or if she was actually using the money for the purpose she said. Other than that, everything was great!"

We we're seated finally. Then after about 10 min with no drink order taken from us, a waitress goes to a table where a gentleman was just seated, sat down with him and started taking his order. He wa seated righ next to us. We got up to leave and let the manager know why we were leaving and she acted like she could care less. Have never tried the restaurant out and I can assure you we never will. Good luck with business. You're gonna need it with the staff you have. Sorry I can't rate the food."

I went on Saturday at about 11:00 this place had about 10 girls 2 at the front talking while I'm waiting to get seated , which took (5 min) for the girls to even come back from where they were at . So I finally got to the both still not being serviced properly. I waited 30 minutes before I got up and went to the front and asked \" So IS ANYBODY GOING TO SERVICE ME\" ?

                "description": "It was a pretty pleasant Sunday evening for me. I got out of work after being positively complimented throughout the day, just feeling pretty damn fucking good today. I decided to take a nap, then of course decided to get food to celebrate my day. I went on to take a nice hot shower, freshened myself up, and went out for food.   Initially, I was planning on going to Cheddar's but that wait time there was way too long. We're talking 45 minutes. I haven't eaten all day by the way. You know what was close by though? Bombshells. What was the wait time? 5-10 minutes. I wondered why but I didn't question it. It's kind of like when you need to take a shit, and you're just hoping to go to a nice restroom. Anyway, I was pretty surprised.  There was a younger woman who was the waitress our table. First thing she asked was the drinks we wanted. \"Three waters please.\" I was then asked for my card right away which was fucking weird as shit as I didn't receive any food yet, nor did I get an order placed for food. I just sat there and started to ponder a bit. We get the waters but no offering of a straw for our waters, which I also thought was odd. Not really working out the way I'd like for my first time actually dining in.   NASCAR was on for a bit on the TV monitor screen, and then it changed to Women's soccer for the Summer Series (GO USA!). We finally get an order in. I ordered the Grilled Tilapia entree with Alfredo sauce smothered on, steamed broccoli, and Spicy Mac 'n' Cheese. The thing was that the poor waitress didn't even know that there was an option to top the tilapia with Alfredo sauce and shrimp. She mistook it that I wanted to do two different dishes. I'm just like, \"I can guarantee something will be wrong.\" I kept quiet for a bit because I was pretty annoyed.  The food comes out. No shrimp on my dish. Eh, fine. I proceeded to eat the food and it was pretty decent. I liked the Alfredo sauce a lot. The Spicy Mac 'n' Cheese was okay at best. The steamed broccoli was good. I noticed one thing the entire hour being there--I've never once was asked for a refill on my drink, nor were we properly catered to with the courtesy of asking how everything was during the feasting of the food. I'm now really annoyed and frustrated.   The more I noticed things, I observed other tables and waitresses actually having an interaction with each other. The waitress at my table could have given two fucks about my guests and I. Cold shoulder was given to us several times, with the same waitress kissing the asses of the table served behind me to patrons that came in after we did. She was also missing for extended periods of time.  Little did she know, I actually am a frequent high-tipping gentleman with a whole lot of damn money to blow. Sadly though, she dropped the ball highly. I guess it could have been the way I looked or the stereotype that I may not be worth the time to serve--who the hell knows? What I do know is that I was still nice enough to offer a 15% tip even after all of the shitty service provided. I was thinking about stiffing her but thought to myself, \"I think she is new, and they've probably thrown her to the wolves.\" Mind you, we had to let her know that the ticket was wrong. That shouldn't be something on our end to do but we did because we knew something was already wrong to begin with. First impressions are EVERYTHING, baby.  I'll make it known that having a pretty face ain't going to cut it in a face-to-face customer service field. That has to be backed up with a great demeanor, capability, efficiency, eagerness to perform on the job, and always a solid first impression. This young lady needs to be trained more, and I think it's at the fault of the actual restaurant not properly training staff that I'm seeing all of these shit reviews about the service alone. My ass got to experience that instead of the positive side.   I'm extremely disappointed and just hope Bombshells fixes their BS quickly. This restaurant can be more than just the typical chain, especially if it was better ran with its employees. I don't fault the waitress for not knowing better because for all I know--this can be her first serving gig. However, this spot missed the mark highly. Easily, I'm a customer that can bring numerous guests with me, ordering items on tickets of several hundreds of dollars a sitting quite easily. Not going to happen now after all of the mishaps this evening. I'd rather drink bleach.  .5 stars/5 Stars: Absolute abomination. I certainly doubt that I would ever come back to this spot. I would rather serve life in prison in Angola than come back to this spot."

First of all I guess they didn't get the memo that we are in a pandemic since the rent a cops weren't wearing mask or enforcing the rule to   customers coming in and out of the establishment.  They were to worried about flirting with the waitresses.  I get it..they are kind of cute but come on..do your job!  Also there were about 9 of them working last night and only three were wearing their mask correct or even at all.  The bartender had hers around her neck the whole time while breathing directly over your food...smh..very disappointing. The wings themselves were okay but nothing to go back for.  I will be going to a place that the employees know how to actually wear a damn mask."

Also the batter that the pickles were fried in was pretty gross. The chicken wings tasted like they were barely seasoned. Drea our server was awesome and had a lot of patience because I know the group I was with was definitely annoying. The bartender was also cool. The drinks snuck up on everyone because at first everybody thought they tasted watered down and then all of a sudden they felt it (lol).

Got seated and literally waited there for 15 minutes and still no server. I walked down to where the kitchen was, poked my head in and said hey can we get a server for our table. A girl came by afterwards and asked did she(the unknown server) come by yet we said no. Five more minutes went by and my brother had to yell at a server to come over and serve us. She was nice enough to do it considering she wasn't are Initial server. We order all our stuff drinks and food at the same time. Btw the drinks were very weak tasted like juice and syrup. I ordered the Philly cheesesteak which was nothing to brag about. My brother told the server it was my moms birthday so she offered to buy her a shot. When it was bill time my brother asked for the manager to come over to explain why we had to wait so long and to at least cut the bill down for waiting so long. She said the birthday shot was considered the \"freebie\" and that she talked to the server and that was it. No apology no nothing . I will never visit this place again. They didn't deserve my money or time !"

After that, it took another 15 minutes to get our drinks. After we ordered our food, that took another 30 minutes to come out and when it did come out, my food was missing. The waitress didn't say anything so I figured that they were still making it. Only after 15 more minutes passed by and the waitress finally came back did she ask where my food was to which I responded that I had no idea. She then went back to the kitchen and after about 15 more minutes, my food came out. While everyone was eating, they found that my nephews chicken was raw and we had to bring up that issue as well.   The manager ended up coming out and taking my food and my nephews food off the ticket but it was still a very terrible experience. I wouldn't recommend going here to anyone."

                "description": "I've lived in the area since 2001 and have been going to Moon Dance for my adult beverages for years. If you're looking for hard liquor, take a look a their selections. If you are looking for beer or wine, go somewhere else. They used to have a good stock of specialty, quality beer and wine. For example, they used to have a good selection of micro-brewery beers, but now storied brands like Pabst Blue Ribbon seem to be the taking up most of the shelf space. The quality of wines have slid as well. My last visit there a couple days ago for Rieslings resulted in looking through a selection of less than 10 choices, all of which I was unfamiliar. The recommendations by staff resulted in two bottles ... one of which had lovely hints of chemicals and gasoline (lots of TDN; obviously a late harvest grape that had decomposition of the veins within the grape) ... and the other bottle offered notes of cat pee ... absolutely disgusting cheap, creamy crap. MD 20/20 would be a step up. I'd like to support my local business, but I'm quite done ... no more ... I'll make the trip across town to Total Wine from now on."

                "description": "I usually shop at Spec's. I realize small liquor stores' prices are going to be higher than Spec's, but this is a little ridiculous. The exact same bottle that always costs me $17.29 at Spec's cost me $25.97 here. That's $8.68 more...over 50% higher! How much are you willing to pay for convenience? Since my office is right near a Spec's, I will continue to plan ahead and enjoy the 33% savings. If you are willing to pay the \"convenience fee,\" I will say this store was nice inside (like a Twin Liquors) and the guy at the counter was very friendly. My only complaint is the prices, but that determines where I shop. I'm a frugal person."

I went in, picked up what I wanted and headed to the counter.  Once there I was questioned about a bottle of peach ciroc.  I told the guy I never touch any ciroc, but he insisted I did over and over again.  A few minutes later a few other fellas walked up to the counter and he realized he had made a mistake.  I would have been ok with this if it were not for the way the clerk presented himself and kepting insisting it was me who picked up the bottle.  I was being accused of stealing a bottle of liquor wearing shorts and a pull over sweat shirt.  Where I could of concealed the bottle is a mystery to me.  Once he realized he was wrong he made a weak apology and continued on.  I will never visit this store again!  Just unacceptable..."

The place is small, but the food is totally awesome !!! They have a great menu selection. Mrs. Texas had a Greek salad which she loved and fried ravioli which she also loved. My son had the Greek delight pizza which he loved, and I had the Mexican delight which I loved and rated it as Slap Yo Momma Good !!! We will definitely be back !!! The place was the clean and the staff was super friendly. Worthy of a bookmark and a try if you're passing through, or if you live or work nearby. I wish they would open up a location in the new strip center by the new HEB in Liberty Hill !!!"

The sauce has good flavor and it was delivered really fast. Very close to New York pizza but the crust is a little thicker! When it arrived, I was pleasantly surprised to see that it looked 10x better than the pizza in some of the other pictures. I think because my slices were jumbo, that they are a bit thinner than their other pizza (which I love)"

It took 14 minutes from the time I ordered till the time it is ready even though they were very busy!  The quality of this pizza is amazing I was very very surprised they also have other items such as wings and whatnot.  I suggest if you're in the area it's a must have if you're in the mood for pizza."

                "description": "I consider myself sort of a pizza connoisseur and could eat it several times a week. I like to make homemade pizza from time to time as well and always like trying new places. I told my husband I was tired of getting pizza from the same places and wanted something new. This restaurant has almost all good reviews and they tout being voted best pizza in Round Rock. I really don't understand why. We got two kinds of pizza and two appetizers. The pizza was undercooked and you could still see the shredded cheese which was not fully melted. Flavor and quality was not great either. Definitely not legit NY style pizza. The garlic knots have no noticeable taste of garlic due to all the other herbs they put on them. Service was fine, but disappointed based on how many people think this is the best pizza. Based on reading other reviews, I am Expecting a rebuttal from the owner in 3, 2, 1...."

                "description": "I wanted to order pizza from a different place and decided to give this place a try.  I ordered on a Friday and they were def busy cause my pizza arrived late.  Once the pizza arrived it was piping hot so hot that when we took one slice of pizza all the toppings started coming off.  So we let it cool down I love the crust I have to say it was very crunchy my kids enjoyed their pizza. The other thing I loved was the sauce yummy very fresh almost like home made.  The only thing I did not like about the philly cheese steak pizza was that it fell apart.  The pizza in general has a good amount of topping and ratio for each slice.  Overall not bad I may try something else next time but my kids pizza was good"

I guess they were busy and their air conditioning was out so I guess Monday specials and beer were out too.  The pizza was good, but I felt it was overpriced.  The wings were okay (not as crispy as I'd like), didn't care for the blue cheese much or warm celery/carrots."

For $20, I felt that was a great deal. I did feel it was a little pricey to add extra toppings on the pizza. I ordered it from my house which was about 15 minutes away and when I arrived everything was ready to go and bagged up waiting for me. A guy brought it out to my car curbside and made sure I had a mask on, which I appreciated for his health and mine. Everything was still hot when I got home and the pizza and wings were devoured quickly. I ate the chicken caesar salad the next day and it was tasty and fresh as well. Would recommend trying this local pizza shop!"

                "description": "Food is good here. We've really  enjoyed the lemon pepper wings! Well, service here isn't consistent. One day my spouse and I walked in to dine in there and service was awesome. The polite, welcoming male told us to have a seat and they'd take our order. We came back days later(to dine in)  and the tables were dirty, it wasn't very busy btw. We sat down looked at the menu. 10 minutes pass and no one helped us AT ALL. they didn't talk to us, acknowledge us. So I went up to just order while everyone stood around. I'm not sure what the process is here ?? But they sure as heck weren't going to come to us.  Well, as I ordered I felt so uncomfortable and as if our presence was an inconvience. 2 other times during this SAME week ( separate days) i walked in to order pretty large orders for my kids final days of school. Similar service was given. No one bothers to greet you and one of the workers said he'd help us when he had a chance. Ok sure, yeah we waited. Lol no biggie I guess?   Long story short we enjoyed the food and spent a lot of money here in just one week but eh the service here convinced me not to come back. Good food, inconsistent rude staff simple as that."

Inside, there are also ping pong tables . There is a coffee shop within the same building.  Next to here is a brewery that you can also get beer from. There is the Spicy Boys food truck on site for snacks while you drink. I think it's a good place to check out if you like ciders and are in the area.  The bartender the day we visited was very friendly and explained the different ciders they have on tap."

                "description": "Support. Your. Local. Cideries.  I'm not even that gung ho about ciders, but a lot of my girlfriends are. I'm so glad we stopped by Fairweather. It's very laid back, intimate, and relaxing with its clean aesthetic. Down in South Atx, we have Texas Keeper (awesome cidery, very different fireflies-on-the-porch and farmside vibes), so it was nice to see a completely different cidery with literally garage-space, elevated, and hipster vibes.   We both got cider flights, and loved the diversity of selections. Their ciders are all hilariously named (Fuccboisen is my favorite...I should've ordered that). I enjoyed their Smell the Van and EZ Tea (it truly tastes like tea!). The EZ tea was so delicious. Quenches thirst, subtle, and very honey-like. Their ciders aren't sickeningly sweet, and the flights give you a great little taste of all of the ciders that you're curious about but are unsure about getting a whole pint of. Their inventory has a clean design too. Their tees are super adorable, as well as their BEVERAGES sweaters. Tempting.  Service was wonderful. Our cider taptender was a wonderful man who was very sweet, knowledgeable and welcoming. The space is small, so it's not recommended you come here with a huge group (unless you plan on taking up the entire space. They have strong wifi, serve-yourself water, and different styles of seating from regular tables to taller barstools. They have little succulents on the table along with a well-designed menu for their \"specials\" deals. I would usually go to 4th Tap next door, but why not do both and hit up Fairweather too?"

This cidery has really good drinks and hosts Austin FC watch parties. Fairweather also has partnered with Spokesman Coffee if someone in your group wants a coffee! If you're here at 11am, which would you pick? Why not both? Good vibes, good music, and a great atmosphere.  Bartenders are super friendly. I like it here! Check out 4th Tap and the pizza truck outside as well!"

                "description": "I usually am not a fan of cider...at all! But, after some friends who are also beerdrinkers suggested this place and that it wasn't your typically overly-sweet cider (which is what I have the aversion to) suggested this place, I decided \"why not?\".  The vibe here is super chill and the cider-barista was super nice and everyone there chimed in when I asked about the diff ciders they were offering.   So I will say, while I am still not on the cider bandwagon (I mean beer will always be my first love), the ciders here were actually drinkable! I enjoyed that they were on the drier side so your mouth isn't annihilated by chocolate and you can actually appreciate the different flavor components of each one! I will also give them kudos for actually packing a little bit of a punch w/the abv, which you don't usually see with ciders either!  Definitely enjoyed the vibe and the concept here!"

                "description": "So many good things to say. I first and foremost am not a cider guy. Came in here on a referral from a friend and was surprisingly impressed with the operation. The cider was good they had some crisp ciders that came off more like a beer if that's what you need. My favorite was the blood orange or the pear. Still a toss up between the two. Also this place has some crazy good wines. They are cheap for a much better quality compared to the ones you get in most stores. They had football running great AC for that Texas heat. Best of all they allow dogs! When I came in my novice skills when drinking wine and ciders were put aside by the owner who gave me a great understanding and tour of his selections. The staff are all super friendly too!  There are no downsides to this place. Except for the hangovers. (Mostly self inflicted) I recommend Sundays. For your visit. There is a cool little coffee shop inside too. Nervous Charlie's was serving up brunch. Soo many good combinations outside of your regular mimosa routine. Do yourself a favor. You are not too cool to break away from your traditions to try this place.  In regards to the cider snobs leaving bad reviews. They obviously didn't come here for something new. Why would you want to go somewhere that copied someone else? Boring.... wish they could get more stars."

It all started with a long wait for barbecue and a guy wearing a cidery shirt/hat. A quick google search later I dragged my family to this tap room so I could get a cider fix (having spent five years in the PNW it is a tough itch to scratch here in TX). The bartender/coowner was extremely friendly and ready to answer all questions. He was adorable and alone was reason enough for a follow up visit.  My sister and I had a flight of their four ciders on tap. Currently:  Common: base for all other cider, ACTUALLY DRY. In lurv Tejano dreams: green chile cider, bomb af. Strong pepper aroma and beautiful subtle Chile flavor. Nelson sauvin (I think).... very strong hop flavor forward with sweet cider finish. A good balance for people seeking hop flavor while trying to expand to cider. huell melon: hop flavor is SO subtle that it almost tastes like sour fruit flavor. I LOVED this cider. I can't wait to try it again.  Opens only Fri-Sun this is definitely a stop to add to your weekend plans. There are big things coming for this cidery. I can't wait to watch them grow.  I loved this cidery and cider and definitely recommend to anyone in the area."

                "description": "I really love Fairweather's concept and having a new addition to Metric Row that isn't another brewery! (Love to y'all breweries, though.)  I came here the day after opening day with a few friends who love cider (I'm indifferent) to try out their brews. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised!  We each ordered a flight of their four ciders on tap. One was the Common, which is the base for all their ciders. Another was one of my favorites even though it involved a little heat from some peppers! The last two were hopped ciders, and the bartender/co-owner told us if we tried them first in different orders, we may like one over the other. He was right, both both were delightful.  I want to give a five-star review to support a new business, but my only tiny complaint would be the fruit flies. Some kept buzzing about here and there, but you can only imagine they want to get a taste of this dry cider sweetness!  If you're a beer person like me, you may have found a new hangout for your friends who don't love beer as much as you. But you'll still enjoy what Fairweather has to offer -- so much so, I ordered a 12-oz pour of my favorite hopped cider after my flight!  Good luck, guys, and congrats on your opening!"

I digress, this review is about the awesome family who started Fairweather (super friendly and knowledgeable).  I bought their cans of Common and was blown away.  Cideries claim to have dry cider all the time, but it's not TRULY dry.  Common though was legit.  These guys are making a truly BONE DRY English style cider from apples sourced from the PNW.   It's not perfect yet, but you can taste the potential. It reminds me of Shacksbury.  The fun artwork on the can intrigued me to go check out this spot that was just a few minutes drive away.  The tasting room is TINY! Start small and dream big! Kuddos to them for turning a cold warehouse space into a fun modern hipster community watering hole.  On a Friday night, get here early to even find a spot to sit!  I arrived around 5:30pm and sat at a high table outside and had no line.  By 7pm, people were crowded elbow to elbow, with a long line.  There also is very limited parking.  Be prepared to take time to find a spot and walk.  When they state they are pet friendly they mean it. Not only was my furry friend chilling with others, we were soon joined by a parrot!  I had a great time. I had come by myself, but ended up having several great conversations with people I had never met before.  Truly this place is only months old, and has quickly become a new neighborhood hang out.  The ciders are all 6.5%.  You can enjoy a flight of 4x4OZ for $10, enjoy a glass, or enjoy a guest cider or something from Austin Winery. I love the local support for other local liquid makers. There is a wide range of ciders to choose from.  They have some fun experimental ciders that were not like anything I have tried before.  It's hard to choose just four for a flight.  They have their staples- Common, EZ TEA, and Tejano Dreams, but also some Dry Hopped Ciders, and fruit ciders. My favorites were Tejano Dreams (nice kick), Gin Bot, and Dr. Rudi."

                "description": "If you like dry ciders, this place is for you. The Tejano Dreams is my favorite. They also have wine if you are not into cider.   Place is a little small. You can get a flight or by the glass. If you are usually a beer drinker or new to ciders, they will definitely let you try a few so you can find your favorite.   If you are hungry, there are usually food trucks at 4th tap and they let you bring food in. It is not officially dog friendly but sometimes they have a table outside when the garage is open."

                "description": "Fairwheather cider was definitely a surprise and a hidden gem. It's a very small location but it is in the burnet brewing scene, as it's located right next to 4th tap. Their cider is so amazing with fusions with sweet tea, gin, wine and different fruits, it'll definitely give you a pleasant experience you may not have been expecting. They also have so many more flavor options than what they offer in the store so id go to the cider for more options. You can also take pictures in front of the interesting wall art with the unicorn things going on."

                "description": "This taproom has a very minimalistic and industrial aesthetic that makes it a perfect place to catch up with a friend. It's quite small, but there was ample seating when I was there. Their cider is different from most of the dry ones I've had before - my favorite was the common with citrus-y flavors. The Apple flavor wasn't as strong as I was expecting (or used to with other ciders), and maybe that's just the case with a \"true\" dry cider. It tasted almost like a wine, which is great if you're a wine lover, I suppose!"

If that's not a problem for you, then you're in for a good time.   We came in on a Tuesday night and easily found a pool table to ourselves. We opened a tab and had no trouble getting drinks without having to leave our games. The mixed drinks are nothing to write home about, but we had an excellent time drinking and playing pool. We also easily played some table shuffle board. They have computer slots/keno games to gamble with in a shady corner is that's something you're into.   The place was acceptably clean and the staff were all very friendly. Just make sure you have a VALID drivers license regardless of your age! This was place was a good time and I'll definitely be back again in the future."

                "description": "Came in on a Thursday, some aggressive lady with glasses and bun, answers the door with \"Do y'all have ID's?\" We said yea and showed ours, then she says \"So then talk to this dude at the door\"... I walk in and there's a table with some merchandise on it and this little man, asked if we were there for the event? I said \"we didn't know there was an event\" and then he said it was $25 per person... well we didn't know, we just came for a drink and some parents night out. So I said sorry and we excused ourselves and then this same lady at the front was smoking outside so I said \"Sorry, we didn't know it was an event\" and she snarkily says \"Yeah! it's dwarf wrestling!\" Like I should be ashamed of not knowing this. I feel stupid, my bad.... But maybe next time have a sign on the door! We read the entire door and no sign about this, a cover of $10-15 we would pay but we didn't want to do $25 per person, since we had not  arrived for the event. I think if you have an event, try being a bit nicer. Some people are not regulars and just want to come over and you could sell it a bit, instead of making us feel bad for not know about your poorly advertised event.  I still like this bar and I like that people can smoke in doors (although I'm not a smoker) we have enough bars we can go too and this one is for smokers, so I don't have an issue and I know what I'll smell like when I leave."

When I got home everything smelled like cigarettes. This is completely illegal and just downright nasty. Everybody knows secondhand cigarette smoke is really bad for you so open up a flipping window if you're gonna let people smoke. If you're too lazy to go outdoors to smoke then this place should be regulated by the health department better, this isn't your house, and no one saying you can't do something but it's just nasty and it's really bad for your health right now my throat is on fire because I've been breathing secondhand smoke I don't wanna sound like a whiner or entitled millennial but it secondhand smoke dude and it's nasty."

Staff has always been good to me over the years, and have been like family, met many current friends because of Shooters. Never a cover, and probably the best drink prices of any bar.  This place has great potential, but they need to make the best of some of its best assets, especially the use that beautiful patio more for events, music, etc. You should have a solo acoustic artist out there in spring/summer/fall and promote some games on the patio, it just seems as it's used as wasted space currently, and that's a shame."

                "description": "Stopped by with others for a quick pop as we were beered out from Whitestone's delicious Oktoberfest beer. Bartender was patient with us as we pondered our last cocktail of the day. Notice I said day not evening. We settled on shots (why not??!!). We all received generous pours at a reasonable price.   Shooters is a great sports bar with multiple TVS (they do have the NFL ticket). There are plenty of pool tables and games to keep you occupied. I would definitely come here to watch games but the cigarette smoke stench is too much for me, and I'm a cigar smoker. We visited for about 10 minutes and my clothes stunk of smoke. I wish they would go smokeless like their other venue on 620 or at least add some additional smoke eaters. If you are a smoker it is a 5 star joint... for others 3 makes it AOK and a fair rating."

                "description": "I really enjoyed this Irish pub.  The wait staff was very friendly and efficient.  Just the perfect about of time to check in us and make sure all was well.  The place was very clean.   The food was very good.  I loved the garlic green beans, could easily of been the best part of the meal (if you like veggies... as I do).  The fish was tender and seemed fresh. Came with my favorite kind of fries... thick steak fries.  The pretzel was warm and very good, was the same as a perfect old fashion European pretzel.   The fried pickle slices were very enjoyable as well.   I absolutely loved the Redhead In Bed drink, a new favorite for sure.  The Bonkers Grapefruit Cucumber drink was a relaxing refreshing drink.    I do recommend this Irish Pub. I am giving it a 4 star only because it is like so many other pubs I have had the pleasure of visit."

                "description": "Stopped by for dinner as I always love a good Irish Pub.  The beer was good, food was good but the \"Irish\" was missing. I suppose for a younger crowd who cares nothing about actual Irish ambience , it's a great bar.  But personally I prefer a bit of Irish music as opposed to the rap that was being played .  So In short, it's just another bar, nothing Irish about it other than the decor."

My fiancés Irish breakfast was flavorful and great, but my chicken sandwich had the texture of rubber boots and was extremely bland. The Mac and cheese was also very unremarkable which is very rare for me. Probably won't come back again."

                "description": "Love their new little picnic tables by the street. It's usually sooo loud inside the bar area/on their patio so this is the happy middle ground and don't have to scream to hear your friend speak.  I've honestly never tried their food because I'm usually not in the mood for dive bar food, but can speak to how great their variety of beers is. My personal favorite is the victory sour monkey."

                "description": "Went for a late lunch today and decided to eat on the patio. When we first arrived the misters were on and felt great. They turned off and it got a little warm.   Our server was part of a family of servers we learned from the youngest server. She was the older sister that helped with our order. She recommended a beer my wider really enjoyed.   Our food was very well prepared and was on point.   My wife was overheating after we ate and we were trying to find our server who seemed to be on a break. We literally waited 15 minutes before going inside to see if we could fine her. It appears like she had 2 tables inside and must of lost track of us outside.   All in all it was a great lunch and we would have loved to give it 5 stars but paying should not be the hardest part of going out to lunch."

There's a terrific beer selection, a lot of different seating options, and a fun glass floor.   There are a lot good food choices here.  The pretzel is massive, fish and chips crispy and flaky, and classic burger always cooked to specification.  The fried pickles have a great batter and the Guinness brownie is thick and chewy and comes with creamy ice cream.  Service is generally spot on, and they have done well when I've come in with a group."

They even had the first half on for us just for them to turn it off when the second half, tied by the way, started. For a sports bar this was very disappointing and I don't recommend coming here for a big game whatsoever. We were stuck watching a postgame report over the last five minutes of a close, actually live basketball game. Ridiculous..."

Right from walking in it seems like this place gets really into soccer games, so I'm sure it'll be a hit when Austin FC starts playing.  Their draft selection is solid, even looking at their menu they have a good mix of several types of beers. Thought the bock type was a little funny, they also have sours, tripels, you name it. Got a Mcconaughaze, witty name, good ipa from Twisted X"

                "description": "I've come to Jack and Gingers on multiple occasions, but JandG is a pass for me. I've tried the food AND drinks, and it's nothing out of the ballpark. Food tastes dry and overcooked (INCLUDING THE PRETZEL). Cocktail ingredients are not portioned correctly, so expect your cocktails to taste different from each other. Drinks can be compared to Dave and Busters, which is a yikes considering this is a pub/bar."

                "description": "I am so surprised I have never reviewed this place once since first coming to JandG's over 5 years ago. Tons of memories here with good friends, sitting outdoors drinking whiskey and smoking cigars, minus the cigars. The irish coffees to the wide selection of beers on tap, you'll never run out of new things to try. They've got a killer happy hour menu, if you catch them at the right time, you might be lucky enough to get the worlds biggest pretzel with cheese/honey mustard dip. It's like $5 and it's worth every cent. I love pretzels and this one ranks right up there at the top.   The outdoor section provides excellent seating for 'people watching', especially during the night when the Domain starts livening up with interesting sorts of people. Love Jack and Ginger's, one of the nicest bars in Austin."

                "description": "Starting with the positives, the beer selection was really excellent. I absolutely loved the Austin Eastciders cranberry cider, very refreshing and tart. My partner got the Sippin Pretty sour which was also delicious with some hints of guava. There were plenty of options for whatever kind of beer you like.   In terms of the food, that's were the stars got dropped. My shepherds pie was very ordinary, nothing special about it. The potatoes were pretty chunky and it felt pretty heavy with the cheese and sour cream. The salad was airplane quality, just some greens and tomatoes. This was also pretty overpriced even for the Domain, $16 for very average food.  The fish and chips was the superior entree. The fish was ginormous and crispy, albeit pretty greasy. Fries were sitting under the fish which made them go soft pretty quickly. The green beans were pretty crisp but it was so awkward to eat with the low quality plastic utensils. I understand it may be more sanitary to eat with during the pandemic, but they were those small, bendy, cheap utensils you get with takeout which made it pretty difficult to pick up the beans and fish.   Overall, go for the drinks and atmosphere. Plenty of TVs inside and in the patio and friendly servers. Skip the food!"

I do not live there though. They said they would mail it and I would send shipping. I said okay amazing I will even pay for the hours of the employee and tip etc. Then just crickets. Their phone number doesn't work first, no working voicemail. They respond every few weeks saying \"still waiting on tracking\" even though they claimed to have mailed it 3 weeks ago. So yea, someone stole it. I spoke with a Candace from their venture group and she assured me it was sent..but, never got it. Crazy. They blocked me from facebook even. Pretty wild."

                "description": "I don't know what happened to the customer service here. A few night ago I ordered the Guinness brownie to go. Not only did it take nearly 30 minutes for it to be ready (while other patrons who ordered food after me got their food before me) but I finally got my food by the bartender rudely flinging it in front of me on the bar... and then walked away. No \"here you are\" or anything. In a hope to support a business during this time I would have expected a little courtesy. Let alone when you are operating at less capacity. Yikes, unfortunately next time I will be taking my late night orders from somewhere else.   I did add a star because there was a second bartender who was friendly to other patrons, but I had not interacted with her."

Their queso has beer in it, hence the name, which I thought made it taste funky. The burger patty was cooked to perfection. The bun was ok, better than some, and at least it was toasted. The pickles on the side also tasted funky but I couldn't tell if that was a sign they're \"higher end\" or cheaper than standard dill spears. My side of onion rings was the best part of the meal. Portions were huge and service was good."

It was laid out decently, had a reasonable selection of beer, the patrons were friendly, and the staff was awesome, but the whole place smelled like a bathroom.    I couldn't tolerate it long enough to finish the delicious amber beer I was served."

                "description": "While we were charging our electric car in Austin, we were looking for a place that was close by to eat late at night on Monday. There were not a whole options in the specific area aside from burger joints and a Chili's. I stumbled upon this place on Yelp and I am glad I did. When you first walk in, it is very dark and gives you a dive bar feel, which is totally fine with me. After looking at the food menu, I wanted to try everything. We opted for the pear, fig and Brie pizza and the Ruben pizza. Both were probably some of the best pizzas we had had in a very long time. The bartender and the entire staff were very friendly, in fact a few people checked on us while we were sitting down. $5 doubles were a bonus. This place didn't disappoint."

                "description": "I love this place (and it's not just because I'm an eagles fan, well, okay, that might be a bit of an exaggeration). First off, their mimosas are fire and I haven't found anywhere in the area who can make them nearly as good! Definitely better than most of the brunch places I go to expecting a killer mimosa.   Their prices are great and the food is pretty good. I dig their queso fries because the queso isn't thick, but I have seen reviews where people aren't the biggest fans. Their sandwiches are good and it's always a good time on sundays.   Everyone there is welcoming, no matter the team they're rooting for. Also, the reason they get five stars is because the service is amazing. They all work together and truly pay attention to the customer.   I advise anyone (eagles fan or not!) to check it out."

However it is a pretty interesting food option... they have some cool pizzas like the one with green chili's on it, or the bacon and pesto, and some other interesting combinations.   We were here for a movie premier... my wife friend was in a 21 min shirt film and this is where it was premiered. It was a cool deal!!  The place has s back room with a projection tv on 3 of the 4 walls. We got have some light food, got a free drink and watched the premier... it was pretty good!  The location is loud, lots of bar people, large outdoor seating area... like I said it is a bar with some interesting food.  Bartenders were fun, quick and on top of their game!   The event was well done.. photo both set out outside, kids dressed up to open doors... it was pretty cool!  Nicely done!!"

There is a group of hardcore cowboy fans that meet up on Sundays to watch the game organized by a guy named Dan (he's awesome).  The service was excellent. Room full of rowdy fans and our food/drinks were on point with flavor, price, and the time it took from ordering to receiving the food. Our waiter was great! Didn't catch his name, but he was fantastic.   I'm in love with Mister Tramps."

They can only stream 2 games at once and even though I called before they couldn't do it.  So I still had to pay for a watered down drink that was made wrong and missed my game.

My friends also got lots of drinks and I didn't hear any complaints coming from them so....I think it's safe to say that it lives up to its reputation as a good pub/bar.   The entire location appears to be dedicated to a soccer team, but as a non-watcher, I can't really comment on that other than to say that they play multiple kinds of sports on the many tv screens, and they are always open to requests as well from what I've observed.   The staff is absolutely lovely and very good about checking in with you, getting orders correct, and being extra friendly. (Don't forget to tip your waitress/waiter!)   I've only ever been for the trivia, but I know they also offer stand-up and I'm sure they offer more on other nights of the week. Anyways, this is a cool place and I will definitely be a frequent attendee!"

                "description": "I'm not too sure about the \"café\" part; however, Mister Tramps is certainly a great place to watch sports (TVs everywhere, including the front outdoor patio where the smokers congregate AND even one in the lady's room!). They do offer some pretty decent standard bar fare: wings (they state they're \"oven roasted, never fried\" and I am totally perplexed at how they get that outer crispy goodness), burgers (not huge but good), pizza (especially after midnight - see tip below) would be in my top three. This dive-ish joint also has some of the friendliest staff around and a great beer selection with awesome prices - including some local craft selections: Infamous, Stash, Thirsty Goat and more - over a dozen different selections of craft on tap at any given time, plus all of their bottle selections and other libations. There is always a shot special board, so be sure to check that out if it's your thang.  And, if you Bleed Blue like me, you will be thrilled to know this is Cowboys country y'all!!! How 'bout them Cowboys?! Fans gather by the masses to Mister Tramps on game day...there's even an entire large viewing room with three HUGE projection screens that is curtained off by what else but Dallas Cowboys curtains (they support other teams as well; maybe more than one set of curtains?). If you want to partake in the fandemonium get there early to procure a seat at one of the many communal tables.    Overall: Yay, I'm a fan...I'll be divin' in again real soon! ;) Cheers!  Tip: Order a pitcher of beer after midnight and you can buy a pizza for a buck - yup, one dolla! Full menu available every day until 2am."

From the outside it looked like a sports bar and it was. When you enter you can order food from a full menu of mostly seafood cuisine. We just skipped this and headed straight to the bar where located right in the middle of this establishment.  This place has lots of flat screens showing a wide variety of sports entertainment. The beer choices was excellent and enjoyed the one I had. Staff were nice and tended to our needs very well.  Fun atmosphere where there was an adult birthday party going on here. Another nice design is very open to the outside even if sitting inside unless way in the back. We enjoyed it and next time pick something off the menu."

We ordered food through fly rite chicken, and I ordered a Bloody Mary from the bar. Pretty tasty food, Bloody Mary was tasty and enjoyed that on a warmer afternoon.   Lots of cool places to visit around this area. I suggest trying the Buffalo chicken sandwich with a side of tater tots."

                "description": "LAVACA STREET BAR YOU OFFICIALLY RUINED YOUR PLACE. The real reason we even came here was for the fantastic poboys, seafood sandwiches. We haven't been to your place in a while due to the pandemic. We walk in excited and salivating and walked out disgusted to learn it was like Fly chicken or something like that. Seriously? You had a perfect blend of affordable high-end food and now,,,, wow you offer such exiting fare as chicken sandwiches?! How is this something anyone looks forward to? Such typical bar food.  I told all my neighbors this and they were shocked. GET BACK THE OLD RESTAURANT. Guys, *that's what made you special and memorable. Your bar isn't that exciting or enticing without it.. think about your Rock Rose Street competition. We were sooo sad to see these food items go. I hate to say it, but we will NEVER be back. Why did you ruin a good thing?!?"

                "description": "Was in the mood for a late night meal and decided to hit the Domain for Lavaca's 30th Anniversary Party to grab a bite to eat. An absolutely phenomenal decision as the food was delicious! Neither of us ordered drinks (I was a little disappointed - didn't see any special anniversary drinks available!) but the food was great.   There are several locations for Lavaca Street Bar, but we visited this one because it's closest to my house. As it is also a bar, you will need to bring along an ID because they do card to enter. This location, as with the others, features both indoor and outdoor seating. We opted for a closet table because I'm on crutches so mobility and accessibility were a main focus. Be advised, you order at the front and they will bring your food to you, but you cannot order anything from your table. Instead, when you place the order they give you a numbered placard to place on the table of your choice.   In perusing through the menu, there were several items that caught my eye, but when I went up to order I noticed a special on blacked tuna tacos for the month...of course this was what I ended up selecting based on the recommendation of the cashier. WOW! My tacos arrived to the table deconstructed as they do not have any suitable corn (gluten free!) tortillas so I couldn't actually eat them as tacos. (This was not the hill I wanted to die on with my celiac disease) It was a beautiful display and they were delivered by the nicest man (super friendly, very accommodating, etc.) but I was quite disappointed that I was unable to enjoy them as tacos because of the tortilla situation.   Despite my disappointment in this....they were amazing!!! The seasoning/rub used to blacken the tuna was probably the best I've ever had and I absolutely have to try it on other meats as well. My friend ordered the chicken quesadillas and also loved it, but I think mine was better.    We came at a pretty busy time (I mean there was a party going on for goodness sake!) and our food was still on the table in the blink of an eye. I will say that this isn't the place to go if you expect to be waited on hand and foot, because this is not that type of establishment, but the service was stellar and entirely met my expectations.   The only reason I'm unable to give a 5 star is because I was unable to enjoy my meal as it was intended and I honestly can't believe they didn't have corn tortillas I could use instead. They did get creative in deconstructing it a d it was still beautiful and delicious, but I really wanted those tacos and I'm sure the tortilla would have changed the flavor as well. Hopefully next time they'll have something suitable as I definitely intend for there to be a next time!"

                "description": "AVOID THIS PLACE AND DO NOT ORDER FOOD HERE! I came here expecting a restaurant, but it turns out that they added a food truck to avoid the COVID shutdown. Almost an hour and a half wait (88 minutes!!) for a set of wings and a sandwich, and it came out cold. Not worth the $20. The best part? When I asked the Lavaca Street Bar folks about how much longer it would be, they said that it wasn't their problem and offered no help. I also tried to go to the food truck, but there's no one at the window to help (you have to order through an app)!!   The beer was fine."

                "description": "FOR FLYRITE    I usually visit the location on 7th street bc my bf is obsessed with this place. We went to the location at the domain bc it's closer to his place and it was probably one of the worst meals I've had in a long time. I already took a risk going to the domain which is like a scene from Mad Max as it is (no one wears a mask and acts like they don't know what 6ft apart means)  We decided to redeem our free sandwich promo from the app. Both our meals were incorrect and the tater tots were soggy. No, it wasn't from waiting to get home. I snuck one out of the bag at the restaurant when my bf wasn't looking and already knew dinner was going to be a no go for me. But I gave it chance. I had a long day and waited to eat until I could have a nice dinner with my lovely partner. After a hangry drive home I popped open my little box of incorrect disappointment and was instantly sad that my food was wrong. I powered through about two bites to find a long overly dyed hair in my chicken sandwich :(. I was tired and ready to end my night that I just pounded down my tots which later gave me a stomach ache.   I felt a call to rectify my order was unwarranted since it was a free sandwich and I still wouldn't eat there again anyway. My bf loves this place and it's a shame that we won't share that experience again. Oh well, onto finding the next chicken sandwich."

We got a steak poboy, ceviche, and dozen Rockefeller oysters and it was well over $70 with tip... we haven't even ordered drinks yet which is a separate process. Bartenders are usually slow and talkative to people they know and who seem to also work there. The place itself is open, has tons of tvs, and dog friendly which is why we've continued to come back. I just wish we got better service for the prices we're paying."

In the meantime, the full menu is offered. Nonetheless, we were attended to by Alfonso whom we discovered was as knowledgeable about the menu and beverages as he is passionate about the company. Their version of pimiento cheese is phenomenal. My fried pork chop was incredibly juicy, and Edwyn's salad was well thought out.  The new GM Josh stopped by to make sure everything was as it was supposed to be, which they certainly were. In a nutshell, this is an absolutely amazing place."

                "description": "I have been to all of the locations in the Austin area and they are consistently good.   I met a client for lunch. They arrived early and ordered the guac and chips as an appetizer.  It was fresh, the chips were not overly salted, nice and crisp and a good amount to share for more than just 2 people.  We both ordered the special that day- the \"Spicy Jambalaya\" as it sounded really good. I have yet to have an entree here that I did not like.  This one was just ok. It was supposed to be chicken and shrimp.  Both of us only had one shrimp and only a couple of pieces of chicken. To me, jambalaya is at least 50% meat and 50% everything else. This was primarily rice and so much tomato sauce that was all I could taste. It was not spicy either so they brought us their habanero sauce (which is really good) which added the kick it needed.   The service is always great, the food is fresh and overall a good place. I was disappointed in this particular dish so I would not order it again but I will certainly go back.  There are a lot of really good items on the menu."

                "description": "We've been coming to Jack Allen's for their heavenly brunch for years now (hello, tomato basil pie!), and I'm beyond remiss to only be reviewing it now, when we're eating \"linner\" here for the first time! If my husband were a restaurant, he would be Jack Allen's. Classic. Stylish. Cool Cat Texan. 90's grunge rock comfortable. FYI that Jack also feeds Camp Mabry on the regular, so we're both definite fans! You'll never ever go wrong with their boozy Sunday brunch. Period.  But does that culinary wizardry extend to Sunday linner? Why, yes. Yes, it does!   Can I say straightaway that the Slow Braised Beef Barbacoa Enchiladas were slap yo mama yum? If you're in the market for southwestern comfort food, look no further! The slow braised beef was flawless, cheesy goodness! Diet food? No. Excellent food? Yes!  First things first, though! The House-Made Pimento Cheese with Flatbread Cracker amuse bouche was stupid good! If pimento cheese was on your childhood menu, like it absolutely was on mine, you'll find this starter profoundly soul-warming! We bought a mason jar full of the cheese to take home because como no?   The Crispy Chicken Lollipops appetizer was out of this world! Crispy sweet heat and the most tender chicken thighs on earth with a pile of Jack Slaw that we would buy by the pint! This would actually be a perfect entree size for me for next time! I'm filing this away!   The Chicken Fried Pork Chop is straight up Sunday dinner at Mom's! If your mom is a stellar chef, of course, which we all know that they all are, right? The masher and the gravy were a cashmere throw! Ridiculous! Just look at the picture, y'all! You. Will. Not. Be. Disappointed.   The drinks all go without saying! The chemists behind the bar are wicked good! My agave skinny cocktail was on point! I knocked back three. No judgement! Hubby's Moscow Mule was bracing and bright! He knocked back three! No judgement!   The Blondie pie? Best dessert ever! I really don't know what else to say about it! I'm without words, and my husband is currently apoplectic!   By the by, our server, Christian, was the pitch perfect Jack Allen guide! Jack Gilmore is lucky to have him! As were we!   p.s. We picked up the Jack Allen cookbook while we were there. Tomato Basil Pie, we shall bake you!"

                "description": "*Update*.....Jack Allen's Kitchen on Anderson Ln is my go to eatery for fresh comfort food. They were doing farm to table before it was a foody phrase. Everything on their menu is excellent! Burgers and fries, fish tacos, salads and chicken fried steak are some of my favorites. These guys get it!!! They don't overthink their food and make the dishes something they're not. I often say, \"Simplicity is best served warm with a side of sweet potato fries.\" If you feel this way, Jack's is for you. In short, they prepare recognizable dishes with fresh ingredients at a good price point. I highly recommend Jack Allen's Kitchen for your next comfort food.culinary excursion. You simply will not find better food for the money anywhere in Central Texas. Run, don't walk, to any of their locations for great food."

We had the Barbacoa Stackers, guacamole, and catfish to start, and all of them were very tasty but not really great for splitting among a large group.  Didn't try dessert, and the drinks weren't bad just a little pricey to me. The entrees were lacking however, I split a plate of Chorizo Stuffed Pork Tenderloin, and Pesto-marinated Crab Stuffed Chicken. Both dishes were fine I guess, but both were light on flavor. There was barely any chorizo or crab in the respective dishes.  Short version, I'd recommend the appetizers, but that's about all."

Monday-Friday 3-7PM *Featuring 1/2 priced appetizers and $1 off all drinks.  BARBACOA STACKERS $9.99- [barbacoa, refried black beans, jack cheese, JAK slaw, cotija cheese]  Comes w/ 3 stackers (basically large nachos), and it was a small meal for me. Good but I expected a bit more flavor. I would get it again though for $5!"

The service is always good. The food is consistently good as well.  My only -1 is the food tends to be a little bland imo. Still good, just missing a kick, if that makes any sense. I've had many things off the menu now, chicken fried chicken, enchiladas, pasta, appetizers, etc. They're all good, but never my favorite. In fact part of the reason I've tried so many things is I'm looking for that ONE thing that makes me say \"let's go to Jack Allen's for dinner.\" But again, the food is good. I wouldn't hate on someone if they suggested we come here for dinner."

                "description": "Let me just say, food is consistently good and they have kept the same recipes and menu since they opened, even when they changed owners yay! Place is clean and does not smell, the ice is the best and for some reason the water there is so crisp! But unfortunately, the service has gone downhill. Especially when the guy behind the bar sees you waiting to be seated and can't even say from a few feet away, \"hello we will be right with you.\" Or even a hello period. I mention this because it's been like this for the last few times we've been there. Usually there are two other servers helping the seated tables and he's just there all bothered looking. I have wanted to politely get his attention by asking him to come seat us. Mind you, it's usually not too busy when we go. I suppose it's frustrating when you know the person chooses to ignore you. Even though it says wait to be seated... it's nice to be acknowledged anywhere you go. Especially if you are fortunate to enjoy an evening out. Other than that, food is good. Service sadly, not so good. Side note- can you please change the 90s-2000 playlist that has been playing for the last 6-7 years lol. Same songs, same playlist. It's cool once in a while but some variety would be nice. I can tell the chef is the same and we thank you for that. It is the only reason we continue to show up!   *This review is to provide feedback in hopes that your business will benefit from an honest customer presenting this information."

The Zilker Love pizza had become its own food group in our home, and there are many vegetarian delights to delight, as well as craft beer and a fabulous brunch!

                "description": "With new management comes change  and reviews can change too, so the old sign that seemed a little pisdy towards dogs is gone.  I forgot pics, bit there's a dedicated dog area, not just at the seating just outside the front door but also across the parking lot with lots of shade, picnic tables, and a water station.  Our server, Luis, made our experience the best as he was willing to serve us across the way under the trees since things were slow.  His recommendation for salad dressing was cool too as we mixed 2 on our Southwest salad and that was awesome (cilantro and chipotle I think).  All in all, the pizza was good, and there is a dedicated brunch menu, which was unexpected as well.  We'll be back another time to try more things beyond pizza and to take pics."

Plenty of unique pizzas and burgers, Austin Terrier focuses on new American taste, mixed with the old.   Vegans rejoice, as there is a pizza and burger for you. The Greenbelt Pizza (sub for vegan cheese) and the Impossible Burger are going to be your go-tos. What makes the Greenbelt Pizza great is the truffle oil, the fresh and plentiful arugula, topped with red onions and mushrooms.  Add the Trio of Fries (sub the truffle parm fries), and you have a perfect meal for two."

Went last night with my doggo to meet a friend with her doggo, and we had the funnest and best waiter named Chad! I got the chipotle chicken sandwich and it was phenomenal. We also got a platter of 3 diff kinds of fries that were accidentally ordered for us and he told us to keep them lol. Then he covered our drinks for us because of a long wait time that wasn't even a long wait time! The dogs all played and got treats and tons of love from the staff. My enormous Bulldog couldn't get back into my car at the end because he was tired and my fiancé wasn't there to help me so Chad helped me lift him into my car lol. Anyways this place is awesome! 5/5 recommend!"

Lots of beer, the TVs aren't loud, and cute Terrier art is on the walls. Dogs are welcome in the outside seating area.  There are a few vegetarian options, and I'm pretty sure they can be made vegan.  After coming here several times, I have to suggest ordering the Trio of Fries. Three different seasonings and three sauces let's you try a variety of flavors and fill up on carbs. That's absolutely my jam. It's great for sharing with 2-3 more people and gotta really well with a sandwich. The Toro is pretty good. It tastes fresh and is really satisfying."

                "description": "I wish the Asian lady who works here quit, only her that makes me don't want to go back especially for pickup. She mostly at the pickup counter. She's not friendly, never smile and short in words, never say nice things like thank you, have a nice day .....after we made the payment/pickup. She's cold and means! She will ask you to show your order on the phone if match with the bag that you are grabbing but the way she did not so friendly.   Others staff is perfect, they're professional and friendly.   Food is good especially the fish dish. Fries as well. Love the new drinks that they are selling on the fridge. But if you use delivery service it won't taste the same.   3 stars because of that Asian waitress, otherwise 5. If manager or owner read this, please consider this waitress. She doesn't have a service mind!! She should find a new job that fit her style. I used to come here at least once every two weeks also order through DoorDash for pickup and sometime delivery, but I hate to see that waitress, so I might stop all."

                "description": "We've been loyalty members and have been coming to this restaurant since they opened and tonight the  experience was horrible.  The food didn't taste good. My soup was over seasoned. An appetizer plate sat on our table all night and was never removed when we were served our main entree. Usually I can handle a dirty plate on our table but it was the remainder of the experience that just topped off the night.   The chopped tomato on my husband's pizza tasted and smelled like it was chopped on a cutting board with raw fish. It's a very strong smell of fish and definitely recognizable.  We placed a to go order and encountered very rude staff with the pickup on our way out. For no reason at all, just rude.   It was a huge disappointment. The place has really gone down hill."

                "description": "Hadn't been to a BJ's in forever, but it was one of the few sit down spots open after 9pm in the area and we were hungry after a long day of work and travel. We had to wait just a couple of minutes because they were getting a big influx of guest - seems like some sort of dance show had just let out. Gary was our server and even though my favorite pasta has been discontinued (RIP blackened chicken pasta) and they were out of my second choice item (turkey burger) Gary had a great attitude and solid recommendations and solutions to keep the night on track. I ended up getting the half rack rib special with a beer that he recommended to pair and of course everyone was more than happy to share my pizooki. Give it a try, nice staff, quick service, solid food and open late."

I got mine with mustard, his was plain. I had a side of fries which were delicious and he had a side of the grilled honey sriracha brussel sprouts, which are awesome. Service was fair, and our server, Kelly, didn't split the check correctly, minus one star, and more than half the tables were closed despite having shields between them, minus one star. They have a great food and beer menu and we will definitely be back."

                "description": "I've eaten here before and really enjoyed the product (all the BJs are really good really) but this location has turned into a joke honestly. We've tried to eat here on three occasions in the past month, every time we walk in, maybe 1 in 4 tables is seated. Then they tell us it's going to be a 1-2 hour wait. I'm all about social distancing and being safe during these times but that's ridiculous. It's either bad management unable to staff the location or just an EXTREME overabundance of social distancing. We gave them two chances and the third time we're done. We'll just go ahead and drive to the next nearest one and get seated sooner. Every single couple/group that came in during the 5 minutes we spent there had the same appalled look on their face when they saw the place practically empty and an hour wait."

                "description": "BJ's was always one of my favorite restaurants, but not this location.  I ordered a family bundle meal directly from their website.  I got a call from the door dash driver a bit later and he said they had no record of my order.  I texted him a photo of my e-receipt and he showed the manager.  Apparently they didn't have the Shrimp Scampi -Tri-Tip Bundle I ordered at this particular restaurant so the order cancelled automatically and I got no notification from the restaurant.  The Door Dash driver had to cancel my order and he said someone from BJ's would be calling me.  They called and said they could have another bundle with a different item ready and cooked in about 15 minutes.  I said ok. that works.    30 minutes later I get a phone call asking when I was coming to pick up the order? I said I ordered delivery, not pick-up. He said, \"you have to order on our website to get delivery.\"  I told him I did the first time.  He just, \"Oh\".  So I said, \"So you are not going to deliver this?\" he said he couldn't.  So I just said refund my money and this is the last time I will be going to this store.    You would think that maybe a manager would have called back to apologize or something, but nothing.  I just hope I get my refund.    Good luck with this store!"

We arrived and then, found out that they had not taken that down reserve ahead of time option, so I reserved a seat for nothing, still waited about 40 minutes.  By the way, you have to be present to get on the waitlist like any other restaurant in town.  When it was time to be seated there probably 5 empty 2 top tables, and they were seating us next to a large party of 10!  Hello, can we move a few tables down?  So we picked another table and sat.  The host came and asked if we would like to move to a booth once it's cleaned as he pointed to the table, never were moved, and the original hostess that sat us brought our silverware and we assumed we were no longer moving.  Waited 15 minutes for our beer after waiting for our server.  Placed our order at 8:25 and got our food within 15-20 minutes, luckily!  By then, we were starving.  Be patient since all dining is lacking employees.  No pics to show since we woofed down our food!"

We have eaten here many times, and although I didn't order it tonight, one of my favorites here is the Jambalaya. It is a little hot for my wimpy tastebuds, so I order it with light cayenne. And it comes out just right. We've always had consistently good food and service.  I suspect some of the more negative reviews may be from those who come during peak hours (which we always avoid)."

                "description": "Coffee in the Time of COVID. There I was, deep in North West Austin. I really needed a cup of joe to soothe my nerves after the drive and the only place close by was a little boutique cafe innocuously named Coffee Shark. The out door seating area was populated by middle aged professionals, who I presumed were working on their screenplays while on lunch. The cafe was in an office place overlooked by Mac-mansions perched on the hills surrounding it.  I girded myself for the aromatic punch of patchouli and sandlewood mixed with the audible assault of world music and hemp-wearing hippies. I entered the cafe and was pleasantly surprised by the lack of the typical Austin vibe. The young lady at the counter took my order, a medium cappuccino, without a hint of pretentiousness. I perused the wares for sale, mugs and tshirts, local coffee beans, metal straws. Thinking I should prepare for disappointment I grabbed some sweetener.  The cappuccino arrived promptly, hot and inviting. To my delighted surprise it was rich, creamy and flavorful.  I skulked out of the cafe, my expectations of over-priced culture dashed on the rocks of pandemic panic-less normalcy. Great coffee and great service."

                "description": "Pretty nice for a hidden coffee shop in a large commercial complex. Would not notice it from the road or walking past unless you know what you're looking for, as it blends in with the rest of the modern building architecture. Not the warmest building from the exterior, but they've done a good job trying to make it welcoming indoors. A variety of seating with one high top table. Most of the seating is 6+ capacity tables, so if you don't like sharing, this is not the place for you to study/sit alone. There is bench window seating, but with two walls of windows I imagine those seats might get warm in the summer. Some outdoor seating as well, for those who prefer that.  I got the grilled cheese and apple sandwich. The flavor combination was well done, but I was a little disappointed by the ratio of filling to bread and felt the sandwich could have been fluffed out a little more in terms of filling. The chips were neither amazing nor terrible; pretty standard fare.   I also got two different hot chocolates. One regular with almond milk, one Mexican hot chocolate with oat milk. Of the two, I'd recommend the first one. Good flavor and nice quantity of whipped cream if you ask for it in a mug. The default seems to be to-go cups, so make sure you're clear if you want to sit and stay a while when ordering. My friend got the Mexican hot chocolate with regular milk and the spices smelled fantastic, but with oat milk they got overwhelmed and it was mostly an oaty flavor.   Welcoming and friendly staff. Would definitely visit again."

                "description": "I ran into Coffee Shark for a quick pick me up during my lunch break and was pleasantly surprised. First of all, the place is huge. I don't think anyone would ever have trouble finding a seat and it seems like a nice quiet place to work for an afternoon. I appreciated the fact that they had a lot of flavor options. I decided to get a Vanilla Rose Iced Oat Milk Latte and it was so good. The flavor was subtle and it was perfectly brewed. The only reason I knock it down to 4 stars is because it's definitely on the pricier side. I would expect to pay minimum $7 for a latte when you go in. While it may not be an everyday stop, I would still go back for sure.   COVID Precautions: Masks required for employees and customers."

We went to this place to try the steampunk coffee as other fellow yelpers have mentioned but I dint see option of steampunk coffee on their menu. There was only oNe person behind the counter for taking order and  making.  We ordered  blueberry scone, cranberry muffin, cappuccino  and house coffee. Muffin was huge, both muffin and scone wasn't  fresh at all, tasted like, when you leave them for couple of day on  top of the counter and take a bite. cappuccino  and coffee was good, service is ok, they  have ample seating. Recommend  cappuccino and cOffee not baked goods though."

It seemed so promising, but my friends and I ordered three different drinks, and each one was incredibly medicore. The chai latte was almost bland, vanilla latte tasted worse than an instant version I could buy at a grocery store, and even the normal latte lacked flavor."

                "description": "We've come here several times now so we must like it.   I have ordered a breakfast sandwich that's good. There's a pretty well endowed breakfast menu, not huge full breakfasts, like pancakes, but for a coffee shop there's a lot of offerings.  Our coffees are consistent.  It's definitely not my favorite, but it's always good. Consistency is hard, which is why I don't have a favorite coffee shop.   The outdoor area is great bc we always have my kids in tow and sometimes there's another kiddo out there for them to mingle with.   The details: It's an older, white, crowd. The industrial decor is neat, but the chairs are really loud when you move them.  There's plenty of parking. Staff is friendly.   It's always relatively quiet. *the reason i noticed the loud chairs *"

                "description": "Coffee is good. I have nothing negative to say about that--just the absolute worst customer service I have ever encountered in a coffee shop to date. The owner, or whoever he was, was so terrified of people I wasn't even sure if I was supposed to be there. Pictures look great, I'm sure the place can be a lot of fun if it weren't for COVID-paranoia. Seriously, I went all over Austin that day and NO ONE was halfway as petrified as this guy.  My brother tried to take a sip of his coffee but was soundly rebuked for exposing his nose and mouth for 10 seconds. I understand we need to be careful, and we were, but if you go to a coffee shop you should at least be permitted to make sure the thing is edible before you leave!! BTW, we wore a mask and were very careful the entire time being there.  Won't be back. There are many other decent coffee stops in Austin."

Good food, excellent desserts, and consistent coffee brewing skills exist here.  4 stars because while everything is good overall, the nitro cold brew coffee on the other-hand well to honest...sucks! Its just weak cold brewed coffee, it doesn't pack a punch of caffeine like other cafes that offer it on their menu. If you're gonna do something, do it right or do it better!  But great little place. Indoor and outdoor seating. Good lighting inside and fairly quiet environment if you're working out of the office.   The staff is friendly but not super helpful."

I love coffee but I'd honestly would get the chai next time - it was absolutely delightful. We also sampled our fair share of pastries including a blueberry muffin, pumpkin bread, and croissant. The muffin and bread were really moist and delicious, but the croissant was very bready and not a flaky, buttery croissant I was looking forward to. I think they get their pastries from a local bakery so that was cool and I would definitely try out their other pastries. Will definitely be back!"

They have a fun little outdoor area with games to play, and a few games inside too. If you're looking for a relaxing getaway with both amazing beer and coffee choices this is the place to go!"

They were understaffed at the bar before the pandemic so don't tell me it's cause of post pandemic staff shortage.

The pizza blew me away. I ordered thinking \"eh, that doesn't sound good but I'll branch out\" and WOW am I glad I did! The Pig was amazing. I was blown away by the meats! The sausage was incredible (this is coming from someone who HATES sausage on her pizza). The meats had so much flavor. Also, the service was incredible. The first time we came by, the wait after being seated was absolutely insane. We were so hungry! However, the waiter was so attentive to this and gave us a free dessert!   ....which leads me to how good the dessert is here! I am not a caramel fan, and this caramel ice cream was insanely good.   Please come to north italia. Trust me. It's our new fave!"

As you can see in my pictures we ordered a lot, lol. We created our pizza. The pesto was perfect. The crust on the pizza was crispy and soft. Great flavor overall.  I ordered the squid Ink. It was great spice and delicious. Only negative was the shrimp and it needed some type of veggie. The shrimp didn't hold flavor well in the dish. I think Argentina shrimp would be a better pick for this dish rather than basic shrimp.  My little one of course with her sweet tooth ordered the glazed Italian donut french toast. It actually was really good. The wild blueberry, honey lemon ricotta, hazelnut and mint combination was actually a really good combination. This dish is super sweet so make sure you have some milk or water to drink.  My other child ordered the breakfast sandwich. She loved it. She really enjoyed the hint of spice it had in it. And my oldest child ordered the Pollo fritto and asked for over easy egg. We also ordered one too so we all could try. Let me say how they cooked the perfect cut of chicken. Normally you order chicken like this and they give you a dark meat cut thigh. Not here! It was a juicy white cut. The crust was perfect! The hash brown balls were yummmmmy! We all enjoyed those.  Overall, great atmosphere, great service, great food! We definitely will be back!"

                "description": "An amazing experience with awesome tasty food. I may not be an Italian food expert but all I tasted was freshness, bold flavors, and great tasting meats.   The charcuterie board has figs, different types of meats such as salami and prosciutto. The char bread is awesome, nice char, mix of oils, and the crunch really helps break up the saltiness from the meats. The white looking sauce is actually cheese spread, I wasn't too much of a fan but it was ok. The best part of the board was the little Italian almonds, soft and firm yet nice crispy shell.   The beef carpaccio is yummy, tasty, and just look at the dish? You eat with your eyes and the dish appeals to your vision. Must try.   The zucchini chips are additive, nice crispy, salty, chips, a bit too oily but it's what is expected, very nice house chips.  The spaghetti and meatball dish is good but I wasn't blown away, I had a better elsewhere. The spaghetti tasted a bit too Al dente, too firm, just missing flavor. I would of spun the spaghetti in olive oil, salt, and black pepper then placed the sauce on top. Sprinkling parmesan cheese helps,"

                "description": "I'm literally sad to give just one star to this location, my family loves this place but our experiences were pretty bad every time. First time we came, the bartenders were rude from the start for no reason at all. We got our usual drinks - Sicilian margarita and ginger blossom margarita. First one was fine but ginger was overly sweet, we asked to change the drink and the lady just refused saying that's how it should taste like. Once again, we go to north italia a lot and we never had a drink as sweet as ginger blossom at this location. Fried calamari were greasy and chicken pesto - super salty. Another time we came , it was slow - bar was pretty empty, the bartenders were ignoring us and chatting with coworkers - service was just poor. We ordered a take out once and salmon came out raw, when we asked for well done. There was wrong dressing and no utensils in the bag.  Why we keep coming back you ask? My husband loves the place, or loved actually, so we were thinking it was that one time of bad service but it just kept continuing.  So, I wouldn't recommend this location to anyone"

                "description": "Make reservations in advance! This place is always packed and when we arrived today the waiting time was about 1h. Luckily, I had made reservations in advance. Family decided to order the zuca chips and meatballs for apps, unfortunately none of their apps are gluten free! This was just a huge let down. They loved the zuca chips and none of them enjoys zucchini...funfact. The meatball in my own daughter's word were very soft and flavorful, the cheese just makes it perfect.  For mains we had chicken parm and bolognese. You can't go wrong with bolognese, if you're in doubt if a restaurant is good just order that and you will see. They gf pasta was perfect! The sauce was amazing! Very Italian style with the some fennel flavor! The sauce was great! Not very acid and would adhere to the rotini pasta perfectly!  My girls had the chicken parm and they said it was amazing! Chicken was still moist with a perfect crispy crust with cheese perfectly melted. The pasta was also good with some white sauce. Neither of them could finish their plates which means dinner is guaranteed for the teens!"

My partner and I love Italian food and have been searching for the best gnocchi, unfortunately they didn't have any. The waiter was really nice and polite and mentioned how everything is made from scratch. Although I trust her, the food was average. It tasted straight from a pasta sauce can. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good, in exception of the bread! Would go again but just for the bread."

                "description": "In town on business an decided to try something new. We stay in the Domain about once a month an the restaurants an vibe never disappoints. Not a bad 20 minute wait for a Thursday night. Our server was fabulous an gave us great recommendations. We had the classic board an everything was perfectly balanced with the great bottle of Cabernet we choose. Server was attentive glasses were kept full. We split the Pig pizza. Sausage was spicy an pizza was overall very good. Restrooms before our walk back to our hotel left us both grossed out an nauseous the urinal smell was just horrid we will skip that next visit. For such a nice place to eat I was a bit to shocked."

                "description": "Wanted an Italian dinner the first night we were in Austin. Found this place about a mile from the hotel and take a chance. Pretty busy but it was Friday night around 6-7pm. Had about a 45 minute wait however we were able to sneak into a table around the bar (first come first serve).  Wife got the chicken parmigiana. Probably the best option on the menu. Crunchy chicken with great sauce and amazing noodles on the side. She also tried the bread as an app. Very crispy and fresh.  I got the Caesar salad because I wanted something lighter. Not bad but it's a salad. Also got the meatballs. Pretty delicious.  Server was very nice and we had a great time. The domain area was very fancy with plenty of shops and stores to roam around in. Worth the visit."

Cappuccino: I had asked to make it with whole milk, but still it was watery and just okay, they give it so much, asked for stevia, but they don't carry it:(  Farmers scramble: it's scrambled egg with veggies, and comes with a side of crispy potatoes and a toast. I had requested to make eggs spicy if possible, but it was super bland, other than salt, no other seasoning whatsoever, when I got my food, nothing was hot, not even warm, it was room temperature, so potatoes were not crispy, but taste was good, toast tasted good too, it would've tasted good, if it was atleast warm.  Our server was nice and helpful!!"

Cocktails are amazing and they're always coming up with some new tasty concoctions!  During the holidays they had eggnog to go, and it was hands down the best eggnog I have ever had!   Everything I have eaten here is a 10 out of 10! We have tried almost everything on the menu and I've enjoyed every dish!  Our favorite appetizer is the brussel sprouts and if you want to splurge get the steak dinner.....WOW!  It could be the best steak I have ever had!  The servers go above and beyond and are always cheerful and accommodating.  The ambiance is super cool and hip from the lounge chairs, to the wall accents, they did a great job designing it! The owners of this restaurant really put in the time and dedication to come up with such a great concept and a great addition to the downtown square. I just can't say enough good things about this place!"

So I didn't get to eat a lot of it. I told the waitress and showed her. She came back with a to go box with the meat I didn't like in it and told me I can take it home to cook it how I like it ????!!! What?!  I came here to pay for a service and pay for the food- and I didn't get it. Then I'm told to cook it myself? I paid full price.  The chef just so happened to ask us how our food was and I told him. He gave me a gift card to try the place again. I doubt I will after this experience."

They were out of EVERYTHING. Everything we tried to order, they didn't have it.  The server told us the \"head chef\" was out on vacation which is why not enough food was prepped...??  My sister got a steak - UNSEASONED - when we asked why it wasn't seasoned, they said they were out of the chutney that goes on top I went with the Cesar salad - nothing but wilted lettuce  My family wanted to pay since it was my birthday, but I couldn't let them. The experience was so bad, I insisted on paying since I obviously needed to do better research."

                "description": "I came here with our bridesmaid party for a lunch break during dress shopping and we had the best time! We ordered a few shareables for the table, including the Cantonese Riblets, Salt and Pepper Calamari and Carne Asada Fries. All three were delicious, but my favorite was hands down the riblets. They slid right off the bone and tasted a lot more authentic than I was initially expecting. The fries were the next runner up because you can never go wrong with fries covered in queso. For lunch, I ordered the Italian Sausage Burger. I really enjoyed it and it came with more waffle fries! I thought I'd love the sausage patty, however, I think I would have enjoyed a different protein to fill it out a little more. It was worth a try though!  The service was great here and everyone was super friendly. Parking can get a little tricky, but there's plenty of spots if you're not going at peak hours. I'm excited to stop by for dinner, when they have a lot more choices! I don't mind shareables, but I felt like the lunch menu was a little limited and nothing really stuck out to me."

It seemed like the place was trying to be upscale but it was more like bar food.   When I placed my order I was told they were out of that item. The menu already isn't very big for dinner entrees so one less option made it hard to pick. I ended up getting 2 appetizers to try to make a meal.  Both were covered in so much sauce it turned my stomach. My husband and kids weren't that excited about their meals either and no one finished the meal.  My son said his  stomach was hurting from all the salt on his meal."

                "description": "Wow, I want to give this place 5 stars, and I hope they trend up but the food is a 3 star experience - at best.  Ambiance is perfect! Less than a block off the square in downtown Georgetown with plenty of free street parking [when Georgetown starts going to valets, I'm moving.] Lots of people walking around: this is a walking little town.  The place itself has a very expansive outside deck with even a few more street side tables - with the fans and heaters I'm betting you get 9-10 months of outside seating here.  Inside the bar is not large but it is gorgeous and there are some table tops as well as lounge seating - comfy old chairs, some Victorian love seats - its really charming and inviting. You will love the ambiance.  Service was fast, friendly and professional - I dealt with three different mixologists and not a surly one in the bunch [try finding that percentage of happy people in Austin...] and the make a wonderful drink. PS: wines on tap (they're not bad) and you have GOT to try a smoked Old Fashion (try the alder wood - its delicious smokiness in a perfect drink.]  PS: At least two rooms for private parties too if you need that holiday gathering!  Why no five stars then? Sounds great! It is great if you go for friends, drinks and good times. But unless we picked the worst entries - chicken and a burger - the food is underwhelming. My neighbor to one side also said her deviled eggs were just average. To be fair, the food was not bad, but it was not good and does not compare with other places around the square.  So; for drinks and maybe an appetizer and ambiance this has got to be on your short list. Think twice about this as a dining destination though - that may not be your best option."

They have exclusive membership options that provide you with a locker for your special stash, so you always have your favorite spirit on hand. I know this because my little bro is a member. He's got a cool locker with some great whiskey in there, and they have a great selection as well.   There is limited seating inside so all of the seating feels exclusive! It's also just a fantastic feel inside and out. The patio is big and adorable, complete with a picture wall the screams social media opp! If I lived in Georgetown, this is where I would hang out. I will definitely make it my spot when I make it over to Gtown!   All of the food we had was interesting and tasty! The pimento app was not your grandma's pimento. It was creamy and not abrasive at all. The Brussels sprouts were so good I could have eaten a couple helpings myself! The sauce is the same for the shrimp, so I was in sweet and spicy heaven! I want more right now just writing this review. The fam enjoyed the chorizo app.   I had moved on to the smoked old fashioned by then and was completely captivated! I added a video that you should check out or just go and order one. The smoke adds to the experience AND taste! Yum. They have a small, but very good, draft selection, creative cocktail menu, and the option to drink your own spirits if you're a member. I can't say enough that I love this place!  Hunter did an amazing job as our server. He was friendly, attentive, and showed his fantastic personality."

I personally prefer the good old fashion but there is a drink there for everybody's taste and if you're into spicy alcoholic drinks they do some of those just right as well!  While drinking we tried out some of their deviled eggs and I was happily impressed each one of them is for a flavor and unique although the Sriracha was my favorite!  I've had dinner here before and I can say it's worth it but for our trip we just had a couple drinks and sat on the patio which if that's all you're looking to do is completely OK this is a great place to go!!"

It seemed like most people visiting sat out on the patio or at the bar. We were celebrating our anniversary so we made a reservation on a weeknight, but unless you want to secure a spot outside, I don't think you'd need one.   We ordered the glazed brussel sprouts app, the carne asada fries app, and the sea bass to split. Each dish was delicious for different reasons. The glaze on the brussels was addicting, the queso on the fries was delish, and the sea bass came out piping hot with a tasty chimichurri and sautéed vegetables. I would recommend every dish we tried, but my favorite was by far the brussels. We topped dinner off with the blonde brownie w/ ice cream - yyyuuummmm.   For cocktails: Our waiter suggested the Love is Blind with a spash of pineapple - tricky little drink. It tasted like candy but found out halfway in that there was definitely a good amount of liquor in it! The G'old fashioned was classic and strong.   Service was top notch. I wish I remembered his name, but he was super friendly and had great recommendations."

Well I like it for it's modern atmosphere. We got drunken fried and all the cocktails seems good mixes just a bit more alcohol would be nice. One star knocked off because of that and the waitresses seems slightly uppity. No one extra welcoming and excited to converse with us aside from the smiling hostess.   Will still come back since I like the environment."

We got the following: -  Brussel sprouts - soo good, would get again! - shisito - pretty average tasting - pecan crusted chicken - very good  - steak frites - the steak was pretty bland for me but fries were delish  - my family loved the deviled eggs"

                "description": "I went here for the first time last week. The host asked me if I had a reservation, I did not, but they were still able to quickly get me a table. The atmosphere is very elegant, yet chill. The low light in the building added to the overall relaxed vibe. I ordered from the morning menu; there weren't as much options as I would have liked for there to be, so I just settled for the Calamari and Waffle Fries. The food came out much faster than I expected, so I am not surprised that it was a little cold. The food was delicious though... especially the sauce that came with the Calamari! The Ranch was very good and paired well with the food! The sweet tea was average, yet still good. The price is a little much for the quality/amount of the food. I plan on going back in the evening and ordering off of the evening menu."

                "description": "Date night for the wife and me. Stating off, the drinks were really good. Only downside was that we were looking forward to the cocktail flight but they don't allow on Saturday night (it's a major item on the menu - should be noted if it's only during the day).   For food, everything we had was really good. The Brussels sprouts and the fries (yes fries - you could actually taste the potato) were standouts. Lost of sauces to pair with things too. The only downer was the queso - good taste but the tostadas were a bit stale and the queso itself was a bit congealed by the time it reached the table.   Will be happy to come back - a great option for something a bit more upscale in Georgetown."

                "description": "I'll start with what The Golden Rule (TGR) got right.  The service was awesome.  Our server was very efficient and personable with great attention to detail.    The food arrived quickly and was good.    The seasoning on the waffle fries was something new.  It reminded me of Old Bay, but with a hint of brown sugar?  It actually worked well.  What needs to improve - I'm glad the window looking out onto the street is gilded with the phrase \"Always a Work in Progress..\" (or words to this effect) since I have some suggestions/observations.  There are three areas to improve - Seating, Selection, and Atmosphere.  First, Seating - why am I sitting on a couch using a coffee table to eat?  I'm dropping nearly two bills on a meal for three people and I'm sitting on a couch using a coffee table?  Maybe if I was just there for a drink, it would be ok.  But not to actually eat a meal.  (I'm sorry about the queso which dripped on the floor. But again - it is tough to eat queso at a coffee table.)  Also, sitting by the huge glass window feels like being in a fish bowl.. People walking down the sidewalk can stop and watch you eat.  Actually, they DO stop and watch.  It happened at least twice while we were there.   It reminded me of an old \"Twilight Zone\" episode. In the episode, an astronaut crashes on Mars and ends up on display in a Martian zoo.  (After he crashes, the astronaut is scared at first, but the Martians are very kind to him and give him a house to stay in.  The Martians show the astronaut the house has all the conveniences and plenty of food.  When the Martians leave, the astronaut discovers the front door is locked and the window won't open.  Later, the astronaut wakes up to find the window open, with dozens of Martians staring inside the house.  The astronaut realizes he is actually the newest exhibit in a Martian zoo, not in a real house.)  There was a sign out front, \"Earthling in his native habitat\"  That's what this seating felt like.   Next, Selection - the beer selection is very slim.  The beer portion on the menu was (verbatim) as follows:     \"Beers on Tap         Hazy IPA        Amber        Hefe        Lager  Ask your server for featured breweries...\"  I asked the server about the vague beer list:  SERVER:  \"And for you, sir?\" ME:          \"Yes, ma'am - Do y'all have Shiner?\" SERVER:  \"No, sir, we just have local beers.\" ME:          \"Awesome.  What do you have from Barking Armadillo?\"   SERVER:  \"Nothing.  What kind of beer are you looking for?\" ME:          \"Something like a Shiner?\" SERVER:   \"We have Brooklyn Lager.\" ME:          \"I'll just stick with water, ma'am...\"  Brooklyn? Local? Similar to Shiner?  You say you have \"local\" beers but yet you have nothing from the local brewery just on the other side of I-35?  As far as Brooklyn - Every so often, I find a restaurant (usually around Dallas) which lists Shiner on the \"Imported Beer\" portion.  I guess geography - specifically Texas geography - is not their strong point.  TGR has the opposite perspective, since apparently Brooklyn is now local to Georgetown.  Finally - Atmosphere.  It is very loud.  It wants to be trendy.  I'm not sure how to fix that.   Maybe this is why I had to sit on a couch."

Just need some live jazz and we are all set! We sat out on the patio and had drinks and apps. Our waitress was attentive and friendly.  Drinks - I had the Ontono - it is a heck ontoYES from me! Next time, I am going to try the Pissed off Machete.  Apps - pimento cheese is real good, deviled eggs are real good, and those carne asada fries are off the chain good! I see myself becoming a regular once I move to Georgetown this summer :) 10/10 recommend!"

                "description": "I was so impressed by The Golden Rule. From the decor to the atmosphere to the menu and creative bar offerings - this spot definitely takes it to the next level as far as dining in Georgetown goes. Everything on the appetizer menu was delicious - loved the deviled eggs and the steak against the grain. I really wish they offered the craft cocktail flight during dinner service as it looked really fun to try. I would absolutely recommend making a reservation to make sure you get a table. The only downside was the service could have been a little better. Several items that we ordered were forgotten and our waitress was not very friendly. However, overall I really enjoyed coming here and would love to come back to try brunch. Definitely a great option if you're looking to eat somewhere on the square."

However, we went there tonight and literally NOT ONE of the staff members were wearing masks?? None of the bartenders, none of the bussers, none of the kitchen staff (!) making the food?? I didn't realize this until after I ordered my drink ‍, so I asked for the check, chugged my drink, and ran. (Still left a nice tip- I worked in the service industry for years and would never deprive someone of that.) COVID is still very present and I'm confused as to why the hell they'd have their staff work maskless. It's not safe for the staff and it's not safe for the customers. I don't even feel comfortable ordering off Uber Eats anymore knowing that no one in the kitchen is wearing a mask.  I felt like a Karen leaving a note on the check even though it was a nice note. I just don't like to complain, but this is a safety issue I'd like to be resolved ASAP, so I can continue being a customer :("

The goat cheese makes it so creamy and the sharpness of it compliments well to the perfectly cooked burger patty.  The husband likes the Ahi Tuna burger. The ahi tuna is so fresh and all those ingredients meld together for a harmonious blend in your mouth.  Every one here is so nice and helpful and the place is always clean.  Good food, great staff keeps us coming back for more."

I didn't know how this place worked so I grabbed a table like normal but got kicked out by someone who was assigned that table lol now I know.   Got assigned another table and the service was fast and friendly. Got the bacon jam double and the big chuck with the bbq ranch fries. The fries were cold, unfortunately, but they were pretty decent so I assume it would have been good fresh. The burgers came out fresh though. Good taste without too much sodium. Even the sodas came out perfectly carbonated, not flat like at most restaurants.   I wouldn't call this place an infamous burger joint that I have to take my friends who visit, but I do appreciate the fresh, not overly salted burgers."

You have the option of regular buns, wheat buns or bun-less (they'll place the patty and toping in a salad bowl). Their sweet potato fries are probably my favorite sweet potato fries from anywhere.   Food is generally out pretty quick (I'd say within 15-20 minutes).   There isn't really a service to review since you order at the counter and someone brings your food out. If anything maybe they can have people checking in on tables?  They also have a full bar, so if you would like am adult beverage with your food you certainly can. I'd recommend their margarita. Or you can always get their milkshakes too!"

I heard hopdoddy was the best burger spot in Austin, so I had to try. Plus there was a special for $5 frozen margaritas.  Ahi Tuna Burger: Thick piece of tuna with beautiful flavor. the nori chips added a nice crunch to the mix and it was very filling.  El Bandito: I'm a mixed veggie, veggie patty type of girl and this burger was incredible. I loved the beans, corn, arugula and guacamole mix. The burger did fall apart very quickly, but still recommend this veggie option.  Hot Honey and Sage Sweet Potato Fries: A little bit on the salty end, but the hot honey with little pieces of sage was so delicious. Fries had a nice crisp to it and the portion size was decent.  Overall, hopdoddy had very quick service and good portion sizes. Will come back again!"

I had the El Bandito Burger (made it vegan), Hot Honey and Sage fries and a Paloma cocktail.  Burger: Both times El Bandito Burger were very salty. My group's food was salty as well! So disappointing. The food was edible, but hours later and I still have the saltiness in my my mouth.  Fries: My Hot Honey and sage fries were delicious. It salty, the heat covered it.  Cocktail: Paloma was very good and the bartender (didn't get his name) was nice.  Customer Service: stop at the register for nice. This is definitely a restaurant where you get your food, sit down, and then you are forgot about. Both times a server did not come back to check on us + we had to find someone for a need. But they seems to be the concept so I get it. And when I did speak with staff they were friendly.   Overall....we like it but due to SALT are looking forward to trying the South Congress location."

Not a fan of the tomatoes. Beer is pretty implied so it's a good place to go and drink and eat dry burgers if you're a tourist. Otherwise, I'd pick another place. This was my third time being here in 5 years and the quality of food hasn't changed much. Pre-covid, the staff was pretty unattentive and I had called people over a couple of times. I would say they were more attentive this time than the last two but still kind of annoying to see a bunch of them in a corner when I've been ready to go."

                "description": "When we moved to Austin 9 year ago, this place was Amazing and for years never disappointed. This was the place we brought out of town guests that wanted a unique Austin burger experience and for a burger arguably one of the best anywhere.   More recently they seem to have lost what made them special. The previous time we went there, thought was just an off night - although still pretty good and I personally enjoyed their serving of Impossible Burger.   Last night - saw more changes.. impossible burger replaced by beyond burger. Maine Root and Stubborn sodas replaced by Pepsi-Cola fare. Fresh leaf lettuce replaced with flavorless shredded lettuce. The fresh, large tomatoe slices - small and nonexistent. What used to be avocado slices now guacamole spread. I'm sure all these things save them a lot of money, but now their burgers not at all worth the money they charge. Honestly, much better burgers than we had for half the price in Austin!  No one on our family who ordered a variety of their burger offerings found enjoyment in what was previously a special treat. Now - their truffle fries and fries in general, still great as they always have been. About the only good thing I can say.   We used to stand in line to get in - glad there was no line out the door last night... and line or no line, short of hearing things change back to what made Austin original Hopdoddy tops for burgers before the cheapening - last night was our last time there. And off our list for out of town visitors.   Such a shame. This has been our family's favorite burger place for close to a decade. Now reduced to over priced fast-food fare.  2/8 Short update... appreciate the reply - did send an email on 2/1, a full week ago as requested -  zero reply to it. Alrighty."

I recognize the service industry is struggling, but all the things I loved about Hopdoddy's is either gone or was questionable from the visit today. Turkey option gone. Under seasoned fries, soggy bun, and they forgot my sons meal. Not the same Hopdoddy's I remember fondly."

                "description": "I rented a party bus through this company a couple weeks ago. In the beginning, Robert was extremely accommodating and friendly. And our driver, Terrell, was great. We got dropped off at COTA for a show and had a great time!  But where it turned south was at the end of the night. I texted our driver 30 minutes before we needed to be picked up (like he requested) and he said no problem. Then we left the concert and were walking to the pickup spot where I gave him a call. He said he got in an accident but would only be 20 minutes and I said that's fine. 20 minutes roll by and I gave him a call again, no answer, but texted and said it would be another 20 minutes. We ended up waiting in the cold for almost an hour and well after most people had left COTA. Multiple people in our party ended up just taking ubers because they didn't want to wait. The whole point of a bus is so you don't have to wait.  The next day, I texted Robert saying we would like a refund for the extra hour we paid for waiting that we wouldn't have used if we had been picked up on time. He said he would call to discuss but never did. I've now sent him multiple emails - mind you, being incredibly nice about it. All I asked for was an hour refunded back - not the whole thing, not even half. But still no response.  The customer service level of this company is terrible should anything go wrong. So hire them at your own risk."

We had rented a party bus on pretty short notice to take a Bachelor Party to and from Lake Travis and Robert and team were amazing.   It was also Prom weekend so the schedule was packed for them but they still took care of us and worked with our schedule.   Our boat ended up staying out on the water longer than scheduled which through our plans all over the place and Robert was there waiting on time. Given his packed schedule, the driver did have to leave without us but Robert made sure to get me in contact with another service and they sent a bus over right away.   All in all, it was an incredible experience!"

Missing panels inside of bus missing or duct tape together.  Another party bus parked next to the one we had and it was so obvious how terrible looking our bus looked.   Can't believe owners would let this bus represent their company. Hope they use our $700 toward getting it fixed.   Driver was pleasant."

But how is that supposed to work when you have a huge group? I called austin nites party rentals for a few reasons 1. I love puns and 2. I'm am austinite and 3. My group was over ten people and we wanted to go out and have nothing to worry about. Great party bus, great personable driver, great experience definitely reccomend these guys!! DONT DRINK AND DRIVE!! Call someone you can trust call Austin Nites!!"

                "description": "I'm incredibly frustrated with this business.  We had spoken a couple times in the months before I decided to book and I initially felt great about potentially booking with these friendly people.  When it came time to book I called them and was told, once again, that our requested date was open and we talked out an agreement.  The owner tells me we're good to go, and that all he needed me to do now was to send him my information so that he could get a contract sent that same day.  I'd explained to him that I was booking this bus ride to and from a party boat, and that I would be booking with them that day as well.   SO, I get off the phone and send my info.  I call my party boat folks to let them know I've just confirmed my bus, and I'm ready for a boat.  I book with them based on my discussion with these guys and put down $400 to hold our reservation.  It's been two weeks since I last spoke with this company and they have ignored my calls, texts, voicemails trying to figure out why the contract hasn't come through.  Our event is next month, and at this point I've been researching new solutions, and unfortunately the new solution means I can't use the same boat company, and therefore I've lost my $400 deposit.  I did not have this money to lose, but after being ghosted by this company I guess I have to take the loss and move on.  They seem like nice people, and it takes A LOT to get on here and write a negative review, but this has caused me a lot of stress and I want to prevent this from happening to anyone else.  I hope at some point I find out a reasonable explanation and can revise this review, but not counting on it.  We'll see I guess."

                "description": "BOOK WITH THIS COMPANY!  Robert did a solid job taking me and a bunch of my friends to Lake Travis and back on July 4th. His price was WAY lower than other companies I called, being the ONLY one that actually sticked to his regular prices during this busy day. He arrived early and was 100% responsive to my emails and phone calls. He arrive early to pick us up and was extremely friendly and professional. He helped us carry our coolers and accommodate everything on the bus.  The bus itself is amazing. Seats are stacked in two rows facing each other, which is great for dancing and socializing, since you are actually facing half of the crowd. The sound system is also very good. I almost feel that the bus trip was even more fun that the boat.   In summary, Austin Nites Ent. is the best on price/quality, Robert and his wife are responsive, professional and friendly, and the whole experience I had with them is positive. Would highly recommend anyone to use it, and will definitely consider using them again if I ever need to.  Thank you guys!!!!!"

                "description": "We rented a party bus from Robert for my brother's 30th birthday. They were one of the only companies I found that didn't increase their rates because of prom season. I called about 10 other companies looking for fun and safe travels with almost all of them being ridiculously overpriced to take advantage of the prom goers. Robert was very accommodating, professional, and had awesome rates. He called two days before the scheduled time of arrival to check in and verify everything was still good to go. He asked if there were any changes in the amount of people and offered a bigger bus just in case. Our drivers, Patrick and Joe were awesome! Patrick called me early the day of to verify everything and let me know he'd be there at 8 and then called again when they were almost to our pickup location. They arrived right on time with an awesome bus just for us. He had coolers with ice, a flat screen tv, music system, AC and even a bathroom in the back. What more could you ask for? Part of the evening was spent at Graham's Central Station in Pville. We didn't realize prior that Graham's doesn't serve food anymore and had to order pizza to the bus. Patrick gladly retrieved our pizza and brought it to us when it arrived. We all had a blast, felt safe and were taken care of. Highly recommend Austin NItes and shout out to Patty PartyWagon, if you had a Yelp page, I'd write a review for you too."

The tour had a nice mix of small, quaint wineries with an individualized experience, as well as more popular spots with an equally enjoyable guest experience."

We seat down at a booth in the bar as usual since there were two open booths but we were walked out by an employee who I did not recognized. He was  stating it requires a reservation. We are regulars and we always tip well so we felt very offended and came to chillis were they made us feel welcome. We usually dont have a problem at bjs but this was not a good experience."

They said five minutes for them to clean a table. We waited 15 and left. They didn't check in or anything. And there were about 50 open tables.   The group of three behind us was given a 40 minute wait for seating... what in the world is going on with this establishment. Disappointing. Being under staff is one thing, being non attentive and rude is another."

BJ's as always delivered on both.  Our waitress was very friendly and the restaurant was clean.  I had the chicken tacos, and they were very tasty.  Some of the other dishes at the table were parmesan encrusted chicken and broccoli and burgers.  The broccoli was super disappointing and had no flavor not even salt.  Overall it was  a good experience and a solid go to."

                "description": "Okay so I came to this BJ's on the 29th of December after coming from the symphony with my little one and another party.   Act One: When we arrived, after being seated, we were greeted by our server. I ordered a glass of vino from the bar. When the vino arrived, it tasted like the glass that was poured was from a bottle that had already been corked and sitting out. While I understand that a restaurant is not a wine bar serving blends such as a 2007 Klein Constantia Vin de Constance, I do expect the mid-level glasses of Cabernet Sauvignon served to be palatable. Accordingly, I asked the wine be returned to the bartender as it tasted turned. When the waitress returned the glass to the bartender noting my comments about the glass coming from a bottle that seemed to have been opened/turned, he laughed as if I was being ridiculous.   Act Two:  Moving past this debacle, I ordered something else from the bar. My party and I also ordered nachos and mozzarella sticks.  The mozzarella sticks that were brought out to the table were COLD! The nachos were okay but clearly not traditional nachos, but that was not expected from this type of establishment.   The presentation of the check:  The turned wine was still on the check when it was presented to me. I asked that it be removed. When the waitress did come back with the revised check, it wasn't an itemized revision, thus I could not determine if the bill was indeed correct. I did not want to wait for the waitress to return again with an itemized bill as the rest of the visit here was less than stellar. Therefore, I paid the bill as it was and quickly left."

The drinks we ordered (mules) were terrible. We couldn't taste any ginger beer and we were given one wrong one. They were out of the majority of their appetizers. Lastly, it was freezing outside this day and also inside. Our poor child was shivering. We will not be returning."

                "description": "Our family in Austin for reason known to them like this restaurant. Huge location and plenty of seats and many screens with sports on the Saturday we went.   Out of the group of 10 of us 1 was vegans and 2 vegetarian. Decent Vegetarian choices but next to nothing vegan choice and the server also not confident out the vegetarian choices which are or can be made vegan.   Did get seated properly and food did arrive fairly soon. The service attentive. The food - the vegetarian pizza and baked Ziti pasta dish were good. The Peruvian Quinoa Bowl was classified as vegetarian but could not get a clear answer if it was vegan as all the questions we asked came as negative. So the menu is not perhaps classified correctly. Even the Guacamole and Chips were not classified as vegetarian!"

                "description": "I had been to a BJ's before in New York and found my experience here to be much more in line with a Cheesecake Factory type restaurant than before which was more like a sports bar. The menu here is long enough that you could stare at it for hours on end and not feel confident in your order. Most of the dishes have enormous portions, with one notable exceptions, and the desserts are over the top.   My group started with the honey sriracha Brussels sprouts and the nachos. Knowing a few pizookies were coming later, I passed on the nachos. The Brussels sprout were cooked to a nice consistency where there was slight crunch. The flavor was good, but it was much closer to buttery than honey sriracha.   For my entree I had the shrimp quinoa bowl, which was the only dish to come out where i wished the portion was a bit bigger. It ridiculously small, but it was smaller than you'd get at a fast casual bowl place for about 1.5x the price. Unfortunately it also paled in comparison to most fast casual bowl places in terms of flavor. Any bite I had that wasn't covered in the hot sauce I asked for on the side was a disappointment compared to the ones that were.   By far the best part of the meal were the pizookies. For those unfamiliar (including me before this meal) a pizookie is a warm cookie in a small deep dish pizza plate with a scoop or two of ice cream on top. It is as incredible as it sounds and they have upwards of 10 different kinds. If you're with a large group I recommend sharing a few and immediately slipping into a food coma.   Overall, nothing too special, but for 3$ pizookies on Tuesday you can't go wrong."

It was clean well lit and our servers were prompt friendly and helpful. We never had to ask for any. Two of us had the chicken lunch and it was great.  The perfect amount well seasoned and good presentation, I definitely recommend it.  The chicken was lemon thyme and it was wonderful I will get it again for sure. I know allot of people are apprehensive about going out to restaurants, support them even if you get it to go."

                "description": "Wow. So much for family friendly. We came in, took the hostess forever to ask us how many, since she had her back to the door... Told her we were 7. She went back and forth looking around. Finally came back and said she had no tables for 7 so we could wait 30 to 45 min for the nite servers to arrive.  WHAT?! NO offer to split the table, no offer to clean a table where 6 had just left. We said we'd have to go elsewhere and we were sorry, but they were losing 7 covers. Her response? YEAH, THAT'S FINE WITH ME, WHATEVER. Never looked up from her cell phone either. No wonder you need help. What you have there now doesn't qualify as help. Bad service, won't go back. Too many other places with decent front end staff that actually want the business."

I walked-in and went to the bar area to sit myself. I sat at a table in the bar area and wasn't served. This guy working that area at completely ignored me and proceeded to serve everyone else who came in after me and sat themselves. I eventually had to get up and leave. I ended up at Yard House which had plenty of options and even a great steak. I was treated very well and promptly. I now know where to go and not go in my neighborhood in Austin. Again, who doesn't serve a customer?! I mean, I understand getting annoyed with your job but when you start denying service based on appearances maybe it's time to move on.   Maybe you'll have a better experience but be prepared to wait or even not be served."

                "description": "So I am starting a whole new set of reviews based on TO GO services. This whole Covid19 thing has limited dining..but it should not limit quality.   I was grateful for BJs being open later than most other restaurants. However I was greatly disturbed by some of the I consistences. The most important problem I had was Frozen Chicken/super cold chicken. I ordered a chicken over rice pilaf dish, and the chicken was stone cold ( must have been ore frozen) after a long night I didn't feel like complaining since the other food was edible.  I specifically asked for no spicy items or spices on my sides , my veggies were laced with a spicy seasoning I can not identify.   The ribs were cooked well not great but he'll for this pandemic I'll take it.   I am giving this place a 3 (should be a two ) only because the person who helped me was so nice and accommodating, and everything was clean, and peaceful.   Support them but do complain if something is incorrect. I realized that as a supportive customer in a pandemic, the we shouldn't accept a lower quality of food."

I think I've tried every flavor onthe menu at some point, including fire in the hole. If your a newbie get the wing platter...20 wings and can get 4 different flavors without being charged extra. It isn't on the menu, it used to be, but hasn't been for years, but they still offer it if you ask. Another favorite is the Philly cheesesteak. I have them toss it in the sauce before adding it to my sandwich. They will do it, but only if you ask. Their loaded waffle fries are great, but I like their chips just as much, if not more. We have traveled 2 to 3 hours one way just to eat there. We enjoy it that much."

We were quoted 30 min wait for a table. We waited over an hour and when we checked with the staff, a red haired hostess sarcastically offered us to remove us from the waitlist as the solution to our problem!!  The kid at the front door kept saying he didn't know which party was next on line. Very sad. I'm the mean time I witness how some staff members wear gloves but the majority didn't (including our server). The tables did get sanitized but not the chairs that everyone's has to touch to be able to sit ... the door handles were not wiped once in the hour, we were waiting outside for our table. Food was average. Came back to my hotel room sticking to grease, yikes."

The wait times are usually very inaccurate and this time was no different, when my party and I were were quoted a 30 minutes wait that turned into an hour. However, the stars are for the food. The holy mac and fried pickles are my absolute favorite appetizers here and are must gets. Because of the temporary price increase on wings, I went with the boneless basket with my chicken go-to flavors of baker's gold (spicy) and goldrush (sweet, not spicy) and my fries tossed in spicy garlic parmesan. Food was great and was enough for me to have leftovers afterwards despite me eating quite a bit compared to the average human."

As soon as I walked in there was I would assume a manager because he was dressed in a white collar shirt(other employees had black shirts) He was older Hispanic male with white hair. Anyways we walked right past each other and he did not say a single word to me. Not a \"Hey, hi, hello how are you doing\" nothing. It literally takes five seconds to say \"welcome\" or anything for that matter. I've worked in customer my whole life and I'd never ever think it would be okay to ignore a PAYING customer after making eye contact. I NEVER leave reviews unless it's POSITIVE.

When I spoke to management they were adamant that their behavior was inappropriate. Everytime I go in there, there is at least a dozen workers doing nothing and then the shelves will be bare. God forbid you need something on a holiday that falls on the weekend because nothing will be stocked and 2 registers will be open with lines out the door. Meanwhile the workers leave registers unattended and stand around playing grab ass all day. Today I had the pleasure of the same rude cashier and when I asked for management I was escorted out by 2 of them insinuating that IM THE PROBLEM when I have spent more than enough money at their establishment.  I have complained several times and they dont care. I don't plan on going back anytime soon. Want some advice? Fire about half of your employees, put a quarter of em on the cashiers and make the other ones stock the damn shelves."

I've never purchased alcohol here before, but we were running critically low on supplies during the stay-at-home orders. A friend told me they had curbside at Total Wine and More. I called to confirm there was the ability to have contactless curbside pick up and the person I spoke with was very nice on the phone (even though I assume they are getting an annoying amount of calls during this time).   Placing my order online was extremely easy. The UI was intuitive and was not confusing at all. There were a few points where they reminded you not to pick up your order until you received an email (or text if you opt in) to pick up your order. I appreciated the multiple points of clarity.   Both times we have ordered (once on a Saturday and once on a Thursday), our order was ready within the hour!  Pick up was easy. All you have to do is pull up to the marked, designated spots and send a text to the number on the sign. You have to provide your spot number and name. Once they come out, just hold your ID up to the window. Then they will place your order in your trunk. Easy peasy!   Definitely give this place a try if you're looking for contactless curbside!"

I called the store and they said they would reattempt delivery that night with another driver. At 8pm I called again to reconfirm so I didn't have to come in -- and again, I'd get it if they had to cancel, but I just needed heads up.  Minutes before closing, I got an automated email that said it was canceled and there was no call or additional note. I'm very disappointed. I know that they use a delivery service like Uber so it's not all within their control, but what poor customer service to not explain the situation, or to personalize the situation in any particular way beyond a click/cancel. It's wine, so it's not the end of the world, but next time I'll just pop into an H-E-B."

Still the same HUGE selection.  Still Conte Priola Pinot Grigio.  Sadly no Kitchen Sink red blend, but HEB carries it here.  Still fun tastings on the weekends.    Annoying cashier girl who awkwardly scans bottles in my cart despite me wanting to put them on the checkout conveyor thingie.    Overall a 4-5 star experience every time.  But yesterday we had a 10 star experience.  OMGoodness, you just have to find Stephen in the wine area.  He'll ask a few questions and recommend wines based on your tastes.  You will love each of his suggestions.  You will love his stories.  This sparkling wine was named after the granddaughter of the vineyard owner....  yes please.    Best liquor store ever."

The good stuff apparently!They have a huge selection of wines and also offers samples too! Plus they have snacks and cheeses and peanuts.We even bought shot glasses and a wine bottle opener! So far our favorite is the banana cream rum and limoncello! If you have t been here you gotta go! They have something for everyone.We found a California wine we really like from Napa also got a pineapple Rum from Barbados!The selection is unbelievable and I will be back!We didn't even make it to the beer section! They also sell glasses for wine and liquor!"

There was plenty of hand sanitizer available at the entrance. There was a tasting station near the entrance with a nice lady offering samples of Mezcal from behind a plexiglass. We were warmly greeted by every employee we passed and offered assistance. The employees are very knowledgeable about their wines, I just told them the taste I was looking for and they led me right over to the options that matched. There's also a large refrigerated beef room in the back. Checkout was a breeze and our associate was engaging and sweet."

I was particularly impressed with the way they handled the  COVID mandates;  A sign was on the front door noting masks must be worn, ample hand sanitizers and wipes were readily at the entrance, and the carts are always clean.  From the very beginning of the pandemic, I was always comfortable shopping at Total Wine.  The store is arranged in such a way that although busy, there was plenty of room to social distance, including at check-out."

The samples are always plentiful and varied.  They have great deals and a huge wide varied selection as well as some high class expensive liquors for refined tastes. They also stock a ungodly amount of small sample, airplane sized bottles of liquor of famous and lesser known types.  They always have several check outside running and lots of neat extra items like gift sets, hangover cures, bottle openers, margarita machines and stuff to create your own bar.   For the holidays they have some unique items such as the moose cup from National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.  Check it out. I promise you will find new and known drinks and much more besides."

The liquor prices are better than those at other liquor stores/chain stores.  The beer selection is excellent.  The beer prices are competitive, and in most cases slightly lower than HEB and other grocery chains.  It is the best place for champagne, in both selection and price."

The problem is living in Texas you cannot buy the pods online from Keurig.  The only stores that carry them in Texas are Total Wine in Houston and Specs in Houston.  I called Specs and the person I talked to was friendly, she knew what I was talking about and said she would look into the distributor and how they could get them in Austin.  I called Total Wine and had to talk to 4 different people, none of whom seemed interested in doing what Specs offered to do.  We place monthly orders with Total Wine for wine and spend a significant amount of money.  Guess we will move our wine purchasing to Specs :("

                "description": "A shout-out to my friends for inviting me to this. I think they were trying to prove me wrong. Here's what I mean: I'm a wine drinker - a dry, red wine drinker. On occasion, I'll sip an appletini or two. During game night, we were talking about one of our favorite subjects, liquor, and I mentioned not liking cognac. Well, my girl, Nickie, told me I've got it wrong and not to knock it until I've tried it again at this event- hence an invitation to a Hennessy tasting event at Total Wine. Talk about a lovely time! They served food (thank goodness), Hennessy (oh, yeah!), and even gave us recipe cards to try at home - oh, and did I mention the stainless steel martini-shaker? I learned a lot about the origins of this drink and how it's made. It was quite interesting. Everyone was having a good time, and the samples were very yummy. Real yummy! I'm a convert and hate to admit it. I hope my friends don't read this review!"

The employees act like they will run over you so you have to walk defensively. Seriously, it is like customers are invisible and they are running a warehouse because even when they cut you off, and they will, they don't say excuse me. If you are lucky enough to find what you are looking for you will get a great value but then you schlep to the checkout lane and that is hit or miss as well. Well, mostly miss in my experience. Good luck!"

They have a great artisan soda selection, pretty much any ready-to-drink coffee you could want and some great snack options that are definitely a large step up from your typical convenience store.  But that's not really why you come here. Sunrise is THE neighborhood spot for craft beer. Walls of fridge cases full of beer on top of the tightly packed shelves displaying almost every beer you could want.They easily have one of the best selections of Jesterking in Austin (outside of the brewery). On top of that, Sam is the man! Become a regular and from time to time they'll hold something for you when it comes in (obviously within reason). It's nice to walk into a store and be instantly recognized. Not only that, if something just came in that fits the type of beer we are usually looking for, Sam remembers and lets us know.  LOVE this place."

She suggested that we go to Sunrise and I said ok, I know nothing about the northlands so lead me in that direction!   When we pulled up I was like ... ok this looks like your typical citgo gas station ... nothing special from the outside at all.  Then as I got closer to the door and could see a bit on the inside I quickly started realizing that I had pulled up to something pretty amazing.  The sun definitely had risen ... this was like the Live Oak of South Austin, but for the Austinites of the northlands.   Pretty much anything local you can get your hands on you can find in here, which makes it cool.  Craft beers out the wazoo, fancy special drinks of all kinds, specialty popcorn made in atx, lavender soap, or organic chocolate of all flavors for your liking.  This place was definitely a surprise to roll up on.    The other thing that I could tell makes this place so special was the staff.  My friend that took me here knew them by name and carried on a conversation with them about what they were doing for the holiday.  They also discussed the beer that he had recommended to her on her last visit.  I mean this was first class, friendly service.    When I am back in the northlands of Austin I will always remember this unassuming, hidden gem."

Yes, there is gas outside (at least I think the pumps work), but inside is everything BUT seven eleven goods.  That's how I have driven past this place a thousand times and never knew of it's existence until a Hopdoddy bartender recommended my husband stop here to get a hard to find beer.    You won't find the typical junk food or grease pit delights here.  Instead you will find organic, gluten free, all natural treats and snacks (from local Austin companies when possible).  Instead of Hershey Bars you will find boutique quality chocolate.   Most importantly you will find an amazing selection of beer, ciders, mead, and wine at decent prices.  Often you will find hard to find items here, that you can't find anywhere else.  Everywhere else had run out of Eastside Pineapple Cider, except for here. The owners are extremely knowledgeable and nice.  Sam is great.  They have such passion for their job and the store.  So excited that Sunrise is in my new hood.  This place is amazing!  They have an active twitter feed that keeps you posted on new items that come in and any tastings that they might be doing.  I don't often set up tweet notifications, but for this place I did!"

There are several refrigerated cases and two main aisles chock full of a variety of craft beer for sale, including some of the harder-to-find bombers and special releases.  What you won't find is the most competitive pricing, *if* you can find the same beer at Whole Foods, Central Market or Highland Market   Recent Pricing Comparisons (rounded up a penny): * Stone Xocoveza  6-pack: Sunrise - $17 / Central Market - $15 / Whole Foods - was on sale for $15, now $17 but with a case discount = $15.30 * Founders Backwards Bastard 6-Pack: Sunrise - $18 / Highland Market - $15.60 * Prairie Artisan Pirate Bomb 12 oz bottle: Sunrise - $13 / Whole Foods - $12 / Highland Market - $12 * Deschutes Dissident bomber: Sunrise - $18 / Whole Foods - $16 * Epic Double Barrel Big Bad Baptist bomber: Sunrise - $18 / Whole Foods - $16 (in the 'secret' section) / Highland Market - $17  Pro Tip: You should bring your own bag or cardboard carrier if you are planning to stock up.

The incredible beer selection aside.. wine in a city like atx should be more of a thing and this place is a brilliant start. You can get a crisp Portuguese white for under $10 or a beautiful $50++ biodynamic rosé from the south of France. All kinds of fantastic reds, too. How exciting to see the remnants of unpasteurised goodness at the bottom of a bottle when you pull it out. It's not just about drinking organically it's about knowing what you're drinking, where it's made, who's making it, how to enjoy it the way the maker would want you to, supporting these smaller family oriented, sustainable, traditional winemakers without all the aids/additives/headache inducing sulfites. These are actual living wines that the owner clearly has a mad passion for. Sam truly is the man, thank you sir and I'll be sending everyone I know to your shop"

Imagine a convenience store with chips and drinks and and beer and wine, but everything is unique different and definitely thought through. Stuff you could find at Whole foods.    Speaking with Sam the manager, he talks about passion versus business, and he makes a good point.

I am dropping a star from my previous review, because Sunrise is not a great place to find truly limited releases.  Those are held back and distributed to friends and insiders before normal customers have a chance. Other shops seem to be more transparent and fair about access to really sought-after beers. But, hey, if you are one of the guys that gets the hookup here, I'm sure life is good.  Sunrise probably deserves a better review, but I am disappointed in this business practice. I will probably be going elsewhere from now on."

                "description": "Our party of four ate at Plucker's to celebrate my wife's and my son's birthdays which both occur in April. Thanks to Plucker's Club both of them had $16 of their meals free. The food was excellent, but the service was lackluster. Our waiter only checked on us twice. The second and final time he came to the table and said \"Are y'all ok on drinks?\" with my daughter's and my glasses sitting empty. He brought us new drinks and didn't check on us again. My wife wanted to order dessert, but he didn't stop to check on us again. Finally, my daughter flagged him down and asked if we could have the check and a to go box.  I can't be sure, but I suspect the subpar service may have been due to the fact that $32 of our bill was free and he figured the tip would be that much less. I usually advise the server ahead of time that we tip on the total before discounts. I forgot to do so this time.  He ended up getting about a $16 tip on a $55 total.  We'll definitely be back as Plucker's service and food are usually excellent. Next time we eat with a discount, I'll be sure and let the waiter know that we tip off of the total before discounts are deducted."

                "description": "It is difficult to say why, but it he place has really gone down significantly since I was last there.   It was unusually vacant for noon on a Monday. After struggling to get the attention of the 3 people standing at the check in desk, I finally got seated. The trim across an entire side of the table was ripped partially off and it was clear that the dividers between the booths had not been cleaned in a long time.   Immediately, I noticed the menu was stuck to itself when I tried to open it. And then noticed there was actually bits of food inside the menu, so they clearly hadn't been wiped clean. Next was the flatware, which had obviously not been cleaned well. Our waiter was very responsive and apologetic for both.   The chicken tender salad was edible but not well prepared, chunks of lettuce half the size of my hand. Edible, not great.   Again, our waiter was engaging and nice. But as we walked out, the three staff at the front desk couldn't be bothered to acknowledge us.   Just poorly managed. Unfortunately. We won't be going back."

                "description": "So I walk into the location and it's freezing as i am informing them they seem not to care at all. I am 281lbs and i had to walk out from the bar area because it was way to cold. I walk out shivering! Not one person or staff member cared. They just stated you can just get on a waiting list. Which i did! But where is the common sense l? Its 80 outside and it feels like 67 inside???   Why is this the culture?  Customer: it's freezing in here Lakeline Pluckers: Well do you want to wait for 45mins to an hour?  How is this your business motto? No, ok paying patron we can take your concern seriously and see what can be done. It was so cold the servers glass started to fog up!! What type of weather manipulation is this?   Imagine a cold beer  and its under 66 degrees!! Un comfortable!   I swear if I stayed in that section long enough it would have start snowing. They dont even have to put ice in the drinks for crying out loud.   I also informed staff to address the situation or i will write a review in regards. Just acknowledge its over kill! They literally ignored me! So Pluckers you have two issues at this location the temperature and the fact your staff provides customer service but no customer concerns is a oxy moronic!   They way they duck my concerns rebranding should change name to Duckers!!  Any way wear a sweater, jacket and or bear skin if you going to the bar for wings. If you have any concerns they will kill you with kindness and ignore you with repetition as if you didnt hear them and also voice a concern. Based on my bites rating (check other post)   They get *2 bites and nibble!  Food Beetle"

Drinks, well I am pregnant so no drinks here for the time being but last time we ordered a michelada she was very confused and was trying to give us the drink with the chicken wing on top. so we had to describe it to her and show her a pic from previous orders in the past and explain multiple time we just wanted the plain michelada no need for the frills - IMO i think it is just the area we were in."

If you still have room get real food.  Everything on the menu is amazing and worth the calories you'll have to work off the next week.  Pro tip - if getting wings, get them with sauce on the side so they stay crispy.  At least that's what we do!"

                "description": "Family has been coming to pluckers for a number of years now and we have never strayed from our order of spicy ranch wings- that's how much we love them. The spiciness of the wings vary a lot though, with sometimes being not spicy at all and others being a bit too spicy. But if you don't want to get too messy eating wings and want a good dry rub, then I highly recommend the spicy ranch. You can also never go wrong with their tater tots or Mac and cheese- tater tots are always fresh and crunchy and the Mac and cheese is nicely baked and cheesy.   Overall, service has always been pretty good and is a great place to come to if you're craving chicken wings and want to watch sports and drink at the same time!"

                "description": "This place was really crowded on a Saturday. We had some time between basketball games and wanted to grab a bite to eat. I have not been to Pluckers in a while and I guess they have changed a few things.  We didnt have a lot if time so we sat outside, it was covered. They had the plastic rolled down and heaters going so it wasn't bad. We were seated close to a heater then they asked us to move because we were too close to an exit? We didn't understand. Either way we were moved away from the heater and closer to other patrons.   We ordered wings, both grilled and fried.  The dry rubs aren't as good to me so I had grilled wings with the buffalo hot sauce.  The staff was just fine, did a good job of refilling drinks, checking in with us, etc.   What they brought out were chicken strips, not wings. I was a little disappointed in this, they were tough and stringy as well. Maybe it is due to Covid, I dont know but I had prepared for wings. Along with these being chicken strips and not wings there was a substandard amount of buffalo sauce on my order.  Overall it was ok, edible and met a basic human need of food but I will wait awhile before going back and check if they have wings or strips before I order."

                "description": "There's no doubt about it, Pluckers is my absolute favorite wing joint in the Austin area. Their wings are just the best and their different sauces always satisfy any craving I have - whether that be sweet, savory, spicy, or crying spicy (shout-out fire in the hole!) the wings are big and crunchy and they always have some good cold beer to pair them with! If you're a fan of Micheladas, you'll love them here too! Especially the pickled green beans they add!   Their rewards program is awesome if you're a frequent buyer. You pay $20 and earn 1 point per every $1 spent on food. Once you get to 100 points, you can redeem for $10 off your bill. They also have specials which you can get for free when buying two entrees so really, the membership pays for itself rather quickly!   There's room for improvement in the Service but other than that, I love some Pluckers!"

It was another 50-55 minutes for our wings, burger, and fries. When it finally arrived the burger and fries were already cold.  We noticed togo orders were flying out the door the entire time we were there. I can only assume that's why dine-in orders took so long. So yeah, this was an awful experience."

I ordered a Mac and cheese kids meal with a side of fries. When we got home and opened it up there were barely any fries. It very irritating that I paid $6.50 for pretty much nothing.

Several months ago, just as COVID was starting to escalate, we sat in the bar area and I saw the waitress carry my glass by the top.  I complained.  Several times since, when we sat in the bar area the service was horrible. They took forever ttake and deliver our orders, messed up our orders etc...  We decided that the service in the bar area was so bad we didn't want to sit there again.   Tonight, I used the pluckers app to join the wait list. We waited for 10  or 12 minutes. Once we were there the text said we only had three minutes to checkin (way too short in my opinion).. You can wait longer than that in line.   When we got to the host stand they asked us if... we minded sitting in the bar!! ??  My wife, of course, said NO.   The hostess basically rolldd her eyes then told us that she could add us to the waitlist again... At the bottom! ... And it would be another 15 minutes!  We left.  We are now eating at Texas Roadhouse."

Recent visit on 5/29 both adult \"10 wing combos\" came out with the wings over cooked   What this location consistently does is over fry the kids meal \"chicken bites\". They come out hard as a rock and you can't even cut them with a knife.   I really like pluckers but the lakeline location closest to my home has gotten to the point it's worth driving to another location or entirely different establishment.  On a trip to San Antonio recently, I stopped by the pluckers in selma the food was great and really highlighted how bad the lakeline location is in comparison. I guess they don't have to try anymore since there's typically a line out the door"

They run around chaotically and can't handle anything. If you sit at the bar high top area you will wait 20+ minutes between food orders and drink refills. They do not bus the tables and bar top. It's a complete mess. Stuff stacks up. Why or how Plucker's corporate hasn't fixed this location yet is mind boggling.   Total incompetence. Food is cold. Food takes forever. Servers ring up extra charges. They forget drinks and napkins, they sneakily upcharge you for 2 wing dipping sauces when 1 is not enough for 10 wings."

The meat market here has almost everything you can get at Fiesta and at the same price as well.  I highly recccomend their carnitas and the green salsa you get with it. That was some of the freshest salsa I have had in Austin. If you're tired of the parking, long lines and the large crowds then come here."

As much as i love me a good breakfast taco, a breakfast burrito was a staple in San Francisco for me. These guys got it down. Same with there Carne Asada Burrito. My mouth was watering as I watched them make the delicious treat that I was about to consume. They are the gods among mexican food, the queen of sheeba, the conquestadors of cheese. I will be back, alot too.  Great spot to find today. BOOM."

                "description": "That I've lived within walking distance of this place for 4 months and never set a foot inside is a great injustice.  What appears at first glance to be a medium-sized convenience store attached to a gas station is in fact a small grocery store, complete with produce, dairy, a meat market, basic staples and a decent beer selection. There's also an excellent and cheap short order taqueria within.  The offerings are overwhelmingly Mexican as the name implies (half of an aisle is dedicated to La Costeña products alone) but they have quite a bit beyond that too, just about anything you would need in a pinch in the way of canned vegetables.  Best of all, it's CHEAP. Grocery store prices rather than convenience store prices."

La Familia doesn't just have the typical gas station junk food (although they do have it). It's like a mini grocery store. They also have a taqueria inside - get tacos! Get migas! Don't forget to get an Alligator Ice on your way out. Man.... so sugary and delicious.   I would choose La Familia over any Walgreens just to pick up a few groceries because as the others mentioned - everything is reasonably priced."

The furniture can either be fairly well made or rickety junk.  But burning $300 for something they have well made is a lot better than finding a similar piece elsewhere for $1000+. The food selection, while bizarre, has some interesting things you really can't find elsewhere.  We don't seem to buy wine there though."

The lady checks for me and says yes but we only have the floor model left and you can have it but we need to break it down. So we turn around go up there and we had some tools with us and the staff jumped into action and started to lay out cardboard and assisted my hubby in taking it apart. Then they scanned and saw that the match bench was on sale too and then tracked down another one for me in RR which was still in the box; SCORE! So I got a new dinning table and two matching benches at an amazing savings... BUT wait it gets better as I am checking out the associate asks me if I am an \"Explorer Member\" and asked if I would like to join and explains the amazing savings and perks. Needless to say I signed up right then and there AND I saved another 20% so I got all of that for $400 bucks.  Pros: great savings, AMAZING helpful staff, variety of products, quality of goods and they have a \"member savings\" program. Cons: Only issues I that when we went in there the table has the original pricing on there, had I not looked online I wouldn't have known to inquire... however this worked in my favor so I almost could count that as a pro lol"

Although it reminds me of those two stores, I believe that World Market offers their own unique products.  I was navigating the interwebs for the perfect relatively priced end table. Do you know how hard that is?! Yes I can get one from Amazon, but they look tacky. Yes I know Target sells some, but they look cheap. And no I'm not going to spend $300 at West Elm for one!   And then I found World Market. A good looking table...check! At a relatively fair price...check! After looking at their catalogue, it probably took me 3 minutes to make up my mind about buying one.   But before I went to the store to purchase the table, I made sure to sign up for their World Market Explorer program so I could get a 10% coupon. After printing out the coupon, I was out the door and on my way.  Although I only had one goal in mind, it's so easy to get distracted by all the modern furnitures and decorations in there. While I was waiting for an employee to get the table from the back, I unconsciously wandered over to the picnic bench area and before I knew it, it had been 5 minutes! Poor employee who was probably holding my table wondering where I had gone.   To anyone looking for interior decoration ideas, World Market is the place for you! I didn't browse their food and wine selections, but I bet they're just as interesting!"

I've always gotten their emails but after I moved from the chain store wasteland of south Dallas, I never really thought to go here again until recently. I needed an umbrella for my patio STAT and it appeared WM was having a sale.   I had the best experience there. This girl who helped me out (beth??) was just amazing. Went to the back to look for the color I wanted, helped me figure out that one was cheaper than another and was basically my personal assistant through the whole process. She was fantastic.   I had to return one item (some umbrella lights) today and again, had a fantastic experience. I was *that* customer. You know the one. Didn't have a receipt, the original packaging or frankly any idea at all what the price was. In fact, I tried to return it with different packaging altogether from the set of lights I'd replaced it with. Yeah, real winner. Maxine got me all sorted with herculean patience and research on the interwebs. She went above and beyond to help me out.   Of course, there's a whole bunch of cool stuff, great jewelry, art, rugs, home stuff, wine, beer, snacks, toys but I was most impressed by how spot on the help was both times."

I called 15 minutes before they were going to close and begged them to let us buy a dining table that was on sale and use the coupon that was about to expire. Elisa answered the phone and was so kind! We came in 2 minutes before they were going to close, chose a table and some chairs. She was so helpful and cheerful! We know how crapy it is when you're about to close and people take their time shopping.... but I have never felt so comfortable! She reassured us that it was ok... they don't work on commission and she was still so kind! Definitely souther hospitality!

I was checking out a rug and Cathy was one of the most helpful people I've ever had at any store period. She even advocated for me all the way up to the register to make sure I was getting all the discounts that were applicable. Really was a pleasure. Thanks again Cathy!"

                "description": "I recently went into a World Market because I heard rumor that they sold Cafe du Monde beignet mixes for a third of the price on Amazon and it made me remember how in love I am with this store.  When I was younger and had more expendable income and time to spare (aka high school), I used to hit up World Market every weekend with my friends. They have EVERYTHING. Everything from adorable gift wrapping supplies to cute bathroom supplies and household items. There's a ton of different kinds of furniture to check out and a whole corner of the store devoted to kitchen utensils, supplies, every sort of little adorable gadget you could ask for. I have had to seriously restrain myself from buying everything in the kitchen set. I WANT IT ALL! In the back is where all the snacks, gourmet food, mixes and drinks are. There's also always a variety of items from different countries for purchase, which are usually organized into different countries of origin.   A visit to this location a couple weeks ago brought all those memories back to me, except with added benefit of alcohol!! Since I drink now AND am into wine, I perused their wine section and found some decently priced wine and a pretty large selection. I ended up impulse purchasing a $7 bottle of Tempranillo based on a recommendation, which was okay, but only cost me $7!   I could seriously spend hours and hundreds of dollars at this store if I were able. Most things are priced higher than what I would spend on almost anything, but it's somewhat comparable to any other higher-end place (not Target).  If you need anything for your house or just have time and.or cash to kill, seriously check this place out. It's amazing."

The comedian they brought in tried to pass off self- loathing, sexually disgusting monolog as comedic humor. Someone please tell him he's not funny in the slightest. The staff are not at all personable. This place doesn't even rise to the dive bar level.  Pop a Natural Light at home and you'll have a better time."

We got to sample a silver rum, pecan street rum and whisky: all were delicious.   Not much to say about this place as we were only a guest of theirs for 30 minutes, didn't feel like a place we could spend a afternoon.  Worth checking out if in the area but wouldn't drive an hour to get there.   5 stars on the quality of the drinks and friendly staff, loosing one star for the man cave feel. We would go back if in the area."

                "description": "Spirit of Texas Distillery in Pflugerville, Tx My wife had a \"Bold Fashioned\" 2 star out of 5 It needs something creamy or sweet to bring it together. It completely burries the whiskey. However, the coffee flavor is out of nowhere and sticks out like a soar thumb.  I had the Spirit of Texas Pfluger Single Malt Whiskey  3 star out of 5 stars Had it neat, they don't serve it in a  Glencairn so if you're a noser, bring your own. It's a much better mixer whiskey than it is neat in my opinion. However, I did get about a 3oz pour so... Booya! (The picture is after I drank about 3/4's of it, lol)  Also tried their \"famous\" Pecan street rum, not a big fan of rum but this was actually decent. Given the choice I wouldn't buy it for myself but I would drink it if offered.  The distillery itself was tiny with not many places to sit. Even their tasting room was mostly a few couches with only a few tables. With that said, it was quite cute and had quazi sports bar vibe.   The staff was friendly and very happy to let us sample and make suggestions based on our tastes.   Overall, I'd come back."

                "description": "Honestly, I'm disappointed in this place. My hubs and I went for the first time here to see a comedy tour which the distillery hosted. The place itself is very small and decent enough- definitely no frills of any kind. They were hosting the comedy tour which was being held outside in their backyard space but they didn't have any of the tables and chairs set up for the patrons. Ppl were grabbing the picnic tables and moving them over to the stage...like shouldn't mngmt have done that ahead of time?? As far as their whiskey and rum, we did not care for it at all. After the reviews, I guess I just expected more. We kept trying it in different types of drinks and it just tasted like cheap stuff. Not to mention their prices! We had exactly 6 mixed drinks. Our tab was $70 before tip. That's $11.50 a drink! Y'all, this place is backwoods Pfluggerville not the dang Domain! I pay $11-$13 for my drinks at the Domain. So, $11.50 for this place was ridiculous. We will definitely not be back. And if you see an advertisement for the comedy tour- skip it. The first comedian was not very good (he had a whole table walk out and leave during his performance. Ouch.), the 2nd was decent but not in any way worth a $70 bar tab."

                "description": "Wanted to try something new yesterday and decided to give this place a shot. We drove up to a small manufactured building and the end of a street  with some questionable establishments nearby.  Just inside of the building is a simple bar and small seating area. The employees are friendly and offer us tastings. We try each of their three offerings: silver rum, Pecan Street Rum, and their whiskey. I can't say I have discerning taste when it comes to rum or whiskey but I enjoyed them.  We ordered three cocktails from their menu (drinks are $6 each or 3 for $15) and took them to their back seating area. It was very no frills and reminiscent of a garage or basement man cave, with old leather sofas and a dart board. The drinks were all really tasty and could definitely be dangerous. We saw that they included generous pours for the liquor yet we could barely taste the alcohol.  We only remained at the distillery for about a half hour because there wasn't much else to do there. No food and no outdoor seating.  Not a bad place to go if you want to grab a couple of drinks and patronize a local distillery but if they'd like to keep customers there longer, the owners will have to invest in helping create more of an experience."

When we were walking up the steps we noticed that there was an open sign lite up and when we walked in the bar tender said they have to close for an hour because he is the only one there and needs to help the band setup..... sounds like poor planning on the managements side. He said someone keeps changing their hours on Yelp but not sure about that hmm. Anyways he invited us back to see the show at 7 as they open back up for that, but was looking to have a drink and not be drowned out by a loud band. Maybe we will try your place again some time ....."

My wife's uncle dropped a bottle of single-malt whiskey on my counter and I decided to pour a neat glass after I poured 3 others for my guests. I really let this whiskey sit on the back of my tongue and savored the flavor. This is hands down the best whiskey I have ever had. I am more of a blended whiskey guy but the sweetness of this whiskey is absolutely perfect. I have my mixing whiskey, but this is definitely my sipping whiskey. There is definitely a strong vanilla taste going on with chocolate, but finishes hard with a good wood. Since having it, I am trying to find a way to get in there and pay my respects, but his review will have to do for now."

It's clean, spacious enough and offers indoor/outdoor dining (see the pics). The pizza was fresh and the crust was better than something you'd get from takeout pizza.  I didn't get any drinks so I can't comment on those but I'm sure we will order from them again!"

It was a good pizza, crust was crispy and soft inside, fresh ingredients, however it lacked something for the full flavor/potential. This place is located in a storage looking facility for auto shops and small businesses. Parking can be tricky. A lot of parking spots are reserved."

                "description": "Love the concept of this place -- a distillery and pizza restaurant located in a warehouse district off the freeway between Pflugerville and Hutto. Grab an inside picnic table and enjoy the fresh air coming in through the open garage-style door. There is a oversized Connect Four game and cornhole for the kids to play. Plenty of fans mean the inside stays cool.   We tried the watermelon cucumber vodka drink, which was tasty. We also tried a classic cheese pizza and a pesto-sausage-olive pizza. Both were good, but could have used a little kick of flavor -- spice? Seasoning? Next time I would love to try the deep dish. Leave 30-45 mins for bake time."

The distillery is down a small road off of 973 and once you reach there it is like an oasis.

I had found them via some post on Instagram.  I am very happy we were able to spend time with them.  Anthony gave us the tour but Logan was there as well.  They give you a taste of both of their products while explaining their history and their process.  They have grand ideas on how to move forward as well.  Both men have full time day jobs.  They have done everything for this company.  Including building the building you are standing in.  Extremely interesting.  We have gone to a few distilleries and the tours can be a tad repetitive but this one was very enjoyable.  We are grateful they took the time to give us a tour.  Every minute they are with you they are not working on their business.  I wish them nothing but success. Worth your time if you are in the area and can get an appointment."

We were staying in the adorable town of Wimberley so I researched tours in the area.  Jodie's Taste of the Hills Tour got great reviews and went to wineries close to the Wimberley area. The day of the tour ended up being chilly and rainy. As soon as Jodie pulled up with her spectacular shuttle-like van she was out like a flash with pretty umbrellas for us! We went to 3 different wineries which we thoroughly enjoyed! After the first one, we returned to Jodie's vehicle and she had a gorgeous tray for us of cheese,  sausage,  crackers,  grapes,  olives, dips.....simply divine!!! The tour was also just the 2 of us and we loved that Jodie still did ALL of this for a tour that I believe takes up to 12 people! The next time we plan a trip to the Hill Country we are going to do one of Jodie's Beer tours!! We had such great conversations with Jodie too! Thank you sooooo much for the GREAT time! Sooooo much fun!"

Jodie made us all feel like we were old friends, even though we had never met anyone else on the bus.  She was very detailed with the stories of each winery, and explained all the different varietals, answering our every question along the way. The bus was very comfortable and clean, and she stored each bottle we purchased until the trip was over, but we could have had the bottles on the bus had we chosen to.  The wineries all seemed to know her, so they were expecting us and were incredibly friendly. We were not rushed anywhere, and still managed to make it back into town to enjoy shopping on the square.  My wife and I were pretty hungry by the time we had lunch, since we didn't have breakfast, but the tapas style lunch was perfect for the glass of wine we purchased to have with it. The lunch was delicious and filling.  Overall this was an amazing experience and I will be recommending this tour to everyone I know."

She knew all the best places to go. The picnic lunch she provided was amazing. I wouldn't change a thing about today. I would love to bring some friends and do it all over again."

She has an extensive knowledge of wines, the wineries, the towns, etc. Our favorite part was lunch because of the views and the wonderful spread that was provided for us. I highly recommend this tour and in fact will probably we doing it again, soon, I hope."

                "description": "Perfect - the highlight of our trip!  Jodie was the best, most fun, knowledgeable and coordinator.  We went to Driftwood, Duchman and Fall Creek Vineyards.  We were fortunate enough to have great people touring with us, and it made the tour all the more fun.  She prepared the best picnic lunch I've ever had.  Sugar Shack cake balls, meats, cheeses, crackers, hummus, a goat cheese something served on crackers (that I LOVED, and I hate goat cheese), spinach feta rolls, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something.  She was fully prepared for everything.  Boxes for the wine we bought, umbrellas in case in rained (it didn't), plenty of water...this wine tour couldn't have been more perfect if she tried.  Thanks, Jodie!"

She provided an excellent variety of foods including a hot portion and gluten-free (just in time `cause I was lit after the 1st vineyard). The three vineyards for that day were selected based on the wine preferences of the tourists that day (A+ perk). We never felt pushed or obligated to buy wines, but we all did because they were very good (!), and Jodie kept our purchases organized and stored for us. She also gave a good background on each vineyard and on the Wimberley area in general. We learned a lot about Wimberley and wine and were able to get tipsy knowing Jodie was an excellent driver of her comfy bus. And have you been to Wimberley? That hilly countryside is beautiful!"

Our tour was originally scheduled for 10:30a, but got pushed back to 1:15p due to shuttle trouble (we had the option to receive our money back, but actually liked the later time).  We stopped at three wineries, including Driftwood Estate and Duchman Family Winery.  The views at all of the wineries varied, but each were unique to their locations.  Jodie provided an amazing picnic-style lunch, including a charcuterie (meat and cheese) board, chicken salad, nuts, walnut and feta salad, grapes, chocolate cake balls, bottled water, etc. At the second stop, Jodie was kind enough to call in people's orders to Salt Lick BBQ and had it all ready to take home by the third stop.  We can't wait to return again!"

She gave us a lot of background information on the wineries as well as the town of Wimberley. She had a delicious assortment of snacks for us to munch on while we rode to and from each winery. She helped package our wine purchases and brought us umbrellas as it started to rain. She even went the extra mile, literally, and drove us back to our hotel since it was raining as we had walked to our meeting spot earlier in the day. We had another couple on the tour with us which was really nice since we had people to mingle with. It was a very personal experience and I felt as though we were all just great friends spending an afternoon together. Who needs Napa, everything is better in Texas!!! We will definitely be repeat customers."

An unplanned stop to provide a bathroom break before arriving at our destination was provided upon our request and was greatly appreciated.

The stereo system was bumping, and Daniel, our amazing driver, had no issue with us turning it up to 11.  Our group was most guys in their 30's and Daniel gave us good recommendations on spots to check out that were age appropriate.  In between spots, Daniel drove me to a gas station to help me restock on beer. He even came in and helped me carry and load beers into the coolers.  Great communicate from Daniel from beginning to end, and he someone found the perfect spot to pick us up on busy Rainey St at the end of the night.   Great value and great experience.  Highly recommend."

He would check in on us during the winery to see if we needed anything or have any questions, and he would offer to help us take multiple pictures. He also got one of the wineries to allow us to explore their cellars!   On our last day in Austin, he drove by our airbnb to pick up someone else and honked at us as we waited for our uber.

He was the kindest, most considerate, thoughtful, responsible driver ever! He was so fun but also let us have our time to just be girls and we didn't have to open a single door, make a decision, or carry a single bag (if we didn't want to) the whole time we were with Arlen!  Also, the management team was incredible. Wei booked last minute and they were so accommodating and listened to our unique needs/wants for the tour! And we're so detailed in instructions. I have had bad experiences with wine/bus tours with other companies and I was SO impressed with the whole experience at Texas tipsy!"

                "description": "If your looking to visit wineries or distilleries in the  outskirts of Austin like Dripping Springs and the surrounding area I highly recommend Texas Tipsy Tours. They are organized and timely. If you're an out of towner like myself and decide to book accommodations in Austin they will pick you up from there and bring you back.   All of my future bookings I will definitely request Wade. He was very professional and personable, he made sure we were taken care of at each location on our tour. He also was more than happy to take our pictures along the way."

                "description": "Y'all BOOK WITH THEM!!!!! I literally do not have one negative thing to say about this company. From the minute I called to book to the minute I said goodbye to our driver the day of the tour they were fantastic.   So when I called there actually weren't any times available. They worked with me to make sure they had a tour time and sprinter available for our group of 6. I had a million questions; they were patient and kind.   Our group was 6 but one of my friends asked if we could add an additional person. Reached out to TTT and they said sure no problem. Literally 3 HOURS LATER I got a call that another girl tested positive with covid and wouldn't be able to come with us obviously- they were so nice and made the switch back to 6. Very grateful for their exceptional customer service.   Day of our driver Bryant was early which was great! Got on the bus and let us have free range of the radio, answered any wine questions we had or any questions about Fredericksburg. He was a fantastic host. Always texted 15 minutes till our time at the winery was up and took as many pictures as we wanted. He was so sweet! He also made sure we were never thirsty or hungry. Which for a group of girls is very important- smart man! Haha   I've heard things about other companies having hidden fees and people getting charges after leaving Fredericksburg and we had none of that. Texas Tipsy Tours was very transparent with all of their pricing and they had no hidden fees.   Thank you TTT for making our trip perfect. You won't regret booking with them."

                "description": "My experience with Texas Tipsy tours was nothing short of perfect!!! From pickup to drop-off, Courtney (the owner) made our experience amazing! When I initially started inquiring about a tour a few months ago, many of the companies only offered private tours for a minimum of 4 people. However, Texas Tipsy Tours offers small group private tours (i.e. 2-3 people). This was perfect for me. She also made planning our trip so easy, and she promptly answered all of the questions I had.   On the day of the tour, she picked us up from our hotel in Austin in an Infiniti SUV (it was very clean too)! She even made a pit stop for me at a CVS on the way to our first winery. Throughout the 6 hour tour, she made sure we stayed on schedule. She even let us change a stop last minute because we wanted to check out a brewery!  One thing that was amazing was the comfort she provided! She allowed us to pick the music, provided phone chargers, and let us control the AC! She even opened our doors for us AND dropped us off/picked us up right in front of each place we went!  Overall, I highly recommend Texas Tipsy Tours, and I will definitely be back!"

We chose the half day option and were picked up right at our vacation rental (Farmhouse on Elder Hill) We wanted to just stay nearby so we visited Driftwood Estate Winery and Fall Creek.  We were planning to also see Vista Brewing (all in Driftwood), but we chatted and laughed so much that we ran out of time and Eric, driver/owner was flexible with our change of plans and let us just extend our time enjoying the fabulous view at Driftwood Estate.  The tour service was absolutely awesome and professional.  Everything done with excellence.  Thank you Courtney and Eric!"

It was as easy as getting on the phone, explaining what I wanted, and Courtney took care of literally everything else. We picked the breweries we wanted and even included a food stop. She coordinated the bus pick up, drop offs, schedule, and even reserved tables for us at each stop. I love that we had our own bus (very nice one, by the way!), and had the flexibility to create our own tour based on beers and food my husband liked. It was the perfect Saturday in Austin! Payment was very easy as well - they sent me an invoice to my email and I was able to pay directly online for everything. Highly recommend, and thank you Texas Tipsy Tours!"

                "description": "We booked Texas Tipsy Tours twice in one weekend. I have taken quite a few van tours around the hill country and Texas Tipsy Tours sets themselves apart by not just being drivers but they truly host you the entire day. I will ALWAYS use this company going forward. We did a private charter from Driftwood to Austin, TX and back and Keaton our driver was a delight. He made sure we were picked up on time and each of our stops were easy and flexible. We did a mixed tour around Driftwood and Dripping springs the next day and our guide Eric executed the BEST DAY for us. He even picked up on what we were liking and recommended a change to our final stop to Vista Brewing and we were SO glad he did. At each stop he made sure we had plenty of water, snacks and chairs to enjoy the gorgeous venues. This is totally above and beyond what we would have expected from a driver. Courtney was so easy to work with and she helped make recommendations for our group ultimately making our weekend get away FLAWLESS. I promise if you don't use this company, you're wrong."

Courtney and Eric are just the sweetest people! Would highly recommend if you're looking for a relaxed tasting without the hubbub of big party buses, AND if you're looking for a more personalized experience with people who can really throw a party. Fredericksburg can be confusing because of the many, many options, so Courtney's expertise in the wineries proved incredibly helpful. Highly recommend!!"

What a surprise when he told us!  Didn't see that coming.  Three great tastings with good friends.  Discovered some very nice 2015 Texas wines.  The grapes have matured immensely since 2008 and glad to finally enjoy some good Texas wines.   Can't recommend this company any lower than *****!

I don't know if the business has just gotten bigger than the owners can handle but communication was subpar. It took several calls and emails to get answers sometimes.   At our first tour, Kathie took tons of photos and would pose us at the wineries. This tour, we had to prompt her. It was a cloudy day so not the best for outdoor pics but I was disappointed we took most of them ourselves or had to ask her to take the pictures.   Our tour was April 11, it is now almost 2 mths later I haven't received the few pictures we took. I emailed twice and have finally heard back that the SD is apparently not working. I'm not sure why I had to email to find this out, seems like this info should have been divulged as soon as the problem presented itself.   I hate to downgrade the star review but my second time with this company just wasn't as epic as the initial tour I took with them. The wineries all seem to love this company though."

DTWT was very accommodating, scheduled the wineries we wanted to see, ordered the lunches, and then confirmed our selections a couple of days prior to our tour. At the last minute after visiting with a couple in our third stop, we changed our fourth stop to a different winery. Jason (our driver) was happy to accomodate us. My only regret is that we didn't choose a few wineries a little further out of town, so we could spend more time in the limo listening to our Willie Nelson songs. Jason was awesome, and I highly recommend this tour."

                "description": "We started researching half-day wine tours for my BFF's bachelorette party several months in advance and chose this company because of its good reviews and cancellation policy (full refund up to 7 days in advance).   First, the bad news. The booking process is way more arduous than it should be. My initial discussion about the tour plans happened over the phone, so I asked for a written, e-mail confirmation of what we had discussed - specifically how the deposit and refund policies work. It took me more than three weeks to get that first e-mail confirmation of our booking and deposit payment. I then went back and forth, back and forth, back and forth with the company, hammering out the details, like setting a pickup location and our choices for the winery stops. Many times, three weeks would pass and I'd have to make multiple attempts before I would get a response to my e-mails. Sometimes, the responses would be incomplete and we'd repeat the process of trying to get information confirmed. Seriously a pain for an experience that costs $129 per person.   Now, the good news. The online payment portal for each attendee was a breeze to use and eliminated the need to handle money all through one person. As for the actual tour itself, we couldn't have asked for a better experience. Our driver, Bobby, was on time and wonderful on the day of the tour. He was funny and polite and had good knowledge of the area. Also, very importantly, he was a good and safe driver! The Mercedes bus we took was very clean and spacious, and they provided water, cups and napkins. They also allowed us to bring our own food onto the bus. The three wineries we visited, Driftwood Estate, Duchman and Fall Creek, were all accommodating and fun. The views were lovely and we never felt rushed and made it back on time. It was raining when we got back to our car, and Bobby was so nice and helped us get our stuff back into our car in the pouring rain.   All in all, despite a wonderful wine tour, I'm not sure I would recommend this company, only because I spent way too much time hounding them throughout the booking process. While the wine was excellent, I NEEDED to drink after dealing with their horrible communication. Discover Texas Wines should strongly consider re-evaluating their communication practices and hire more people to keep up with the demand for their service. It's the only way they will stay competitive in the long-run!"

The selection of wineries was amazing, perfect mixture between red and whites/dry and sweet, so every one of us could have something tasty. The drive was beautiful and not too far out of Austin. Overall, I am very impressed with this tour and the wonderful employees. Would definitely go again."

                "description": "Absolutely do not recommend using this company. I made the reservation back in January, gave my card for deposit and was told I'd be emailed a link for everyone to pay. Over the next two months I called and emailed asking about the link so my friends could pay their part and I was repeatedly told they were having issues. Okay fine, no big deal- I also emailed again saying we can just pay the day of if the link wasnt working and never received a response. The day before our tour, as I was driving from Dallas to Fredericksburg I get a call from Some guy at the company and he seemed very annoyed with me saying no one had paid yet. Um.. I'm sorry I didn't realize you finally sent it after months of my asking. (He had sent it the day before calling me to tell me no one had paid) The vehicle I requested was not the one that showed up. The driver Julia was late bc she did not write the address down correctly. We also had 3 girls cancel last minute, so we were down to 5 instead of 8. Considering there minimum is 5 I wasn't expecting that to be a problem but Julia felt the need to bring it up multiple Times as if it caused some inconvenience for her. Rude people, horrible communication."

Roy was a true gentleman and really took good care of our group all day long, making this a truly great experience. Noel was very helpful in booking us, even with a last minute addition to our party. I will be using these guys again in the future, and would recommend anyone who is looking for a first time trip to do the same."

                "description": "What a fantastic time! Organizing a full day wine tour for 50 people in the Texas Hill Country may not sound like an easy task, but Noel at Discover Texas Wine Tours made it smooth and most importantly, unforgettable. His main goal is to make sure everyone is comfortable and has a good time! Most companies were not able to host a group this size, but Noel made it happen. He made sure our bus was the best he could find, worked to have a lunch catered for us at one of the stops, set up private tastings with many of the wineries to accommodate a group our size, even stopped to let one of the guys who didn't drink wine buy some beer. I can't say enough good things about Noel and how hard he worked for our group. I highly recommend him and look forward to another tour with him soon!!"

Throwing a surprise weekend is stressful enough but Woody was SUPER accommodating especially for being so last minute.  There were many tours that I could've chosen to stick with but Woody was so authentic about his services and was a person of integrity when it came to what he offered.  He personally picked us up from our little hotel we were staying at and drove us to all three of our tours. His tour bus was super clean and we all had a blast! He even offered to pick up some cheese and snacks at the HEB close by to have on the bus if we wanted! I really appreciated Woody taking the time to answer my numerous phone calls with questions I had as this is my first Bachelorette party I threw.  I HIGHLY recommend using Woody if anyone wants to have a great time and looking for someone to trust. I will be booking with you again Woody, thank you so much for everything!"

If you come across Fredericksburg Uncorked Wine Tours, stop your search and make the booking.   Organizing a wine tour for 18 girls as part of a bachelorette party was a breeze with Woody, the owner/operator of Uncorked. He gave great advice, offered competitive pricing (especially for the expectant mothers/non-drinkers in our group), and was easy to communicate with. Woody was incredibly patient during the lead up to our tour, and then was a funny, gracious, and attentive guide during our wine tasting experience.   Our tour was fantastic from start to finish, and I can't recommend Woody and the rest of the Fredericksburg Uncorked team highly enough. All (18) of us had the greatest time!"

I honestly called three or 4 more tours throughout the week and left messages and he is the only one that called me back. Not only did woody come through, he came through at the last minute when I thought We weren't going to make a tour.  He was funny , knowledgeable and overall a great guide. He even recommended a few things that weren't apart of the tour (Alamo Springs Cafe) which we ended up going to and was delicious.  Lunch was not included but the place we went to was pretty great for a sandwich . I'd hang out and grab a beer with woody any night !  Thank you for making my boyfriends birthday a good one !!"

I never agreed to Woody keeping my credit card information on file after he charged the wine tour for 11 girls (almost $1,300).   The driver Tommy was nice but he did nothing special and didn't know the basics of Woody's business. Had he known even a little bit about Uncorked Tours, there wouldn't have been confusion about lunch.   As far as the wine tour: William Chris and Lost Draw were my favorite wineries. Hye Market pretended we weren't there half of the time. Pontotoc was greedy with their pours.   Woody was very unprofessional and difficult to work with at the end. I would not recommend him.

Sam, the owner and driver, was unbelievable. Very accommodating, great driver, and super chill.   We planned to hit up the Salt Lick on the party bus and then venture around to some breweries afterwards. Sam made sure that the group got where we needed to be on time, had great suggestions for breweries, and made sure we were having as much fun as possible.  The bus is great. Fit everyone comfortably with enough room for a cooler in between all of us. Sam had her playlist turned up or she would hand over the AUX cord and we could play our tracks as loud as we wanted. The whole experience was incredibly laid back and worry free. I would absolutely recommend Cool bus ATX to anyone that wants to have a great time with a big group in Austin.   On a side note, if it is Sunday, make sure that you buy beer on Saturday because they don't sell it on Sunday before noon.   Thanks again, Sam!"

As a bachelorette \"day party,\" we gathered together and hopped in the super roomy and comfortable All About Central Texas SUV and headed out on our journey.   Kim is extremely knowledgeable about each winery; the history, the best wines to try, the \"wine club\" or other bonus things each winery has.   We stopped in on 3 different wineries and Kim had made superb choices in each spot; from the wines to the view to the suggestions on what to try and how to make the most of our samples so everyone could try as many as possible (thanks for that tip, Kim!).   Be it an afternoon with a group of friends, or a romantic day for two, All About Central Texas is an outstanding choice.  Thanks for everything, Kim!"

I did the Fredericksburg tour and based on my wine preferences she had some great suggestions on which ones to stop in, there are so many! I even joined a wine club, the tastings were informative and she is just a lot of fun and I didn't have to worry about driving or directions and could enjoy the pours and some snacks.  I highly recommend All abt Central Texas tours, they are personable, you can really get to meet the others in these small groups- Thanks so much!"

He was quick to respond and helped me schedule a party bus big enough for all of us. David, our driver, showed up early and made sure we had everything we needed for the trip. He had a giant cooler with ice and waters that we were able to load up with seltzers. I booked our wineries ahead of time which made getting into the tastings a breeze. David made sure we got to each winery on time and went in ahead to ensure each winery was ready for us when we arrived. He even coordinated to have the band at one of the wineries sing Happy Birthday! David was absolutely fantastic, and we had a great time with him. We will definitely be booking with them again for our next trip. I highly recommend Open Range Tours to anyone visiting Fredericksburg!"

We started at William Chris, headed to Pedernales and ended at Augusta Vin. The 15 passenger van was great for our group of 11. They offered water and took care of checking us in at each winery. David was a complete gentleman and carried all of our purchases and secured them in the van while we enjoyed our time tasting the different wines. He even dropped us off downtown so we would be on time for our dinner reservation."

He picked us up from San Antonio, drove us up to Hill Country and around to 3 wineries.  As this was my first Texas wine tour, he did an AMAZING job of helping us select which wineries would be a good fit for the group.  As we had a decent amount of guys with us- he suggest Garrison Brother's Distillery which ended up being a HUGE hit!  He was extremely professional, courteous and just an absolute delight to spend the day with!  He also has a wicked funny sense of humor.  He was also very accommodating and ordered and picked up lunch for us so we could continue to enjoy beautiful Hill Country.  I would use him again in heartbeat and highly, highly recommend him to anyone wanting to enjoy Texas Hill Country!  Thanks David!"

A 15 passenger VAN showed up with a dent in the side and ripped seats. We were told we could bring coolers. We were only able to fit 8 adults in the van with our two coolers- no way we could've had another person in the van. None of the wineries had been scheduled yet and the ONE we had specifically requested was not available. We had to scramble ourselves to find wineries, in which we were promised everything would be done ahead of time. The meat and cheese tray that was promised was a small tray that was bought during the tour at a convenient store to feed 2 people. Our driver was great, however the owner did not deliver what was promised and we were highly disappointed. There are plenty of companies to choose from, and I would NOT recommend Open Range."

I wouldn't have changed any of that part. But, once the day rolled around we were met with a hiccup. The driver, not David like I was anticipating after multiple conversations, arrived in a mustang for 5 of us. Obviously that wasn't going to work so I was offered by the driver only to cancel or reschedule. Our trip was planned around spending our day out and about so cancelling wasn't an option for us. After a phone call to David, we were assured our day wasn't ruined just a bit delayed. The driver left and showed back up with an SUV and away we went. The driver wasn't interactive and she didn't seem to even be having a good day... It happens I get it but come on. Anyway, we made the best of our day and enjoyed ourselves. When we were dropped off, I tried to pay but she said to get with David. No problem but I did have a problem with her then saying that she'd go ahead and take the gratuity and that the standard is 20%. I didn't even know what our total cost was to figure 20% but asking for the gratuity before I even paid for the day was in poor taste. We did go ahead and tip, and well mind you, because that's the kind of people we are. I ended up calling David and finishing out the transaction and once again, he was a pleasure to deal with. Overall, we'll use them again because I appreciated David that much. But, I'll definitely make sure we don't have the same driver. 5 stars for David but 4 stars overall for the above mentioned."

                "description": "I really enjoy this Winery. They source grapes from California and Texas, but stick to what grapes from those regions do best. My favorite was their Russian River Valley Pinot and they had a special white from the green valley sub appellation I LOVED.   The tasting room is down to earth and simple- and expect a drop in by the owner! Great wines, friendly crew- recommend for the wine lover."

                "description": "Been wanting to check this place out for awhile now. Very close to our house in town and needed a nice Texas bottle of wine for a charcuterie board night.  Made reservations for 2... Very specific time slots available. We were arriving a tad early so I called first to make sure that was indeed ok and I actually got a call service... they weren't on site and first told me that they take walk ins and it was cool.... then he stopped me before hanging up telling me no... reservations required... he couldn't figure it out and didn't have access to the winery to check... that was odd. Walked in and got right in to a different table then I reserved since we were early.  You will feel like you're walking into a house.... lots of pictures and decor everywhere.... they are not minimalists :) Sat down and Ami took excellent care of us with the wine tastings and a couple snacks. We ended up grabbing a bottle of our favorite to go.  We were there for an hour. Felt kind of rushed. The owner was walking around the whole time we were there with an ipad scanning the room and tables... it kind of ruined the chill experience...  loved the nice friendly folks that were there drinking with their dogs... music in the background was nice. The wines were tasty too and Ami was super knowledgeable about them all. She was the best part of our time there.  I prefer outdoor wineries. There are no windows and it's all indoors in a strip center. I am very sensitive to floral air fresheners and strong chemical cleaners and they definitely use both. A lady was walking around spraying windex after people left very close to us and it was so strong it retuned the wine tasting experience trying to navigate the smell and taste the wine....  Overall the wines were good and the people were nice...  Windex spraying, calling a hot line instead of winery and Ipad guy walking around the whole time wasn't for me...  I like laid back relax and stay as long as you choose atmospheres with no strong cleaning smells while drinking wine. The bathroom is also very strong.... extremely blue toilet water... and fragrances... Doesn't mix well with food and wine..  Loved all the dogs and pics of dogs!  Ami gets 10 stars!!!"

                "description": "Ok yes, this is in a \"warehouse\" \"strip mall\" kind of exterior... HOWEVER, Once you walk in, you forget! It's so very welcoming and cozy...and the WINE! I've been to plenty of wine tastings that I had to figure out one I liked. This dilemma was figuring out if there was one I didn't like. My friends all agreed, and we actually tried to figure out if we could get another time slot reservation because we enjoy ourselves that much. The staff were so welcoming and checked on us often enough but not too often. There were snack options, and apparently on the weekends they try to offer food specials if you come hungry. We really enjoyed ourselves and look forward to next time."

Amie poured various wines and gave a complete history of how they were grown along with what to expect when tasting them.  She also shared with us stories about how she went to college for making wine and growing grapes which was fascinating. An added benefit was that they serve a bowl of pulled pork stew that was to die for!  And the accompanying piece of cornbread was also excellent."

                "description": "Wow I was blown away by Bent Oak. It really does not look like much from the outside but my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try based on the reviews and we were not disappointed! We easily made a reservation on the website and came in at 2pm on a Saturday. They took out temperatures at the door and we were seated quickly.   We decided to go for the wine tasting first, 5 samples for $15 plus a stemless logo glass to take home! We really enjoyed trying the wines and enjoyed all of them. Our favorite was the Blanc du Bois because it was light and crisp but had a unique fragrant flavor from the floral notes and the apricot.   My only gripe was the reservation was only 45 minutes. I wish it could've been around an hour, we didn't get a chance to finish our wine or our charcuterie but it's not too big of a deal since we just took it back home. We also got another bottle of the Blanc du Bois to take home and they gave us a cute wine bag for the two bottles.   We will definitely be back again to try the rest of the wines!!"

                "description": "What a wonderful discovery on a lazy pre-Xmas Sat afternoon. Who would have thought you could find a boutique winery that rivals any that I've visited in Sonoma.   Do not despair as you pull into the generic industrial park hard off of Anderson Mill Road in the CP. Walk-in past the small lobby area and step into their beautifully decorated tasting room.  Since we were the only patrons we received VIP treatment from start to finish.   We opted for their premium tasting menu and selected all reds. I'm not a TX wine fan but Dylan, our sommelier, expertly guided us through our tasting and as we concluded our wonderful stay my mind was changed.   My favorite was the Alexandar Valley Cab will more than suffice if you enjoy a big traditional Cab with a strong finish.   Their Spanish Mourvedre version is deep and rich and has a surprisingly strong finish,   There are a number of \"light\" reds as well. We were not fans but appreciated the flavor and balance of these wines.   Bent Oak does offer cheese plates and other small plates to accompany your tasting. Check their social media as they have live music on certain days.   Wonderful wine, an intimate setting, and passionate knowledgeable folks equals a 5 star experience."

                "description": "This was a real treat.  We looked for winery that was open before 4pm. We were staying in San Antonio and wanted to visit Austin TX. We found this place by searching best wineries near Austin. When we 1st arrived, it looked like a little store front in a strip mall. When we entered it was a whole different story. We were greeted by Debbie and Bryan who both turned out to be extremely gracious hosts.  They have wines grown in TX and CA. The TX grapes are grown in the High Plaines near New Mexico where it is warm during the day and cooler at night. I decided to do a tasting with only the TX wines.   The TX wine menu had 5 wines for the tasting menu. Started with the Chenon Blanc (quite nice with a buttery smoothness), proceeded to the Blanc de Bois, then the Roussanne (my least favorite), then switching to the reds starting with the Sangiovese and finally to the tempranillo.  The Tempranillo was my absolute favorite.    What really made this experience so nice was the wine Ambassador Debbie. She is just the nicest person who took good care of us. She also has a very nice sense of humor. Bryan was also very nice. He helped me pick out a few stainless steel wine stoppers. Bryan gave us great restaurant suggestions for Austin and San Antonio.  Do not be fooled with the entrance on the outside. It is misleading in the size and the value you receive on the inside."

Took two of my really good friends here today both who require wheelchair accessibility and felt very comfortable in the atmosphere. The reservation made ahead time was set up easily and the communication was quick and efficient through email. They were able to recommend a table that was best suited for us all to feel comfortable. It is very rare to actually be able to talk to the owners/wine makers about their products but they were the ones serving us the tasting! It really was a special experience not only for me but for my friends that have not gone out socially since the pandemic. Thank y'all so much for the inclusive atmosphere and making it such a memorable experience, we had a blast!"

                "description": "What a hidden gem! We were sitting at home on a Friday night, trying to find something to do. After a quick yelp search, we saw there was a winery up the street and open late. We decided to take a trip and check it out.  Driving up, you start to question if you are going the right direction but just keep going.   You walk in to this office center and are welcomed to the most friendly staff and environment.  Rarely do you get to sit down at a winery and speak to the head wine maker.   What really makes this place different is the fact that they have California and Texas wines. I'm no expert, but I've been told Texas grapes just don't compare.    The prices are great, and the options are plenty.  This will definitely be the family visit spot in the future."

                "description": "Wine: Only tried one wine, the tempranillo. It was fine, not as bold as they usually are. I smelled some of the whites, and they smelled very sweet so I passed. Didn't even look at pricing because of what the snacks cost.  Snacks: wow, expensive. Tried a bunch of them with a group, overall not worth the price. Particularly the truffles. It was $27 for a teensy box of 9 pieces of terrible chocolate. Waxy texture, did not melt when you eat it, chalky, bad flavor. Dark chocolate is my fave, so that's not the issue. Who knew chocolate could actually be yucky? It came from next door, glad we didn't go there after.   Service: very good, sweet ladies.  Ambience: not good. Outside it just looks like a store front, inside is super dark, no windows, and looks like a Kirkland's from the 90s.... everything is red, has fringe, pretty cheesy. Not eclectic, just ugly and full of stuff."

                "description": "Living in Austin, this winery is located in our backyard. It's nice to be able to drive just 20 minutes and enjoy a good glass of wine, and meet the people who made it. I now have a place for out of town guests just spending the weekend to take a sip of Texas wine.  They focus on creating quality wines sourced from Texas and California grapes.  They do not blend grapes sourced from the two states together.  When you drink a bottle of Texas sourced wine, it is 100% Texas, and vice versa. Bent Oak has been around for about 3 1/2 years, and from what I have heard they are starting to find their stride.   When you enter the space, you will walk through the front gift shop to the back tasting room and production area.  They have gone to amazing strides to make a warehouse space homey. It feels like a Texas hill country family home.  We were warmly welcomed, and they even let us take our three well behaved dogs into the back area to sit and enjoy a tasting with us.  Everyone here was friendly and knowledgeable.    I was pleasantly surprised by the consistent quality of all their wines available to taste.  You can taste up to five wines from their menu.  The Blanc Du Bois was one of my stand out favorites.  There wasn't anything I didn't like on the menu.  I am not a fan of Chardonnay's but their California sourced Chardonnay was good.  Their reds were a bit young, but the Mourvedre from the Texas High plains was tasty and my favorite of the current options.  Medium bodied but with spicy fruity rich tones.  The Sangiovese was satiny smooth, but just needed some time.  I actually enjoyed their Texas wines more than the California options.    Clearly there is a reason why their wine club membership has a waitlist.  It's just a great group of people to hang out with.  It felt like being with family, and enjoying a great conversation over a nice glass of wine.  They are located next to Delysia chocolates towards the back of a warehouse area.  Wine and chocolate neighbors?  Yep, it's an amazing pairing."

                "description": "Barons Creek was our first stop on a planned wine tasting adventure around the square. We were greeted by our sommelier Tom, seated, and the tasting process explained. Tom provided a charming mixture of highbrow wine knowledge and light humor as he took us through our tasting journey of 5 red wines. The wife liked all of the wines, and I liked all but one (a tempranillo). Never fear! Tom is here! Tom saved the day (and the Tres Primos reputation) by pouring us an extra taste, but instructing us to first chew a chocolate-covered coffee bean before pouring the wine across that bean in our mouths. This somehow transformed the flavour into something amazingly pleasing for us both!  We also ordered chicken empanadas, which were surprisingly delicious! For some reason we did not expect such flavor and complexity from a wine bar's kitchen. The empanada crust was crispy and flaky, with a filling of chopped chicken, onions and seasonings that burst into the mouth with each bite. This was no Tex-Mex kitchen empanada. Hats off Barons! Hats off!"

Barons had more of an uppity vibe to it, so maybe I wasn't picking up what they were putting down from the jump as I tend gravitate toward a more casual atmosphere... especially when it comes to wine tasting.   They were nice and helpful here and poured us a cup of Tempranillo and Crazy Train on our way out, to drink while we walked around the square. Both good wines but did not justify the price tag for us."

The women working at the counter were all smiles and had great recommendations. They have kitschy gift shop gifts, local goods, and some snacks you can purchase. There are a few café tables inside and some chairs outside to enjoy your purchase. The wine was just fine, more light and very sweet, but the experience and service at this laid back tasting made it a worthy stop.   A must stop when experiencing the square to enhance your time!"

My friend and I were greeted promptly and given an overview of the wines for our flight-sampler. We scored a small table. This was a huge win as there are limited seats, I believe up to 25 seats. The staff checked in on us as we tasted our way thru the wines. When we finished tasting, we bought a glass of our fave wine and continued to walk through market days on the square.  Anywho, if your walking the Georgetown Square, stop in for a tasting and or a glass or 2. Cheers."

After a more upscale experience in a different tasting room on the square, it was pleasant to ease into this more relaxed space. We were promptly greeted by the hostess, who became our server, and perused the menu of wines. $10 each for a sampling of 4 wines. Nice price, and fitting to the setting which would have been appropriate for beer as well. Neither of us remembers which wines we ordered, except for my two port samplings, but neither of us was overly impressed either. My ports were good, if extremely sweet and fruity, and the wife liked 2 of hers. She was disappointed in her first choice, which was the most expensive wine on the menu as priced by the bottle.  We didn't buy a bottle, nor would we return if we ever visit Georgetown again, but the ambience and carefree environment did add to an overall relaxing day on the square."

                "description": "Georgetown Winery is an adorable little handout in the heart of Georgetown. This is a great spot for a date night, girls night, or just an afternoon with a small group of friends or family. The actual vineyard is located in Rockdale Texas- this is just a small tasting room right on the Georgetown Square.   For $10, you can taste 4 wines. My spouse also got 4 tasting, so in total- I got to sample 8 wines. My favorite was the Big Tex which is aged for 9 months in oak. A full bottle will set you back only $24. Create price for the quality.  I also love their Viognier, I love white wines- and this was so light. I would casually sip this on any warm summer day. One thing I didn't love their fruity wines. The Blueberry and Blackberry wines tasted like they used artificial flavoring. The couple next to use was absolutely loving the blackberry, so maybe it just wasn't for me. Totally fair.   They also have cheese and crackers available. I feel like any wine tasting isn't complete without a good cheese plate. Unfortunately, we had dinner plans right after, so I enjoyed my wine cheese-free.   I absolutely plan on coming back here soon for some wine + cheese."

                "description": "The best winery for friends.  My friends and I have only been members of this winery for about a year, but this is honestly one of our favorite locations to consistently come and visit when we're all together. They have sweeter drinks and wineritas for people who aren't fond of dry wines and their wine club memberships are literally built to be shared. There is table seating inside where you can sit for hours and catch up. Laurie and Heather in particular are so sweet with their service and their recommendations. I can't think of where else I would rather spend my weekend."

                "description": "This is the perfect meet up spot with your girlfriends. That's not to say that I don't see plenty of men in here, too. It's a great spot for day drinking. Any day of the week. And I know from experience.   I don't bother doing the tastings here - I know exactly what I like. Their unoaked chardonnay is butter and smooth. After that I move over to their pinot noir - which isn't too sweet but not so dry that I need to carry in my own water bottle. I do not drink fruit wines but my sweet lil granny does and she swears by the pomegranate and blueberry.   You can buy gifts and chochskies here. I always like to pick up a few bottles of wine before I had home to visit family. Their wine club is probably the best you can be apart of in terms of benefits.   I would really like if they would provide bread so that we can try the olive oils. Probably smart that they don't do that or else all of us winos would use that as food. :)"

Always a fun time at Georgetown Winery!  Thank you for making my family, friends, and me feel so special."

My partner liked two of the reds so much she bought a bottle of each.  This is a long narrow shop that has lots of knick-knack items displayed so we did not move around much, but it was fun to read all the funny quotes on the signs and towels and glasses, etc. The folks at the bar were helpful and friendly, and we enjoyed this visit much more than our first."

When I visited Fredericksburg, I went to multiple wineries and this was BY FAR the worst. The employees have no manners, and don't treat you well regardless of your membership status. My friends and I felt uncomfortable and judged the entire time we were there. Overall, there are much better wineries in the area with much nicer staff and better wine. Don't waste your time or money when there are other amazing options less than a mile away"

Jennie's ability to know exactly what we wanted before we did was truly enjoyable and her knowledge of wine and friendly professionalism made for a great Saturday outing.

                "description": "Conveniently located on the Georgetown Square, Grape Creek Vineyards tasting room is a welcoming oasis of great wines and friendly \"tasting ambassadors\". You know Grape Creek's wine is good: they earned almost 2 dozen medals, including three Double Golds, this year at the prestigious San Francisco Wine Competition. And their wins encompass all styles, with Double Gold wins for red, white and Port. My Tasting Ambassador, Sandy, was exceptional! As we talked, she discerned my tastes and made a couple of recommendations that turned out to be spot on. She was knowledgeable and responsive, and a delight to talk with. Having been to many tasting rooms and wineries in the Texas Hill Country as well as from the California wine regions to the New York Finger Lakes, my experience at Grape Creek exceeded my expectations. Highly recommended!"

My friend is a wine club member and invited us to accompany her and her significant other to a tasting. We ended up enjoying a bottle! It was delicious.

Although the facility is small, the atmosphere is friendly and quaint."

Since they made us split up our party of six we got two tables that were close together. Apparently management had a problem with my girlfriend and I orienting our chairs towards our friends table so we could all talk to each other and came and got in our faces to tell us we have to turn our chairs around and face forward. What is this kindergarten? The wine was alright, but definitely not good enough to justify the $40 per bottle price tag. I've found better bottles at HEB for under $20. Don't waste your time or money. There are plenty of other wineries in the area of the same quality that are more affordable and less rude"

It is absolutely delish and my go to red for my collection and for gifting to friends.   While the main building itself is somewhat small and doesnt offer the option to sit downstairs (GC....this is overdue), there is a members only room available upstaird with views of the Gtown Square.  The patio however is the reason people gravitate towards this winery. There is live music, nice fans to keep you cool in summer and heaters for the winter.  My only dislike is the changes hours...it closes at 6:30. Far too early and down the street are alternatives that stay open til 9 or later."

Although... standing in line when you first walk-in did seem a bit off, it was merely just a way to help usher traffic through more efficiently. Luckily, the line went quickly or this would probably be a different type of review, as someone * wink wink* who doesn't do well with lines for absolutely anything, except that one Prince concert 30 years ago.   Needless to say, we came, we tasted, we joined the wine club and now we are big fans. Especially of their Rose of Malbec. That deliciously tasting watermelon jolly rancher (without the sugar) wine has changed wine drinking for me and completely justifies the $30 price tag."

I decided to join the wine club because of her level of service. However, it's hard to get a hold of someone on the phone. I have a simple question to ask but no one will ever pick up the phone. When select the button to speak to the tasting room, their automated service starts all over again. Yes, I can email, but for a simple question, picking up the phone should be an easy option as well.  Also, the times on yelp versus their times on the phone are inconsistent. That needs to be updated.  Bottomline, they lack communication.  It's really annoying and frustrating. I plan on canceling my wine club membership and going elsewhere due to the experience that I've had."

I really like this winery, with the exclusive access to seating upstairs. I love the live entertainment outside lounge area. I really like this winery! I also like how EVERY time you come to the winery, you get a complimentary glass of wine! Of course, you need a membership.  I don't live in the area so I have a trek to make to receive my complimentary glass of wine for me and a guest. However, when I am in the area you better believe I am here. I just started my membership last visit but failed to write a review after a couple of bottles. My apologies. I was informed that my three bottles qill be mailed to my residence in Harker Heights, Texas. I will be sure to post how that goes. You can cancel the membership at anytime.

We had previously been sitting there calmly, not being loud or offensive in any way - it felt very abrupt and extremely rude.

My sorority sisters came to Georgetown for Austin's ACL Fest and added on extra days to sightsee.   Grape Creek was a wonderful respite.  You stand in line, describe your likes to the salesperson, and taste. Then, you get wine by the glass (I think it was 10$/glass) to enjoy on their relaxing patio, and bottles to go.   My BF is a frequent member and has a card to get 2 free glasses of wine a month.   A very nice spot to relax and enjoy good wine and good conversation.   Thank you Grape Creek Vineyards!"

We were able to taste several different wines before we decided what we wanted to make. We spent about 1-1.5 hours there. We look forward to designing our own wine bottle labels and returning in 6-8 weeks to bottle the wine."

                "description": "Absolutely love this place. The owner, Jenny, is the best. She's fun, friendly, thoughtful. All the staff are wonderful.   I've made many batches of wine here. The wine making process is really fun from tasting and selecting the wine you want, to making it and, the  funnest part, bottling. You can customize your wine label and they print it for you to put on the bottles.   You can bring your own snacks and get a bottle to enjoy.   I would highly recommend everyone to try making a batch of wine at water to wine. They make great Xmas gifts too."

                "description": "Water 2 Wine is best described (at least as they themselves put it) as 'Build-a-Bear for Adults'!    I visited this establishment thinking it was a simple wine tasting spot.  Actually, they also provide services as your own personal vintner and label maker, where you can taste, create, and label your own wine!  While I have yet to try this full service out, the staff was very friendly, the wine (tried the whites only) was excellent, and you can palpably feel how fun the process is.  Definitely coming back to celebrate good times with a custom-made wine!"

                "description": "Ok, but why is this place SO cute?!  I went here for a wine tasting years ago with a girlfriend and as a fun catch up, we decided to meet back here.  What a fun tradition we want to continue!  The staff here is outstanding, they have great thought, and make you feel comfortable.  We had some neighbors at a different table order food in and  thought that was hilariously brilliant!  You are definitely recommended to buy a bottle as all winery's usually do, but this spot doesn't make you feel pushed to - which makes me want to buy another bottle.  I love that this is tucked away in the city and you don't have to go to the city limits to do a wine tasting.  I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this to any and all of you!"

                "description": "Water 2 Wine is perfect for so many occasions... date night, girls night, happy hour, a pop-in for a glass of wine, or a night of wine making/bottling with friends. We were sad when the Round Rock location closed down, but found this place to be a million times better. The decor is cute and thematic, with tons of inviting spots for seating, whether you're looking for a romantic spot for two, or some couches for a larger gathering. The best part is the staff - super friendly and helpful while we try to make the tough decision of what to drink or take home. The free samples help too!   Making our own batch of wine is a yearly tradition for us. We get together with friends to start the wine (which of course involves a good time trying the different wines first), design our own labels (or get help from W2W), throw a gathering to bottle the wine, then have bottles to hand out as wedding favors, Christmas gifts, or generic gifts.   We are club members, so we stop by at least monthly for a couple glasses of wine and to pick up our bottles to enjoy at home. Whether you're joining wine club, making a batch, or just stopping in for a glass or two, Water 2 Wine is a fantastic neighborhood gem. I only wish they were in my neighborhood!"

                "description": "Came here with friends who decided they wanted a wine baby and we tagged along to help them taste wines. It is a very laid-back tasting room. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Prices are reasonable and tasting is free. You can even make your own wine, which is exactly what we tagged along to do and that gets you 28-30 bottles. Highly recommend this place - Cheri and Jenny are so knowledgeable and make the whole process so easy and fun!  Only downside, no Texas wines... but this isn't necessarily a con -  all their wines are made on-site with grapes from various vineyards."

They make excellent suggestions whether you know what you're looking for or not. They can get you going in the right direction.  Sulfite free wine? Is my understanding. I don't know a lot about wine, but know that's a good thing to be free of. I can say the ports and fruity wines are a good dessert. My family and friends love the other wines."

                "description": "If you are a young couple, or an old couple, or an odd couple, and you decide you want a wine baby, you may be a bit worried about where, when and how to do that.  It's a big step and you should have nothing but the best for your Vino Bambino, so please look no further than Water 2 Wine, and Jenny in particular.  She is the BEST midwife for your wine labor.    We just had the best experience making, bottling and labeling our wine baby.  It was smoooooth sailing and immediately made me want another :)  When you decide to make your own wine, first, you'll get to sample the wines, ALL of them if you so wish.  I spent two afternoons sampling bunches of them and all the staff were generous and enthusiastic in helping me find which wine I wanted.  Then, you make an appt for conception.  It's fairly simple  and pleasurable.  Again, you can grab a glass of wine as you work, mixing the juice and water and yeast in a giant white bucket (Carboy), churning away for about 10 minutes and then your part is done for about 6 weeks!  The rest of the staff will ensure that your baby gestates comfortably and appropriately, testing its ph and sugars until its ready to be born.  Then the magic happens.  As the parent, you'll have full creativity in naming your baby.  In which case, you can pick any 3 images you like, decide the wording and color scheme and font of the label, email all that to Jenny and she'll print out the most perfect labels.  You can then invite a bunch of friends to witness and help in the birthing.  You can bring in all kinds of snack ems and the fine ladies at Water 2 Wine will immediately ply your guests with tastings of their wine and you can buy bottles (and bottles) to facilitate in the birthing process.  Everyone in your party can try their hand at filling bottles, corking bottles, melting the lid foils, and sticking on labels.  In the end, you'll have about 30 bottles of fantastic wine ( I recommend the Gruner!) to share and take home.    They make for fantastic house warming, business, wedding, new baby, Christmas, Hanukkah, etc gifts.  In fact, if you decide last minute you'd like to adopt a wine baby for Christmas, they keep a bunch already made and ready to label for your Christmas party or gifts.    Best thing was, our friends had so much fun and it was such a new experience for all of us that we WIN again as the hostess with the mostest.  And, even though I had grand plans of using this wine at our housewarming party, I doubt it'll last another 8-10 months so we may indeed make another baby next year.    Jenny and the rest of the staff really made this so much fun and interesting with all their cool contraptions and accomodated me with the music I wanted (got to have appropriate Edith Piaf wine birthing music!) and never left a wine glass dry in my group.    So grab your partner, in life, in business, in crime, and get to makin that baby! They're the best kind of babies, they don't puke or shit or cry and instead of causing you stress, they relieve it.  And in the end you'll have the coolest collectible bottles."

                "description": "Water 2 Wine has taken your normal wine drinking experience and given it a unique spin by providing you the keys to the winery and letting you become the vintner. You make your own batch of wine, create custom labels, bottle it, and best of all, taste the fruits of your labor. By having you do this work on site they are able circumvent certain regulations resulting in less sulfites and other chemicals than store bought wines.  I have been visiting Water 2 Wine for about five years and actually created a batch with my wife and we gave the custom bottles of wine away as gifts at our wedding. The gifts were a hit.   Water 2 Wine imports their grapes and juices from other vineyards. This is not uncommon for vineyards in Texas as most don't grow enough grapes, if any, to meet their own demand. When you decide to make a batch this is where you will start. You will mix the juice, and depending on the type of wine you are making will add flavors like oak.  After you make the wine it will go in the back room for fermentation where the staff will guide the wine along over the next six to eight weeks changing containers around six times.  About two months later you will come back and bottle your wine. You add your label, fill the bottle, cork it and shrink wrap foil around the top. Like a good chef test tasting food a lot of quality assurance goes on during this process. This is a perfect event to bring along a group of friends. Hopefully you end up bottling more wine than you drink.   You don't have to make wine. Water 2 Wine is also a spacious wine bar, with a large selection of wine, where you can stop in just to drink some wine. All of the wine is made on site by the employees. They don't sell food but you are welcome to bring in food to eat with your wine. There are plenty of tasting options or you can buy by the glass or bottle. The staff is very friendly and have been one of my favorite aspects of every visit."

Stop by and challenge the team to find you the perfect glass- they won't disappoint."

It was a last-minute decision to book a bus so we ended up having two drivers, because they had to scheduled something at the last minute, and both were entirely friendly, professional and helpful. We wanted to find a bar with a mechanical bull and they helped us track one down. There communication was perfect, it was always easy to reach them and they were super flexible at the end of the night, allowing us to extend our trip for as many hours as we wanted for an hourly rate. In the end we only stayed out another hour, and they gave us the extra hour for free. Also, because it was a late booking, they offered us their 25 person bus for the 20 person bus rate.  The sound system was enough to give everyone permanent hearing loss and the dancing pole and hand holds proved to be incredibly robust and secure!  These guys are AWESOME, and I would DEFINITELY book from them again in a heartbeat."

When I started to ask general questions, the man on the phone (unfortunately I did not get his name), kept telling me to refer to the website. When i asked him if he could please tell me his thoughts on how long the bus was needed for, etc over the phone because it was easier for me to do as I could not look at my phone at the time, he very rudely said \"I just don't understand why you can't just look this up on our website.\"   I do not think it is too much to ask to provide basic information over the phone, and the snarky, rude comment was completely uncalled for and one of the more unprofessional customer service experiences I have had. Needless to say, I will not be using Austin Party Bus for my transportation."

                "description": "Booked a limo bus to take 23 people to float the Guadalupe River in New Braunfels, six hours round trip.    Bus: The rate was so much better than every other place I found that I worried the bus would be shabby.  Not so.  Bench-style limo seating, hardwood floors, good sound system, and a pole for dancing.  My birthday guests were all impressed.   Service: Our driver Mike quickly answered every question I had in the weeks leading up to the event (and I had a lot).  He gave us an excellent rate, arrived on time, and was very polite and accommodating.  We were a loud, rowdy birthday crew, but he never seemed to mind.  The first toob place we visited was sold out, so he called another and even got us a group rate!    Overall: Very happy, no complaints.  I plan a few different party buses every year, and I will be using Sixth Street Rides from now on."

                "description": "We purchased a MooLaLa deal for a 5hr wine tour from Sixth Street Rides for up to 15 people.  The deal was supposed to end before we were able to get the group together but Sixth Street Rides was very accommodating on extending our deal to March (2 months after the deal was supposed to expire).  Mike handled our requests including moving the date and giving us suggestions on where to go with complete respect and professionalism.  I received a confirmation the day before as well as our driver, Chris,  called us 20 mins before our pick up time.  We had a couple hiccups (including running late - as 15 girls tend to do - as well as running late at our last winery stop) but Chris handled it with the utmost patience and ease.    Honestly I couldn't have asked for a better company to use for our wine tour.  I highly recommend Chris and Matt over at Sixth Street Rides."

They all want party busses for their birthdays/graduation parties. My only complaint was the A/C did not work from the get go of the ride, my birthday was in May so it was pretty hot on that 22 person bus, but no one had a stroke so it was still a good time. Just make sure you get a bus with an A/C. Other than that, no complaints about this company. Driver was on time (11:00), and took us wherever we wanted to go. We had the bus for 4 hours which was more than enough time. Spent an hour or so on the bus, got dropped off down town for 2 hours, then rode it for the last hour and dropped people off back in west campus. It was perfect!\""

He then refused to take us home from the second winery which was an hour and a half away from where we live?? He said we were drunk even though 1. We hadn't even had 2 regular sized glasses of wine total and 2. Isn't that why you hire a driver?? So you don't drink and drive? He put his finger in my mom's face so close it was basically touching her nose. When my brother tried to calmly speak to him, the driver dramatically told him to back up because he was \"dangerous\" and started filming. The video he took will clearly show that no one was threatening him. The other people at the winery came up to us after and could not believe how he acted and that he just left us in the middle of no where. He also called the cops on us and then drove away laughing. What if one of us had a medical condition and needed to get home to take medicine? We had to call all of our friends to see if one of our friends could pick us up since there were no ubers / Lyfts.

The driver was dismissive of us from the start, we needed help setting up the Bluetooth speakers but he was clearly trying to rush us from the moment we got in the bus. At what was supposed to be the halfway point of our trip, the driver came into the winery and told the owner we were 'running late' and they needed to rush us out. This company had over booked themselves and instead of calmly talking to us to resolve the situation, they decided that abandoning a group of people - an hour and a half away from our destination - was the best course of action. The driver had also called the police after escalating the situation himself which was both unprofessional and a waste of the officers time. To add insult to injury, the driver was laughing while he drove away without us. We were lucky enough to have friends drive out and get us, but it was a terrible end to what was supposed to a fun experience. I would not recommend this company if you expect transport to be completed both to and from your destination."

                "description": "Two years in a row now, me and my peeps have used this company to chauffeur us around the hill country wineries.  Beautiful idea, that.  Depending on how many people you have and what kinda of car you want, they will tote you around in a shuttle bus, a limo, or even a stretch hummer.    What is sooo cool about this company, is that they are so laid back about every event you schedule with them.  They will let you bring ungodly amounts of food and booze on the bus or limo and you can get as loud and unruly as you want, as long as you don't puke in the vehicle.  Last year  got a little rowdy and alll the girls ended up pole dancing in the shuttle bus!    We always bring party trays of sammiches, cheese n crackers, and lots of easy to drink beverages, like box wine or premade mixed drinks. We have them pick us up at my house at 10 am and they bring us back at 6.  And in that time we are usually able to visit 5 wineries.  When you call to set this up, talk to Bob.  He will visit with you on the phone for a long time, finding out where you want to go and making recommendations on new places.  He is a real sweetheart.  The drivers have always been very helpful also in recommending places and in general by putting up with our drunken behavior i.e. pulling the limo into a convenience store to pee several times in route......  One more kindness they extended to me this year.  We had reserved the airport shuttle style bus again as we had 10 people on our tour and low and behold pulling up in front of my house was the stretch hummer.  I was a little nervous about a mixup but they said not to worry, the bus had a flat that morning so we just got upgraded....now that thing was pimped out!  Blue running lights inside, nice stereo system (I bring my own cd's), and glasses and cups lining the backs of the seats.  Only problem with the hummer is it is kinda difficult to get in and out of for older people or anyone with a gimpy leg.  Only 2 back doors and a steep step down.  Gotta crab walk if you are sitting near the front.  Small regrets compared to a great day of hangin with my peeps, sampling wine and enjoying our hill country."

Will was polite and professional and helped us pick out wineries to go to.  We went to five wineries and my girlfriend and I were a little drunk by the end.  We had booked five hours (12pm-5pm) but knew we had gone over that by 30 minutes and were fine with that.  When the driver wanted us to pay for the extra time he said \"Well, you went an hour and half over but I'll put it down as an hour and fifteen\".  I called him on it and said it was only thirty minutes.  He showed me his watch and for some unknown reason his watch showed 6:30pm.  My girlfriend and I both got out our cell phones and showed him that it was in fact 5:30pm.  He then backed down and charged us for thirty minutes.  At the time, I let it pass and even tipped him quite well cause his service had been good.  Later, when I was more sober, I realized that it was extremely peculiar for his watch to be an hour *ahead*.  I am pretty certain he was actively trying to scam us for an extra hour and don't appreciate someone trying to take advantage of me when I've had some to drink."

                "description": "Found this company on Yelp. Last Sunday, I booked their party shuttle to take 9 women on wine tours for my sister's birthday. Their pricing is dramatically better than all the other companies I researched.  When they showed up, they arrived with the stretch hummer limo - free upgrade due to an issue with the shuttle radio from the party the day before.  Drive showed up almost right on time. Our driver was nice, knowledgeable and all the part-goers were very pleased.    I highly recommend you visit the wineries n a Sunday instead of a Saturday. We visited 6 wineries and had the place to ourselves at most wineries. In contrast, when I've gone on a Saturday, the wineries were overwhelmed, which meant you received no personal service and had to wait in lines - and thus you visit less wineries. Sundays and Bluebonnet Wine Tours are the way to go."

He recommended the 9 passenger limo and 4 of the favorite wineries- Becker, Massina Hof, 4 points and Mendelbaum   Becker was our favorite! The guys working were so fun and the place had delicious nuts, chocolate and live music. The wine was good, too ;)  Our driver, Eric, was awesome and we got upgraded to a hummer limo for free!  Don't forget to bring lots of snacks!"

                "description": "If you are looking to reserve transportation for a wine tour, look no further!!  I reserved a party bus for last Saturday to take some girlfriends on a wine tour to celebrate my 25th birthday.  Everything was fantastic from beginning to end!  They were at least a hundred dollars cheaper than any other place I called, and I feel like we could not have gotten better service.    When I made the reservation, I estimated that we would have around 15 girls and Bob reserved the 16 passenger bus for us.  However, a few days before the event I realized that we actually had 17 people.  I called Bob (slightly panicking that he wouldn't have a solution) and was pleasantly surprised that he offered to upgrade us to a larger bus for no additional charge!  Happy birthday to me!  Our driver (Justin or Jason... I think his name was Jason) arrived 15 minutes early and was extremely patient with us the entire time.  I mean, what other guy could put up with that many screaming, dancing, drunk 20-somethings on a long car ride??  Jason was very professional but also very personable.  He even suggested a winery (Woodrose) that was not on our original tour - and I'm so glad he did!  Woodrose was very low-key and had some great live music (it was perfect for our first stop).    We ended up only going to three wineries on our tour (we were slated to go to four) but that was completely our fault - we just spent wayyyy too much time at each stop.  All in all, this was the perfect way to celebrate my birthday!"

                "description": "I decided on Bluebonnet because of the price.  It was a mistake, the bus was late, it was dirty and I wish I would have spent the money on a better company.  Next time I will ask the venues for a recommendation.  If the venue has a problem with the transportation company it's a bad sign."

                "description": "My friend is using Bluebonnet Limo's for her wedding next Sat. so we decided to check their availability for her bachelorette party.  They were available, super nice, and prompt.  We had a hummer limo pick us up Friday night, take us to dinner, and pick us up on West 6th at 1:30AM.  We were staying about 30 minutes away, so it was great to have a ride for all of us girls.  We decided on Sat. to call them again for another night on the town and they accomodated.   A driver picked us up in a party bus and again, the drivers were top notch.  Great price and exceptional service. I highly recommend this for all your transportation needs"

                "description": "Ordered the 4 passenger hummer and a 15 passenger stretch hummer showed up!  What an awesome surprise!!  Keith was a great driver and knew exactly which Hill Country wineries to visit.  Even though we only scheduled a 1/2 day, we did not feel rushed at all.  Becker and Grape Creek were our favorites.  Can't wait to do go on our next wine tour!"

                "description": "the one star goes for the guy that helped me on the phone. he was excellent. however the driver was horrible and when i called to complain come to find out it was the owner. i dont care if you have 1-2 people or 20 in the back of your car. when you pay for something you should get respect. not being told to get out of a limo while your gathering your things. and this was after he started texting an hour before pickup time asking if we were ready. it was obvious he was not happy we paid for pick up and drop off. but bottom line is we paid. the owner of blue bonnet limo turned our new years into a nightmare. NEVER AGAIN. im now scheduling our next limo service by asking first if they are associated with blue bonnet. HORRIBLE SERVICE! small parties beware!"
