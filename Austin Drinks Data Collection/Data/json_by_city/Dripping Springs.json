                "description": "Honestly i would recommend this place. But, because they are fairly new i think they have some areas to improve and there are a few places i might go before coming back here.   The good.   This is a big indoor/outdoor brewery. Very family friendly. Big play scape for kids to run around. Can come here for food and drinks. Decent beer selection. Decent food selection. Clean and about what you'd expect to pay at a place like this.   The bad.   Though they have a decent food selection, it is lacking in execution. We ordered a variety of things to get a feel of all their flavors. Not very impressed. Let's just start with Texas bbq. Offer paper towels and some type of plates for share-ables v trying to eat out of a small serving box. We started with the queso and slaw with the burnt ends. The queso was lacking in brisket and the slaw was served without burnt ends. When we got the burnt ends, they were fatty (odd for burnt ends) and chewy. Not the crispy charred flavor one would hope for.   Let me preface on all the bbq, it is automatically covered in bbq sauce. This is not my ideal type of bbq. I want to control how much is on my meat.   Next we tried the ribs. Again chewy. Was really hoping for fall off the bone ribs. And again covered in bbq sauce. After trying a few, we could not even finish them.   We then got the chopped beef sandwich and the pepperoni pizza. I was hoping for a brick oven fire pizza. This felt more like a boxed frozen pizza with too much cheese, chewy crust, and thrown in the oven at 375 for 15 min. A bit disappointing. The brisket sandwich was probably the best part of the meal. Unfortunately it was also a bit too fatty for my liking and i only ate a few bites.   The beer was very good in my opinion. But considering the amazing bbq joints and pizza/beer joints around Austin, though i would probably come back, it would not be my first choice."

                "description": "TLDR: A little bit out there, but worth the drive  Came here on a Saturday afternoon. The first impression of both the outside and the inside is the asthetic. It is very tastefully put together (so much so It's worth commenting on). It has the right balance of \"instagramability\" with a twist of \"modern farmhouse\". The day I came out here, it was a tad crummy, so I didn't get to enjoy the outdoor area as much as I would have liked, but it is expansive. I'll certainly be back in better weather.  It's not all look though, they do have the beer to back it up. I only got to have two different ones on tap, but they were both really pleasant. on my next visit I hope to try some more, and see what they have to offer. Overall: 4.25/5"

The drive from austin was beautiful and this brewery makes you feel like you are in the country giving you fun and different vibes. Perfect place for large groups and kids. I went on a Saturday and they had live music which was great! They also have a playground for children. The food items were delicious and came out quickly. I would definitely come back again!"

                "description": "This is my new favorite spot! Plenty of outdoor, spaced-out seating under the cedar trees. Large playground right in the middle to watch the little ones play. Air-conditioned indoor tables as well.   All the food I have tried is great. The fried chicken sandwich special, pulled pork tostadas(?), the beet and arugula salad... it's all good. Only disappointment was the Mac and cheese, pretty sure it's Kraft. But hey, that was for the kids anyway.   I will definitely keep frequenting this place when I am out on Fitzhugh, and especially once the weather gets cooler. Oh, and all the workers are super friendly as well. Good work, team!"

                "description": "The beer is great but the atmosphere is very lacking. When we showed up on a Saturday afternoon, there was no seating. You had to enter (with a dog) through a crowded patio with other dogs. I luckily found 2 chairs not being used at a table to pull aside, but oh lord. There were kids EVERYWHERE. I can handle well behaved kids but there were probably 5 kids per every adult there. It was madness. They were running all over and several times the poor guy delivering food to tables was almost tripped up by them. Our dog was super overwhelmed by parents not watching their kids running up to him.  My husband went to get us beer while I waited outside with the dog, and it took him at least 15mins the line was so long. The beer deserves 5 stars but our dog (and us) were so uncomfortable with how crowded and crazy it was, that we left after quickly sharing a flight. I'd come back, but it would only be right when they opened, and not for very long, considering they're this crowded often.  I definitely don't feel like they took distancing or mask-wearing seriously....my husband and I were the only ones outside wearing them when not at our seated area.  Oh, and the sewage smell is so insane. Rotten eggs bad. Hard to enjoy a good beer with that constant smell. Reminded me of Twisted X Brewing."

                "description": "The space is a modern farmhouse look with high ceilings and clean, modern lines and the outside area has plenty of seating and trees for shade. Aesthetically it is close to perfect, but I have to knock a point off for the food. We ordered the smokehouse nachos and while they were delivered promptly, they were barely warm with cold pieces of brisket. I have to say, I'm amazed they can find anyone to deliver orders to, since you only get a table card for them to locate you, but in our case, we were seated close to the door, so he came straight to us. The beer was okay and I had the cider mimosa. Another thing I was less excited about, but didn't take points off for, was the number of children running around the place. There is a large playscape outside and as a parent whose child was once young, I get wanting to have places that are kid friendly, but that's just not my jam anymore. Again, I don't fault the place for that, but it'd probably make me less likely to return."

Good food.  Interesting beer.  Don't bother with the Mac and cheese as it's very reminiscent of Kraft that you can make at home.  The fried chicken tenders were just ok.  The sausage sampler platter was tasty.  They had other items on the menu that looked good but we didn't have a chance to try them this go-round.  The Barbados Stout was a fine stout.  The Wee Scottish was more unique but wasn't as peaty as I would like, but was still tasty."

Beverage selection: beer, soft drinks and some drink creations they make from their beers. Beer selection was over a dozen, about half  were IPAs. No porters, no stouts, especially for this time of year.  Overall sampling of selections was nothing to rave about, very little body and no depth in flavor. Bar staff was polite and busing the entire place. Unisex bathrooms need regular attention, bar staff should not have to do that too.  Overall impression: we won't drive to Dripping for Twisted X as a destination in the future."

A food truck offering tacos and other Mexican snacks is parked on the premises.    Beer offerings are good with a varied selection.  Available on the day we visited, was chupaHOPra IPA, Mango IPA, Oatmeal Stout, Zwickle, Pilsner, Lager, Pale Ale and a few guest beers.  Flights available, $2 a taster for a very generous pour. Good flavor profiles to the ones we sampled.  2 bathrooms available. Out of toilet paper and not very clean on the day we were there.  Dogs are welcome, however, the outside seating area isn't huge.  Cornhole outside and the COOLEST carved tree you have ever seen!  Worth a stop and a beer just to appreciate the giant gargoyle and sombrero-wearing iguana."

I can't say I had had Twisted X beer before (or maybe I have and it wasn't memorable). The location is nice and quiet, with a ton of outdoor seating. However, the sewage smell was overwhelming! The inside was large and open but was crowded and was so loud. I don't know- I was impressed with the building, but not the beer, and definitely not the smell."

I love getting out to dripping springs and getting out of the city. The leaves are changing and it's just a wonderful drive through hill country  We got there and were greeted with friendly faces. We got a few beers then went on a tour. Very cool behind the scenes look of how they do everything in house!  Came back and told the bar manager we trusted him to put together a flight for us. And he delivered. All the beers were delicious.   We very much so enjoyed our time there! We also enjoyed that there is a food truck serving delicious pizzas! Daniele' did great!!"

On the Sunday that we visited it was too darn hot to enjoy their patio even with their Big Ass Fan. Inside was cool and comfy as we ordered a couple of their taproom only specialty brews and enjoyed the live music. A shoutout to the guitar player who finished his set with a great Spanish guitar-led song.   So bring the mutt and your kiddos (there is plenty of room for both them to run around outside) and enjoy a few of their wonderful craft beers.  Be sure to check out their website for taproom only beers and new releases!"

The brewery has nice curbside appeal.  The structure is nicely done and their is a little area for the doggies.  Of note, dogs are also allowed in the tasting room.   There is also a food truck there.  The inside is your typical tasting room with an industrial look.  It is nicely done.  The bartenders are good.    The prices are right.  I would recommend the flight so you can try ones.  I really think they do a good job on the IPAs.  Their beers are quite good.   But of all of them, i favor the Chupahopra!"

It's not a huge place, but they have tables and chairs outside, an outdoor patio section and then some indoor. You can also sit at the bar. They had live music while we were there (a single guy and a guitar which was pleasant and not overwhelming, and there is a food truck on site. Plenty of parking as well.   We told the girl behind the bar it was our first time, and she did a great job of talking about the beers. I'm not an IPA fan so she recommended the German lager, which I found to be delicious. My friend got the mango IPA which he also liked a lot. And a good price at $5 per glass.   They have tours twice a day but we missed it as well as merch for sale. All in all, I found it to be a great place to hang out on a Saturday afternoon and it's in close proximity to Salt Lick and other wineries/breweries. Definitely make it part of the list to stop at!"

It reminds me of how Austin used to be when I was a kid. Special, sacred and just a lot of damn fun. To be honest I wish that I could have this gem to myself and keep it secret from the rest of the world but sharing it with my family is simply the only way to experience the best brewery in Austin. There are a lot of good breweries around town but few compare to the crisp, unique, and inventive flavors created by FBBC. A genuine oasis in a desert of hoppy IPA's that remind you of a bad ex. There are few things that I enjoy more than drinking a Brieux Famille on a hot summer Austin day. Do yourself a favor and take the short drive on Hamilton Pool Rd. and discover that there is a lot more to ATX than your special \"Rainey Street\". Love you guys!"

                "description": "I came to Texas earlier this month for vacation. One of the places I was dying to try was this specific beer Company. When our party arrived, it was slow. but there were only a few tables, and they were taken. It was cold outside, so we decided to stay inside and use the side table against the wall. this was fine, but then a table opened up and we got it. We went to the front to order and the I felt like I was interrupting the staff's conversation. I asked their opinion regarding the products, and they pointed to the menu on the wall. I already read the menu; I was referring to any we should try since we only got 4 on a flight. No Matter, we chose then headed to our table. They said it would be ready in a bit. ok... we sat and began talking about all sorts of stuff. after about 5 minutes, we were looking around towards the front to see if they were ready since it should have taken only a minute or so to get 4 flights poured. we are looking over and nothing. After about 10 minutes, a staff member came to the table and advised us our flights were sitting in the front. REALLY?! she came over, she could have brought them. At the VERY MINIMUM, could have told us something, flagged us down or anything to get our attention. Nope, just let the beers sit there while they went back to their conversation. We asked about food and they said the food is on the table in the form of a QR Code. ok... we looked around and was not busy at all, so we wanted to get some food. the wait time was like 40 minutes! there wasn't anyone there! Maybe 6 other people in the entire place.  The Magic of Dean Winchester Beerpub went POOF with that experience. The Glider was G*****E Black Beauty, Cabo, Cosmic Cowboy and Kick out the Yams was Awesome.  Not Likely to return to this Pub, ever. But will likely buy the beers (Mentioned above) if I see them in the stores.  Maybe staff was having a bad day. I dont know but that was my Experience"

                "description": "I don't drink so I can't comment on that but I can on the service which was severely lacking and the food.  You walk into a huge room and at the end is a small counter.  We had never been so didn't really know where to order or know anything about the beers. The people I were with are from Oregon and saw the owner on some show. I was hoping to show them awesome Austin hospitality but these chicks that were running the place seemed pissed to have to help anyone.  They finally ordered and we went outside to grab a table. About 10 minutes later I noticed other people having drinks but not the people I was with. I went up to the counter and all their flights were sitting on the bar. We had NO idea they were ready or that we had to wait for them. I have to say, if you expect a tip you have to work. They looked smug when I went up there and asked if they were ours. Anyway, service was a ZERO star.  The only thing I liked was the strawberry pizza. It sounds crazy but it was awesome! Not a lot of crust, just the right amount of cheese and it was huge! The pretzel, just don't! It's a Sysco frozen thing that was microwaved. Just stick with the pizza!  We won't be back but I sure hope I can find that pizza somewhere!"

                "description": "Delicious pizza, lots of beer options, great grounds, but admittedly not what I was hoping for. My family are Supernatural fans and considering the name of the establishment is a cute nod to Jensen Ackles' role in the show, we had hoped there would be some spooky theming to the establishment, maybe some fun photos or props, but there wasn't anything of the like! Anyone walking in who wasn't a fan simply wouldn't even know. A bit disappointing because while it was pleasant, it wasn't unique-- just a brewery in the hill country. *shrugs*  Ignoring my own hopeful expectations, as I said, we had a lovely time. It wasn't too busy on a Thursday night, and the staff were good about roaming occasionally to see if guests needed anything and to inform us about last call on food and later beer. We sat at one of the outdoor picnic tables and ordered with the QR code; received a text when things were ready for us to pick up. There's also some seating indoors if that's preferred. Noticed there was an area inside for a band set-up, though there wasn't anyone playing while we were there. Water is available in coolers both inside and on the patio.  Nice restrooms are clean and chic. The playground is pretty fun if you've brought munchkins. There is also the ever-popular Texas-favorite Cornhole. If it's a moist day, the ground may be a bit muddy, fair warning. The parking lot is all gravel. Turn is easy to find thanks to numerous signs along the way guiding you to the entrance."

                "description": "We had the BEST time here today! We made a reservation yesterday for today (good thing too because you have to have a reservation) and sat outside on a picnic table.   The hostess informed us there was a bit of a wait for the pizza and told us to put in our order as soon as possible. We got on it immediately and then figured out why she told us that - after an hour wait, we finally got our pizza.  No biggie though because the drinks are available as soon as you order them and there's a playground for the kids to play at so they weren't driving us crazy while we were waiting to eat.  The pizza was delicious! We got the pepperoni, carnivore, and Hippie and all of them were great! They're a thin crust, so you'll eat more than you think you'll want. The Hippie was my favorite.  We had such a great time listening to the band play and enjoying the perfect 70° spring weather.  We'll definitely be back!"

Order from your seat and pickup after a few minutes. If you don't live in the area it is a bit out of the way. As Supernatural fans we made the 3.5 hour trek, but wouldn't say we would do it again. The beers are fine. Nothing stood out except a dark anchored cream beer, but all were good to sip for a bit."

We were completed soaked so we decided to wait rather then go back out I'm the rain. Thankfully a table opened up and they sat us within about 5 minutes. The service is all ordered online and then you get a text to pick up your drinks or food. It was a cozy place with a great selection of beers. Flights were only $10 so we took advantage of that! The also had pretty good pizza."

You can order pizza from the food truck. We had the amazing.   Beers are all pretty good. The Grackle, Cosmic IPA and the Hamilton Pool Pale ale were my favorites. I was surprised at how refreshing the IPA was and happy with the flavors of the Grackle, a not too heavy imperial stout.   Would love to head back with our kids next time as the venue was wonderful."

                "description": "Family Business Beer Co is so worth the drive out into Hill Country. I try to go every weekend. The beer is good, the pizza and salads are good (vegan/ non-dairy cheese available), and the setting is FANTASTIC. They have picnic tables outside in an oak grove. In the evening, string lights give the seating area a really warm and inviting vibe. I've sat at one of the tables at the edge of the property at dusk and watched a family of deer frolic nearby. You don't get that experience at a suburban strip mall restaurant.  Friendly dogs are welcomed here, as long as they remain leashed. There is even a pickup station with bags and a trash can.  The staff have all been SO friendly and welcoming every time we've gone. They'll occasionally have to remind people to please wear their masks, but this isn't a personal attack. They're just doing what they must to stay open!  Covid precautions: Masks are required for everyone unless seated at your table. You'll spend the vast majority of your time seated, so this is really not a big deal. The tables are far enough apart that this feels quite safe. The picnic tables have been covered with plastic table cloths, so they can be sanitized between patrons. The playground is currently closed, and there are no games or live music. Reservations through open table are required, to help with social distancing, but if they are not busy they will seat walk-ups.   I love this place even with everything being scaled back because of the pandemic. I can't wait to see how much more fun it will be once it is safe to fully reopen!  Things I would like to see: Cider as an option. Live music. A few more veggie choices."

                "description": "We went to Family Business with daughter and boyfriend on Sunday, December 27, for a pleasant family outing. It was so, with one exception. The positive first. The grounds are very pleasing, and FB is very careful to distance you, to sanitize between visits and to enforce mask wearing.   Their beers are well designed and creatively conceived. Cosmic Cowboy is a mildly rich, middle of the road offering and fun on the palate. Hamilton Pales is crisp with fruity tones and makes a great warm weather beer. Brieux Famille is my wife's favorite, though she usually prefers a beer that's one step beyond rainwater.  The downer was the guy in charge of passing out your beer order from inside the taproom. He was overly officious and rude. He liked the little bit of power he had, and he used it. I felt disrespected and insulted because I tried to sip my two beers down to a level such that I could carry it without spilling a bunch. I was doing that on the deck, not in the taproom, and he shouted me down. Daughter's boyfriend was offended on my behalf as well.  FB, please train your folks on how to handle customers with dignity. It's not only what you say, it's how you say it."

They've gone overboard with the outdoor masking and the covid precautions to the point where it's just not that great.  I hear some of the other establishments in the area aren't as bad re this.     I'd probably skip it until they see fit to remove the outdoor masking.    Definitely buy the beer in the store though. It's top notch."

The hill country views are beautiful and I'd imagine sunsets here are gorgeous. Outdoor games available. Dogs on leash are allowed.   Lots of seating and an interesting idea on how to hold your seats/table. It was nice not having to worry about somebody taking our spot while playing with the animals. You can also get food for them at the bar. They were pretty gentle and didn't mind selfies.   Lots of beer, cider and wine options. I had the sweet Sangria (Messina Hof) and Cherry Cobbler by Martin House. Both delightful and fruity.   They have 2 food trucks: Gringas Grub Shak and Kelly's Hill Country BBQ. I went with Kelly's and got the Brisket Elote Parfait and it was so, so good. I want to go back just for that! There were so many options to choose from. There's really something for everyone. I'll definitely be back!"

It the best of what the area wineries offer in terms of a place where you want to spend a leisurely couple of hours, with a great assortment of local craft beers on tap (and options for the non-beer drinkers).  I like that there is a variety of seating options (picnic tables, Adirondack chairs, barstools) and they are nicely spread out.  Aside from the view the main attraction is their resident llamas and mini donkeys, and trust me, splurge on the bag of feed for optimal up-close interaction with these adorable camelids!  | Beverages | A nicely curated selection of local beer on tap, and surely something to please everyone.  There's also a selection of cider, hard seltzer, wine, and non-alcoholic beverages.    | Eats | We didn't eat here, but there's an onsite resident food trailer offering tacos, quesadillas and burgers."

It's kid-friendly, dog-friendly (just don't let them get close to the llamas) and the views of the hill country are gorgeous. My only suggestion would be to add a really nice, healthy mocktail to the menu. We had the lemonade, but it was an artificial lime green, which was a little unappetizing."

                "description": "After a long dip at Blue Hole Regional Park, the Shady Llama is a place to go for a quick bite, beer, and incredible views. As soon as you walk in, the chairs and hammocks out provide a nice campfire style vibe. There are a ton of trees to keep you cool, and the view of Hill Country is one of a kind. To your right, there is a small fence with adorable llama's you can feed and pet. I didn't get to try the food, but the bbq smelled incredible.  Lots of beer and wine options, and great place to bring your friends for a relaxing afternoon."

The check in is nice, you tell them how many people are in your party and they give you a table sign to reserve your spot. The beer selection is local. Wine is local as well. The llamas are an extra treat to see. You can purchase feed at the bar. The view of the valley and hill country is fantastic. This is a great place for groups, dogs and is kid friendly too.  All staff members are friendly and helpful."

                "description": "What a perfect place to enjoy a relaxed few hours on a nice weather day in the Hill Country! The Shady Llama, just west of Wimberley on the way toward Dripping Springs on RR12 is a gem of a yard bar offering Texas-based craft brews, soft drinks, and wines with a killer view and a few furry mascots to feed and pet.  Our family loves this place. We can each enjoy a tasty beverage we like, have a good lunch from the Gringa's truck we like from Wimberley, and feed some alfalfa to some llamas and burros.  There are plenty of socially-distanced places to lounge around the terraced and tree-shaded yard, and everything is outdoors. It's actually perfect for pandemic times.  Pro-tip: do not try to come here during any weekend with special events in Wimberley, like Market Days or Rodeo. The parking lot has limited capacity. Lazy Sundays are the best time IMHO."

Plenty of great drinks on tap as well as friendly bartenders.   The bae and I came here after a swim at the neighboring Blue Hole Regional Park. Short 11min drive will get you to Shady Llama from Blue Hole.  The star of the show is the petting zoo featuring the llama and two donkeys. You can get up and personal with the llama by feeding and petting. I was a little hesitant to get too close because who knows if he'll spit.  The view of Texas Hill Country is breathtaking and you could sit here for hours just taking it all in. There were two food trucks on site offering tacos and bbq.  THE FINAL BAMBOO: The vibe here was so nice. Great place to unwind after long day at the pool or chill with friends until dusk."

                "description": "Judging from the recent reviews, I guess I'm in the minority. But I miss pre-COVID Shady Llama.  It's just not the same and the magic is gone. Given that literally 100% of the place is outside,  their COVID protocols are way over the top.   Why do you need to assign picnic tables??   And all the hammocks are gone (risk of transmission is greater from canvas than wood??).  At least they stopped doing the inane requirement of reservations they were doing for a while.   So if you're uber paranoid and love restricted freedoms maybe it won't be an issue for you.    But it just made my wife and I sad to be back (1st time in a year and pre-pandemic we were regulars).   Yes they have good beer, and higher prices now to offset the fact that people obviously aren't flocking there like they used to.  And the view is great and it's fun to see the llamas and if you never went before maybe you'll be none the wiser.  But for me it's just a sad reminder of what it used to be and a testament to how much fear and paranoia have all but ruined our country.   I won't be back until they restore everything to pre-pandemic protocols."

                "description": "Just all sorts of whimsical in brewery form.  Their table designation decor they give you at the front so you can claim your spot without fear of anyone scooping it up when you're grabbing a beer or going to gawk at the llamas or mini donkeys is adorbs and shows attention to detail and a winning customer service experience right off the bat.   The tables are spread out nicely and there's plenty of shaded options or exposed ones, depending on your tolerance for the sun/heat.   It's actually on top of a hill so you can get a lovely panoramic vista of Hill Country, so you better believe if you're there at sunset, you'll be getting a gorgeous setting to close out on.   They don't brew their own beer (or wine), so they offer up a glimpse of Texas' finest on tap, which I appreciate. During COVID, every order came with chips or a treat (from a Costco assortment), but there's also a taco truck in the back if you're looking for something a little more substantive.   Kid and dog friendly, and since there are cute animals roaming the grounds (but fenced away from the tables), there are a lot more kids also roaming the grounds, so if that's not your thing, this may not be the place for you ;)  They have 6 llamas and two mini donkeys, and while the guy checking us in made it seem a sighting of them is rare unless you get there right when they open because that's when feeding time is, they were ever present during our midday visit. You can purchase feed for $1/bag to lure them over, and so I have a feeling we just had an extra generous crowd that day that always kept them fence curious!"

I was a bit hesitant as someone who didn't like beers much and as this was 30 minutes from where we were staying in what seemed to be in the middle of nowhere.   I ended up loving my visit! I tried four different ciders or IPAs and was able to find one that I could sip on for the rest of the day. Pizza was pretty good too, not too heavy.   The sun had come out by the time we finished our drinks and we got to play some corn hole and interact with some goats. Lovely trails around the farm and we even took home a few packs and merch before we left.   Highly recommend!"

Super solid beers (primarily known for sours/wild ales, but great IPAs and stouts to boot), wide open spaces with 2 bars (with differing taps), a goat farm for family fun, walking trails, and even scratch-made wood fired pizza! This time we got the Mason (red sauce, mushrooms, pepperoni, red onions, fresh Lioni mozzarella, pecorino Romano) and, even though I try to never ever have pizza while traveling (something we New Yorkers aren't exactly starved for, thankfully), this...was delicious.  Could it have been the beer talking? Perhaps slightly...but this was admitted good pizza, and just what I needed. Had to try the blue corn muffin, as I do love me some corn muffin/bread - it was fine, but better to have more room for pizza or beer lol  About a 30ish min uber/lyft ride from Austin, there's absolutely no excuse to not stop by and make one incredible day of things! I was back here in March 2020 and now having revisitedin March 2022 (F-you covid and messing up SXSW 2021...and so much more), this place is a must. And don't forget to say hi to Sasha, the Golden Retriever / goat herder!"

                "description": "Stopped by here in our way back from Hamilton Pool. There was quite a line when we got there to check in for some reason, which they said was to just ID you. However in the end you put your order online and get a text for pickup.   The website claimed a 30 minute wait for pizza, but by the time we decided it was a little over an hour wait. Not ideal, and I feel like for pizza it should be pretty quick since they have the stone oven. That's the main reason I knocked a star off. The pizza itself was phenomenal. Knowing the wait we should have ordered 2 for 3 people. We got a side of olives that comes in a large container which we also enjoyed.   The ambiance here was pretty chill. You get folks who are just super casual and then folks who look like they could be instagram influencers here. Witnessed a birthday group, a bachelorette party, a baby shower, and a pug meetup all together!   There is also an area for goats if you wander far enough to check them out. There's also a nature trail which we didn't get to explore. Next to the stable was a private area where we also saw a wedding gathering."

                "description": "Ever hear of a place so much it makes you envious and you have it on your list of places to go whenever you get around to it? This is that place. Friends in the beer business highly recommend. This is THE coolest farmhouse brewery. From the beers, huge farm, trails, goats, rabbits, and chandelier swinging in the trees, Jester King has it all. Try the food, it's just as good as they have a real wood fired oven! Ambiance is 5/5- there are so many cool places to enjoy a cold brew- beer garden, under the outdoor tent, along the trails, the brew barn. Try the cider, it looks deceiving but it's VERY good! This is a must visit when in the Austin area.   P.s.- The restrooms are in a converted airstream!"

                "description": "Jester king is a fantastic outdoor venue for family and friends with unique and bold beers. They have several bars, each with different offerings, to encourage you to roam around the property. They also have wood fired pizza, which does take a long time on busy nights - so order right when you arrive! We also got a chocolate chick cook and the Texas Twinkie (jalapeño wrapped in sausage and bacon) to snack on and they were INCREDIBLE! The blueberry beer and mushroom beers were my favorite from our 3/18 visit. The beers change often so get excited to try something new at jester king! Also, they have goats and a playground - just epic."

                "description": "This place was a cool spot to visit on a skip work day Friday. They had a good drink menu to choose from. Their food menu option was great too!   Only downfall is I wish they had their brewery tour open. The traffic for Friday was good. I wasn't expecting many people to be on grounds.   It's big enough to service a lot of people. It's also family friendly with trails and a playground. For the size, I think the playground for the munchkins can be bigger.   I definitely will be back since my husband wants to see the brewery."

                "description": "Multiple bars at the venue, each with their own style, menu, and line.   Live music at the first bar was awesome. Must also go see the goats up by the metal barn and the rabbits out back by the restrooms which are housed in a converted camper.  At this bar, I recommend the white wine spontaneously fermented beer.   At the second bar, strongly recommend over any aversion to how it sounds, that you try the mushroom and sea salt beer.   They also have corn hole to play and plenty of indoor and outdoor seating."

                "description": "I remember when this place was a new thing. Every one of our friends would invite us but it was usually during those torturous hot summers so we never made the trek out there.  Time passed, more breweries started popping up all over and it became less of a unicorn. We still wanted to go, but we never thought about planning for it. Such is life with a three year old, you're just along for the ride...  A quick trip to the zoo, three hungry bellies and then the thought, \"Isn't Jester King around here?\"  Find me a prettier Austin day than 55 degrees and sunny.   The grounds are magnificent. They are diverse, offering something for everyone and they are expansive. There's so much to explore.  The food was great, the pizza reminding me of a certain Austin pizza juggernaut (Pious). The kolache and the meaty beans were surprisingly good.  The crowd was happy, engaging and...pretty. I couldn't help at notice everyone who didn't have a kid was dressed up while all of us slobs with kids were just holding it together by a thread. Either way, it was harmonious and positive.  While I didn't get a chance to sample all the beer, I did have a small sampling of two red fruity ales. I'd want to wait for a couple more trips and more beer tasting to give my definitive on the beer.  That said, the experience is what matters, and it was definitely something you'd want to do again. Sure, the stars aligned weather-wise but they often do for us in Austin so enjoy!"

                "description": "This place is truly a craft beer experience unlike any other in US!  We ventured out to Austin for a bachelor party and as we are all beer enthusiasts / professionals, Jester King was the main goal. We called ahead to let them know about our party size / arrival, secured tickets for the tour and stayed for an early dinner.   We HIGHLY recommend the tour.  I personally have been a tour guide for many breweries as well as have been on many brewery tours but this one was so personal and meaningful. Debbie gave a world class tour and really made everyone understand the reason why JK exists and the emphasis on terrior they have. The legendary coolship room was fantastic and I geeked out on the horizontal lager tanks.  We snagged a beer at the barn bar before the tour started.  The food and ambience was fantastic! Everything is so spread out and their kitchen that day was rocking. Ya can't go to JK without snagging a pizza and glass on one of their saisons.   Regan and Jerika, who I know from the Stone Brewing days, were prime examples of hospitality. From geeking out about the to go selection to just talking about the rad events they have coming up, it was all tied together to the overall beer experience.  I shared some Pure Project beers and SD gifts for their wonderful attention to detail. The overall team is a well run machine!  Go out there, try a beer you have never heard of, and enjoy the open Texas field."

                "description": "Came here because Jester King has two of my favorites, pizza and beer! They have a variety of pizzas so we order (3) of them and they were all good! And with that track record it is safe to assume they're all tasty! Not sure if they make their own dough but it was a good with a nice crunch.  The beer selection is pretty wide as well. Pro tip is to ask for a flight even though it's not shown on their menu. That way you can taste a bit before ordering a whole pint!"

It ended up being a great find. The grounds are lovely and in November the weather was absolutely perfect. Their beer is pretty much all sour so be prepared for that. The goat tour was also really charming. When it was over there was a small hiking loop (I'm guessing a couple of miles?) that we were able to take.   Unfortunately we did not sample the pizza but that's on my \"to try\" list the next time we come back."

The food is expensive and the pizza is definitely worse since they took over. The atmosphere is great; so I'll give it that... but how did this all happen with so many better breweries all over the place here ?  Maybe if you like sour beers and some strange brew, give it a try.  The food isn't bad either, just not as good."

Lots to do here like grab a beer, walk around, explore the grounds, enjoy the scenery outdoors, pet some baby goats. They make their own beer here (obviously lol) and even had a few sours, which is sometimes rare to find! Also, you can purchase cans (and bottles?) of their beer. Very chill spot especially in the evening sitting on a picnic table with the twinkly lights and live folk music."

                "description": "Overall, jester king brewery was great. The grounds and location are beautiful.  There were some hit or misses with each dish I had, and the beer didn't win me over. I think why this was 4 stars because everything was just good, but the grounds and location made that 2 star go to a 4 star.   The tomatoe soup bisque was interesting. It was very watery. The flavor slowly grew on me. The grilled cheese was good, but small. I feel there needed to be another half or more bread for it.  There was too much soup to grilled cheese ratio for dipping.  The sage cookie truly grew on me. The flavor was intense and sweet. I took a bite and then needed a few mins to process this flavor.  Eventually I'd eat the whole thing.   The bread with dipping butter sucked. None of us liked this at all. I felt the bread was kinda hard, and I was expected warm bread but it was room temperate. Also, the butter it came with was super bland too.  The 2 beers i had were okay, but i felt the flavor was pretty bland. I was here back in February so maybe the batches they were working on then were not my cup of tea."

                "description": "LOVE it here, because Jester King is more than just a brewery. They also serve fresh pizza, have lots of land, have a walking trail, and also GOATS!!!   If you can, Jester King advises reservations to guarantee a spot. If not, they do accept walk-ins, but be warned it's based on availability. People spend more than the average time here to enjoy the amenities Jester King has to offer.   How it currently works: Check-in at the Pole Barn, order food from your phone using the QR code, pick up your food and order drinks at the Pole Barn, and find a seat either in the Beer Garden, The Hopyard, The Canopy or the Grotto.   The Hopyard is where we decided to settle just because it's away from the larger crowds at the Beer Garden, and you're next to the Goat Barn! I didn't find the smells of the goats too horrendous, but be warned on windy days, the dust kicks up heavily!  Brews, Ciders, and Wine is what Jester King has to offer in terms of beverages. You can also take some home with you by stopping at their shop! Jester King is pretty niche when it comes to their brews, as not only do they have pure cultures, but mixed as well. Get crazy brew people!"

I'm not a beer aficionado... my husband is and he seemed to enjoy the tour.  For me, it was all about their outdoor seating, good food options and live music. It's the perfect place to have a nice relaxed afternoon... hanging out with family and friends. We tried their root beer, a couple of different beers brewed on site. I had the Pilzner and it was the perfect drink for a hot afternoon. They offer a pretty impressive menu of starters and entrees. We did their Asian pizza and it was scrumptious. I've never had a pizza infused with Asian flavors and I Jester King does it right!"

You got to be up-close to day-old goats. Holding a baby goat is something you didn't know you needed to do until you try it.  Afterwards, we grabbed a table by the stage (yay live music) and got pizzas and pretzels to share. You can skip the pretzel. It was not good. The pizzas were great and it's a lovely experience to treat out-of-town guests to. It was a Thursday night."

I started with the Treat Oak Ghost Hill neat after seeing it in stores a couple times and it was perfectly smooth.  Next I tried the Spiced Old Fashioned from the cocktail bar and it did not disappoint. I really liked the addition of the cinnamon stick, it added the perfect amount of \"winter\" vibe to the drink to match the cool weather.  The offered a distillery tour that we wanted to go on but it started a bit to late for us, since we were there early.  We played cornhole and overall had a great time, will definitely be back!"

                "description": "Ah man, we really wish that we loved this place better than we did. We came here on Sunday with our two friends and their kids for the first time and the space is just gorgeous: lovely old oak trees, plenty of open space and tables, a little area with slides for the kids to run around and enjoy.  That's where the compliments stop. Everything else about our experience was wanting, starting with the GRUMPY woman who helped us at the bar. We ordered the burger--they were out (thanks for letting us know!). The winter smash cocktail tasted like it had zero whiskey in it and was poured from a spout. The IPA on draft was fine. The food that we did end up getting was only OK. The cucumber salad was runny and mealy, and the chopped brisket sandwich seemed like it could have been tasty that morning but by 5-whatever pm, it was dry as hell. We also didn't get the BBQ sauce that it was served with (our friends did for theirs). Our kid's quesadilla was standard. And bagged chips galore!  Also, they close at 6:00 pm. On a Sunday before a holiday. OK, fine, bad business, but you do you! Here's what's not cool: coming over to our table hot and heavy and telling us you're closing in five minutes with an attitude and demanding our food trays. We're happy to be accommodating! You just don't need to be jerks about it. If you've had a long day and just can't handle the customer service, then have enough self-awareness to ask a coworker to do the corralling.  Honestly, we went over to Fitzhugh afterwards which had good food (desserts at least), better service, a better play area for the kids, and we had way more fun there. We'd love to try Treaty Oak again, but we need to have enough time to forget the less savory aspects of our experience."

They have a tasting room with well-versed, educated servers who can give you the lowdown on the various whiskeys available. My guy and I are not whiskey drinkers, but we really enjoyed tasting and learning about the process.  The grounds are clean and well maintained with ample parking. There's a large restaurant with bar service as well. We went out to hear a band one Saturday afternoon, and hang out before the blistering summer sun hits central Texas. The venue is family-friendly- there were lots of kids, and dogs, picnic tables, frisbees flying, and balls being thrown. You can bring along your own camp chair too. I did love that they had flushing toilets and not just port-a-potties. Thank you! You can also tour the distillery itself. I'd highly recommend checking this place out whether your a whiskey connoisseur or a novice. Let me know if you do! Cheers!"

                "description": "Took my second trip out to treaty oak and was not disappointed with the day spent here. Treaty Oak is the kind of place that you want to spend the entire day at, and you totally can! What I love about it too is that it's a massive space with so much to do while on the grounds. It even has a playground where the kids can play, and an indoor space with plenty of TVs to watch football on game day.  We started off with a tasting, which you can either do Gin or Whiskey. I actually highly recommend the tasting, it's only $10 a person but gives some great background on how each different flavor/bottle is created and made. You also can put the $10 towards a bottle if you end up wanting to buy one to take home.  We then went into the bar area and got drinks, which is a huge variety of cocktails! They have plenty of picnic tables, and multiple boards for cornhole on the grounds. The restaurant on site it BBQ and was amazing! We got the brisket sandwich and pork sandwich and loved them both. What I also loved about it, was that there's multiple places where you can get drinks, foods, etc. on the grounds but your tab stays open for everything. Love this place and highly recommend making a day trip out of it if you haven't been!"

                "description": "A gem in the Hill Country area. Great outdoor seating with plenty of room for kids and adults to run around and play. Pet friendly.  We had the white sangria... which was just perfect for a summer afternoon with some brisket nachos that were yum yum yum! The kiddo had a blueberry lemonade with mac n cheese that disappeared in so little time. He couldn't stop exclaiming how good it was.  We'll definitely be back to try out the cocktail bar for a date night.  They didn't have live music but they were playing music of varying genre throughout the evening. Great way to relax and leave your stresses behind."

                "description": "I want to give this business a better review but unfortunately they had some major issues.  We went last weekend on Sunday and there was a sign to scan the QR code the for menu, we waited in a long line to order food, once everyone got to the cashier she told us that only the brunch menu was being served (it was like 2pm or something).   So everyone had to quickly change their order!   Talk about poor communication!! It should say on the menu very clearly what's being served.   Then, I tried to order vegetarian nachos but my cashier told me they were sold out of beans and that I should just get chips and queso instead, so I did. THEN my brother in law who ordered after me got his nachos which were vegetarian bean nachos (not meat like he ordered). I said \"they told me they were sold out!\" Again, bad communication.  Then, my brother in law ordered sangria and got a big pitcher, my dad went to order the same thing and they gave him HALF the size. So weird and confusing.   This place seems very confused internally and each worker seems to have their own message.  Also nothing for gluten-free vegans on the menu."

                "description": "Treaty Oak Distillery in Dripping Springs is a great Texas distillery getting most things to make their bourbon and gin from around Texas. It has great covered patios and outdoor space throughout the property with a delicious restaurant- Alice's Restaurant, a tasting room, and a covered bar/lounge as well as an outdoor stage and small playground. We did the tour and tasting which allowed us to see the inner workings of the distillery. Cody was an excellent tour guide answering all our random questions as he showed us around the distillery. And I bought an old barrel, which I have wanted in my house for quite some time. I would highly recommend you get over there...today! Such a great time. Thanks Treaty Oak!!"

                "description": "Another great distillery to add to the list when in Dripping Springs! This place is huge and perfect for a group or date or even solo! So much space for you, your kids, and your dog! Bring the family! LoL  It was actually recommended to me at my last stop, and I love me some bourbon and whiskey so it was a no brainer. However, if bourbon isn't your thing they also have options for the gin, vodka and non alcoholic lovers in your group! Something for everyone I'd say!   That being said, I took off a star mostly because the line was stupid long. They definitely could have, and should have had more than just one single file line for us to get a drink, I spent half my time in line.   That being said though, once I got my drink and was able to enjoy the drink and the vibe it was great! They have live music and a restaurant if you get hungry and I ended up getting the day tripper drink! I loved it, it was so good. I will definitely be back!"

If you don't get the brisket nachos, you're making the biggest mistake of your life. But don't eat too much, or you'll be too full for the delicious drinks!   The vibe is relaxed, the food feels almost TOO good for the rustic setting and the live music is pure Texas charm. I could stay here all day!"

                "description": "Good liquor and good atmosphere. As mentioned, plenty of space to spread out.   However, there's no simple way to just stop by to pick up a bottle. Even if you're not buying a mixed drink or anything that requires work other than handing you a bottle and paying for it you have to stand in the line that's serving cocktails and drinks.   Further, when you do get service, it's been rather dismissive the last few times we went. Expect to spend time there- no way to quickly pop in, grab merch and a bottle and leave."

Just about 30-40 minutes outside of Austin lies this beautiful distillery. There's so much space and more than enough seating but even on the weekends this place can get pretty busy. As for food you can expect Texas bbq from this place as I tried both the brisket and Turkey which were both very good. If your not a booze person they also have their own in house wines and beer but if you do like a good cocktail I'd recommend hill country dreaming. Im anticipating come back here to check this place out in the evening for some live music or Sunday brunch!"

                "description": "The perfect spot for a sunny day hang, celebration activity, or date! We came for my best friend's bachelorette weekend and we are so glad we did!!   Parking was ample and so were the picnic tables! We didn't do a tour but put our name in for lunch at the restaurant, Alice's. It was about a thirty minute wait on a Saturday around 1, which really went unnoticed because we just grabbed drinks at the Cocktail Bar and sat in the open seating area until they called us saying it was ready. There was live music, lots of space and tables , cornhole, and you could go do a distillery tour too.   The bartenders were helpful in finding a gluten free drink option for me, as well as our waitress at Alice's. Our waitress was especially friendly and attentive--didn't get her name but a recent HS grad going to UT! She made sure to ask about gluten and dairy free options for me, and there were plentiful. Everyone devoured their food and were happily satisfied. I had a delicious club sandwich on gluten free bread with some salt and pepper chips. SO good. I also loved the white sangria.   All in all, I am so glad we found it and the bride said it was the perfect way to spend our day. We definitely will be back!"

I'd been invited out there for a friends birthday and the idea of heading all the way to Dripping Springs on a hot Saturday afternoon to try bourbon (which in general all tastes like burning to me) wasn't really my idea of a great time. Man, I was wrong. First off, they have a wide selection of spirits, everything from gin and vodka to wine and beer. The setting is bucolic with wide open spaces and clusters of shade trees. A friendly staff, great bbq (try the brisket nachos) and some tasty signature cocktails (try the Pineapple Express) made for a great afternoon that turned into a lovely evening. Did I mention they also had live music? I will be back."

                "description": "TLDR: A really pleasant brewery experience, if a bit out of the way  So right off the bat, this place is beautiful. The \"taproom\" isn't really a room, and more of a tap cavern. Lots of seating, but enough space it still feels very spacious about.  We got both appetizers and some food. for apps, we got the trio. The salsa was really really good. Queso and Guac were both good, but not exceptional. If I am being honest, I can't remember which two tacos I got, but they were fantastic. Everyone at the table really enjoyed theirs.  I had two different flights, so I got to sample a large amount of their beers. they have a lot of really original and unique flavors, while still maintaining a lot of the regulars you see at a lot of breweries. It really gives this place a lot of individuality, while not making it niche. all of the beers were at least \"pretty good\". Of the 8 I tried though, none really made it to the \"phenomenal\" level, which is my one and only complaint about the place.   100% worth the visit, and amongst the best breweries in Austin. 4.75/5"

We found this brewery just a few miles SW of Austin that just had STUNNING food! I had the chicken tortilla soup which was probably the best I've ever had. I also got a pair of chicken quesadillas while my wife got the pork tacos. Everything including the chips N queso was just great.   The vibe was relaxed and easy going, it was quiet enough to enjoy the Motown music mix, our servers were friendly, the prices quite reasonable, and food was delivered within minutes. We finished off the night with a flight of ice cream. Oh yeah -- the beer was good too. We're bringing all of our friends here first chance we get."

                "description": "Over the weekend we had the opportunity to travel down to Austin and stay at the brewery in our Airstream. This was a fabulous place! The beer that they are brewing is unique and flavorful, along with traditional street tacos and Mexican fare, which can be pretty competitive in Austin.   When we first go there, I asked for a Topo Chico, which they don't have because they have something much better!  If you want something refreshing to clean the palette before you start trying different beers, order the Hop Water! It is amazing!  I really have to commend the staff, because they were friendly, attentive to our needs, and fast.  That is a challenge in today workforce, and there is nothing worse than having great food and crappy service.   While the beer and food was delicious - the one thing that stood out as exceptional was the ice cream flight. That is a must have if you visit Beerburg Brewing. The seasonal speciality was Atole Ice Cream and it was our favorite!"

The staff is friendly and takes their time explaining what's on the menu and even provides recommendations.  Their food is fresh and delicious ... every item we ordered was so tasty! I LOVE that they have homemade ice cream ... a variety of flavors and some of them that are seasonal. I'm definitely coming back to enjoy their outdoor seating,  try their other tacos and of course... ice cream!!!  Potatos bravas - nice and crisp on the outside, soft on the inside. Delicious seasoning. Great sauce to dip the potatoes in.  Guacamole - oh so fresh! Again, just the right amount of salt and lime in it. Chips were fresh too.  Brisket tacos - well marinated and cooked brisket (on the spicy side), with caramelized and pickled onions on a semi fried taco... yum yum yum  Ice cream - chocolate with strawberry was great although I did wish they had more strawberries in it. Blueberry cheesecake tasted just like it's name!  Beerburg Brewery for the win!!!"

We had the whole patio to ourselves with just our dog and the sunset! The setting is hard to beat, a nice view of the hills, an area with trees and benches, and a dog park. They have an indoor area, too!  The beer choices were plentiful and varied, and for non beer lovers they have other alcoholic and nonalcoholic options.  We ordered flautas, brisket tacos, and patatas bravas. My favorite of the three were the patatas - great flavor, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Also quite a bit for the price. The flautas were good - the shell was perfectly crunchy. But, the taste was lacking. This was the case with the tacos, too. Also, for the price, I think 3 would be more reasonable vs. 2... Though I was satisfied (not too full) by the end. Definitely order some ice cream! Both flavors we had were great - probably the best of the food tbh!  Overall a great place to hang out with some friends and have a few drinks. Very dog friendly. The food is promising, but will have to try more to be convinced."

So, the beer was delicious and the artisanal ice creams were incredible but when you visit do not forget to try the striped bass ceviche! Holy bajoles it is knock your socks off delicious.

Because of covid most restaurants I've been too have been sloppy and rushed to get it out the door and not much care places in their food.   The staff were very friendly and took precautions to keep themselves and us safe, which we really appreciated.   I'm not a beer fan so I got a glass if the rosè, it was decent at best. My husband had a cider which was really good.   We will definitely be back with our dog once it cools down some and the full menu is available. It looks like it will be amazing!  Good job y'all!"

                "description": "I came here on a motorcycle ride with my Combat Veteran Association January 22nd, 2022. It was my first time here and it is on a beautiful road in Texas Hill Country.  The company is Military Veteran owned and a very family friendly property. There is a play area with a jungle gym and lots of picnic tables outside as well as a smaller covered outdoor seating area. I honestly didn't see an indoor seating area so I'm not sure if there is one. The covered seating area is where the bar was to order your drinks. They had about 12 beers to choose from some I did a flight of 4; 3 lagers and 1 stout. It was only about $11. The flight was four four ounce pours. They also serve some local wine if I recall.  There was a food truck on site serving up great bbq. I had their turkey sandwich and a cup of beans. Both were extremely good. The turkey was freshly smoked or bbq'd and perfectly tender. The beans was saucy with their sausage and veggies. For $15 I was stuffed. They also had small buzzers to give when ordering so you knew when it was ready and worked on the entire property.  I really want to return here on a warmer day and in the spring and/or summer. The same road this is located on also has a winery or two I believe so it would make a very good day trip or even weekend adventure to the area to explore all the local spots."

What an awesome accidental event to stumble upon, although I'm sure I would've had just as great of a time here were it just a regular weekend. Great beers, fun crowd, lively polka music, very cool artisan craft fair, and one heck of a time in a beautiful beer garden setting. Well worth the drive from Austin if you're visiting!"

Great atmosphere, great service and great beers and I'm not a beer drinker. There is something for everybody.  When you visit a place like this your faith and hope in our country will be restored. The news and maybe even your own neighborhood/community could be negative or living in fear of what's to come, get out.. turn off the tv, hang around your fellow Americans and breathe in some good ol Texas Hill Country air! Does a body good. If that doesn't make your mouth water then stay home...   Food Trucks! Live Music! Veteran owned! Dog friendly!  Face friendly! Goof folks! Oh and beer!  Cheers!!! Merica!!"

The idea that this was founded by veterans and gives back to veterans is amazing.  The beer itself, I was personally disappointed in. It was too \"heavy\", if that makes sense. We tried 3 and one I enjoyed but didn't love. It seemed like they were heavier/stronger than they should've been. Plus a lot of \"froo-froo\" drinks such as mead, etc. made up half their offerings. I get that you need some for people that don't like beer but they had too many."

They have many of their own beers on tap (featured beers change often) and they also feature other local beer, wine, cider and mead.  It's a family (and dog) friendly establishment featuring an awesome tactical playground!  They have food trucks, live music events, and seasonal family fun events.  We are happy to have them in our \"neck of the woods\".  The owners are kind and always welcoming! We hope they stay around for a long time to come!  They have over 80 picnic tables spaced outside across the property, so you can pick any table that fits your style!  Clean restrooms! Free to use water and ice machine!  Changing table!  Rona Rules! Great place to have an outside birthday party or celebration!  The list goes on and on!!!  At at time when our local businesses are struggling to stay afloat, and many are threatened with permanent closure, we are happy to support local business!  12 Fox has gone above and beyond to give back to the community, help neighbors, and support other small businesses at a time in need."

                "description": "Oh, what a great find! The hubs and were out brew hopping a few weeks back and we saw a sign on the corner of a crossing that stated \"12 Fox Beer Co\" [insert arrow]. Any of you who know me at all know my great penchant for craft beers, especially local, and I'm always up for a new brewery. So, turn left it was.  Parked in the large gravel lot. Walked up the trail to the building - HUGE kiddo playscape - I wanna slide! :) Very chill, nice place with a great patio and lots of other outdoor seating.   The proprietors/brewers are Army Combat Engineer veterans who learned about and found their love for beer while being stationed in Germany. Hence, they dozen lineup of Euro-styled offerings. They use single sourced malt and rainwater to create crisp, clean suds that aim to please. Of course there's hefe, pils, saison, dunkel...they also do a solid IPA.   Highly recommend! Really great folks, brewing their best, and serving one of the most outstanding charcuterie and cheese boards I've seen anywhere...no joke (and you might know that's also my \"thing\"). Go hang out in the Texas Hill Country, sip a cold one, get your snack on, and listen to live music on select nights. If a band isn't playing, some locals might start a impromptu jam session. What else could you ask for? Cheers!  Note: at time of last visit was informed they were going to have 2 food trucks on-site. Icing."

                "description": "Brought the family here hoping to find an outdoor beer garden with lots of space: what ought to be the perfect COVID-safe situation for a relaxing evening. Instead we found a business observing no COVID safety precautions whatsoever other than a chalkboard a-frame asking patrons to stay 6 feet apart, a guideline which I seemed to be completely alone in observing. Not a single member of the staff was wearing a mask, nor were 95% of the clientele while ordering at the bar or moving around the establishment. No capacity controls were in place, and the place was generally indistinguishable from a pre-pandemic beer garden.   A ton of wasted potential here, it's a shame the business owners aren't interested in being responsible members of the community and taking basic safety precautions."

Plenty of seating, and you go up to the counter to order and get your stuff right away! This last visit we got the raspberry Meade, it wasn't too bad... Don't think I could drink too much of it though because it is so sweet. There's a playground for kids so parents can hang out while their kids have some fun too, lots of times they have a live band or singer playing. There's easily accessible restrooms, and a food truck if you get a bit hungry. Overall wonderful spot that's out of the way and away from the craziness... Just go here!"

The beer was absolutely amazing.   The beer was absolutely incredible.  They seem to focus primarily on Belgian style beers, which is my absolute favorite, but they have some IPAs that will appeal to the hipsterist of hipsters as well.   We also tried the Cranberry Mead as well as their cider, which was crispy and dry that would appeal to any lager or Pilsner fan.   The outdoor area was expansive and, frankly, beautiful.   The staff were very friendly, accommodating, and genuinely excited to share their knowledge.  It was fun to get their perspective on what I should try.    One thing worth mentioning...that I have seen in comments:   The folks behind the bar don't wear masks.  The order process is 6 foot distances, so no big deal for me, but some may have a problem with this.  Although I feel we are being extremely careful with covid guidelines, for some reason, I felt perfectly safe here.  Overall, I was extremely impressed with the quality of the beer, the beauty of the grounds, and the charming staff. This place will be a regular haunt for us."

                "description": "This establishment is owned by a very famous patriot. There are Some excellent online reviews of One Shot Distillery and the owner. Just plug the owners name, Colonel Phil Waldron, into your favorite search engine.   But if you don't have the patience, the owner, colonel Phil Waldron has concocted an amazing and intoxicating drink called the Jan 6th. The description is so funny. Tongue In cheek: Two parts my pillow guy, one part Giuliani, 1 part Trump. Colonel Phil the owner of One Shot then personally stirs it. He is such a funny guy. He really lights up this place!! He has this funny cos-play bit he will perform if you ask. With his horns and fur hat, he imitates the insurrection shaman. He does a great job. Almost like he was there. So funny!!! Love you colonel Phil."

                "description": "For my husband's birthday, we spent Saturday trying a few places off Fitzhugh that we hadn't been to. It was nice to have a place to stop that had something other than beer. They had several places to hang indoors, then a big outdoor area which looked like it might have live music events. The cocktails were delicious: I had the Mogadishu Mile - like a blackberry mint mule, and the Big Red which was a vodka, grapefruit with rosemary. We ordered at the bar inside, but quite often the bartenders would come out to see if we needed anything or the owner check on us here and there. Cute spot, we'll be back!"

                "description": "Let me preface my review by saying that I'm not an avid beer drinker and only like non-hoppy varieties. I can't really comment on their beer other than to say, the three I tried were not to my liking, but what I can say is that I love this place!  I've been here twice now, with friends, and with my man and both times have been great!  The place is spacious and covered in tree canopies with a sprinkle of fire pits, Adirondack chairs and picnic tables. The service is good and the mules are divine. I love that they serve cocktails as well as beer so there is something that I like and something for the beer drinkers, like my boo.   We were lucky on both occasions to have great weather and this time around, live music. I've been to several of the breweries and distilleries along Fitzhugh and so far, this is my favorite."

The Gold had a little bite to it, but all were delicious.   The wife's hurricane was potent but delicious.   I snagged a raddler which was a little different to a traditional one, but delicious and dangerous as you can probably down 6 before the Lord almighty gets the news.   The brew house and distillery are open and outside seating is abundant.   Bring your 4-legged friends for the ride as they are super dog friendly!!!!  You would have to be drunk and mad to pass this place when visiting Dripping Springs. Wait...they might be able to take care of that for you...responsibly of course.   So. Great drinks? Check. Great staff? Check. Great atmosphere? Check? VETERAN OWNED BUSINESS?!? Affirmative. God Bless y'all for your service.   Rock solid 5 stars."

Otherwise I probably would not come back here, the drink I got was literally all syrup and made me extremely sick to where we had to leave... Kind of completely ruined the day. My boyfriend enjoyed the drink he ordered, which I believe was the hurricane. They have a wing food truck that you can order from, unfortunately we didn't get to try it because the drink made me so sick. We plan to go back in try the wings and will review the wing food truck. Great location for the spot, nice and relaxing... Just be careful what you order and avoid anything that has syrup in it."

                "description": "We made our first run to One Shot on a Friday afternoon recently and thoroughly enjoyed it. They are presently distilling rum and vodka and brewing several varieties of beer.  My spouse tried a Big Red One with salt -- a vodka drink -- and a Cuba Libre.  She was pleased with both. I had their amber and liked it so much I had another.  They have a clever solution to social distancing. The two young, friendly order takers are stationed under a canopy at the edge of the parking lot by their outside seating. You place your order with them, and one goes inside to fetch your drinks. There are plenty of shade trees and picnic benches so it's a pleasant experience. The owner , Phil, came out to say hi to a fellow vet (me). Nice, congenial guy.  The Dripping Wings food truck is stationed there now, so I went back for an order for dinner. Excellent wings, particularly the Asian sweet and spicy.  Glad to have a new convenient venue to enjoy."

Nice, large, shaded outdoor area with lots of oak trees and picnic tables.  I had the Cuba Libre cocktail that has Star Bullet rum, splash of lime, and coke. Delicious!  Husband loves IPAs and had the Panzer IPA, said it was great.  Inside of distillery and brewery were closed, but they have two food trucks on site. Service was awesome and friendly. Would come back!"

You can pick any four beers for $10.  They are brewing 12 beers on a 3.5 barrel system here so they are busy bees!  Their Karnstein was the best amber lager I've tasted.  Sooo good!  We got these in the flight #8 Barghest English porter, #9 Kobold black lager, #6 Karnstein amber lager, #11 Hans Trapp Bourbon Barrel Imperial Stout (yum).

They're dog-friendly (with treats) and have both indoor/outdoor seating. They also had TV that was playing soccer, and strong wifi. I love that they have flight options 4 for $10, as well as pints. It wasn't busy when we stopped through on a Saturday afternoon. They don't have food here, but if you ask the taptender...he'll tell you what food options are nearby.  Service was kind and efficient. Their beers were across the board--good. My favorite was their Aine Hefe! It was floral and super crisp for the warm weather after a long hike. They seem to do a lot of English style ales, which aren't my favorite...but you can definitely find options that suit your taste buds. They also give free stickers upon request. BOOM!"

The staff is friendly, prices reasonable, though quite a few of their brews tend towards English styles.   On our visit, I had the Norwegian Juice, Bellibone and the Killiecrankie. Careful with that last one, it's delicious, but at 11.4% ABC, more than one can sneak up on you pretty quickly.   Acopon just had a really great vibe, and the fact that it's dog friendly is icing on the cake."

I was actually surprised to see them so decently priced this far out in the hill country.   They do provide half pours in their standard sized glasses, just make sure to ask for a half pour when you order. I was happy to see they allow food from the outside as well which makes staying easier as you can bring your snacks in haha.  Not on overly crazy amount of seating, but definitely enough for 5-6 medium/large parties. They also seemed to follow the trend of allowing owners to bring their dogs inside which is always cool and fun to see.  They also have merchandise for sale and their shirts are super sick...did I mention their logo absolutely rocks!?"

Located in Dripping Springs and in a small space felt right.  On the day we visited they had 4-5 beers on tap I believe.  I'm a larger guy, so a Bellibone was ordered up for me.  Suz got an English Bitter Gaspipes.  I enjoyed my larger, it was crisp and cool. This is a great nod to Emil Christian Hansen and the use of his Saccharomyces Pastorianus, which he first isolated in 1904.  A year before the greatest footy team in the world, Chelsea FC was started.  And he was also a Dane.  Suzie drank her Bitter and coo'ed.  We would of stayed longer, but staring a gigantic Manchester City flag was making me ill.  Just Kidding Dudes, I'm still ill after that 6 goal slacking you gave us this past February.  Drop in, grab a pint.  Bring the pup and stay awhile."

                "description": "Mad props to Acopon for allowing my dog to chill inside with me this afternoon! Many places are dog friendly as long as it's on the patio. I walked in thinking the same but was quite surprised to be able to chill inside with my fur-bro. Made for a much better time in this \"hotter than average\" June we're having this year. I've been here a few times now, have never had a bad time here, and after my experience today I will continue to stop by when in Dripping Springs."

                "description": "The owners of the Barber shop wanted to start brewing something different.  They wanted to focus on creating English ales fresh from the cask. Their goal is to have at least one ale available from a fresh cask each week.  Are English ales their sole focus?  Definitely not! There are a variety quality brew styles.  You will find them here.  Their specialty though will be ales.  Acopon is just a stones throw down the street from the Barber shop in downtown historic Dripping Springs. On the Sunday afternoon I ventured here, this was a quiet and sleepy part of town. The tasting room and production are located in the same small historic building. The tasting room is comfortable, and inviting.  It feels lived in, like a proper English drinking hole should.  A nice change from the hipster modern sleek brewery tasting rooms popping up all over Austin.  The staff member behind the bar was knowledgeable and friendly.  They also have canned mead, cider, and wine options for non beer drinkers.  Outside food is welcomed.  They have some tables available outside to sit at, and are dog friendly.  I enjoyed one of their flights.  All of the beers in my flight were well structured.  I liked some better than others.  The Rowan was a stand out for me.  Good solid beers."

                "description": "A short review: The beer was pretty good - but served in plastic cups (unforgivable) - the service was kind of slow. Good prices.  A longer review: We were there during the Songwriters' Festival so this may explain the plastic cups, even so, if you care about your beer you can't serve it in a plastic cup. It defeats the whole purpose. But, looking beyond that, the few beers we tried were good. I particularly liked the porter.  The service was slow with three people behind the bar but it seemed that only one person was really doing the work. (There was a younger lady behind the bar but as far as I could see all she did was stand there and scowl at people.) So, a mixed experience. We'll probably try it again (I suspect the beer really is good) when there isn't a festival going on, and hopefully have a drink in a real glass."

These folks specialize in British type beers, which I like, but also brew one of the best New England style IPAs I've ever had...but they don't bill it as such. Roomy enough, down home local feel.

The beer was to put it mildly scrumptious.  The Rat King Double IPA was one of the very best I have ever had the pleasure of drinking.  Beautifuly balanced, malty, and hoppy at the same time, perfect nose.  Just awesome all around.  The Hans Trapp Imperial Stout was a malt bomb of the first order.  Great Beers, Great People, Great Location.  Great Brewery.  Must Go to if you're in Central Texas ..."

You walk into a beautiful large spacious entrance where all of their vodka is on display. In the mornings they have a build your own bloody Mary bar which is definitely where I'll be camping out. The other drink we tried is one of their slushy's, the hurricane. Don't be fooled... These are doubles and they sneak up on you fast! The sugar to alcohol ratio is on point.  For the pregnant and nursing ladies there's three different mocktails, and friendly bartenders that are willing to put together anything your heart desires. The food menu is great! A little bit for everyone. Salads, soups, even a box for kiddos. Outside is beautiful spacious and open all of the live oak trees are immaculate and the space is well laid out.  They have one small play place for kids, lots of yard games and lots of different areas to sit and hang out. Including a turf area. This place is definitely want to come see!!!"

                "description": "We had such a great tour experience Saturday! We have loved Dripping Springs Vodka, and Gin since we moved to Texas. The clean, pure taste is better than Tito's and we will miss having this when we move soon. The tour was great, and informative. Our tour guide was nice. I wanted to ask him to take our group picture, but in the hour we had our tour, he rubbed his nose, scratch his nose, and touched his nose every few seconds. It was gross. So we didn't get a single picture bc I couldn't ask him to hold my phone! Other than that, the tour was great!!!!!  I rarely leave a review, but this would change someone's mind on whether they would ever come back somewhere these days. I love this company too much not to help them change it!"

We go to deep eddy's every time and have never looked up any other distilleries in the area but I'm so glad we did this time. The property itself is gorgeous and it is coupled by the fact that there liquor is also very good. Ryan had the flight and had their 2 bourbons which he said were okay and then he had the traditional gin which we really liked. They have their cocktails on tap and I got the Raz N Shine cocktail which was made with their orange vodka and was absolutely delicious. We ended up getting another flight of the rest of their liquors after that, and I'm so glad we did because their straight vodka is so good. It's so smooth you could drink it straight. We will definitely be back next time we are down!"

                "description": "Dripping Springs Distilling is just now opening its spanking new tasting room, patios, entertainment venue and production facility, and it is splendid. I went there four years ago, when the tasting room was essentially the lobby to the distillery. While I great.y appreciated what they were doing with their gins and vodkas, the ambience was like drinking in the lobby of Atscott manufacturing in Pine City, Minnesota. This new facility reshuffles the entire deck.  It has taken them a while to complete, but it was worth it. The new venue is spectacular -- well designed, comfortably modern, spacious and welcoming. It's not only a tasting room, it's also a credible restaurant with an interesting menu, specials, and a exceptionally friendly staff.  We went on the second weekend of the 'soft 'opening', but they seemed to have already worked all the kinks out. They were welcoming and prompt and attentive. Our server, Jack, went out of his way to answer questions, including about plantings on the grounds and ingredients in the dishes, and to offer suggestions about cocktails.   I had the street taco daily special and an Electric Lady cocktail. My companion had the jalapeño cornbread muffins and a French 75. The street tacos were small but fully packed. The spice mix could have been spicier,  it then I like hot. The flavors though were indeed special. Nothing dominated, so you could appreciate the protein and still enjoy the comity cheese and the light drizzle of sour cream. The tortillas were a bit small, but you expect that in a street taco. My friends jalapeño corn muffins were excellent. A well constructed corn muffin with one slice of jalapeño that came up and kicked your butt on the after palate. There were plenty of them, so we took lots home for later. The regular entre menu is interesting enough (two different pot pies, additional comfort type foods) that I'll be back.  I should not forget the flight of spirits. I've always respected their two gins, and I often buy them as they are available at Twin and Specs. Very solid, unpretentious and well crafted. I'm not a vodka guy, but my friend liked their offerings. Their 1876 bourbon still needs some maturation and work though. But such is the case with whiskey.   The full grand opening is coming up, with all the hoopla expected. Once the noise is past, Dripping Springs Distilling, with its multiple brands and spirits, will be a destination you'll want to add to the itinerary."

The follow up lunch and drinks topped off the afternoon. The food was delicious and our server Jake was so accommodating.

                "description": "Nice location with plenty of outdoor seating. Food truck with pizza next door. Dog friendly. Tried four of the brews on tap. The IPA and HC Haze were both very good. The Kolsch was okay - a little flat and slightly bitter. None of us liked the Rye Wit - must be an acquired taste.   We likely would have stayed longer, but it was chilly and windy. We'll be back in fairer weather to try the pizza."

Hitmaker has a nice outdoor seating area, clean bathrooms, ample parking and friendly staff.  The menu is not huge , but the Kolsch and Hazy IPA we had were good.  Great place to grab a pizza next door and sit outside with a cold beer!"

                "description": "Welcome Hitmaker to the South/West-ish Austin microbrew community!  I love that there's newcomers to the brew scene here in South Austin. I've had Hitmaker on my radar for a while. I came through with a good friend close to closing hours on a weekend. We were stoked to try their flights, which was great to get a taste of everything. Their menu is limited at the moment, since they're pretty new. I didn't feel any sort of type of way towards any beers in particular, but I do love that they had a Belgian called Accidental Trappist. Their rye wit I love too. They tried to have a little bit of variety in their menu which I appreciated.  The brewery also smells new too. I love it. It's like the smell of a baby or a puppy. Weird. So let's move on. They have board games for all, clean restrooms and TVs. The seating options are endless. You can go outside and play outdoor brewery games or sit indoors at the bar or in their many picnic tables. Parking is also super easy, and the taproom is easy to locate with their brightly-lit sign (especially at night). I definitely see us coming back here more often, especially since our taptender was a sweet and informative man who was so kind to stay a little past brew hours to let us finish our conversation and beers. I will definitely be back for the exceptionally kind service and cozy brew times."

                "description": "A friend recommended that we meet up at Hitmaker Brewpub. Hitmaker? The Google provided some excellent information: \"The co-owners started six of your favorite neighborhood bars/restaurants - MugShots, The Hideout Pub, Bender Bar and Grill, Pour House Pub, Violet Crown Social Club and Pour House Pints and Pies.\" Having been to a number of their locales I looked forward to having a few Hitmaker beers.  The bottom line their beers did not disappoint. My IPA was not excessively hoppy and had that typical fruity citrus flavor. Plus one stepped out of her comfort zone and went with their Kolsch offering. My tastebuds told me this was not a typical Kolch as it was pretty lite and could have masqueraded as a lite pale ale. A good summer beer.   The bartender on duty was very knowledgable and was eager to fully describe their offerings. The taproom is cozy, dimly lit, and cool. Perfect atmosphere for quaffing excellent brews on a hot summer day. Lastly, feel free to bring your mutts."

                "description": "I live pretty far from Hitmaker but have tried to visit a couple of times when I happened to be in the area. I recall both times they were closed when I was near by. My plan was almost foiled again, but this time luck was on my side. Due to Covid-19 the hours online didn't match their actual hours so I got there an hour before they were actually set to open. I didn't want to wait around for an hour until opening time so I was going to head home. As I was leaving I happened to run into one of the workers (maybe an owner) and after explaining my dilemma he graciously agreed to let me in an hour early to enjoy their beer. I was delighted and thankful. I got a glass of the Summer Saison and the Hill Country Haze and enjoyed both. The service was great and the atmosphere was enjoyable."

                "description": "Wow.  8 beers tried, and 8 beers worth trying again! The kolsch is such an easy drinker, light and refreshing!  Pale ryeder and rye wit have a bit more flavor but still an easy drinking wonderful drink!  It'd be hard to stick with just one here, but if I did; I'd probably go with French Saison, wonderful taste and a bit stronger than the others.  Coconut Porter isn't the best porter I've had, but if it's cold outside this would be my drink at the brewery. Hill country Haze is an IPA I could drink, but I'm not an IPA fan.  Accidental Trappist is good.  I can't put my finger on it... you just have to try it.   The brown ale is a little heavier than most and I'd be tempted to grab it instead of the Porter.  They have some cans of wine and a cider too.  $2 tastes 6oz.  $4/5 16oz pours."

After hitting a farmers market and a flea market we decided to take the route less traveled home by watching the compass and staying off the major arteries. This is where Lady Luck showed us a sign that I almost can never resist,\"Tasting Room Open\", like a mosquito to a bug zapper ,I'm in!!   I have to say I really dug this place for a few reasons beyond the fresh beer selection. First is general layout,not to big or to small,its just right. Second is decor,simple,industrial,clean. The focus here is on their craft brews not a bunch of goofy crap on the walls. Third is noise, this place was chill. I was actually able to converse with my bride without the aid of ASL!   On to their craftwork, after meeting the very friendly barkeep we decided I'm a picky bastard and he had me try a few samples, all were very good. Landing with the Kolsh really hit the spot!!

                "description": "It's totally worth the drive if only for the gorgeous view. This place has a little bit of everything: sun, shade, food, drinks, yard games, pickle ball, and live music. There is plenty of parking so don't worry about having to carpool. There is a lot across the street where you just kinda make your own spot.       My friend was having her birthday out here on a Saturday afternoon. It was a gorgeous spring day in Austin...so of course it was super crowded but not overly crowded. What we all noticed though is that there isn't enough provided seating. There are many picnic tables and sets of grouped chairs. Many people brought their own lawn chairs but I feel as though there should be more seating provided. The Adirondack chairs were comfy but many of us had to sit on the ground and take turns in the chairs. #mytwocents      There are actually two buildings: one for beer and one for wine. Everybody wins! The beer list is great (see photo) but a bit pricey IMHO. I ordered a beer and it came out to be almost 8 dollars. Yikes! I usually order wine most places so maybe that's the going rate these days? The beer was tasty and refreshing. A few people in my group got frozé or a frozen peachy shandy so there are plenty of options for everyone.       Dogs are allowed on leash but it was odd that they didn't have enough dog bowls to go around. Many places these days are providing paper dog water bowls (and filling station) which are then biodegradable. I wandered around and asked three different people about where I could get water for my dog. I was sent from one building to another and finally was told that there were water bowls around I just have to look for them. I was also told I could buy a water bowl. What?!? I am not buying a dog water bowl thank you very much. So this place is \"dog friendly\" but not very \"dog accommodating\". I finally got water from the free water tap in the beer building (nice touch) and just let my dog drink from the plastic cup. My dog is a person anyway so she was fine drinking from the cup. ;)      While we were there a man set up for some live music which was nice. It was loud but not too loud so we could still have a nice conversation and not have to shout over each other.       I didn't have any food but there is a pizza food truck there and it looked pretty good as people were walking by with their orders. The truck itself is pretty cool looking. It is all painted black and goes with the black and white theme of the buildings.       I had to leave before it got dark but all the trees were wrapped with lights so I'll bet it is lovely out there at night. I will definitely be back to enjoy this outside space. The view is stunning. I hope there is an improvement to the seating situation by then and I'll have to remember to bring my own water bowl for my dog."

                "description": "Check out in the Frontyard and the Front Porch!  This brewery is just a bit outside of Austin, out in Spicewood. It's a new construction where they're making a handful of different beers, along with a winery, that share the same space, making a family-friendly place to hang out!  There were lots of kids when I came here, in fact one kiddo was celebrating his birthday out here. No, he wasn't turning 21, he seemed to be in middle school. Nobody bats an eye with the parents letting their kids cut loose and play out on the artificial turf, the pickle ball courts, the frisbee golf goals, the toys that just seem to be put out there for kids, and other playground like amenities for the little ones. Beer is served inside by enthusiastic bartenders who seem to know their goods, and like drinking it and working there. They all seemed genuinely happy to be there pouring beers, which is great!  The beers were all pretty standard beers, nothing too imaginative or risky. They had things like a Mexican lager, an IPA, a Pale Ale, etc. No strange beers, or sours that I could recollect. Their more crazier beers were the dark ones, which I skipped since it was pretty hot and I couldn't handle a deep, dark 10%+ beer. They offer growlers, and sixers to go as well.  Be sure to check out their merch area- they have some fun looking things. Some embroidered brewery patches would be appreciated! They have plenty of things that'll keep your kids entertained if they left their toys at home. The beers were all pretty delicious. I got a flight to try a wide swath. The carbonation could've been stepped up a few notches, the beers were on the less than bubbly side, but the beers were flavorful and quite delicious.  The view is worth checking out- you sit back on one of those Adirondak porch chairs in the shade of their oak trees or their porch and take in a pint of honey ale, it's as close to heaven as you're gonna get."

This was the perfect place to enjoy the fresh air.   Front yard Brewing is on the same property as 5 Soul Wine Co. It's great if you have a group that wants wine and beer. The bartenders at the brewery were super nice and explained their selections to help us decide what to order. My fiancé got a beer and I ordered one of their cocktails. It was a lavender lemonade cocktail using their cider and I really enjoyed it. The only negative was that their prices were a little steep.    We visited right after the Austin freeze, so some of their inventory had not been delivered. We tried to get some food from one of their food trucks, but they were out of quite a few menu items and the winery was out of their charcuterie. We ended up trying the pizza food truck, which worked out well in the end, because it was delicious! My only other thought - I wished there was more outdoor seating. It was so busy that day, it was difficult to find a seat outside.   They have pickle ball courts you can rent by the hour, Frisbee golf, and fire pits to sit near. Overall, a relaxing place to spend a Sunday."

But then a little birdie told me that they make hard seltzer cocktails and I was signed up! Went here for lunch on a Saturday. Arrived around 11:45am which was perfect because there were still plenty of seats. If you come after about 1:00pm, you might consider bringing some lawn chairs unless you want to bring a blanket and go \"picnic style\". They have a large turfed area and then real grass further beyond. People do bring their dogs, which I don't mind because I love dogs, but it's a bummer when you watch one piss on the turf. Also, there's a disclaimer on their website that their insurance doesn't allow certain breeds which is complete b.s. and they should get a new insurance company. Any breed can be bad depending on their owners. Any breed can be good depending on their owners. I am a pitbull owner and he's a sweet as pie and the thought that I couldn't bring him is sad. Even Great Danes are listed. Anyway, back to the food and drinks...The two cocktails I had were the Lavender Lemonade and Frozen Lava Flow. Both were good but they were $10 and $11 respectively which is a bit spendy. Then I got a the Frontyard Burger and fries at the food truck. It was decent, but a little dry. I did enjoy the homemade pickles and the fries were extra good. There was a lady working the food truck that I witnessed on multiple occasions being rude to customers. If the owner wants to message me to find out who, I would be happy to let them know. I just don't like blasting people for the world to see. The employees that were serving drinks were amazing so that made up for it...along with the music selection. Overall it was a good experience and I'll likely be back."

                "description": "Frontyard is actually located inside the 5 Soul Winery property.  The overall property is super kids friendly. They have a large artificial turf area, multiple corn hole areas, a few pickle ball courts( requires $ and reservations), a few slides, and another big field.  So yeah, it's kids friendly. Maybe too kid friendly:-)  The brewery itself has some really good and wide spectrum of beer choices. I've tried their Belgium and Amber both were great. I recall seeing IPAs, Porters, Lagers and others on the list.   Prices seem a bit on the pricey side but I cannot recall the exact price.    Regardless, it's a fun place and super family friendly. Great beer, great on property food trucks, and pretty good wine next door at 5 Souls."

The adults loved the salted caramel stout, the rye IPA, and the pino.  Kids loved the root beer.  All of that to say the food and drinks are really good, but pale in comparison of the staff's friendliness and the hill country ambience.  This fine establishment will become a regular place for us."

                "description": "We can here for the first time last night. Perfect 80 degree evening in the hill country. Gorgeous sunset. The beers were super refreshing. Had a flight to start and then a full beer of one of my faves from that flight. Greats stuff. We skipped the pizza from the food truck but they looked amazing. Instead we opted for some very good brats and hot dogs.   The place is adjacent to 5 Souls Wine, which sources their grapes from Paso Robles. A perfect option for the non beer drinker. The overall outdoor setup is nice with artificial turf, Adirondack chairs, tables etc. oh and pickle ball courts too.   And depending on your view, it is very family friendly so there are lots of kids. Wasn't that big of a deal, but some people will not care for it."

Sadly though I give only 3 stars and it is for the daycare center atmosphere.  Kids running unsupervised in all directions, parts of games being thrown everywhere, yep thought I needed to duck a few times.  I don't mind kids at places but the kids here outnumbered the adults and they weren't in just one area so there was no escaping them."

                "description": "Gorgeous brewery and outdoor space!! The staff and beer were equally wonderful. The resident food truck has delicious food that is described as \"farm to trailer\".  We will definitely be back! Depending on the style of brewery environment you prefer read my \"fine print\" below.   The fine print- when we went early on a Sunday it was quiet and heavenly. Within about 30min of arriving the place was taken over by parents and kids who were not supervising their kids. Ex. Kids throwing ladder balls into a nearby tree, tossing a football across an area for seating, and swinging the porch chairs into the buildings windows. It was chaos."

However, when I ordered a drink from the brewery, the cashier had already chosen the 20% tip before she turned the screen around to me.  Very presumptuous and offensive.  In addition, the food truck on site was terribly overpriced.  $15.75 for a cheeseburger the size of a slider."

                "description": "After visiting Frontyard Brewing this weekend, it has certainly taken the title of my favorite brewery in the Austin area (sorry, Meanwhile Brewery). The views are gorgeous and there is plenty of space for social distancing and for the kids to play. There is artificial turf so it's perfect for setting up a picnic area and not have to worry about bugs or dirt. Their seating areas are set up in a way that it doesn't matter where you seat, you can keep an eye on your kiddos while sipping of your drink of choice. I tried the Hazy IPA and my husband had more than a few Ambers. I also got a bottle of 2018 Cabernet Sauvignon from 5 Soul Wine Co next door. It was pretty good, but I did not particularly enjoy drinking wine from a plastic cup. The food truck has great quality food. The pretzel bites were the perfect combination of chewy and buttery and the beer cheese was tasty. The burger was perfection, but I did not care for the chips. My kids had the hot dog and grilled cheese and they devoured them faster than they eat most of their meals, so I assume they approve of this review. My only complaint is that I wish I lived closer so I could hang out here more often. Check it out... you won't regret it."

Anne was very welcoming and friendly. She also gave us information on other wineries/breweries/distilleries to try. I had the $15 flight of reds and she also gave me an extra cup of red wine, Needy B*tch, I ended up buying a bottle! I finally found a great bottle of red that I actually enjoy, sad that I can't get it shipped to me in California. Drippin' Sweet is also great, bought a bottle as well. Love the descriptions given to the wines it made them sound all delicious. And they were! (According to all the ones I tried)."

So we are there enjoying wine glasses, wine flights, food, the atmosphere. Everything about this place is so cute and amazing. But trying to get an Uber home seemed unlikely. Everyone kept cancelling on us and the bartender Ann or Annie (plus the last two customers) kept telling us that we were not gonna walk the 2 miles home. Annie made sure that we stayed till she closed and literally DROVE US BACK TO THE AIR BNB!!!. She was the sweetest thing and didn't even want to take any money from us. We had a back and forth of take it, no keep it, take it!! Haha I'm 80% sure I got the money in her cupholder before I left but I was the tipsy one so who knows haha. I really hope I did because driving us back to our Airbnb was above and beyond."

She let us try what we wanted before committing to our drink of choice. I ended up going to wine cocktail called the Texas Kiri and it fresh rosemary in it which I though was a nice touch!

As such, it wasn't a great day.  We decided to go some place else.  We showed up around 4pm on a Sunday and had the entire place to ourselves. It is so cute.  I love the decorations and the vibe. We did the wine tasting which is $7 or waved if you buy a bottle of wine.  Megan was wonderful.  She was full of information and funny.  We had such a wonderful time we decided to join Bell Springs wine club.  Three bottles a quarter. No sign up fee. They have a wine pick up party that allows you to bring your dogs.  20% discount the first year and the discount increases every year you are a member.  Free wine tasting for you and four people either at Side Car or the winery itself. You also get to pick which three bottles you want. We signed up on the spot. What is NOT to like! We enjoyed many of their wines but really it was Megan.  She made us feel so welcomed and was so friendly.  Bell Spring treat her right, she is a HUGE asset to you.  We can't wait to attend our first wine pick up party.  Hope to make it to first Thursday soon and hang out at the Side Car.  If we lived in Dripping Springs this would be a weekly stop for us.  What a great place in this sleepy town.  We are so glad to part of their wine club and excited for the many cool events moving forward.  This should be a place to stop if you are in Dripping Springs."

                "description": "Over priced, over cooked and understaffed.  $90 for lunch for 4, a rude waitress and a condescending manager all amount to a ruined birthday celebration. The food was almost inedible to the point of stopping for fast food on the way home. This is a sad establishment- if you want to support a struggling business, this fits the bill.  I just remembered- the couple next to us didn't get their food at all. Another table went I side to get their long overdue order. This place is a joke. And to the 'roided out manager that \"thanked\" me for coming in- he could tell I was upset- your customer service is truly unrivaled."

                "description": "Sad to write this as I live right up the street and this \" Could\" be a wonderful establishment....However it currently is not. Staff doesn't seem to care what anyone thinks or bother to give anything remotely resembling service.  Without writing a book on all the bad I'll just say that whoever owns this place needs to start owning it, No management or leadership literally the staff doesn't GAF and it shows. As far as the food? used to be pretty descent especially the fried chicken. Now not so much...last few times I've been here everything was horrible, Even when the subpar food does finally make it to you it's cold, unseasoned, Looks like a TV dinner that someone slopped onto a plate. Again it's a great location and the bar has good whisky selection \" grossly overpriced\" but good stuff. I would suggest skipping this place until the owners decide to invest some time and money here. Way better options right up the road.  Sorry PandC hope you get your act together someday... word of advice hire a good GM and get this place turned around."

                "description": "Hello, I'm just a girl from Nebraska who loves visiting Texas for their BBQ. My sister and I decided to try this place for the first time. We were looking forward to getting some brisket and pulled pork. I mean, those are two of the best kinds of BBQ in my opinion.   When we arrived there wasn't anyone to greet us for about 5 minutes which normally isn't a big deal but the place wasn't busy. There was one table and two people at the bar. We could see the waitress talking to somebody as she cleaned a knife. Finally she looked over and noticed us. But instead of saying hi and letting us know we'd be helped soon, she went out of our view.   Eventually one of the two hostesses seated us. She immediately opened the menu to the beer section. That should have been my first clue that the food wasn't going to be the main focus of the restaurant.   When the waitress arrived we ordered our drinks and she went to get them. It took longer than expected to get our waters and the soda my sister ordered. I was still waiting on my beer when the table behind us said, this beer tastes like thirsty goat not the one I ordered. I turned and said, oh so that's where my beer went. Which by itself isn't a big deal but this was just one of the things that was adding up to disappointment.   When the waitress came back to take our order she then told us they were out of brisket and pulled pork. This is something that should have been told to us when we were first seated either by the hostess or waitress. We had already decided on our order and now had to figure out a new plan. She awkwardly stood there apologizing and saying don't shoot the messenger. We just needed her to leave so we could decide what we were going to do.   I decided to change my order to Turkey and ribs instead of brisket and pulled pork.  My sister decided to just get fried mushrooms. My nephew stuck with his kids burger that they thankfully didn't run out of. My food was ok, the ribs were tender and so was the Turkey but it wasn't what I wanted so it wasn't as satisfying. There \"BBQ\" sauce was a bit weird for me. It tasted a lot like cocktail sauce. I was disappointed there wasn't more than one sauce option. My sister only ate two of the fried mushrooms because they were disgusting and started to make her feel sick.   She brought our bill before we were done eating and then again began to apologize and explain that she doesn't do the ordering. Again said don't shoot the messenger. Ok, we got the message, you still want your tip. She said both that she just comes to work and finds out that they are out of stuff and that usually they are not out of stuff. She also asked how our food was. We told her the mushrooms were not good and she just made a yucky face. Then I told her about my Texas toast that was actually just bread. I mean maybe Texas toast is different in Nebraska but ours comes toasted with butter. She made a weird comment that my sister and I could use it to make our hand prints. Then she started asking a lot of personal questions. At that time we just wanted her to leave and get my ToGo box.   When she came back I started to put my fries in the box and she began to tell me to just dump them in. I explained that I didn't want to keep the ones that were touching the ketchup and mustard. She replied with who eats ketchup and mustard. In my experience in the food industry a lot of people do, that's why you can find ketchup and mustard as a staple sauce in most restaurants. But what waitress comments on how someone is eating their food.   Over all I would not recommend this place as somewhere to eat and enjoy your time out."

We live nearby so we've been here a few times and enjoy it each time.  Service was excellent...slow time of the day, but Jessica was very nice and friendly!:"

It's a nice place to kick back, even when busy the atmosphere was pretty relaxed.  For context, we came on a day they held an event with a pumpkin patch, face painting, petting zoo and magician so there were mainly families.   They have high chairs for the little ones, and pretty good food for the adults.   We tried the queso, a few beers, smoked turkey, turkey sandwich, Nashville tenders and the brownie. Decent meal but GET THE BROWNIE."

                "description": "We were at Proof and Cooper for dinner. Girl loves a good fried chicken so we had to check out a local restaurant serving it!    We chose to sit on the outdoor patio as it was a beautiful evening. They have outdoor lawn seating as well which is just gorgeous when the lights turn on and they have live music playing.   There was no wait when we got there. The host was very friendly and so was out server. Very prompt service and no waiting around. I had their quarter fried chicken which is a choice of leg + thigh or wing + breast with a homemade biscuit and honey. I also ordered a side of coleslaw. The chicken was fresh and tasty. They have a great ranch sauce that goes well with the chicken. The biscuit and honey tasted fresh and delicious as well. Coleslaw wasn't too great... I don't think I'll order that next time. We had also ordered fried pickles and deviled eggs as starters... both were well made. Our family enjoyed the starters. For dessert, we had the peach cobbler that was warm and served with a scoop of ice cream ... so yummmm! Great finishing touch!   We stayed a little longer after dinner to enjoy the live music and it was just a beautiful Texas summer evening.   The only reason I gave them a 4 star is that there's a bit of a fly problem that they need to figure out a way to get under control. I do want to mention that our server acknowledged the problem and apologized for it. Much appreciated."

                "description": "Only been here once so far, but am surprised at some of the low ratings. Came for relatively late dinner on a Sunday evening (note kitchen closes at 9pm on Sunday but I think 10pm on other nights...better double check though if you plan on coming late). We were more than happy with the beer selection. Lots of varieties, and many of which are local beers. We also had an attentive server.   Blue cheese burger was divine -- strong blue cheese, nice thick burger patty and was cooked to a perfect medium (just slightly pink on the inside). Fries were excellent - the thicker kind that is crisp on the outside but pillowy on the inside.  The Nashville Hot Fried Chicken sandwich was also very tasty. Not very hot though, which is just fine for me. I would rate the heat level as a mild (similar level to the spicy chicken at Chick-fil-A). Biiig thick chicken that cooked through without being dry. Where it was thicker, I could have used more sauce/seasoning because the flavors didn't quite penetrate all the way through.  Mac n cheese side was decent -- creamy white sauce but not too strong on any particular cheese.   The outdoor part is definitely more atmospheric than the indoor seating, so if the weather permits, sit outside (behind the building, not in front). That area is very pretty (see picture)! The parking lot extends around the side of the building; it's not only the few spaces you can see at the front of the building."

Went to our favorite spot when we are traveling around this area, but the food truck on location mysteriously closed at 6;50.  Hungry.  This place was suggested to us. We were seated and told who our waiter would be. Another server turned up, and then the hostess came back and also took our order (again) telling original guy that our server was some other dude.   She came back after a while to say that my on tap local choice was not actually available. Decided to just drink water.  Husband's drink arrived.  Listened to music.  A while passed, a long while.  Then we got our food.  Our cold food.  The order wasn't even correct.     Just go somewhere else.  Anywhere else."

We are sweet people, I'm a bartender I would have been happy to help her through the drink menu and get exactly what was ordered. She also had her dog running around the property and it tried to eat our food, a disgusting experience and I will never return.

                "description": "The Proof is in the Fried Chicken   It all started when I was exploring places near my home using Maps on my phone and saw Proof and Cooper. I clicked on it and there were photos of fried chicken. I love fried chicken so I bookmarked it. Days later my wife and I drove out on a nice day to this establishment.   At first I thought this was a country dive bar but I was surprised it was very family friendly, well at least during the day.  There was plenty of parking scattered in front. In front you will find porch seating with inside dining with a bar, but in back will deck and lawn seating all facing a small stage.  There is a grassy area for kids to run around including some games to play. We sat outside in the back.   There was a wide selection on the menu including barbecue, fried chicken, burgers, and sandwiches.  One item that got my attention was deviled eggs and only know one person who likes them. I ordered a Quarter Fried Chicken (leg and thigh) and being a little intimidated from talking with the staff did not make it Nashville Hot. I got the feeling it was going to be a firestorm in my mouth. I ordered a craft beer to enjoy.  My order showed up and the biscuit was huge covered with honey. The fried chicken was so good where I place it in the top three in the Austin area. It was perfectly cooked being soft and juicy with great taste with nice spices .  The crust was spectacular and was about to breakout in song!   I did not leave empty handed for we took home some barbecue Brisket, St Louis Style Pork Ribs, and Smoked Turkey to enjoy the next day(s).  The barbecue was also extremely good where the meat just fell off the bone. This was just a wonderful place with exceptional food and atmosphere, and next time wear my boots."

The only Thing descent was the brisket. This place has truly gone down hill. It's like they don't care anymore. Please do something to fix this as it is close to our house and we really loved it the first time."

                "description": "I enjoy the beer here and the food from the food truck.  Grilled cheeses, patty melts, burgers, fries - delicious!  You can do a 4 beer tasting flight and they have around 12 or more on tap.  You can buy beer to go in cans or they have growlers available and some cute merchandise.   Be aware the v neck tee shirts they have right now are cut pretty tight/narrow.    They have a nice back patio where you can eat and drink and bring your canine friends and sometimes have local craft vendors back there as well.   I really like their Coffee Kolsch beer!   You definitely need to walk next door  and check out Revolution Distillery - simply fantastic gin and cocktails with a free tasting of a few of their spirits.  Can't buy bottles of hard alcohol on Sundays but they were still open today (Sunday) and they are happy to serve you delicious cocktails!"

                "description": "A good brewery that's just a bit overshadowed by its neighbors.  When you're standing near giants, you live perpetually in their shadow. Such is the case with Last Stand. It's a good brewery. It's got old school Hill Country funkiness, as evidenced by their chicken shit bingo games (every 3rd Sunday!)  For better or worse, it's also just down the road from the behemoth that is Jester King. Hell, there's a great distillery 10 feet away! Last Stand's brews are good; this visit I had the Citra Smash, Simcoe Pale Ale and the Fuzzelicious. But I'd be lying if I said I wasn't thinking about Jester King with every sip."

Large beer garden with Chicken $**t bingo every 3rd Sunday of the month. That beer tho!  They focus more on the hoppy-side (love their CitraSmash); however, they also make great porters, stouts, and other seasonal brews including barley wine. A flight of 4 - 2oz pours will set you back 10$ if it's your first visit. Then, go for a full flight!  Light snacks available (pretzels, etc.) and food truck on-site at times.   Package available for sell and they also custom fill 16oz crowlers. Cans also available at ATX merchants (e.g., HEB).   Support local!   Family and Fido friendly. Cheers to the love of great beers!"

My 3/5 stars is due to the build your own pizza coming with cheese (which we don't and can't intake) so we spent $20 and weren't able to eat it. I'm hoping someone else ate it because it hurts my heart to think a cow gave her milk for nothing. We were told that we had to purchase another pizza. We decided it would be best to go elsewhere for food. My only advice is to inform the customer that the pizza comes with cheese automatically. We wouldn't have known otherwise. We will be back for the Fuzzylicious IPA!"

                "description": "This was our second brewery on our beer tour, while in Austin. Small place, and not many beers on tap, but you can still find some good ones.  Their beers are listed on the wall on tap, and they also have them in the fridge if you want to take some bottles home.  They do flights, and of course that's what I did to be able to try more. The Coffee Porter was like drinking actual coffee.  Delicious!  I left this one for the end, after one sip since it ended up being my favorite. Imperial Oatmeal stout was just OK, in my opinion.  They also had it in Whisky Barrel Aged - same alcohol content but the barrel aged process always makes it taste stronger.  I wasn't loving these so didn't finish them.   Holiday Ale - was good, tasted just like it's name implies. The one that surprised me was the Smash Citra. I usually stay away from IPAs (too hoppy for me) but this was amazing!  I could have had a second one.  Service is hit or miss.  They were a bit slow preparing our flights.  One of the ladies was really nice and friendly, the other two people behind the counter, not so much.  You can enjoy your beers inside but the outside is really cute. Looks almost like a schoolyard with long wood tables, space to walk, and a cute colorful seating area near the exit.  Across from them there's Revolution (locally mad gin) and another brewery. So, this is a good place to \"park\" and enjoy a drinking day out with friends, without having to drive around for more.  3.5 stars"

                "description": "Came here after a stop at JK and this place was a pleasant little surprise!  Far less crowded than JK and the outdoor patio area was fantastic on a gorgeous spring day to just vegge out, hang w/friends, enjoy some brews, and play a mean game of cornhole!  Their beers were very hit or miss for me. I did the sampler and nothing really stood out, but none were undrinkable, just not really my style. If you like hoppy beers, then you will probably enjoy their selections more than I did. Their stout was ok, but in all fairness, probably not the best choice on a warm day as it was heavy.  I will say, what stole the show for me here was our little discovery of their Revolution Spirits barn. They were doing a free tasting of their gin and Cafecito coffee liqueur, both of which were absolutely awesome!  I really like the gin as the lavender in the batch we tasted was very prevalent. I am usually not a gin drinker, but the mix of this w/the hibiscus tea that they served was perfection! The Cafecito, however, was so mindblowingly good, I immediately dropped the $25 to purchase a bottle on-site! It is made w/Cuvee and packs a delightful, caffeinated, yet alcohol-y punch. I have paired it drizzled over some coconut, chocolate chip, almond vanilla ice cream, and it is what dreams are made of!  I probably would come back here in a few months to see if they have any different beers on their rotation and to restock on the spirits."

I will say that I need a session beer from them... something a little less on the alcohol would be good, but that's just my preference.  The location is just a few minutes down the street from Jester King (so if you're already out at JK, come give Last Stand a try!). They are located in a really cool business park. There's also a distillery a few doors down!  There is a couple of places to sit inside and a full outdoor area with seating (if you're allergic to hay, it might be an issue)."

As we circled back to Austin, the Mister decided he would confuse his brain after the lovely wine tastings with a beer. This was dessert, he explained.

                "description": "Argus Cidery's website mentioned they were open on Sunday. But when we arrived, they were definitely closed.  So since we were there we thought we would check out Last Stand.  Last Stand is located at the back of the warehouse properties in the cute little green buildings, next to revolution spirits.  There is plenty of parking.  They have a small inside tasting room with space to sit down, and an outdoor area that is dog friendly.  There are some trees shading the outdoor area, but they have also put up some netting.  The area is barked and they have some nice tunes playing.  They have a corn hole with bean bags, or across the street a Frisbee Disc Golf course set up that doesn't look like it has been used in awhile.  The only negative on the outside space is that it had a large fly population.    The competition for micro breweries in Austin has become fierce.  There are many options to select from.  There is a bit of something for everyone.  My beer tasting adventures with my expert husband have developed a palette that appreciates this alcoholic beverage.  Last Stand out of the many I have tried is just OK - Average.  The beers just fall flat and thin for me.  They are missing that full flavor quality profile. You can select from a flight of Year Round Beers ($7), or a flight of their rotating taps ($10).  Their rotating beers always feature the following: their ongoing Farmhouse, SMaSH (single malt and single hop), and a Single Barrel Series.  They also have some growlers you can select to fill up to go.  The two that I found decent from their menu were the Pale Ale and Coffee Porter.  The coffee porter is made with local Summer Moon cold brew, which you can taste in the unique roasted and nutty tones.  While not rich and creamy like most coffee porters, this still has some good flavors.  The staff were friendly and helpful."

We've been wanting to stop in here for some time and I'm so glad we finally did! The beer is tasty, I only had a few sips since I'm driving but next time I'm pounding some brews! However the pizza!! Omg!! Now that was delicious! I ate half the pie to myself and sadly I feel I could have ate the whole thing haha the crust is chewy crispy, the sauce tastes freshly made, the cheese actually has that cheese flavor and not some pre shredded cheese bs! Oh and the pepperoni!! It was so flavorful!!  Now for the atmosphere! As soon as we walked in we were greeted with smiling faces!! Everyone was so friendly!! I swear this is the first place in Texas that I felt truly welcomed!!"

                "description": "There is a lot that is planned for this place. Well, that's what I was told. Certainly has a cool canvas to work with.  The beer is good. There are lots of shiny distractions on the menu, for sure, but there are some solid entries as well.   The food is nothing amazing. It's just ok. And wow what a wasteful process to give everyone a pizza box. I guess you are not offering the pan it was cooked on or some other dish you don't need to wash or dispose of, and I'm sure they are recyclable, but you just have one trash, so what's the point. Maybe you are saving water instead of trees.   The events are cool, fun stuff. And like I said, a great space for it.   The bartender/manager guy is very snooty, but I guess if he is that proud of the place, that's good for him. You just get the feeling he'd care less if you were there or not. I can pretty easily choose not to go just to not need to deal with that.   But, I'll be back."

His response 'Will make improvements is BS\"  Look at the current review reviews they're keep coming..., the bartenders are still rude, and \"The beer is Blah\" how is this to operate a business????  You treat a customer with respect and gratitude, guess what they will be coming back.. think of all the repeat customers you losing out on, because of your rude staff...  Do appreciate small business, but if you dont even care about yours and really improving the overall customer experience, why should you...  Setting yourself up for disaster.   I would find replacement bartender with a positive attitude with a smile in their voice..  Whos there happy with their job, not watching the clock for 8hrs to go by..."

Then you just walk up and place your order. I ordered the Pilsner, and I can't remember what my boyfriend got and we also ordered some garlic knots. They have indoor and outdoor seating, you just have to walk around the building. We chose to sit indoors and watch the football game, wasn't too long before our food was ready and it was bread-tastic!!!! There is so much flavor, I would definitely order again it... I cannot wait to try more of their food and come back for more chill vibes! Thanks for the awesome experience Suds Monkey!!"

Friendly staff and there's a pizza place located within the brewery so you can get a bite to eat while you drink or after!  They have a classic arcade machine that has a ton of old school games along with a number of board games as well. Seating arrangements are pretty open and for a Sunday afternoon, parking was not crazy.  Expect to see tons of awesome dogs with their owners and just an overall chill vibe. Can't wait to return to try the other beer options!"

From the moment you walk in, it's clear this spot is beloved by the locals. The crowd was a solid mix of tourists, cowboys, retirees, and working stiffs.  The tap selection is small, but they go out of their way represent Texas brews, even hosting a tap from Acopon, which is literally about 20 ft away. It's dog friendly, with a patio and a small performing space for musicians. This place just oozes history, it's definitely worth a look if you find yourself in Dripping."

Super cool owner too who I obviously know because of my tenure in this town.   The Barber Shop is so cool in fact that my wife and I chose to renew our vows there for our 10 year anniversary. Complete with a hail storm, cake balls from nearby Well Yeah Cakes, and a Elvis impersonator in his second ever appearance.   Beer is always cold; wine list is tragically minimal to the regret of my wife (think tiny bottles like near the airport). Yet, it's charms outweigh it's negative aspects. Heard these days there is a sammich outlet on site for food instead of ordering from nearby Pizza Cave or the shi*ty fried chicken at the gas station.   Biggest note here: It's little Rooster's favorite bar :)"

I have been coming to the Barber Shop for years as a good friend of mine lives in the Springs and we always seem to default here. Take note this is a beer and wine bar only. Yes, they have soft drinks and water as well. This is a dive bar extraordinaire so there is no need to get all decked out to hang out. There are plenty of draft and bottle beers with all the usual craft suspects and always a few surprises as well. The venue is dog and kid friendly so don't step on Fido and keep your cussin to a minimum.  Friendly patrons, good service, and a great beer selection that's the trifecta.

In the early, early, early, early days it was a gas station and my dad told me they'd stop here for gas when traveling cross country in the 50's. I love this place because it's got a great history, the building rocks (pun intended), and the beer selection should satisfy most any beer drinker; lots of variation. They also serve wine and some non-alcoholic drinks. Children are tolerated until 9 pm. There's an area out front to gather and stand, an inside area to order and sit down, and a backyard area -- some covered, some not -- with picnic tables and chairs. There's music on some nights, a great after-work vibe, and friendly atmosphere throughout. Easy Texan drinkin' and relaxin' all the way. Stop by if you're in the area."

I went in last night (Tuesday/Halloween)for the first time in a long time. The World Series was on and I decided to grab a beer and hopefully see the Astros win with other Texans but... they lost. The crowd was small and friendly but I did feel like a party crasher because they all knew each other and were passing the guitar around. I hope this place hasn't turned into a towny bar because it never was in the past.   I'm going to have to go again to make sure or at least that's my excuse to go get good and affordable craft beer."

The cocktails at this place are great! The most popular is their frozen margarita, you have to try it. If you really just want to get a feel for what Sotol tastes like though, try ordering the flight first.   For food, there is a food truck on the premises. I think they switch it up but when I went it was a Mexican food truck with very good Birria tacos."

They've got their sotol, of course, but also a whole bunch of (sotol and other) cocktails, food, and a pretty cool outdoor space with plenty of place to chill. Best of all, there's pretty much always some sort of musician doing their thing (this *is* Austin after all!)  If only it wasn't a decent drive away...."

                "description": "My friend who knows all the hot spots invited me here during the stricter COVID times. It's a heck of a drive but I was really impressed with how lovely this place is. Very Instagramable location with the truck outside and the silo.   PARKING I went when it was pretty busy. I found parking but I did have to wait for like 5 minutes so cars could clear the road. It gets pretty tight once the parking spots are all full. It's all free. A lot of cars parked on the road. Just be careful crossing the road.   FOOD When I was here they only had one food truck. The options were limited. The prices were a bit too high for the food options available. I didn't try it out. My friends ordered a few things and they felt the food was just ok. I'm not sure on the current food status here.   AMBIANCE  They only had outdoor seating when I was here because of COVID. I sat on the covered outdoor seating which was great since it was around summertime. It was HOT! Really cute tables, friendly/helpful staff, and live music! I don't remember his name but there was a gentleman playing guitar and singing. He was fantastic!   DRINKS I ordered 3 drinks. The first two were the Comanchero and the third was The Copperhead. I'm glad I stopped there. They are strong!   I'm giving it four stars because I felt like the size of the drinks didn't coincide with their prices. I hope I get to stop by here again. It's a bit of a drive for me. It's a really beautiful drive though. Keep kicking butt y'all! I want to try everything!!"

                "description": "First time trying Sotol, and there wasn't a cocktail on the menu that wasn't incredibly delicious. We sat outside in the lovely fall weather, enjoyed some acoustic tunes by a talented duo with a female vocalist, and tried several cocktails -- all of which we enjoyed. My friend tried the frozen Bartender's Choice which was like a frozen apple cinnamon cocktail, and I tried the Comanchero, the Yipping Coyote, and the Rugged Flower. Each were so smooth and well-balanced. This place not only makes a flavorful Sotol with a smooth, clean finish but transforms it into mouth-watering mixology masterpieces!   Aside from the bus loads of out-of-town tourists who looked like they were part of an Instagram filter for an \"Ashley/Ashleigh\" compilation (complete with brimmed hat, scarf, and boots), this place is a must-visit if you're in Austin. Couple it with a trip to nearby Fredericksburg and you've got yourself an amazing day!"

                "description": "Finally decided to take a day trip down to dripping springs and had to finally stop at Desert Door. To start, this place is designed so beautifully. I wish I could steal the décor and put it into my own home. Both the inside and out were so inviting, I don't know how someone could go and not spend hours enjoying the ambiance, food, and drinks. What I thought was so cool about Desert Door was that they educated you on what you were drinking and the history of Sotol. What I did not know, is that they are actually the only Sotol distillery in the US.  We started off with the Sotol flight, and two drinks. Although we did enjoy tasting the Sotol by itself, it was a lot to start the afternoon off with! We also ordered the The Copperhead (my personal favorite of the day), the River Rita, and the Sotol'd Fashioned. I loved each drink but the copperhead was definitely the star of the day, which was a Sotol version of an espresso martini. They also have a food truck on site serving out very unique food. We ordered the tacos and vegan \"queso\" and both really surprised us by how unique and amazing it was. We loved this trip out to Desert Door, and will definitely be back."

                "description": "I'm generally not a huge fan of tasting rooms and find them gimmicky and far from truly experiencing the spirit of the spirit. See what I did there.   But every rule has its exception, or exceptional. Desert Door is a destination in itself. Beautiful southwestern interiors and stylish furniture. The space is cozy but didn't feel crowded, though every table was full. They do have a large patio for outdoor seating and bigger groups.   Now, the sotol. I had never heard of it and didn't know what to expect. The best way I can describe it is an agave spirit, clear, between a vodka and a tequila in its thickness/smoothness. In plain English, it's delicious.   We did the tasting flight, which was a great way to get introduced to a new spirit, followed by a round of cocktails. The cocktails were excellent and reasonably priced.   They also had a lovely food truck on site but we didn't have enough time to try it."

Great patio vibes: chill, mist fans going , and live music about to start. Inside is nice too, super clean and cute/trendy.   The sotol is great and their cocktails are delicious, as well as unique. Had a difficult time deciding which one to get but our attentive and extremely friendly waitress, Nicole strayed me the right way with the Comanchero.

And they sure know how to do a cocktail, too! I got the River Rita and it legit blew my mind.   Sit and stay awhile, listen to the live music on the patio and if you need to cool down, the interior is a WHOLE mood.   Be sure to visit their gift shop to buy an adorable handmade clay shotglass (SO CUTE) and a bottle of their famous Sotol.

I had the blackberry smash with vodka and it was so good. They have the option of vodka or gin in your cocktail depending on your preference.   Definitely a great way to spend a day!"

                "description": "We spent the weekend visiting distilleries and this was very disappointing.   It's not busy at all but they still gave us gin instead of vodka.  It would be okay to play some music as it's awkwardly quiet due to the lack of patrons.  Finally, the people at the counter seemed annoyed with people overall.  Another couple in  the parking lot stopped us and asked if we had the same bad experience so it was not just us."

                "description": "Definitely a hidden place with a great view! Glad we stopped at this place after seeing a sign off the side of the road and following a winding path down to see this gem.  Very homey vibes with a great patio for outdoor seeing that just has a fantastic view of the hill country. Decently priced drinks consisting of either gin or vodka.  Seating is pretty limited inside, but the outdoor space is just amazing and honestly makes the experience really that much better. I'd highly recommend 'The Bullfrog' with vodka. Tasty drink, but not overpowering and has a nice kick (smooth vodka that doesn't burn like gasoline).  P.S. They have some cool looking merch! Make sure to take a look at their terrariums...they are wicked!"

                "description": "Frog Pond Distillery was a pleasant surprise.  I have been wanting to come here for a while now, but always drive-by, and don't get a chance to turn around.  However, this time I made a trip purposefully to stop in.  I am glad I did.  Frog Pond is a family-owned business and passion project. The entire family was behind the bar the day my friend and I stopped in except for mom and I think a daughter.  The family owns the land and has slowly overtime built the tasting room and production area themselves.  They currently make a vodka and gin.  They offered us a free sip of each to determine which we would prefer in one of their handcrafted cocktails.  Both had a nice flavor profile that blends well in cocktails.  Their cocktails were creative and they mentioned the family came up with the recipes together.  The cocktails were delicious and very reasonably priced.  Their space has a fun modern 50's theme.  They have an outdoor patio you can sit back and relax on a nice day."

It's very obvious that a lot of careful thought has gone into this place. The actual distillery is incredible. The whole place is just beautiful. Even on a scorching Texas Summer day, there's a strong breeze out on the porch.  It's a very \"Austin-esque\" type place, down-home and friendly. Although I don't drink, my wife enjoyed a cocktail very much and we bought a bottle to take home. They had some nice lemonade and infused water for me too.  Great design of the logo, bottles and everything. Really worth stopping in if you're in the area or just feel like a nice drive from Austin."

Unfortunately, tours were closed due to COVID, but we hope we can come back for tours some time soon!"

We started off at another well known distillery down the road and googled what else was close by and found this awesome little spot with a great view. They make small batches of vodka and gin at the distillery and make a few different drinks to try. Their porch was a great place to hang out while playing giant jenga and relaxing. I noticed cornhole as we walked in as well. We watched deer randomly wandering in the distance. The drink I had was great, a cranberry vodka fizz, so I had another. The indoor space is fairly small and the patio could fit maybe 30 people comfortably. It was not crowded at all when we were there on a Sunday afternoon. We'll go again next time we're in Austin!"

I am very happy to say that the product that they are offering, not only the liquor, is amazing. They couldn't have picked a better location to place their distillery. The hills of Texas, day or night, make relaxing on the patio with the variety of gin and vodka cocktails that much more relaxing. The bright pops of color when you venture inside of the distillery are such a delight and really made my girlfriend and I feel happy to be in such a welcoming place.   The gin was delicious and I plan to buy more bottles very soon. Don't think that my lack of praise for the vodka means that it isn't good (I am just not a fan of vodka..rough nights in college) but I definitely suggesting venturing out to this family run, local organization. You will not be disappointed."

There is a winery and a brewery on site so everyone likely has an option they'll like = Best of both worlds.

                "description": "Completely unacceptable management. For about 2 hours a group of individuals where shouting at two tables, yelling sexually explicit language, swearing profusely, and were clearly unable to drive. At a place that prides itself in a family atmosphere, where kids are running around playing in the grass and trees, this is completely unacceptable. I am looking forward to management/ownership response to this review. In a region where wineries, breweries and distilleries are a dime a dozen, plenty of opportunities to take my business elsewhere when we come visit.  What should really concern the owners and management about what happened at Bell Springs is the fact that:  1) The Hays County sheriff was called after the incident because it was so egregious. Enough of these reviews and they will be lining up outside the parking lot for DWIs.  2) The staff (7:00 pm on 6/19) did absolutely nothing to cut off a clearly over-intoxicated group that was negatively impacting people around them  3) The staff's response (blonde and burnette hostesses), ver batim, to the vulgar language and rowdiness was \"free speech\" and \"you are the problem - I know those people\".  Fantastic - best of luck in your future endeavors . Your stellar response caused one of our group to cancel their wine membership."

It's very easy and they do allow you to amend reservations over the phone.   They produce really great wine and there's a great selection to choose from. The staff is very knowledgeable about their wines and answered all of our questions. Testing comes with a **small** array of cheeses, nuts and crackers."

                "description": "Cute spot and their brewery next door is awesome too! Bell Springs is in a nice location and it is so green! The wine is yummy, tastings are nice sized pours! Only reason I am giving 4 stars is because when you make a reso for wine tasting and charcuterie, don't expect a lot of cheese and meats HA! It was so small, we were cracking up. I would recommend bringing your own snacks and food! Otherwise, awesome spot and I can't wait to go back!"

There is ample outdoor seating under big shade trees! It's a pretty place.  There is also a brewery on site, but I cannot speak to the quality of the beer. We stuck with wine on this trip. I would definitely come back and try other wines and the beers offered!"

                "description": "This is a beautiful winery. Plenty of tables spread around the grounds under trees. Lots of room for kids to run around out there. We sat up on the patio with our dog and enjoyed a lovely wine tasting. We chose the solo tour which was $15 for 5 generous pours of delicious wine. All the staff we interacted with were very friendly and helpful. The one low point is the food truck. We got the currywurst for $10 which was good, but not a large enough serving for the price. The more upsetting part was the pretzel we got (also $10, which is very expensive). The prestel was small, hard (even though it was supposed to be a soft pretzel), and flavorless. The mustard cheese dip did its best to save it, but it wasn't enough."

                "description": "I have been here numerous times and always had an awesome experience but today was the most unacceptable experience I have ever had ANYWHERE. I was here with my family, parents, and my brothers family with a total of 5 kids (not unusual to see kids here). While here, we became aware of a group that was likely overserved and using foul/vulgar language that we tried to ignore for a long time. Once we heard the phrase \"fat c*ck\" at a ridiculous volume my husband asked them to please keep it down, which resulted in a huge altercation with various threats/insults from their end. Despite their behavior management still allowed them to stay. What's worth noting is multiple people had already complained about this group and others joined my husband in attempting them to quiet down- so they were affecting loads of people at the winery. Eventually things calmed down and the argument broke, but as we were leaving they said loudly for us to hear \"I'm so glad that douchebag is leaving\" so I gave them the finger as I was walking away (I will concede this was adding fuel to the fire but I was so fed up at this point) and they screamed to me \"FUCK YOU MOM\" across the grass. Managements response? Free speech allows them to say whatever they want. Apparently this nice hill country spot is going for the dirty 6th vibe. Save your money and go somewhere with enough pride to expel those who can't keep it together while I use my own right to free speech to notify everyone this place doesn't care about their patrons."

                "description": "I am a resident of Dripping Springs and have been a frequent patron of Bell Springs Winery. I found this family-friendly venue to be welcoming and beautiful. It was for this reason that I suggested that my kids, with their families, join my husband and me for a Father's Day celebration on Saturday evening, June 19th. When we arrived just before 5 pm, we found a good picnic spot in the shade near the bag game. We all noticed, or rather heard, a very boisterous group of 12 to 15 people sitting near the brewery. As the evening progressed, and I am assuming more alcohol was consumed, the group became louder and more profane. We attempted to ignore them, but soon it was impossible due to the volume and the increasingly prevalent and disgusting language. At that point, and because we had 5 young children with us, my son-in-law went over to the group and respectfully asked them to turn down the volume so that my Grandchildren would no longer be exposed to words like \"F*ck and C*ck\". He was immediately met with a barrage of personal slurs and threats. 2 staff members (2 young ladies, one light-haired and the other dark-haired) working that evening came over to the group, however, incredibly, the inebriated party was allowed to remain on the premises. Shortly after, every family packed up and went home, including our group.  When walking to the parking lot to leave, a particularly vile young woman yelled obscenities at my son-in-law and daughter. I turned around and went over to the group. When I arrived, I was also barraged with a variety of slurs and called a \"C*nt\". Once again, the 2 female staff members came over to the table to intercede. At this point, the dark-haired staff member shared with me that she \"knew the group\" of offenders, which helped me understand why these folks had not been asked to leave. If you happen to know staff, you can act like filthy pigs, with the knowledge that your actions will have no repercussion, regardless of the profoundly negative impact on everyone else looking to enjoy wine and food with their families.  To add insult to injury, staff had the unmitigated gall to suggest that I was the problem, not the drunk and vulgar group. When I questioned staff (dark haired young lady) why they permitted such obnoxious behavior from any patron, she suggested that hurling profanity toward others was protected under free speech. Staff continually suggested that our \"conversation was over\", indicating that they wanted me to leave. Clearly, the privilege of free speech isn't applied equally to all patrons visiting Bell Springs.  In the past 15 months, I have recommended Bell Springs to dozens of family and friends. Now, I plan to exercise my right of free speech in every forum available to tell acquaintances and strangers alike about my experience, advising that Bell Springs is not worthy of anyone's patronage."

Like everything in and around Austin, there's a sense of \"for now...\"   And that's why Vista Brewery is a smart play. It may be a drive out of the way now but soon it'll be right in the middle of everything.   Hopefully not too soon...  On a cold, sunny day, the grounds are a welcomed sight for adults and kids alike. The two buildings are new and impressive but not imposing on the landscape.  Now, the beer. The stouts were quite impressive. They were smooth and strong with a distinct personality. I tasted three of their stouts, loved all three for different reasons. My wife had a couple ales and was equally impressed.  The food was acceptable but not something to write home about. I feel like they could take it to the next level if they brought on 1-2 food trucks but I get that may not be in the cards for now.  All said, it offers something for everyone and you're bound to leave happier than you came in."

Wonderful areas for kids to play and adults to chill. Lots of great beer options for everyone no matter what your taste is. I tried the Everything is Aussome - an Aussie sparkling ale. It tasted a lot like an IPA to me. I may have expected it to be a bit lighter in taste but still a great bold flavor. Great for groups, family picnics, or just a fun day out to relax. Definitely worth the stop in the area."

Food offerings were always a bit comically small before the pandemic, but delicious, now they're just overpriced and not very good.

Stopped here on Friday night and caught the tail end of their acoustic live music set which they happen to do every Friday night. They stage by far is the best set up I've seen In the area under a natural oak tree with twinkling lights scattered above. Could easily see this place being a great wedding venue. They also had a nice little hiking trail where there's additional seating and a kids playground located further down. Now let's talk about the beer and the brewery. The brewery is huge and has a nice modern approach with a little Texas flare. As far as beers I ended up trying a flight and by far definitely grab a Barton creek gold on a hot summer day. If your looking more of a full bodied beer destination ipa would be my choice. Can't wait to come back here once the weather starts to cool down."

It has a great location right by Deep Eddys and Salt Lick BBQ, which allows you to make a nice day trip out of it.  Starting with the service, my party and I were seated immediately and were served. For drinks, we ordered  1. Adair 2. Zwickled  All the beers were excellent, especially the Adair.  For food, we ordered  1. Pretzel  2. Brisket Sandwich   The food was also great and a lot better tasting than other breweries, for sure. I did think it was interesting to have brisket pastrami cold, but it was still solid.   Overall, I will definitely come back to the spot because they have great food and even better beer."

They did a great job of enforcing masks when people aren't seated at their table and made it easy for us to keep distance while in line.   Their beer selection is very diverse, so I opted for a flight in my first round. I was pleasantly surprised they allowed you to include their more expensive barrel series in the flight which made the 4 4oz pours for $12 a great deal. While those were tasty my favorite was the dark Pilsner, for such a dark beer it had a more mellow, malty flavor than you would expect.   Food wise it was fairly typical brewery fare, but the $1 hunks of watermelon really hit the spot on a hot August evening.   If you're looking for a brewery a little outside of Austin to escape the city for an evening I'd definitely recommend checking them out!"

First disappointment:  Their reservation check in system.  A chalkboard sign indicated a table for to-go order pick ups and simply an arrow for reservations.  No employee to greet, direct or be helpful.  2 employees filling to go orders as we stood in what we estimated to be the 'reservation' line.  Several people were behind us when 2 young women cut in front of us and said loudly \"Will you take walk ins\" and to our astonishment they got an employee's attention who completely ignored us and helped them get a table.   Very rude!  Once we were checked in we found a table in the shade and went to get our  beers and food.   Disappointment #2:   No food.  Only popcorn and a cheese plate.  That was it.  We told them we had been assured over messenger that their kitchen was open and they shrugged and said  \"Don't know what to tell you.  It's being renovated.\"     I can't understand how they are allowed to stay open with beer and POPCORN sales as food, under the Governor's new restriction.   At this point we already had our beer so we went back to the table to make the best of it.  Disappointment #3:   the amount of flies and mosquitoes. We go out to another \"farm style brewery\" frequently and have never had an issue with flies or mosquitoes like we did here.   Maybe it's one brewery using a spray service vs. not?  Maybe it's dog poop from being a dog friendly brewery (although, so is the other farm Brewery we go to...)  We had 4 mosquito bites while sitting there and this was at 5:00.  Flies were insane.  It was a disappointment all the way around as we had really been looking forward to several hours of relaxation, beer and food out under the trees.  Added on 7/11:  I have not changed a word of my original review, however I am adding a Star based upon the great communication I have had with one of the owners, Kent, who wrote to me after my original review.  He seemed genuinely interested in my feedback and responded in a very thorough manner."

                "description": "My husband and I love vista brewing! The owners are so friendly, it's family friendly and they follow covid guidelines so we felt very safe. We love sitting indoors and outdoors depending on the weather and like that we have that option. They have live music on weekends and the beer/wine selection is good. Pre-covid their food was farm to table and delicious. We're anxiously awaiting the return on their standard food items. Definitely a great place to check out!"

                "description": "Come for the beer, don't stay for the food.   We came here for the first time and ordered a bunch of food and beer. The beers are good. The food is not. I didn't realize the current menu is because of covid. The sandwiches were all cold. The pimento cheese dip was good but hard because it's also cold. Literally everything came out of the fridge as they handed it to us.   It was a terrible first impression. I understand it's covid, but I think they could've at least heated the sandwiches or tried to make some better food that can be packaged.   Great venue. Not sure I'll come back."

                "description": "Had a school event there and it was great.  Plenty of seating in and out.  lots of room for the kids to run about and having a great staff about was wonderful.   only ding was the coordination / distribution of food.  Basically they ran out for our guests, and well, there is nothing you can do about it.   Events are hard to plan for, especially with family and kids, so we will work with them next time to better handle the food service / serving.   The beer was good, the wine selection was pretty good.   What i liked the most was the atmosphere. on a cool evening, with the stars out, it was a great place to be to unwind and chill with friends / family.    Plenty of parking..   Finding the place...well, thats tricky.  See punch in the address in Google Maps, you will be ok, just know that when you get close, slow down, and know the entrance is on top of a hill ... so you can miss it if you are not paying attention.   will I go back: of course, and I would recommend you go and visit."

                "description": "First time ever at Vista! Also first draft beer (not Crowley/growler) since beginning of lockdown. Such a great spot.   COVID: Vista has a GREAT outdoor area with plenty of tables distanced from one another. The ordering process specifies 6 ft of distance in line. Hand sanitizer is everywhere. Beers are delivered in single use cups. They have also started their live music Fridays again where you can venmo the artist tips. Masks are required everywhere but at your table.  You can make a reservation on Open Table for their outdoor area. Currently, they are open until 8PM.  We brought our own chairs and a blanket to use as a tablecloth. We also brought our own glasses to pour the beers into. I love beer out of a glass so this was a need for me.   Overall: This brewery has a ton of good stuff going for it. It's a little out of the way for Austinites (40 minutes), so you've got to make a night out of it. We're generally bigger IPA fans, so there are a few breweries we would check out ahead of this one. BUT they still have a ton of great beers on tap, and it is so worth checking out."

And some sort of food options. I'm not impressed with the bar service either. They have a barrier up for a line, but they don't actually use it.    Highly recommend orange, lemon, sweet tea and peach vodka.   It's not a bad stop for a drink. But only get one. There's a cop in the parking lot waiting to nab a drunk driver."

My favorite is probably the peach vodka and they have many cocktails to choose from. We went on a Sunday where there were local vendors there too as well as live music. Head to Dripping Springs for the great tasting room. Unfortunately, the distillery near Buda is not one that is open to the public, so the tasting room is where to go."

                "description": "Like I was saying earlier, I find tasting rooms gimmicky and this one is a perfect example of it.   We chose to come here because I have deep respect for Deep Eddy as a company for their commitment and contributions to the local community. They've gone above and beyond again and again. Respect!  The tasting room is a large hall, with flights consisting of tiny cups of flavored vodka. You don't taste the actual spirit because the fruity flavors are so sweet.   The \"Colombian\" food options on-site is a joke. It's an old school concession stand (movie theater of the 80s style) with heat lamps keeping nacho chips warm on a folding table. Don't expect tacos or empanadas.  The space, both indoors and outdoor, is quite large. And they have a cute performance stage inside.  We stayed a total of 15 minutes."

Bartenders are very friendly and fast but the drinks are simply made and during Covid they are all touching the mint in their hands by smacking it. Id rather a gentle crush/roll in a glass... felt a bit gross (others commented too).

                "description": "Finally I was able to make it out to the distillery with my good friend early on a Saturday so that we could get some direct tasting vodka notes from Deep Eddy themselves rather than me taking shots at bars around Austin.  Parking was easy for us but do note that we showed up around 11:20AM on a Saturday so we didn't have any issues.  The later you arrive parking could be a thing and you may have to wait/stalk someone who is leaving to get a spot. Also as the day got later there were many buses and charter vans parked in the front and roundabout chilling out as the company they are driving around are inside getting down too.  Cocktails in a paper cup runs $8 with plenty to choose from the menu that is thoughtfully laid out in sweet, sours, spicy, etc. A nice mason jar with the Deep Eddy logo is $12 and slightly larger.  Do know that they will not refill your mason jar after you buy your first one so be prepared to be clanking around the distillery with your extra mason jars if you keep going the $12 route. Also be careful with your glass too - I saw many people let that mason jar slip out of their hands and the mason jar just crash on the concrete floor. So sad! Also frozen drinks / cocktails can only be purchased downstairs so be ready to wait in a little line if it is busy.   Loved the areas to sit inside the tasting room and even in the 2nd large downstairs area.  The pillows, decor, and the small touches around the sitting areas on the first floor are super cute and selfie-worthy.  I can imagine in the winter, with the large fireplace going, this space is cozy AF!  We didn't go outside at all as it was super hot in July but it looked like there are plenty of tables, shade, and seating for some large groups both in the front, side, and back areas.  After 2 cocktails in a mason jar we were feeling a good buzz and knowing we still had to trek back home (south Austin) we cut it off there. By the time we left around 2pm the place was buzzing with people, all 3 bars had 10+ waiting to be served, and I wasn't planning on waiting to close my tab in a long line.  I was super surprised to find out you can close your tab at the merch area with the cashier there so don't fret and add in that mug, stickers, shirts, bar additions, and Deep Eddy cool pool lady in red signage to your basket to check out while you close out your tab. You will save yourself some time and be out of there in a jiffy!  We plan to come back especially now knowing they are opened on Thursdays at 11am!!!!"

The set-up is gorgeous and feels so clean when you walk in. You get a behind the scenes taste of where the best Texas vodka comes from. The staff was kind and knowledgeable. They answered any questions we had about the drinks. I ordered a $10 flight and my Husband got the Orange dreamcicle drink. You have the option to get your drink in a mason jar as a keep sake.  There is a great gift shop on site, so we got matching shirts because we are cheesy like that.  There was a delicious food truck out front that had Vegan and Meat Eater options available. I like that they cater to both.   There is so much to do in the surrounding area. We went thrifting and enjoyed the nature that Hill Country has to offer."

We are already big fans of Deep Eddy's vodka and all of their flavors, so we had no doubt we would enjoy our time there. The cocktails they serve at their bar are innovative and refreshing. I ordered the Spring Sling and he ordered the Austin Mule. We both enjoyed the drinks next to the patio where they had multiple groupings of chairs spread out on the lawn. Other than drinking, there's not much else to do here, but it's definitely a lively place to enjoy a drink with friends! Our bartender was also very kind and helped us choose the right cocktails for each of us."

The weather was perfect and they have a nice little patio area. The spot is family friendly meaning you can bring your kids, but there isn't a lot for them to do except run around in the patio area. I would have liked if the patio area was fenced off and not open to the parking so I could relax a bit more. I had to keep a close eye to make sure my kid didn't wander off. I enjoyed both of the drinks I tasted and would definitely stop in here to explore more of the tastings, but will likely leave the kid at home next time."

FINALLY this past weekend we got there when they were open! Oh we were so excited and the place lived up to the hype. The seating atmosphere both inside and out is very roomy and comfortable. All the staff is friendly and easy-going. Everywhere including the bathrooms were incredibly clean. The cocktails... the cocktails are downright amazing. They're inventive, delicious, and fresh. You're going to have a hard decision to make no matter what kind of drinks you like... I actually ended up ordering two at once because I couldn't decide! On the way out, we stopped at their little gift shop and man do they pack that area with goodies! Talk about variety and options. The shirts are awesome and made very well to boot, and they have tons of other merch. I left with a soft tanktop, a wicked fun tin can that I plan on using for a cactus or succulent vase, a magnet, and a collapsible dog bowl! We'll be back every chance we get. Loved it, loved everything, love the vodka."

                "description": "‼PSA: NEVER go to the Deep Eddy's Vodka Tasting Room!!‼ HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED AS A REGULAR DEEP EDDYS ENTHUSI  My friends and I went out to celebrate Maddy Montgomery's 22nd birthday and were harassed by the manager for being \"underage\".   The whole group willingly gave our ID's for inspection and the birthday girl's ID was \"questionable\", so she was taken to a cop car by a Sheriff, put in the back and questioned.  While Maddy was at the cop car getting her ID verified, the rest of the group had our full drinks/cups (that we paid for and were able to take home), snatched out of our hands. We all requested a refund for the drinks and were denied??  After the Sherriff verified that Maddy's ID was real, the manager proceeded to threaten tresspassing charges against us??   I have never experienced anything like this and would love to be contacted/reimbursed for the mistake that was clearly made."

                "description": "Real Ale has been on my list of breweries to try while in the San Antonio area. Granted, that's a pretty loose definition of San Antonio area and I'm usually gone or working during their operating hours.  I deliberately flew into San Antonio early so I could make it to Real Ale on Sunday before they closed. I even got my friend to  make an early morning 3 hour drive to join me. I ended up making the hour drive to Real Ale and parked in their lot and cluelessly wandered the grounds until we found the taproom on the second floor.  While I wanted to try their beers on tap I really wanted to try their spirits. They had draft cocktails so I started with their Peanut Old Fashioned. I also tried two of their beers their anniversary Golden Stout and the Black IPA which were also pretty good.   There's not much food wise on Sundays-if there was it would have helped me stay a little longer since I definitely needed something solid to continue drinking."

                "description": "Tucked back in Hill Country Texas, Real Ale is like an oasis with beer flowing in a wine dominant river.   I've been a fan of their brew since stumbling upon in (sort of literally) while on a vacation to Austin. Unavailable in Louisiana, it was a refreshing change when I was really first getting to know all the various types of beer out there. Due to the generosity of a friend of ours, I get to have some every now and then when he travels here from Texas.  The brewery itself was a nice, functional building. A spacey bar and plenty of tables and games to enjoy in the cool AC, or you could hop outside on the patio and take in some hills and the occasional breeze. Picnic table outside and plenty of parking is available.   I tried one of their rotating IPAs on this visit, and it was a delicious and refreshingly smooth 6.something% tongue pleaser. It went down a little too smooth for the Texas heat, but who's complaining. On to one of my favorites, Axis, first time on draft. I was one happy girl.   Service was great, and I enjoyed watching the bartender interact with a first-timer. There were a lot of \"beer guy\" patrons, the type I love watching drink beer as they name off the flavors and the ages with a simple taste.   My hope is to make it back for the annual Real Ale Day in April when I can take in Texas *slightly* cooler, and enjoy being surrounded by beer guys, nerds, and geeks, tasting all the deliciousness.   Real Ale is definitely a place you should visit and give your taste buds a break from the grapes for a hoppy bit."

                "description": "Beer buds do yourself a favor and take a ride out to Real Ale brewery. I understand they recently expanded and even though their tap/drinking room is on the intimate side there is plenty of deck/patio area to enjoy your brew or their craft gin and/or whiskey cocktails. Real Ale has plenty of acreage for when they have special events. I heard from a regular that their anniversary parties are a must attend event.  Next visit I'll be taste testing their whiskey but this was a beer kind of day. I came in heavy with their Commissar Russian Imperial Stout offering. With an ABV of 9.8%, it's truly a sipping beer that is full-bodied with a nice dry finish. Plus one opted for a true summer ale, their Rio Blanco pale ale which was surprisingly flavorful. My last beer was their Axis IPA. I favor west coast IPAs but I may have found my backup. It has a perfect balance of hops and citrus flavors. Man, I wish we had a DD so we could have quaffed a few more draft options.   The barkeeps are knowledgeable, friendly, and will pour you s hearty sample when requested. Be sure to check out their production area it is quite impressive."

                "description": "Out of all the breweries I have visited in South Texas, this one seems to have the largest brewing capacity (but is also the LOUDEST).  One thing I didn't realize is that they also distill their own gin and whiskey via the Real Spirits Distilling Co.  You can purchase the gin and whiskey here, or you can order a specially crafted house cocktail if you aren't into beer.  This place is clean, up to date, and has friendly bar staff.  BUT, it is loud AF, and PACKED.  I stood at the bar for my first beer, and although I wanted to try a second beer, I just couldn't get over the loudness, and the bar scene.  I'd pick a quiet spot at the bar and then other customers would swarm to my area to place their order or mill about and hang out within my personal bubble.  I just don't dig that if there's plenty of other open spaces at the bar.  So, I fled after finishing my first beer. There are a few outdoor covered seating areas if you want a more relaxed vibe, but it was HAWT!!!  Most of Real Ale's beers can be found in a lot of grocery stores and liquor stores around South Texas, and they have a good variety of beers for each palette, so I suggest skipping the drive out to this brewery and just getting your fix at a local store or pub.  Parking is in a gravel lot and can be confusing. There's a \"no entrance\" sign before you drive into the parking lot, but I think it's supposed to be facing the other side street coming into the lot. Looks like it might have been turned around.  There's a collection of pictures of the character \"Rerun\" from an old sitcom named \"What's Happening?\" behind the far left side of the bar.  Ask your server the story behind that."

The people serving the beer are absolutely unfriendly and by the way the place is crazy about masks, even though everything is outside and the venue is outside they are extremely pushy about the whole mask situation even though it's not required anymore. So be prepared to wear a mask outside in the sun everywhere you go except for at your table, LOL, makes no sense whatsoever!"

                "description": "Extremely impressed and proud of Real Ale for their expansion and how far they have come. Visited on a Saturday, on our way back from Wimberely. I have not been to Real Ale for clost to 9 years, so this was pre - expansion. Crazy to see how far they've come, and now they even offer spirits!   The tasting room is upstairs, but does have an elevator for handicap accessibility, which I did not actually see, I just saw the sign. The tasting room has a nice long bar, lots of picnic tables and clean restrooms. It's also nice and cool in here on a hot summer day. There is 2 tables right outside the tasting room, which is covered. You  can also walk around outside on the second level and look into the brewery or go through double doors past the bar, and have a birds eye view of the brewery. There is also some old school arcade games, FREE, that you can play!   We were able to catch a few chairs at the bar, and enjoyed a few beers. There is also seating outside, downstairs, which is covered and allows smoking. There was a food truck, which we did not eat at. There is also corn hole set up outside, and plenty of board games in the tasting room.  It did get loud, after what felt like a tour bus came in, but they were in and out so quickly, it didn't deter us from wanting to stay.   Real Ale is about a 45 minute drive N 281 from SA.   I love their beers, except all the sours... what was going on with that? Sour IPA? Never heard of it.. but maybe it floats someone else's boat. They had at least 4 sours on tap. They do offer flights of 4 tasters, or you can purchase a pint. The beer is poured at the perfect temperature! They do not sell beer to go nor do they fill growlers. But they do sell bottles of their Real Spirits whiskey and gin, as well as make craft cocktails.   The staff was very friendly and attentive. For a Saturday afternoon, we didn't ever have to wait long for help, even with as busy as it was.  On Saturdays, at 1 pm and 3 pm they offer FREE brewery tours, and you can take a beer on this with you."

                "description": "Jumping back in time to before our stay in San Antonio, our stop by Real Ale Brewing (with the addition of Real Spirits Distilling Co!) in Blanco, TX was a very, very wise move.  The place closed at 6, and we got there just after 5.  Our time was short, but our visit was good.  The distillery folks had left for the day, so the beer heads couldn't answer all my whiskey questions, but they were still great to talk to.  Not only the bartender, but also the guys at the bar who'd gotten off shift and stuck around to enjoy the fruits of their labor.  The facility is tucked away off the main road, and rolling up to it is impressive.  It's BIG!  The bar area is up a flight of stairs, and it overlooks the bottling operation.  I knew Fireman's #4 was popular, but WOW!  They bottle a LOT of that stuff!  Major operation for sure.  Impressive sight, particularly for a craft brewery.  Keep in mind, Real Ale has been around just over 20 years.  They were one of the first big dogs in Texas craft brewing, and they started out much smaller than they are today.  This isn't a venture capitalist project - this is a success story built on grit and good beer.  I'll tell you what, though - as a whiskey and bourbon head, what really knocked my socks off was their new line of whiskey.  I expect little of new folks on the craft whiskey scene.  Many source product from Indiana or Kentucky, and it tends to taste the same - usually mediocre and sometimes downright bad.  Real Spirits Distilling Co was a passion project by the place's owner, Brad, and it tastes like a passion for greatness.  When you have all the stuff that goes into making whiskey already on hand to make beer, why not?  That would be one approach.  This takes it up a notch to, \"Oh, and it's awesome on our first try.\"  I was very, very impressed.  I can't speak to the mash bill because they don't disclose it, but I seem to taste a lot of barley.  Not surprising, considering they make beer here...  :)  They don't use any rye in their beers, so I'm guessing zero rye, and I'll bet wheat is the other main ingredient.  Not sure about corn... if there's any, I'd guess it's not a lot?  I can't taste it, whereas most bourbon has a notable corn component.  (Note that their whiskey is NOT labeled as a bourbon, although they do use new charred American oak barrels.)  I'd love to know their mash bill...  I'll have to see what I can find out...  You can only buy the whiskey on site, and - like at all distilleries - you can only buy 2 bottles per month.  (Stupid rule.  Stupid lawmakers.)  So, knowing I live about 4 hours from Blanco and don't frequent the town, I naturally had to buy 2 bottles.  To be clear, I'm talking about their \"normal\" whiskey.  The single barrel sold out in a matter of hours when it was released in late April, I understand.  My wife loved her hef, btw.  We'll be back for sure next time we're in the area!"

                "description": "We went to Real Ale on Saturday afternoon when we were in town to go camping. We happened to get there just a few minutes before one of their tours was starting, and quickly hopped on after chugging down our flight.   The tour is interesting, but was a bit drawn out in our opinion (we liked the one that we did at Shiner a couple years ago better). The guide was a woman (yay for women working in the beer industry!) and she was very sweet and accommodating.  The tap room is kind of smallish, but it has a nice intimate feel to it. Major props for having board games available for your patrons! We've always loved Real Ale beers and enjoyed almost all of the different brews we had on our two flights. Our favorite, if we're remembering correctly, was the gose. Service from the bar was efficient but not memorably friendly. We didn't love that they had a massive television in there, but we guess it's a draw for Texas football lovers.  There's a food truck outside that looked good, but we just opted for some pretzels to hold us over. Our toddler was pretty well-behaved the couple hours that we were there, which always makes the whole experience more pleasant. Overall, definitely a must (in addition to the Buggy Barn Museum across the street!!) if you're in Blanco."

There are a lot of grounds so there was plenty of space for everyone who showed up. There was plenty of parking and so much room for people with dogs and kids. There were food trucks, live bands and tons of beer- ALL made by Real Ale. I honestly thought they only made about 10 beers. The party had 35 different ones, and that wasn't even all of what they brew! It was very hard to decide which ones to try with the 4 beer tickets each person was allowed.  I definitely recommend visiting the brewery! I am not sure how many beers they offer on their regular weekend hours, but they are all excellent, so you can't go wrong!"

When pulling up, you aren't really sure about parking, but you can basically make your own spot and roll from there. There was a sign out front, but we weren't sure where the door was, so after walking around, we went upstairs into the tasting room.  When entering we were greeted by the bartender, who was helpful and educated us on a few of their beers. There was several other guest there, which is cool to see in the middle of a Friday.   I ordered a flight of IPA's- all pretty good flavor, a few were lighter than the others, but I would recommend the flight so you can sample several of their beers. Hubby snagged their Axis IPA and also a sample of their whiskey, which he enjoyed. We skipped tours, due to time. But their tasting room was roomy and had long tables which are good for groups and cool views of the property. I would recommend stopping here for some beers!"

Second, great patio space [esp for Lakeway], with some casual live tunes at times. Overall, a really nice place to grab a brew and chill.   Everything else: Food is very hit or miss, high $ for average/poor quality, service is also so-so sometimes, could be kept up a bit better.   Yep, 3 stars. I'll continue to return for the suds. Cheers!"

                "description": "We were looking for a lunch place with patio open close by and this came up. We went there and we're amazed to see how big is their patio. Plus it was very nice and clean which is a plus.  We were greeted nicely and made to sit at their patio table in next few minutes. Our server was very good as the water came out fast and after placing drinks order it came out quick too.   For food we ordered brussel sprouts and fried cornbread as appetizers. Brussel sprouts were usual but corn break was too sweet than usual. Than we had aglio Olio pasta without chicken and it came out okay. Though I liked their chicken pesto club.   All in all, it's a nice place to have drinks with big outdoor patio, good service and decent food."

                "description": "Honestly I really wanted to write a positive review but instead I got very sick off the food tonight and still suffering. When I return this time ithis time it's different I believe the managers are different and is now owned by someone elsomeone else. They know they no longer make the drumsticks like before now they have dried up, comma bad bad dark meat of low quality, comma instead of the succulent white meat of chicken they normally do cook. They served me a very old salad it was horrible I didn't even get to taste it the tomatoes were rotten and smell it was were rotten and smelled you could tell the salad's been in a refrigerator for a long time period period the hamburger was a $22 hamburger small I took a picture so everyone could see a $22 hamburger with little fries. I'm not a glutton I just don't understand why someone would raise a hamburger that high I know that meat cost a lot these days, but but if it is small let it be an amazing tasting hamburger and his hamburger instead of dried up. To my shock I wasn't planning to write a negative review until I got home with a bad sickness my stomach is still hurting I don't know if it's what I ate or the chicken tasted funky. I don't think I can return back to this restaurant ever again I find it to be shocking that these people were very nice to me this time around  and didn't understand Why I felt bad after 35 to 45 minutes still feeling bad is still feeling  bad stomach aches..Hope this helps everyone out there who understands that if you're gonna pay over $50 for a meal it better be a good one instead of a  stomach ache!! New ownership but not in a good way!"

                "description": "What a ridiculous response by the ownership. It's very clear that the ownership of this place does not treat their employees with respect. A lot of your staff has turned over. Such a great patio that the majority of Lakeway will not go to because the owner has little man syndrome and talks down to his staff in front of customers. It's apparent now you don't take criticism very well. Re-read this a couple times and adjust your business instead of reading Dr. Seuss books."

The food we ordered was very good. Smell of seafood overwhelmed the restaurant upon entry. Interesting layout where trays of utensils, etc from the kitchen come through the restaurant to get to cleaning room which is right off the traffic to the restrooms. Shannon was outstanding waitress!  In all, will return but it didn't become our go to restaurant."

Not a huge deal but kind of weird.   Got the breakfast club sandwich. One bread had burnt edges the other under toasted. Hot as heck outside and no lemonade or \"refreshing\" options. Again nothing concerning just off.   Wife got the \"egg plate\". Self explanatory. Not sure what I was expecting but wish I just went to Waffle House.."

I had the BBQ baby back ribs and my wife had the salmon. Both dishes we're spot-on!! Super high quality ingredients with delicious homemade sauces. Salmon on a bed of creamy risotto and the ribs on whipped mash potatoes. Not your traditional dryrub Texas BBQ.  We had a few martini's \"up\" and they were perfect.  Very generous size...Shaken with little ice crystals.  We got to meet the owner Eric and he's a great guy that you can tell has tremendous passion for his business and ensures his guests are well taken care of. Real attention to detail for a small neighborhood grill.  Found out that the chef has two Michelin Stars and his food backs it up!  Finally, our waitress Shannon was as Friendly, kind and prompt as you could hope for.  Live music too!!  Great neighborhood spot!!! Can't wait for our next visit!"

They tried to seat us at a table that had yet to be cleaned. Then we waited 5 mins for anyone to come by the table once we were seated.  Despite placing our orders right away, we learned 30 mins in that there were still 10+ dinners ahead of us and it would be more time. Best thing of the night was the waitress offering to cancel our order and close out our tab with our drinks only.   Our previous visits were OK but never lived up to any of the reviews we've read."

                "description": "The overall quality of not only food but ingredients and recipes has declined drastically in recent months. The caesar salad dressing went from creamy and rich with anchovy, to a simple blend of olive oil and parmesan cheese. Brunch items consist primarily of store bought premade processed ingredients straight from HEB. Sitting outside long enough you will notice employees running back and forth with bags from the HEB next door as the restaurant runs short on supplies throughout the day. A simple stroll toward the bathroom provides a clear view of the pantry stocked primarily with Knorr mixes and highly processed precompiled ingredients. For example a $22 Eggs Benedict Entree consisted of store bought Thomas English Muffins, pre-packaged ice cold Parma Prosciutto, Ore-Ida frozen potato cubes, and \"hollandaise inspired\" Knorr Bearnaise sauce powdered mix (almost more powder than liquid sauce). The side of bacon I ordered was unmistakably signature Hormel fully cooked bacon drenched in liquid smoke and processed applewood flavoring. It is truly a disappointment to see a local staple that once emphasized farm to table ingredients transition to a business model that more closely resembles \"frozen food aisle to table.\""

Their outdoor dining area is so nice and the live music is great! All of their cocktails were great. We LOVED the Brussels sprouts. We got two servings of it. We also got the charcuterie board and fried cornbread and really enjoyed those as well. I had the aglio olio for my main and it was tasty. The bread pudding for dessert was a great finish! We met the new owner while we were there also and he was so welcoming. What a great neighborhood bar. We can't wait to come back to Austin to visit my MIL and go eat and drink here again."

                "description": "it was nice to get to a vineyard that was hospitable and had darn good wine.  We continued through our drive in the countryside south of Austin to the next vineyard, which was Driftwood.  after pulling in and walking down the trail to the main house we got in line to do a tasting.  actually my gal got a tasting, was happy to try a full pour of the Cabernet they have.   While we waited I took in the rooms that we were in.  It was a homey vibe with lots of small things to buy and others to just look at. The tasting was pretty good, but I took my glass of wine outside to the edge of what seemed the property as it dropped off sharply down a hill. There was some chairs there to sit and look out over the valley and that's just what I did.  it is a beautiful spot to appreciate the views of the wine valley here.  I could see the vineyards crawling over the hills on the other side.   There was a gazebo a ways to my right with a couple people people enjoying there wine there.  They had some classic rock songs going on the sound system which added to the relaxed vibe. I would definitely recommend going, and for sure enjoy the view out back."

                "description": "Absolutely horrible experience this afternoon. My review is similar to those before me. There is a long list of rules and policies posted at the front. The one policy not listed is one you will be yelled at for violiting and practically chased out of the building for. We went in with the intention or purchasing a wine tasting experience. The woman behind the bar was rude, as others have mentioned, and did not tell us anything about the rules. We received our pour and stepped away to sit outside since, while the website boasts table tastings, there aren't any tables inside. We were yelled at in an absolutely abrasive manner by two woman behind the bar. We were then informed that we were not allowed to take our tastings outside and come back inside for the remaining pours. They stated: \"it's just too busy to allow that on the weekends\". There were four other people inside. Busy? I think not. There isn't a sign anywhere stating you must remain inside for the duration of the tasting. The women were so incredibly rude when referencing a policy that isn't stated anywhere and that we were completely unaware of. It was humiliating and aggressive. So many other wineries allow you to taste at your pace and sit wherever you'd like. This was not the case. We were so thrown off by such atrocious customer service that we settled on a bottle just to get out of the building.   Hours later I saw one of the same woman chase a woman out of the building while yelling \"excuse me, excuse me\" because the woman had violated some other unstated policy. Chasing after and yelling at paying customers does not invite a relaxing winery experience.   We are local to the area and are members of two other wineries. We would have been back but my opinion of this \"estate\" winery has been permanently soured. Don't aggressively yell at customers in front of other guests and certainly don't chase them around your property. We'll stick to welcoming wineries with better tasting wine like Duchman, Bell Springs, Wimberely Valley, and Fall Creek. If you're looking for a great Texas winery skip this place and head elsewhere."

Beautiful area you can see the vineyard from up top.  Dogs welcome, to s of land outside for the doggies yo play in.   We tasted award winning wine from TEXAS grapes!  I'll just bet that when the temperature is a bit WARMER, and the sunshine's one would have a memorable time relaxing and enjoying a bottle or two  Some nibbles you can purchase, not a whole lot the time we were there, remember it was TUESDAY"

                "description": "We made a quick stop at this winery and enjoyed the view while having a glass of wine.  I chose a jammy Cabernet called Lone Star Cab that was perfect. They do wine tasting but I just opted for a glass of what I knew that I would enjoy.    The cafe was not open but they had items that paired well with wine.  I'm sure it is busy in the weekend.  The Cafe is small so get your food to go and enjoy one of the many cozy spots to view the vineyards.   The staff were very friendly and the store was very clean.  They have gifts as well.  If we were in town longer, We would have come back for lunch.    The road to the vineyard is gravel so drive slow.  Parking is free and plentiful.  Follow the signs as the vineyard is about a mile up from the main road."

The wine was fine but definitely not the sole reason to visit, so make sure you have a couple places you're bopping around to in the area. Cute little tasting glasses and there's a shop for kitschy items featuring a lot of wine puns.    I do think the crowd skews a bit older, so better suited for entertaining folks than a bach party!"

                "description": "Beautiful winery 25 minutes from Wimberly! We stopped by during 4th of July and was surprised there wasn't more of a crowd. Strict 21+ policy (many signs warning you to turn back if you aren't 21!) but the servers were so nice and kind. We did a wine tasting which was $20 for 6 samples of white, red, and sweet wine. You can also split the sampling between people, which I shared with a friend. Server (I think her name was Julie) was so sweet and knowledgeable about the wine flavors and gave us recommendations and some history of the flavors. Our favorite was the Starry Night, or the Orange Muscat wine! A bit disappointed they didn't give chocolates or nuts during a wine tasting and overall felt a bit rushed through the process as more people showed up, but it was still a unique experience.   The patio has a beautiful view of the orchard, which is why we came here versus other wineries in the area. Outdoor seating is plentiful, many round tables for larger groups too. Definitely would've spent a good half of day out here sipping wine if it wasn't for the rain. The Bistro (food/restaurant area) was closed because of Covid so eat before you arrive so you don't get hangry or wine drunk! ;)"

They are on a hill so that the outdoor seating has a great view.  We got 2 tastings and for the most part I enjoyed all of their wines. The Alamo Red was great and so was the Longhorn Red. My wife enjoyed the Chardonnay as well. The servers were very helpful and help guide us to their more popular wines.   We ended up buying a couple of bottles and really enjoyed the experience and the view. We plan on coming here again soon!"

                "description": "The wife and I tasted a flight of 6 wines: including the Rose, Cab, Red Blend, Merlot, Sangovese, and Syrah.  They were all simply awful swill. Everyone of the varietals lacked depth, character and complexity.  Everyone of the reds tasted blah, and I mean blah. They all lacked the distinctive aroma and notes that each of the grapes are known for.  The Rose  lacked any minerality that one would expect, and was as bad as the others.  The tasting room experience was as bad as the wines. The server had zero personality or character either.  We came away with the same thoughts as we have from other Hill Country Wineries.  They should not, nor should they be attempting to produce well known wines, and in fact do a terrible version of Cabs, Merlots, and Chards.  They should stick to Italian varietals, as well as a few others that might be better suited to the Texas climate, even though most people have no idea about those varietals. I suppose its just marketing to attract people in to the tasting room, and once they get toasted enough it no longer matters, since once the minds fogs, its just pour me another."

The ambiance is fantastic and is worth the visit to just get a bottle and enjoy the panoramic views.   Pro tip: they do not allow children, so know that before you go.

They wipe down tables in between people and staff are all wearing mask. Plenty of space outside for proper social distancing and enjoying some wine. We grabbed a bottle and ate at the small restaurant they have there. Would recommend you make reservations if you want a view. Service was great and food was amazing. My favorite was the pizza, don't remember the name of it but it had honey on it and it was the perfect amount of sweetness. Never thought I would like a pizza with honey on it, now I can't wait to go back."

They have an outdoor sitting area where you can admire the views and the bottle that you order is brought to you by a server who wears a face shield and gloves.    My group ordered a bottle of the 2017 Newsom Cabernet Sauvignon and we were pleased with our choice. It was not dry like a Merlot but just right. This winery does not allow you to bring outside food only the food offered in their bistro outdoor facility. This was not an issue for us.   Overall, it was a pleasant experience."

Prior to this place, everything I tasted was a mixture of sour fermented grapes. Not knocking Texas wines but they are just not my style. Maybe it needs an ice cube. Every wine here, ones that I tasted, is 100% Texan and done the way I think it is suppose to taste. Also, the view from the estate is beautiful. Very worth a stop for tasting and buying."

We went an 75 minutes out of our way to stop in for a tasting to see what peaked our interest in their current offerings. We loved that they have so much beautiful outdoor space. That is something that was always a major draw for us at Driftwood.   We called ahead, let them know we had a pup with us, and wanted to do a tasting. They told us to come on in. (It was a Monday and the place was very slow)  Upon arrival they told us they will only to tastings inside? What? In the era of COVID? As for the dog, they said one of us could do a tasting.   Between the lack of customer service, unfriendly attitude, and most importantly lack of outdoor tastings we will never bother to come back. WAY too many options with just as beautiful of grounds, equally great wines, safe tasting environment, and more importantly good customer service."

The views are breathtaking, and the main house is absolutely impressive, I was so impressed with the property I had to explore it further on my own.   They have been operating since 2004 and turned the former residence into a tasting, event and sales space. The sunroom and patio are perfect for enjoying a tasing or a bottle of wine among friends.   I actually sampled all of the wines on my visit to the vineyard, of course my preference is red, but I found many of the whites quite refreshing. Although the pool is no longer used for swimming, it makes an excellent backdrop, stop in and set a spell! Cheers!"

I'm not weeping with joy from any of the wines but they're easy enough to drink.  It's particularly lovely for violet crown sunsets, so save it for your last stop if you're making the rounds in this neck of the woods.  They don't have any ice, which I find supremely odd being that it's Texas and they serve white wine! If you want to keep your wine chilled while sitting outside (they've got plenty of gorgeous trees to provide shade but shade is not a wine bucket!) the only way to do so is to drink it real fast while thinking cold thoughts."

We were a little disappointed to hear that, as of our visit in May, they weren't doing tastings due to Covid because I do think it can be done safely and would've made for a better experience. Otherwise, you either have to buy a full bottle or multiple bottles if you'd like a well-rounded understanding of their wines. We opted for a blend that we absolutely loved, described on the bottle as a \"patchwork quilt of grapes.\" It was honestly worth every penny--so delicious!   We took our bottle and glasses outside onto the expansive lawn which is just perfect for picnics. They have lots of shaded tables under the old growth trees.   Perhaps for safer tastings they could serve them \"beer flight\" style with the informational flyer and direct you to sit outdoors so that you can still experience a handful of their wines without breaking the bank? That would make it a 5-star experience for me!"

I've done the tasting before and also just purchased wine by glass. Both are delightful. Tasting is nice for first timers to explore a variety of wines Duchman produces. Because of the tasting, I was able to find my favorite red and white wine of theirs. And for $10/tasting, it is such a steal!! (Price may have changed. This was based off of 2018). After my first visit, I just opt to get a bottle or glass of my favorite red and sip it on the patio taking in good wine, views, and company.   My friends and I always love to end our Hill Country winery trek at Duchman and drive over to Salt Lick after for good ol Texas BBQ."

The wine tasting was $17 per person."

                "description": "This was actually one of my favorite stops in our Driftwood wine tasting day. This particular winery has outdoor picnics for groups and benches for smaller groups for one to buy a bottle , bring some of your own food and enjoy their wines. During this pandemic time, this is the perfect scenario to drink wine while still practicing social distancing.   They do allow you to use the restroom with mask wearing enforced for you to go inside the building.   Their wine was light and refreshing. We chose  a white wine.   If you go near the end of the day you enjoy a nice sunset followed by lighted trees giving you a Christmas vibe. Up until that day , I never knew that Texas had a winery side like Driftwood but places like Duchman Family Winery proved to me that they do exist and they have really good wine too. Highly recommend you make a stop at this winery."

I had a review but it was taken down by yelp for whatever reason, I was so surprise when from rude employee message me on my yelp apologizing personally, and apparently there was a guy anonymously message me regarding my review to be reposted. Eventually found they are working together and engaging me on whatever conflict they have. Thus, proven that they really have poor customer service , very unprofessional.I wont be surprise if they will ask yelp to take my review down again."

                "description": "I live in California and only an hour away from Napa. I wasn't expecting anything close to what one would experience in Napa. However, I still wasn't fully pleased.   The only way I can imagine that someone would really enjoy it, is to bring your own picnic and use their outdoor seating area. This is of course conditioned on the weather and also whether or not there is gonna be any bachelorette party there during your visit. (We saw two when we visited and they were so loud and they had overtaken all the outdoor seatings)  We tried their tasting. It was only $15 which is relatively cheap. In Napa you pay 2-3x more than that in a good winery. They let you choose your own 5 wines out of their selection or go with their recommendation. The tasting overall was okay, nothing that I disliked and at the same time nothing wowed me. I'm not sure if I'm gonna go back there, but it was worth to try it once."

                "description": "Nice stop just outside Austin for a wine tasting! The outside setting is very cool, spacious front lawn and some tables/chairs for hanging out. Dropped into this place for a quick wine tasting, consisting of 6 small pours of wine. The whites we tasted were all very smooth, not overly sweet but just the right amount of smooth and dry. Definitely recommend sampling all the whites if you have time, you won't be disappointed!  We didn't go check out Trattoria next door for food, but have been there in the past and pretty good Italian food, pairs well with the winery.  If you come here and the weather is looking good, you can expect a very scenic, picturesque spot to spend some time at!"

                "description": "Over priced tasting . $17 tasting for very small pours of 6 wines . No water in tasting room. Had to go get it yourself . No crackers or palate cleansers . If it was a free tasting I wouldn't care as much . When I made reservation I was specific about food and was not given accurate info. You are not able to order food or eat during the tasting. Food only available to purchase after tasting was over. Servers poured wine on top of previous tasting . Missed poured twice . Server changed frequently and not consistent. They obviously are not organized to keep track of what wine we should be on . Huge red wine fan( live in Europe for 6 years ) was not a fan of  any of the reds . Surprisingly liked 2 of the whites, Beautiful atmosphere and building . A shame the tasting experience doesn't match . Could be so much better!!"

                "description": "Duchman is a great winery to visit near Austin that makes great wines.  I've recently been on a kick to learn more about and try Texas wines.  I've tried wine from several different Texas wineries in the past couple months (all purchased from wine stores) and Duchman is so far my favorite.  I prefer red wines and my favorite Duchman wines are the Aglianico and Sangiovese. Since the winery is so close to Austin, my husband and I decided to visit.  The grounds are beautiful - the perfect place for a picnic.  I appreciate the precautions they've taken due to COVID-19 too.  You can't go into the building (though they will let you in if you need to use the restroom), so they are set up outside selling wine by the bottle and require everyone to wear a mask.  There is plenty of space to picnic and social distance.  They sell some picnic meals on-site, but we brought pizza from Pieous, bought a bottle of wine, and had a lovely time relaxing at a picnic table in the shade.  I highly recommend visiting Duchman.  I'm happy there is a winery that makes great wines so close to Austin.  Even if you can't do a tasting during COVID-19, it is still worth the drive to drink wine in a pretty setting!"

                "description": "Really beautiful property. We wanted to go to Salt Lick and wanted to find some other activities in the area so came here for a tasting before lunch. They do $15 for 6, which is pretty good, and was offering 5% off your total bill for following them on Instagram.   There's some beautiful benches set up outside to go with your glass of wine. It unfortunately seemed to be drought season when we visited so the actual grape plants were pretty bare. Once you step inside, there's a small room where the tastings happen and the shop where they sell bottles and all kinds of souvenirs. There unfortunately wasn't any seating indoors so we had to stand the entire time. If you walk in more, you can see barrels and label making rooms. Wish they had given us more history during our tasting but it was fun nonetheless.   It was pretty easy to get an uber out here from the city but be warned getting an uber out here may take a little while."

                "description": "A great little distillery for those looking to escape the hordes at Jester King.   The service here is top notch, if it's your first time they'll present you with a complimentary mini-flight so you can sample their entire range. Right now that consists of gin and various liqueurs. I wasn't a fan of the liqueurs, but the gin is an absolute steal at $35/bottle (not available for purchase on Sundays!)   They used to have a few BBQ offerings, but sadly that's gone now. While the space is dog friendly, the outdoor seating is relatively small. We were planning on bringing our pups, but I'm glad we didn't...both the parties out there with us brought their dogs and it would have been 6 pups in a relatively small area.  Drinks range from $8-10, and they regularly rotate out flavored slushes, absolutely perfect for Summer. If you go on a busy Saturday afternoon like we did, you're better off going inside and ordering from the bar."

The tasting was free, while the cocktails were in the $8-10 range. The gin, coffee liqueur and pecan liqueur were amazing! However, because it was Sunday, we couldnt buy bottles, which was very disappointing. The cocktails were a bit of a let down that didnt let the spirits shine. The best was the gingery take on a White Russian. The service was very friendly and attentive, yet again, we were the only customers. I definitely recommend picking up a bottle of their gin and liqueurs if you can find them!"

When we answered no they immediately brought over for a tasting - no charge.  We enjoyed most of the different offerings.  Then we picked out some cocktails to enjoy - both with their gin.  Daughters was with grapefruit and mine with cucumber.  We also purchased a cheese plate which we were told was made up for them from the local grocery store.  Nonetheless, we enjoyed our cocktails out on the picnic tables and had quite a lovely time.    Not being from Texas we were unaware of the law prohibiting liquor sales on Sundays.

This place is really amazing!! There was quite a bit of crowd as it was saturday but we were still given a great deal of attention during our tasting! My favorite was the cafecito coffee liquer and the chocolate cafecito. They're so good, that I could probably drink an entire bottle all by myself!  The best part of this place is the amazing people who own/work here and they didn't even charge us for the tastings and also gave us a free cocktail made with their gin!! So as appreciation from our end for all that they did and shared with us, we gave a nice tip :)!! Definitely, going to look for Revolution on my next trip to Spec's!"

Best of all there was no need to pay $$ upfront for a tour--just walk in and start tasting and talking.   The gin was the standout here, but all the stuff we tried was excellent except for their own cherry-limeade mixer--that was kind of a letdown, but the alcohol itself was great.   Can easily walk from here to Last Stand Brewing and Argus Cidery. There was a food truck outside as well."

                "description": "Everything was done right - great customer service, clean flow for visitors, and the quality and uniqueness of the distilled liquor itself was great. To elaborate, samples were provided for the different options of their distilled liquor while an explanation of the flavors was provided, which was particularly beneficial for the 100 proof gin such has notes of grapefruit, lavender, and juniper. They also have a coffee liquour which is 50 proof, so a bit stronger than the traditional but still very sweet and flavorful. Even after the tasting, it was a nice place to hang out and was well ventilated and shaded."

My favorite alcohols were the gin and cafecito; also, the tonic they use (Springwood) which I had in a GandT I ordered after the tasting is also locally produced and top-notch.  The cherry on top is that the distillers are extremely friendly and knowledgeable.  Will be visiting again soon."

Even though they only make whiskey, their \"white dog\" (unaged whiskey) makes a great base for a wide variety of drinks.  We had a jalapeno margarita, blueberry margarita and a mule.   The staff is incredibly knowledgeable and helpful.   All this based on award winning whiskey.   A must visit if you're out in the hill country."

We had a large group, but the bartender was not bothered with us at all. She made some great recommendations. I opted for the Bloody Mary as I'd never had one with whiskey before. It was flavored perfectly.   The ambiance is a classy casual - be sure to check out the cute little room in the back. I grabbed a comfy chair and perused the book selection, finding some really good reads. I could see myself setting back there with a cocktail and a book for hours.   I would highly recommend a stop here for something a little different than the wineries around you."

The staff is super friendly, too. The cocktails are reasonably priced and you can buy bottles to take home.   We were here on a Saturday afternoon and it was chilly outside so we stayed inside, but there was a nice seating area outside. There was also a really wonderful Bluegrass band upstairs that was playing while we were there. So here are 2 levels, but the second isn't really accessible when a band is there. Totally worth having the band play, though.  Definitely will be back at this place. We are all from Austin and it's a super easy drive to get out here. Great for people to add to their winery tour."

I came here on Tuesday around noon (before my flight in Austin), there were only one other customer there, so I spend a lot of time chatting with the bartender.   I did the the 4 tasting, with two additional tasting of the Reserves. My favorite is the Stryker and Stryker Reserve, they are just a heaven in a glass.   The environment is very relaxed, there are couches inside and patio seatings outside.   I would love to bring my friends here next time when I'm in town"

                "description": "Oh boy, this is going to be my favorite place to visit when I'm out in the Texas Hill Country!  New to the Wimberly area Andalusia is a welcome addition focusing on Whiskey and helping break the overpopulated brewery scene.  Step inside and head directly to the bar I suggest ordering the Whisky flight to familiarize yourself with their three very distinct spirits.  Done in the Scottish tradition their Peated will remind you of a well balanced Scotch while the Stryker will flood your senses with mesquite, oak and apple wood much like good BBQ.   Once you decide which of the three you like order your cocktail and wander around the beautiful space or sit outside and enjoy the scenery. My favorite cocktails were the Whiskey Mule and the Cherry Cola.  Holding the fifth star until I try the food which I hope will be soon."

                "description": "We stayed at Carter Creek so of course we had to try the on site restaurant. The chicken Alfredo was excellent with lots of spices and flavors that you don't normally get with such a basic meal. The stake frites meal was incredible.  The sangria was good but the waitress said all they do is open the bottle and pour it in your cup so that just made it seem much more expensive than it should have been. It was nicely flavored.   The open seating to listen to live music was wonderful. Very comfortable with cornhole and Jenga games while you wait. There is a large pavilion and lots of open areas to hang out in. Great place to spend a lazy Saturday evening   Unfortunately, the spa is not open still which was disappointing.  The front desk said they're having a hard time finding employees for it.    We had room 1710 and it was very nice.  The only downside is that you have to walk down a rickety set of stairs and then through the mud to get to the room from the parking area.  The room itself was very nice and clean. The bed was comfortable and they did a great job of having the room stocked for us. Overall, a very nice place for the weekend"

                "description": "Very nice spot in the Hill Country for lunch on a perfect day.  We discovered this establishment with an online search on Yelp.  Old 290 is located within Carter Creek Resort, just west of Johnson City.    The menu was varied to appeal to both younger and older palates.  Nice cheese  board as well as the Texas Twist with soft pretzel, cheeses and bratwurst.  A wedge salad was also fresh with a delectable dressing.  None of these menu items required much culinary effort, but the ingredients did not disappoint.  The burger was not impressive, as the meat was lacking in flavor and the bun was coated in something similar to an everything bagel - not traditional burger material.  Truffle fries were tasty.   Prices on the lunch menu seemed a little steep for a family outing.    We sampled a hibiscus hefeweizen and a brown ale aged in a bourbon barrel.  I recommend trying both.  Most excellent brews.  Lovely location and nicely appointed restaurant/brewery.  Outdoor dining area was covered and overlooking the grounds.    Only restroom area is outside the restaurant at the front entry of the resort, according to the waiter.  Perhaps that was a mistake.  It's a short walk, although not completely covered.  A restaurant with high-end finishes and  no restrooms inside is puzzling.  I wonder how customers would manage the trek on a rainy or snowy day.    Understaffed restaurant, but understandable under current conditions.  Hope the kinks are worked out soon for this pleasant family-owned resort/winery/brewery/restaurant."

                "description": "Had a great dinner with friends on their outdoor patio. It was the coldest night this year yet in Texas but they had plenty of heaters. We had chili, salads and the Brussels sprouts...all delicious. Inside, they had a live band playing good music but not overpowering. On site brewery and wine. Looks like a great venue for a wedding reception. The place is huge. And hands down, the best server I've had in ages...Kimmi. She was attentive, personable and obviously loves kids. Even though they were short handed, she didn't crumble under pressure. Sorry no pics of food!"

                "description": "I am shocked how upscale the food is at the Old 290 Brewery. I ordered a gluten free mushroom burger with goat cheese, and it was the best burger I've had in years. The chef is definitely top notch and serves exquisite food. They are so short staffed during covid, that even the chef served our food to our outdoor table.  The staff came around to light the outdoor heating lamp but it burnt out after fifteen minutes. I think it might've run out of gas."

                "description": "Disappointing at Best.   More along the lines of overhyped and not worth the time or money.    Walked in at 2pm on a Saturday excited to order a glass of wine and enjoy a nice meal.  We were told they weren't seating.  Side note:  The place had a number of other tables with menus and staff taking orders.  They close at 2:30 for a mid-afternoon break(?).  Option provided by staff:  Go to the Smokehouse and sit on a bench and eat.  We were starving otherwise this option would not have been considered.    Ordered at Smokehouse and it was DISGUSTING.  If you are smoking beef in Texas it should be at minimum edible.  Ordered a brisket sandwich and bbq tacos.  Brisket sandwich was all fat and no meat with a disgustingly soggy bun.  Fat swimming in bbq sauce.  Absolutely revolting.  Tacos, same.  Fatty, drippy and translucent meat substance in a mini stale tortilla.    Definitely overpriced.  Fast food and gas stopover giant, Rudy's does such a better job!  Seriously, not worth the money for what was served: crap in a paper hotdog basket.    Onward to Hilmy Winery to pickup our quarterly wine allocation.  No need to let a dreadful lunch ruin our afternoon.  I really wished we had passed on this badly needed substance stop.  Hilmy flock allocations had a wonderful pairing!   So glad that we barely chocked down the Smokehouse offering.   The pairings were awesome.  We won't be back to Old 290.  Too many other great places in the Fredericksburg area.  Only good takeaway here was the bag of Miss Vickies potato chips."

                "description": "We are currently staying at the Carter Creek resort where the old 290 is. We went for dinner this evening and were blown away. For drinks, my husband had the pale ale, and I had the rose. Both excellent. For dinner, the kids had the pizza and chicken strips and my husband had the burger, while I had the Tri Tip Dip. The burger was cooked perfectly and the sandwich was a new twist on a classic that I order often when we dine out- this is the best I've ever had. To finish up, we ordered both the chocolate torte and pecan pie. The pie had orange zest in it...a surprising but delicious addition. The best part? The yard in the picture I'm attaching. The kids ran around while we enjoyed our beverages and enjoyed live music. The pricing was fair, service quick and luckily they were able to get us in because I made the reservation via open table for the wrong night (the hostess said it happens often so pay attention to the date when making yours!)"

You can get a much better comparable dish at an Olive Garden or Chili's for half the price. The service was nothing spectacular either. We saw our server maybe 3 times throughout our meal, and had to flag them down each time to wait on us. For these prices, you expect better."

                "description": "I had to give this place a single star, i am sorry but the five stars it has on yelp is very misleading, must have been artificially inflated by employees or family members or paid russian bots because the food was ok and the service was a complete catastrophe. I think it is unfair to others that trust and have confidence in yelp. I have had some amazing undeniably amazing meals in San Francisco, Chicago, Phoenix and Miami with the help of Yelp, i felt bamboozled sitting in the dining room of the Old 290 Brewery. I understand covid has taken its toll on the industry, take out tables reduce capacity if you dont have the kitchen staff to properly serve all the guests. Our server Josh was triple sat with our table being the fourth he did a great job of explaining his game plan and he waited on his section as it was one large table, i applaud his effort. All of his tables had issues and he was never going to catch up and there was no evidence of teamwork whatsoever. A vast amount of tables received their appetizers and entrees together and and salads and entrees at the same time. I assume the restaurant has a manager i think it was the woman dressed like she was going to the Kentucky Derby she spoke to a table and brought the table water but you could tell she didnt care she just wanted to talk to the regulars, she really enjoyed the sound of her voice we called her Julie from the love boat through out or meal. I understand restaurants like this only care about the regulars that like to name drop and ask if chef/owner/president  is in... that is why i made this review so not another traveler, vacationer, honeymooners, birthday revelers (us) dont fall for the inaccurately described and awarded restaurant. The food was decent the steak tasted great and was perfectly cooked Pittsburgh Rare but there is no way to absolve all the inequities the front of the house presented. Take this review with a grain of salt"

We didn't even know it existed until google directions told us as we were heading to a winery in Fredericksburg.  Staff was very friendly and efficient. Place is clean, esp the restroom. Food was good. We had iceberg wedge salad, flatbread, Cesar ssalad, tuna salad. Everything was great except tuna slices were from a bag.  Aside from the restaurant, there is a brewery and housing- resort type set up and venue for weddings. Will try again."

We tried several things but our favorite was the Angry birds (boneless wings) great flavor and amazing crunch on the breading. The ribs are also good and the tropical mimosa on the brunch menu. We also had the chicken sandwich and a pizza they were both good too. If you are staying at the resort make sure to grab dinner here at least once. The staff is very friendly and attentive."

Me and my husband each did a wine  flight and picked our favorite sips and ordered a glass each which we enjoyed on the fabulous patio.  I love that with every flight purchase included is a souvenir wine  glass. Flights and by the glass were very reasonable given the type of wine  served.  We ended up enjoying our time so much that we came back an additional day.  I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to sip on some delicious wine ."

We had to wait about an hour for their food and in the meantime we had a glass of Astoria Moscato and watermelon wine on the porch. The weather was perfect and this created a whole mood. We then proceeded to their wine tasting room and tried some of their best wines. I've got to say the Astoria Moscato was their best. At least for those who like sweet wine. My husband liked many of their dry wines as well. Definitely going back with the kids so they can pet the donkeys in the neighboring pastures."

However, do not fret if you didn't, because the grounds are stunning. You can order a glass or a bottle, no judgment ;), from their double decker bus, that gave me some serious harry potter vibes. Then take it and enjoy the view. There is ample sitting. I would love to come back with reservations of course, and try a flight in their beautiful tasting room."

Plenty of outdoor space to social distance along with animals to interact with: donkies, goats and miniature horses! A decent selection of wines with one standing out in particular to our taste-buds, can't remember the name specifically but it was red wine cherry blend, maybe seasonal?   The staff is friendly, place was very easy to find, there is a bit of construction going on in and around the place but it's not too big of an annoyance to take away from the overall great experience."

The tasting reservation process was pretty easy. The tasting price is very fair (5 glasses for $18) and the pours were generous. The wines were very good. I left with a couple of bottles. I definitely recommend the Christmas Cuveé and the Sangria wine. Once you finish your tasting, there is plenty of space outside on the patio or other areas to just sip more wine and just be.  A lovely experience."

I did like the outdoor patio and the arrangement of all the things. I enjoyed the red wines that they had. I really liked the season fruit wines--tasted like juice with how fruity they were (I mean that in a good way).   The food truck also served some pretty solid food. Really enjoyed the chili and cheese tator tots. The pizza was good too! The burger was a little disappointing though.   All in all, nice place to visit! Come check it out!"

Because of Covid, they are doing tastings by reservations only so that they can control number of people and properly space out in their tasting room. I'm sure you'll love a bottle to buy and you'll have ample time and space to enjoy it on their deck or yard after your tasting. Our tasting guide, Robert, was very knowledgeable about the different wines and a joy to converse with! They do have a good truck on their premises that bakes wood fire pizzas. I didn't try any this time because we already had brunch before coming. The port was my favorite wine. You've got to try it for yourself!"

                "description": "A year later and Wimberly Valley Winery is just getting better!  Our friends are members here and we joined them to go out and pick up their wine. While we were there we had a tasting.  They now have a full line up of \"fruit\" wines like Blackberry, Cherry and cinnamon, honey crisp apple, and others. They are on the sweeter side but for me were seriously tasty! I loved the cherry and the blackberry.  However at this time of year it is the mulled wine that truly wins the day for me! If you haven't had mulled wine I suggest you get off your butt, drive the distance, and sample some right now! It is so worth it!  A hearty and loud Ooooh my Goddie toooo Hottie to this wonderful glass of spiced wine that is served hot! It brings flashes of warm fire places, deep snow, thick sweaters and holiday cheer with every sip. It is my absolute favorite!  They are adding more structures to the location, the outside area is a divine place to grab a bottle and just sit and soak up the outdoors while enjoying a good sip with friends, and the inside is a great lush environment of comfy lodge like decor.  It is a great location with good people and a great selection of wines... not only theirs but a plethora of other wines as well. We always enjoy our time here!   One last note.... try the mulled wine! It is the holiday season in a bottle!"

                "description": "This place was definitely a one and done. There wasn't anything bad about our visit but there wasn't anything great about it either. They don't even use Texas grapes so these are all from out of state and only a handful are barrel aged. They were basic and not anything special. We came for a tasting so we tried a total of 5 different wines each (10 between the two of us.) They even serve store bought wines here!!! I've NEVER been to a winery that serves what I can buy myself at HEB. They didn't tell you anything about the wines other than \"this is dry and fruit forward,\" no explanation of the grapes used, how long its aged, etc that we've become used to at other wineries. Also the alcohol content must be very low in thier wines, we went on empty stomachs and neither of us felt a thing which is not the case at other wineries we've been to. I'd give it a try if you're in the area, but don't expect much. The grounds are nice and they have a cute double decker bus they converted but for us one visit was plenty."

My niece and nephew love taking carrots for the horses and donkeys and kicking the soccer ball around. The venue is just beautiful and even when their are tons of people there it just doesn't feel crowded, the layout is perfect.    The wine is top notch. I  like sweeter wines so most on the menu suits me but they have some dry wine as well for folks who love a dry red or white.  Slushes in the summer, warm spiced wine in the winter, fruit wines in the fall ... this place has it figured out!  Grab a Cheese tray and hang out for an hour or stay all day!"

Server Gabriel said we had a bad experience because he works for his ex and that we could leave a review about our \"shitty experience\" on Yelp. Welllll, here I am. When we walked out we got to speak to the owner and realized our tasting came with a complimentary wine glass that the server didn't provide. Owner brought it out, thankfully. Place is beautiful but had a better experience at other wineries because of service."

The lady on the other end of the call was quite nice suggesting they had PLENTY of space for our cars to park.  Well, they weren't wrong. Quite possibly the best photo opportunity of the entire weekend. Our attendees overlooking 24 cars perched in the beautiful trees of Hays County overlooking some of Mazda's genius. Free samples of crafted rum too?   I'd call that a win! Owners were quite attentive as soon as we arrived. Telling us the story of the brand; walking us through each tasting. Some drinks were ordered; maybe a bottle or two bought. Not sure we were the most receptive group being on a car tour in the Hill Country. Service was excellent!"

They offer free samples of the three different whiskeys with one of them being bourbon barrel aged using Rebecca Creek barrels.   The staff was friendly and well informed on the products. Currently they are distributing to smaller local stores and will start distributing to more stores in the future.   As it is August right now we couldn't tour the distillery because it was too hot but we were informed that the tours would start in October when it cools off.   The bottles are decently priced for hand crafted rum like this.   There are plenty of tables and chairs for groups, drink cocktails were decently priced, and property is a great change from the city."

It's a really nice touch, because it shows they aren't trying to blow through tours by combining as many people as they can into one group.  The tours are $5.  We emailed her to set ours up.  We started with a tasting.  Laura had bartended for several years before the business started, so she made us a Vanilla Rum mixed drink in a sample cup.  It was nothing short of delicious.  Absolutely fantastic drink.  Atfer that, the tour started.  Laura explained how the business started up, showed us the distillery and explained all the functions, and then showed us the bottling room.  She answered all of our questions and was very personable.    We concluded the tour with 1 more sampling of their normal rum combined with a mixer.  Again, a totally refreshing drink.  We stayed and talked to Laura for about 20 minutes after and were on our way.  This was a great experience.  It's a humble distillery with a growing presence.  They've won a couple of major awards and you can definitely they definitely love what they do.  Makes for a really enjoyable tour."

I didn't expect it to be at someone's home, though!  Not that it's a bad thing.  Rum, for me, is a take it or leave it type spirit.  I typically use it only in cocktails.  I don't think I've ever wanted to sit down with a glass of rum.  Now bourbon?  That's a different story.    On arrival, I just expected a tasting only, but they actually make cocktails.  They have a small menu, or you can request whatever you want from the mixers they have.  Mojito?  Of course.  Want to go dive with a great rum and just some Coke?  They won't judge you for that, either.  They make their own version of Rumchata in house and it was SO DELICIOUS.  For real.  And they'll give you the recipe.    Pick your favorite of the three varieties: Crystal, Gold, Vanilla and buy a bottle.  Then pick up a bottle of vanilla extract.  If you don't cook, make your mom very happy.  That stuff is fantastic.  In the hotter months, don't be a jerk and demand a tour of the actual distilling barn.  We all know how distilling works.  If not, the internet is your friend.  They don't want to be in the high temperatures, and neither do you.  Let them explain the process to you while you sip a nice, cool drink instead."

I have been to other rum distilleries and have never stumbled upon such a \"harsh\" flavor that could never be drank alone. That being written we decided to have a drink on the patio...I'm glad alcohol kills germs because the guy serving us had the dirtiest hands and fingernails I have ever seen in my life and I have children. For example when he grabbed our glasses from the cabinet it left a dirty grip mark. I was pretty much grossed out. It's too bad because again the location is great."

Let's examine the facts:. -- He led us through a tour of his small but highly functional distillery. -- He answered all of our questions about the process he uses, and even showed us some of the machine parts he's made. -- His wife made us two (nicely sized) tasters: a mojito, and another thing I drank even faster than the mojito that tasted like a lemon drop.  $5 each later, we skipped right down to Wimberley Valley Spirits to get ourselves a bottle, because the law is mean and David can't sell any of the goods on the premises.

The wide variety of Texas craft beers, wines, and meads absolutely blew everyone in attendance away and we can't wait to go back to try the beverages we missed."

                "description": "Who knew there was such a thing as mead but the wonderful girl behind the counter helped us with choices and filled us with lots of knowledge.  My parents were staying at the cabins at onion creek right behind this place and when we stopped I saw a dog inside so I called my parents and said meet us up here and told my husband whoa we gotta pet that dog!  I enjoyed the bead as I had never had it before and loved the inside decor and how the place is set up.  Cozy if you want it, outside on the patio ( not for us since it was raining) up at the bar or in large tables.  If you're in the area its definitely a must."

Beer, wine and mead only in a warm industrial space. The service was very accommodating, however not as knowledgeable as I had hoped, given the selection and the many questions several of us had as we tried mead for the first time. Prices seem to be a bit high considering we aren't in downtown, but it's a place we'll visit again."

                "description": "Hill Country Tasting Room is a wonderful find - I strongly recommend it! We rented out the entire venue for our rehearsal dinner, and it was absolutely perfect. We had ~50 people with an outside catered buffet dinner, and the venue was the perfect size - it still felt intimate during the speeches, but there was enough room for everyone to sit, eat, and mingle. The layout worked really well for us - for dinner, people could sit and eat on both the ground floor and mezzanine, and for speeches people mingled on the ground floor while the speeches were held on the landing. We love the atmosphere there - a combination of industrial, rustic, and chic that totally matched the vibe we were going for!  Planning was a breeze too - first Lindsey and then Deepa were both so accommodating and answered all our questions. Especially compared to some of the other venues I was talking to, Hill Country Tasting Room responded so quickly, kindly, and didn't mind when I asked a bunch of questions! I would definitely recommend them for hosting an event.  The drinks themselves were also amazing. We loved that it was all Texas beverages, and there were so many options! We were so glad to find a place that offered such a wide variety.  On the actual night of the rehearsal dinner, the bartenders were so helpful - I even got comments back from a couple of guests stating how nice they were! I can't wait until our next visit to the Dripping Springs area - we are definitely going back!"

The staff were very friendly and knowledgeable about the selections they were carrying and they were able to make great recommendations based on our tastes. They have reasonable prices, they were in line with the other tasting rooms we had visited during the day. Their concept was awesome! Their selection is from local craft breweries and wineries and rotates between different companies. They also had the beverages available to take home if you found one, or more, you enjoyed."

                "description": "Two friends and I went to Driftwood Tasting Room and asked to do a wine tasting. The only employee there, Antonio, said the tasting would be $8 for four tastings. The menu had a long list of beer, mead, and cider as well as wine. We asked if we could mix and match the tastings between these drinks, and the employee said yes. We then asked, several times, if this would still be $8 for the tasting. He again said yes. When we went to pay, we discovered that our bill came out to more than twice that amount. Apparently, the tasting was not $8. He told my friends that we received full pours, and that's why it was more. Here's the thing, WE DIDNT ASK FOR FULL POURS; we asked for a tasting. The employee took it upon himself to give us the full pours, which we did not ask for and shouldn't have had to pay for. We left upset and confused as to what happened. One of my friends went back into the establishment to discuss a refund. We didn't want to all three go in and cause a scene, since the man was kind to us, we just wanted to remedy the situation. Apparently, he reexplained the full pours THAT WE DIDNT ASK FOR and then offered my friend $10 out of his pocket. She felt guilty about this and didn't ask for compensation for the other two of us that did a tasting. I repeat, tasting and not full pour. I'm not sure why he would offer us his own money instead of trying to correct the problem initially. Maybe he knew he was wrong? Or maybe he just wanted us to go away and not complain? I really don't know why he would do that. We discussed it more and felt upset about the whole situation and how it was awkwardly handled. It was a damper on what was supposed to be a nice day out. I decided to contact management through the Driftwood Tasting Room's Facebook page the next day to see if we could be fully refunded for the employee's mistake. I explained everything to the manager, Lindsey Pierce, who, of course defended the employee. I understand this, and I have nothing against the employee, but a mistake was made and I wanted it corrected. I didn't mention the $10, since it went to my friend who spoke to the employee. Apparently, this gave the manager reason to believe that I was lying. She said that my friends could contact her for a refund and I could get one after I returned the $10 cash, which I didn't even get, but ok. I mentioned how she was treating me like I was lying and like I was a criminal for complaining about what happened. Lindsey Pierce then THREATENED to take me to SMALL CLAIMS COURT for SLANDER for writing this negative review. All I tried to do was express my dissatisfaction and try to get a refund, and the manager treated me so impolitely and with such disrespect. I would never want to go to a place where the management treats a customer so rudely. There are better places down the road where the servers charge you what you expect to be charged and the managers are polite and genuinely care about your experience at the winery. I'd avoid this place at all costs simply because of how the management treated me when I tried to explain what happened."

                "description": "This place is a hidden gem and definitely a much needed place for the growing area. It has huge potential and I hope they get enough business to stay in business! I live nearby and it's a nice place to grab a drink. Beautiful interior! The glasses of wine were a little pricey compared to the nearby vineyards but everything else seemed reasonable. The guy serving my friend and I was super friendly and helpful I hope they continue to have great service. The only things I would recommend would be to maybe add a couple TVs without sound on to keep some of the guys happy should there be UT games or golf on. The bar is a beautiful spot to hang out. I'd also recommend having some nice big glass jars with some pub mix or nuts in that folks could purchase by the scoop and maybe even a cheese/meat plate or some olives. It's a great hidden gem for us who live nearby to be able to have an upscale bar with great local beer and wines. And sometimes someone in a group doesn't want wine so it's nice to have the options! Something for everyone. Hopefully eventually a food truck or some dinner pairing event would be fun. I have seen some really cool events advertised on fb but haven't had a Chance to make it in to one yet. I will add as I have two kids I wouldn't recommend this a place for kids as there isn't really an outdoor space. A great date spot or place to meet friends for a small birthday. Bonus would be to add a happy hour or special pricing for driftwood locals!!"

                "description": "PRO: Good interior decoration.  CONS:  Poor management, poor service and communication, unpleasant noise from Air Conditioning.   We booked a Lucky Arrow cabin via Trip.com.  Shortly after the completion of payment, we received a confirmation email from Trip.com with a receipt attached.  \"Please show your confirmation number and PIN number to the reception.\" \" Check-in after 16:00.\"  \" 2- person breakfast included.\" We later found out that none of this information was correct.   (1) When we arrived at Lucky Arrow Retreat around 7pm, there was no reception to be found and we were trapped outside a closed gate. We tried the PIN number from the email, it turned out to be incorrect. I called Lucky Arrow a total of 8 times and sent a message to an \"assistance number\" printed on the lock of the gate. No one answered the phone. We were stuck outside the gate for 20 minutes and very frustrated. While we waited, there was no reply back from Lucky Arrow. We almost drove to Austin to find somewhere else to stay. We eventually got a text message back asking our names and gave us the instruction of how to unlock the main gate and our reserved cabin.    After we got past the main gate, we found there was literally nobody managing the property. We did not feel safe staying here due to the lack of any assistance from them if there is any emergency going on during our stay.   (2) There was no breakfast despite what was advertised.   (3) The exit gate remained OPEN when we were leaving after self check-out. It appears that anyone can drive in from that exit gate which gives the guests no privacy and makes the place unsafe.   The Lucky Arrow Retreat needs a lot of improvement in communication, as we did not receive any information regarding the check-in procedure and it was difficult to contact any staff during our stay."

                "description": "I had a lovely few nights stay at Lucky Arrow. We traveled with friends - 3 other couples and their kids - and stayed in a cluster of four cabins. It was the perfect pandemic vacation: we were able to socialize with our friends and still have our own spaces, without being indoors together. I don't think I'd have enjoyed it as much with strangers staying in the cabin cluster with me, especially since each pair of cabins shares a hot tub (which was delightful to relax in!) and all four cabins share a fire pit.  The rooms were clean and modern looking, the beds comfortable, and the air conditioning great. They have basic toiletries and good towels. There's very weak and unreliable wifi at the cabins; I recommend you come here to disconnect. I had good cell phone service with Verizon. The cabins have mini fridges but no kitchens; if you want to cook, you'll have to grill outside. Bring your own charcoal and lighter fluid!  For shared amenities, there's a lovely outdoor pool, and a big space with a large fire pit, grills, and picnic area with tables and swings (and some covered seating if you need shade). The pool has a 1-foot area with lounge seats, and lots of nice floats. We visited during the week, and it wasn't very busy; our group spent a lot of time at the pool and were often there by ourselves. There's a small walking trail, too.  It is quite pricey; I don't normally spend this much on a hotel. I'm not sure if I'd stay again if I weren't going on a group trip (with pandemic friendly housing.) If you're going with a group, call and see if they'll give you group pricing.  Warning for those who are planning to spend most of their time in Dripping Springs drinking: if you visit on a Monday - Tuesday, as I did, most of the wineries and breweries (including Bell Springs, which is attached to the resort) are closed."

                "description": "Very little privacy and poor management. Had a grounds keeper hop, that's right hop, on to our patio while my wife and I were changing. Wife was and is still pretty traumatized.  Took us forever to find management to let them know we are out and they told us they would pay for our room at the holiday inn. They did not.  Recommendation to LAR:  If you are going to run a wedding at your retreat, maybe consider additional help managing the facility. Only having 1 worker who is trying to run a wedding at your grounds isn't going to cut it.  * to managements response:  You want me to call you again? I'm sorry, but your response to my review makes it sound like this is the first you have heard about this incident. Is this correct? If so, this is disappointing because that tells me you have not taken steps forward to improve."

                "description": "Came here for a mid-week staycation. We had the place almost all to ourselves since it was mid-week in September. The weather was amazing! We rented one of the breezeway cabins with views+hot tub+fire pit. There was firewood at the cabin when we checked in. We had a fire and hung out in the hot tub to look at the night sky both nights. It was so quiet and relaxing, exactly what we were looking for. The breezeway cabins are beautiful and fun! The pillows, sheets, and bedding were comfy. The breezeway two-seater swing was cute to sit in while sipping coffee. It would be nice if the room with the couch and wet bar also had soap and a couple dish towels by the sink."

                "description": "I just stayed for an incredible weekend at Lucky Arrow.  Not only was the resort gorgeous, it was super clean and the staff was incredibly friendly.  This was the perfect place to unwind and still feel safe during all this Covid madness.  The check in process was all online, so we didn't have to worry about social distancing.    The rooms were so adorable and you could tell they really put time into every single detail to make sure you have an amazing experience.  We were able to sit around the fire pit, have smores and enjoy the quiet starry night with no city noise or much light pollution.    The location was beyond perfect.  It's just far enough away from town that you feel like you are truly on vacation, but there was still an HEB and tons of food options within a few minutes drive.  The gated access to the winery next door was a wonderful perk.  Highly highly recommend staying here!"

Only complaints were that there was no map provided, nor customer service available, so we had to drive around and try to find outlet yurt at 10pm. Which was fine - we found it fairly quickly. Other complaint is that it looks like the person cleaning might of got distracted and left the room, without putting the ac back together or bringing her cleaning towel. Also not a huge issue. Will definitely be back!"

A pool, beer garden, campfires conversations with s'mores, and even a complimentary wine tasting at the Bell Springs Winery located right next door.

                "description": "Lovely glamping space close to the Hill Country and within an hour of Austin, but ludicrous pricing policies will prevent a repeat visit. This spartan campsite with tiny houses and yurts (with a bathroom space shared with pool guests) offers a close to the city getaway with minimal amenities. But with a per pet fee of $150 PER ANIMAL plus a nightly fee, they don't seem to understand how out of touch they are with pricing policies of similar establishments. With two dogs under 20lbs, you're looking at $350 just in pet fees prior to any rental rates for just two nights, and therefore Lucky Arrow won't be getting any repeat visits from us."

                "description": "There are few things more excellent than Texas Spring, and we were delighted to spend a weekend of the best time of year out in the hill country at Lucky Arrow during their opening weekend.  There is a central event space and bar / pool area at the top of the hill with yurts as well as more conventional accommodation tucked into the trees below. We stayed in a 'courtyard cabin' one of four arranged around a fire pit with a hot tub. Which was bright and airy with the squishiest mattress, soft sheets and plenty of space to set up our travel crib for our three month old son (they also have them there if you're coming from further afield and need to borrow one)  We spent the weekend listening to live music and sipping cocktails by the pool, wandering the shady trails, admiring the view and toasting s'mores on the fire pit.   Close enough to Dripping Springs if you want supper /HEB - but far enough out that the stars are super bright and the night is gloriously quiet. They're well-behaved dog friendly, so we'll be back with our (only moderately well behaved) hound. And for a yurt, I only peeked my head inside one but I'm desperate to stay in one soon!"

My husband loves the beers and gets excited to try each seasonal release. I am not a big drinker but honestly just go for the atmosphere- super relaxed, nice spot in nature, our kids ages 3 and 6 beg to go bc they have a fun area to run around and gravel with construction toys to play with. We usually order a few appetizers and sit under the trees or an hr watching the kids tire themselves out."

I had a chocolate chip cookie which was fresh and not too sweet!  The nachos had fresh chopped beef--similar texture to brisket or pastrami. Liquid nacho cheese is very warm.   None of the food was exceptional, but down home good.   Great place for a lazy weekend afternoon!"

                "description": "As good as it gets!! I have always loved their farmhouse ales (Ona is probably my favorite dark saison in existence but I'm also so happy about their lager program starting up.   It's great to have refreshing approachable pilsners for people that aren't quite ready to walk on the (beer) wild side. If you're ready to go a little wild I definitely suggest their cave aged beer (the premiere has a little funkyness but it's not too crazy, like overripefruit and sourdough bread) we loved it and it feels really fun to pop a cork out in the texas sunshine.   You can always count on Roughhouse to make something creative and unique and if you come to the taps with an open mind you definitely won't be disappointed. They have beers to go in bottles and cans too which is lucky bc some of the high abv ones are really the best (but I can't have them before driving, ha!!)   Great food for snacking, we got a bbq sandwich and really liked the bbq sauce, we ended up getting extra so we could dip our chips in it lol  The setting is hard to beat, plenty of shade outside with abundant picnic tables, plus there is an air conditioned loft if you just can't handle the heat!"

I love the shaded outdoor picnic tables, and there is even a fire pit for s'mores ($3 to buy the kit)! The beer is delicious and fresh and they have a menu of farm to table foods. My husband and I tried the salsa (made from the goodies in their on-site garden) and it is the best I've had with the right amount of heat. We were able to buy a quart of it to take home- yummy!  This is definitely a great place to hangout with the pups and to get some fresh, countryside air while enjoying an acoustic band and some fresh beer served by the friendliest people."

Admittedly, my hop-soaked beer taste buds may not be par with a more astute beer connoisseur, but bad beer is bad beer. Tis a shame: this place is a true retreat. The Austin-indie-jazz duo provided an eclectic sound which paired perfectly with this serene outdoor haven.   Their flight card/cart is cool...it's dog friendly....there's a cactus.  The point is, what can you do when the beer's bad but move on and find another place.   I'm also slightly irked when businesses refuse legal tender."

                "description": "A group of us drove in to get some beers on a hot early evening/late afternoon after shopping at San Marcos Outlets. And if you're debating whether or not to make that drive--do it. You're welcome.  Roughhouse has THE space, service-oriented people backing it up AND...(the most important part for all of us beer nerds) a delicious lineup of their own beers. We drove in and were surprised to find that it was tucked in at the end of this residential street. There is plenty of space here though--it gave us Jester King and TX Keeper Cider vibes with the \"outback\" far out drive that make you feel like you've escaped the busy city/town life. Parking is abundant in the gravel area, and from the moment you arrive you know it's going to be a wholesome good time.  We could hear the live band out there that day, and we saw people with their dogs and kids. So awesome when breweries allow all people and furry friends! There's a kitsch pickup truck out front and a huge wooden cottage-like space that is the microbrewery. The interior feels much more quaint and modern, so get out your hipster glasses and handkerchiefs, millenials! I enjoyed my flight of beers for $12. My favorite beers were Treeform IPA and Floral Print. I ended up taking a Treeform home, and the label is so tastefully done with an earthy and spritely flavor.   We also ordered burgers (that come with mac and cheese! SO ooey gooey), and I gotta say their black bean veggie burger was not bad. I'm critical of veggie burgers because most people just slap it on the grill and that's it...or they just give you a thick piece of Portobello between two slices of bread. Not at Roughhouse! We also enjoyed a game of cornhole and can confirm they also have large Jenga. They have clean restrooms and serve-yourself water. Wifi is strong and it's a guaranteed a good time. Will definitely be back. Can't wait to see them grow and expand in the community."

                "description": "Roughhouse Brewing is the cutest husband and wife brewing company in Texas!   If you're in the San Marcos area, this is a great place to spend the day drinking some delicious farm-style beer, wine and ciders in an absolutely gorgeous wooden barn.   The building alone is worth the drive, but the Treeform IPA is what kept me smiling ear to ear! One of the best IPAs I've ever had.   Our Saturday trip included some really nice tunes by a local acoustic guitar player on the stage in the backyard. We had a very large group in town for a funeral, and there was plenty of seating outside for us all and the staff was incredibly accommodating, offering everyone samples since we were all first timers.   We don't make it out to San Marcos often, but this will definitely be a place we visit every chance we can. Great job! We wish you nothing but the best!!"

                "description": "We had rented a little house at the Lighthouse Hill Ranch which is part of the property so decided to check out the Arc near sunset.   The building itself IMHO is an odd shape but the views are amazing. The staff were super friendly and knowledgeable. We took the elevator to the roof and we're not disappointed. The views on both sides were spectacular.   We went back down and grabbed a glass of wine and found a nice quiet spot on the bottom floor overlooking the ranch property and the pool area. (See pics)  My friend loved her wine so much she grabbed a bottle on the way out. I can't remember the name but I do know it was a white wine and it was from Slovakia. Who knew right?    Next time you are on 281 and you see the oddly shaped building on the hill, go grab a glass or a bottle and enjoy the view!"

Even though this is out near the Texas Wine Country, they carry non-Texas wine, beer and bubbles.   Their are two patio areas- one on the first level and one a few floors up on the roof. In between the first and top floors are small rooms you can rent. The pool access is a perk for staying there."

Most of the time, spontaneous stops are the best, and this was no exception. The views really are fabulous and there is plenty of lovely seating outside to see all around in every direction. They have a great selection of different wines as well as cute cheese/meat platters to snack on. It's a fun and different stop to make while you're on a wine trip."

                "description": "I'm definitely not a wine guy, but this is still an awesome place to visit. The views of the Texas hill country are amazing!  The place is perched on top of a hill, so even the terrace on the ground floor has amazing views.  After you order your wine, head on up to the fourth-floor terrace for even more astounding views of this beautiful ranch.  As someone else pointed out, it's a wine bar; they do not make their own wine here.  But don't let that stop you from paying them a visit. I counted 29 varieties of wine on their list.  Choices from Argentina, Spain, California, Sicily, France, South Africa, Oregon, and of course, good ol' Texas wine (and many more states and countries that I haven't listed).  You can order a glass of wine, a full bottle of wine, or do what I did. You can go for the \"Wine Tasting\" for $14.95.  You get your choice of five different wines (one-ounce pours).  I'm new to the wine scene, so I was expecting to pick all five choices up front and have them served like a beer flight. Evidently, that's not the case with wine tastings.  You make your first choice and the one-ounce pour is served in a regular sized wine glass.  Then, you return to the bar for each choice after that. The only thing I didn't dig, is that they didn't rinse the glass when you returned for your next choice.  So, if you had a red wine, and then returned for a white wine, a little of it was mixed in with the other. Again, I don't profess to be a wine dude, but this doesn't seem right to me, if you are trying to get the true flavor of each wine.  I didn't stay here overnight; I just did a day trip.  But they have several suites you can stay in, and five or six houses on the sprawling ranch that you can vacation in.  I spoke to one of the guests who was staying in one of the suites, and he said it was \"absolutely awesome\"!"

Hideous building though, right? Like, you have all that money to build a hotel and you pick an architect that delivers the ugliest design? I don't get it.

                "description": "On our way today to Willow City Loop to see the bluebonnets, we passed by some beautiful wildflowers right by Arc de Texas. The winery piqued my interest but I was really hoping to see more flowers as we went up the way.  Seeing the sign for chocolate made me stop in to see what was waiting for me. There were multiple flavors with pecan in the name. Each truffle is $2.95 and individually packaged. I chose 2 of each - Pecan Rum, Pecan Toffee, and Peach Bourbon. The truffle tasted great but not with a hint of pecan taste or crunch though. I could taste the bourbon but not the peach.   Maybe the next time we could enjoy some of the wine on the rooftop terrace for sunset."

                "description": "We stayed in the King Louis IX Suite with two other couples for two nights. It absolutely blew our expectations! This suite is the penthouse and while the rooftop is available to all guests during the day, from 10pm-8am it's for penthouse guests only. Needless to say it was so much fun.   During the day we hung out and explored the property and the gorgeous surrounding areas and we made use of the hot tub one night and the fire pit for s'mores. It was really just an excellent and amazing weekend. Johnson city is super close and we had dinner in town one night which was delightful.   The views were BREATHTAKING and if you want to see stars, the rooftop is THE place to see them!"

How about seeing an awesome arc backdropped to a beautiful Texas prairie.  Well then you've found the place! Really I can't say anything bad about this place, great service with awesome views.

                "description": "This is a very pretty location and the woman working was super friendly. There were plenty of places to sit and enjoy some wine. The view from the roof is very pretty and definitely worth a visit just for that. The wine prices seemed reasonable to me, with a lot of options in the $40 range.  Due to COVID they will only do bottles, not just a glass which is no problem at all, except that's where my negative part starts. I asked for a chilled red (don't judge me, it's 105F right now) which they didn't have. I rarely drink white so my partner and I finally agreed on a dry rose. There are two on the menu, one sparkling and one non. I wanted the non-sparkling but before I could say anything the lady said \"oh, we're out of the sparkling rose, have the cava instead\" and popped it open. So, we wound up with cava. OK, I kind like that but it was two levels away from what we asked for.  I realize that sounds slightly petty so the other issue is that we asked for a tempranillo to go. When we got home we realized it was a rioja, and not very good. We didn't get either of the wines we wanted.  I'd be a lot more willing to give a better review if the place had not been literally deserted when we arrived. There was no one there but us so I don't see much reason why the wines got that messed up. I wish we had been asked about the cava before she opened the bottle."

                "description": "We have driven past it many times and always said we should stop.  We finally did.  I was pleasantly surprised.  What I thought would be a road side tourist trap was an exceptionally good road side tourist trap.  We met a couple at the wine tasting room who had the same story - they finally decided to stop.  The bartender / sommelier was a very pleasant fellow.  He offered good advice on the wines as well as things to do in the surrounding area.  Although we arrived too late for the tasting (630pm on a Monday), we were able to indulge in a glass of vino.  The wine tasting room screamed of fine Tuscan influence.  The wood was solid.  There was a majestic painting in the room to give it an elegant and distinguished feel.  The commode was fit for a king or queen (unisex bathroom).   After we obtained our glass of wine, we went to the observation deck.  We had 360 degree views of well, I am not exactly sure.   Just rolling hills.  It is hill country after all.  I am sure it would be a great place to watch the sunset, but it was quite cloudy on our visit.   I give this roadside attraction two thumbs up.  It is well done and great place to stop for a glass of wine."

                "description": "My first and only visit.  I would have left a ZERO rating if that was an option.  1. We walked up to the bar and the lady behind the bar (late 40's to early 50's with glasses) was not friendly at all.  She did not greet us nor did she ask if this was our first time nor did she let us know if  she would be the one to serve us. Very poor demeanor.  However we let that pass and still decided to give the place a try.  2. While sitting at the bar area we noticed a stale cigarettes and ashtray odor, coming from behind the bar.  Just nasty , not sure if it was the bar area, bartender or trash.  3. We asked for the choice of five wines taster and how that was served The lady behind the bar answered the question by saying we can't use 5 glasses because we don't have enough to serve you all 5 tasting glasses at once.  Never really answered the question we asked. However we did note that the wine glass area had a huge selection of clean glasses. I guess she has an aversion to washing wine glasses [ see #4] .   4. We ordered our 5 tasters. They give you 1 glass of wine  and 4 'poker' chips.  When you order the next sample they take your dirty glass and 1 poker chip and then pour your next sample into the dirty glass. One would think to RINSE OUT THE WINE GLASS  so as to have a fresh CLEAN glass for the next sample.  The lady NEVER  cleaned the glasses after we tried each wine, even after we pointed this out.  5. The worst part about this visit was that the lady [older lady, a younger one showed up to help ]  was eating cheese and crackers while she was working behind the bar , and talking with her mouth full and food was falling out of her mouth while serving people. ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING.  6. The area behind the bar was filthy , boxes on top of the counter close to the bar top where customers sit,  the bar top was sticky, not once did we see the bartender wash her hands between serving customers or between eating her food and serving customers.  YOU SHOULD LEARN PROPER HYGEINE TECHNIQUES.   We had a our taster and left.   We wont be back and we will make sure to tell everyone we know to avoid this business and find a place further down the road.  There are MANY other wine tasting rooms, wineries and more that have clean facilities , better hygiene and friendly staff."

They are open until 7pm every night which is later than any of the other local wineries. Arc De Texas doesn't make their own wine but rather sells wine from all over the world. My favorite is the Insurrection red wine. Grab a glass or better yet a bottle and head to the roof to check out the views!"

                "description": "We had heard that there were new brewery tap rooms in Johnson City and decided to drive over and check it out. It was empty except for the owner so we sat and ordered a flight. The beers weren't extraordinary but pretty good. We missed out on the food, he said the kitchen was closed. The art gallery part was really cool.  One of the things that put me off was even though the hours were 11-9 pm the owner was cleaning and turning things off while we were there at 5:00 pm and I felt a big \"go away\" vibe. Not a nice feeling when trying to relax on a Sunday afternoon. Probably wouldn't go out of my way to return."

                "description": "Man, if you have not tried this place, you are missing out! We were here a couple years ago and it was strictly a brewery.  Outstanding beer and great people. In case you have missed it, RER now has food...and DAMN! I got the pulled pork Cubano and my wife got the Hawaiian Pulled Pork. Her sandwich was really, really good.  She even said once it was gone, \"I miss it already.\" My Cubano was a brilliant twist on a traditional Cuban, with the traditional ingredients, including pickle, ham, and mustard.  The addition of their house smoke pulled pork sent it into the next level. The beer here has been excellent from day one, but with the addition of a killer menu, this is now a one-stop shop that really needs to be on your list.  Summing up, phenomenal beers, next level sammys, and really great people.  Why more does one need?"

                "description": "Looks inviting from the road...where only locals are welcome! Our bartender Audrey had no personality and could care less, unless you were a local. She had no problem being friendly and clearing the table and asking if you wanted a drink only if you were a local. Be prepared to stop for something else to  eat, nothing spectacular and you leave feeling as if you made a serious mistake stopping in! Seriously, spinach, with 4 mediocre slices of thin out of a freezer bag chicken slivers, a dash of cheese and pico and onions and quac on one tortilla chip for a salad. Not sure how this is called a fajita salad?  So, two salads (on a paper plate and plastic fork) and a couple beers  for $40.00 plus a tip!  We stop in Johnson City at least two to three times a month on our way back from business trips. I recommend going to some of the  other locations across the street! They have wonderful Texas friendly service, nice portions of good tasty food and beer plus food is served on an actual plate! I don't like to leave bad reviews, but the service industry is tough these days and you need to have a good food service and selection and treat your patrons well so they come back!  Being as good if not better than your competition is a must! So, if you just want a brew and nothing more then stop by."

                "description": "Cozy place to enjoy some locally brewed beer.  Tim, the owner and brewmaster, is happy to tell you about his craft beers, including the Norwegian yeasts he selected for their compatibility with brewing in hot Texas weather.  To keep startup costs down, he did almost all of the construction himself - check out my picture of the beer flight holders he made from lumber.  Speaking of flights, I decided to try all 7 of the beers on tap. My favorites were the hazy IPA and both of the stouts.  All of the selections were solid.  I didn't see any food on the menu.  The interior space features an L-shaped bar good for socializing, a comfy love seat, a mini pool table, and whimsical touches such as a guitar sitting in a stand, ready for someone to pick up and play.  If hanging out indoors isn't your thing, there are a few outdoor tables under a ginormous oak branch.  While I also love the brewery around the corner, I plan on working Reck 'Em Right into my rotation!"

The only issue we ran into was that we ordered hummus, and the person taking our order didn't let us know that it didn't come with bread or anything else to eat it with. Considering we had just had a conversation with her about it being our first time there, we're about to present she didn't let us know that important bit of info. Not a big deal, and the person who brought us our food outside asked if we had ordered anything to eat it with and quickly brought us an order of a baguette.  Aside from the establishment itself, the vendors selling goods were all friendly and talented, and the other patrons of the establishment were friendly as well. We struck up several conversations with passers-by.  I would definitely go back!"

The guy who was pouring our flights was super nice, we were excited at first to have finally checked this place off the bucket list. However, the ciders weren't that great unfortunately...we would've kept on drinking anyway, just probably ordering the other cider/wine/beer that they stock, not make. We were there on a very dead weeknight- only 3 other people were there, so you'd think they'd welcome more business- but we had to leave because we were told that we couldn't eat the tacos we got from a nearby food truck...if they sold food, I'd understand, and we would've ordered dinner there...but all they sell is super overpriced make it yourself charcuterie items (a whole block of cheese, a whole baguette, etc). The way we were told that we couldn't eat our tacos rubbed me the wrong way and the vibe was just sadly killed, so yeah, we won't be back :/"

It is a little hard to find and the road is a little rough in their lot. The place was completely empty when we were there. The ciders were all just okay and some were super sour and not great at all. The bartender was the best part of the experience. He was super knowledgeable and so friendly. Probably the biggest downfall and what would definitely bump them to at least a 4 star is their lack of food. There are no food trucks on site, they only sell outrageously priced charcuterie boards, and we found out the hard way, don't allow outside food. We were told after we got food brought to us that it was not allowed. We would have stayed and continue buying product had they allowed us to eat. Rather we sat in their parking lot and ate on our talegates. This place is so out in the middle of nowhere you would think that they would have better food options. They also were not very nice when delivering the news. Needless to say we won't be back."

And the great ciders they serve up certainly do not hurt the wallet or the ambience.  It's so relaxing sitting at the picnic tables out among the oaks listening to your favorite band. Strategically placed fans hidden among the trees aid in making the glade that doubles as a stage tolerable even on 90º days.  In these seemingly never-ending days of the pandemic, it's also refreshing to see the servers masking up indoors and out. I tend not to venture out too much for exactly that reason, but felt totally safe here even when ordering inside the tap room.  Maybe I should keep it a secret, but it's also one of those places you want to share exactly because it is so very special."

They often have wonderful live music and their drinks are absolutely perfect for a Texas summer. They are so refreshing. We got one of the picnic baskets and it was full of yummy cheese, sliced meats and bread. Highly recommend!  It is worth noting, they do not have a full lunch/dinner menu. They basically have an assortment of DIY charcuterie boards, which we really enjoyed. However, if you go expecting a full dinner you may be disappointed."

They have a layout showing how sweet items are and let you sample, so you pick the right one!  Parking is massive and close to the large lot that houses bee keeper."

                "description": "My new favorite place in Austin. Love everything about it.  It's basically the only Place I ever want to be. If you haven't been yet- get on the ball!  The cider is so delicious - nothing is overly sweet and they have a good assortment of dry and well-balanced choices. Their sampler is 9$ for 5 generous pours and is a great way to find the cider you like most. For us it's the rose, but the original is a close second. Your best bet is to purchase a bottle and drink affordably. You even get a discount when you purchase bottles to go (although I'm not sure if that's just at the end of the night - we've closed this place down a few times).   We are also big fans of the food. The carrots in a blanket are so yummy and very unique! A must-have. The curried egg salad is a go-to as well. It's made with eggs from their own chickens! They also add pickled veggies on the side which is always a win for me.   The location is so spacious and beautiful. Plenary of tables inside and out. Even a great view from one side where you can watch the sunset over the trees. I've enjoyed live music there and loved the tunes they were playing inside."

                "description": "The ciders are essentially tribute to the apple gods, extremely generously priced, and the cidery is tucked away--makes for a great escape from the city of Austin!  Came on a rainy day with some girlfriends after dinner, and we LOVED it. It reminded me of Jester King Brewery because of the fact that it felt very off-road and secluded. If you're driving at night and a little too fast you might miss the entrance, so slow down as your GPS tells you you're near. The stone cobble walkway is so organic and lovely, that it felt like we were entering into a storytale cottage. Upon entering, everything screams wood and warm pinterest vibes. The three of us sat down at their tall barstool table, and started on our flight! What prices! Normally they do 5 for $9, but they tapped out of one of the selections so we did 4 for $7! Such a great price for the variety of ciders. I loved their hefeweizen + cider combo, and the first cider on their flight list (a name I forgot). Everything was so juicy and tasty, would highly recommend coming back.   The staff is very knowledgeable, and the lady doing the taptending that night was so sweet and helpful. She trusted that we knew which selection we were on during our flight. She also told us that there are five cideries in all of Austin! So for my cider lovers--let's hit all of them up."

                "description": "I have been a long time fan of Texas Keeper Cider. I love the Tap Room, the grounds, the staff and especially the cider. The cider is dry and they make a wide variety of ciders to appeal to many palates.  They have successfully reopened the Tap Room and I decided to have my belated retirement party there. I was able to reserve a space for my large group and the staff was very attentive. If I had one criticism, it would be their food choices.  It's now a make your own picnic, and you choose cheeses, meats, and sides. It's not really a charcuterie tray, as they don't prep the plate.  The cheeses,  meats and bread all need to be sliced.  This made eating difficult with a large group. Most of my guests had to leave early so they could go eat somewhere else.  I know this new menu makes it easier for the staff, and they are a cidery, not a restaurant, but I miss their old menu.  I will still go to Texas Keeper Cider, but may not hang out as long.  (Or make sure I eat beforehand!) Overall, it's a beautiful South Austin gem."

                "description": "I don't know why it took me so long to get here but now that I've been, I'll be telling everyone about it and making return trips! If you're a fan of Argus Cidery, you'll like this place. I do think Texas Cider Keeper is making cleaner ciders than Argus (nothing was infected or had off-flavors).   It's easy to miss the entrance, but it's right next to the cemetery! The outdoor space is very quaint but all Texas and has tons of picnic tables. The tasting room is beautiful with butcher block tables and plenty of seating.   We opted for the tasting flight menu which is five 2 oz. pours for $9. Their mainstay Texas Keeper Cider No.1 is dry, refreshing and well balanced. I'm not a fan of sweet ciders, so this was perfect.  I also really liked their Grafter Rose -- which is made with Rome apples and some grapes, which gives it the beautiful rose hue. It's also on the drier side, which is nice.   Our least fave of the five had to be the Cider Weizen, which had a bit too much coriander (and this is coming from a girl who LOVES coriander and hefeweizen beers).   The bartenders were all knowledgeable and really try to give you an explanation of each cider they're pouring (a la a wine tasting).   They also have a tempranillo wine on tap because in Texas it all falls under a \"fruit fermentation\" permit. Apples, wines, it's all the same permit.   I'll be making it a point to come here more often, and I would if traffic getting through downtown and south Austin traffic weren't so bad."

                "description": "One year later I returned for their 1st Anniversary Party and release of The Grafter Blanc.  For $9.50 (w/fees) your ticket included your admission and 10 oz tulip glass (not the standard 12 oz tulip most breweries sell for $5-6). There were no drink tickets included; all cider and other offerings were for purchase only.  Certainly not the best deal in town....a town full of breweries with taproom festivities.  The Grafter Blanc is definitely my favorite of their ciders, with the perfect balance of acidity, tartness and dryness."

                "description": "Wow! So before coming here I always assumed ciders as overly sweet and flavored froo-froo drinks for those who don't like beer. I have never felt so mislead before! Cider is made from apples (no matter what the flavor), and real, legit cider is found here! It isn't overly sweet and there are many different kinds! Some reminded me of wine and a not-so-Sweet cider mixed together.  At Texas Keep there is room to bring a large group, or even the dogs or kids to run around. There is a small indoor area with games and a huge outdoor area with room to move about and enjoy the Texas sun (or stars).  The people here really enjoy and are PROUD of what they do. They are excited to tell you the story behind the names of the ciders and what they entail. They have seasonals and guest bottles and taps. Normally I would feel gross trying something out of a bottle opposed to tap, but the whole experience was so eye-opening, I didn't care. They told me their 1 bottle of (maybe a 750ml cider) has about 10mg of sugar in it as opposed to he \"cider\" I knew such as Angry Orchard that has upwards of 50mg PER BOTTLE! Yowza- no wonder they were too sweet!  I was definitely iffy about coming here since they didn't serve \"regular beer\", but I'm definitely glad I stepped out of my comfort zone- and you should, too!  Only reason it's not 5 stars- the food \"truck\" setup (not a truck just a station) was out of food by 6:30p on a Saturday night. We had ordered 1 of the 4 items on the menu for our group to try. When we went back to order our favorites, they claimed they were out of everything and turned around and took 1 more order. Annoying. So we ordered a pizza and left early to meet the delivery man at home. Maybe have more food or more options and we would've stayed until the 9p close."

We've been here during all seasons of the year and the property is always gorgeous and inviting. Staff is so knowledgeable and helpful. The kitchen is Now built in to the main tasting room. The fresh house made popcorn is absolutely awesome. This is a family friendly establishment as well and very nice of them to accommodate young children in a pretty adult setting! We are very thankful and grateful and it certainly keeps us as loyal customers."

We brought our dog too but he could not go inside which was challenging even for ordering. Our favorite cider is the No. 1! There was an event going on that sounded fun so we will definitely check out those options. We did not order food, just did a shared tasting. No one came outside to check on us or offer to pour and tell us about the cider which is common when visiting wineries with our dog and friends. It's a cute little spot for a weekend drive."

They had live music on Saturday when we ran into this cute spot.  We ordered a flight of cider and had some garlic kettle corn, but regretted not getting the cheese plate because it would have been perfect with the acidity of the cider.  Zach, who served us, made our experience more memorable.  Definitely a spot to visit when in Austin."

You can hang out and play bird games or sit outside on picnic tables. The food is not quite  awesome yet, but decent if you want tot munch along with your cider. The ciders are dry dry dry and not gross apple soda tasting like Eastciders (barf). \"Stillage\" is amazing."

I love Hefeweizen and have drank my fair share while stationed in Germany for four years as well as here in the USA. This was the worst glass of Hefeweizen that I've ever had. It was very disappointing, tasted watered down, and had very little flavor. The Live Oak Brewing Company Hefeweizen is much better, and it's the best I've had in the Austin area. Other than that, the place was clean and the staff was friendly. Again, this review is solely based on their Cedrela Hefeweizen."

Only reason for the 4 starts is today we came for what had to be the 6th or 7th  time and got kicked to the outside patio for having a dog. This is ALWAYS the brewery I go to when it's hot because they allowed dogs inside. I've had every other bartender let my dog in, love on him and have had zero problem sitting inside with him. Even their Facebook has a picture of a dog inside. Today we were told that was never allowed and should have been told to go outside. We have also seen many other dogs inside during past visits. I hate inconsistent rules. Also, super sad that we'll have to find a new brewery this summer. It's too hot to be outside and my dogs nickname is the the brewery dog.  I'll still support them during cooler months-- but dog owners should know the rules have changed. Very sad. Wish they would have posted something about this change."

                "description": "It's been a hot minute since I visited Whitestone- I think the last time I was here was in 2016, when it was quieter and a lot more laid back.  Fast forward to 2021 - the city of cedar park and Leander are booming.  There is a huge influx of population. The tables at Whitestone are full, there is a food truck (which is awesome) as a permanent fixture BUT the overall customer experience has left me disappointed.  Maybe because it's a Sunday with lovely weather, the guy behind the bar is done with people, or, he isn't a people person , or, he just didn't like the way I looked? But man was it hard to get him to give me an effing beer without getting hateful glances. Yeesh. Im kinda scared of coming back here now!  That aside, im not really a fan of their beer selection either - the kolsch is OK but I've had better. I guess the biggest advantage is the proximity to both CP and Leander and for the people who live around here.  So, this isn't much of a review rather than a semi rant ?   Also guys- kids have a tendency to move around from one side of the table to the other. They're not capable of sitting still and neither are you. If you'd rather than families stay away, just tell us to our faces."

They had a Food truck hanging outside so if you wanted to partake that was great.   Suggestions- In the guys bathroom the keg should be a little bit higher. Pretty tough for tall guys lol.

I tried their special beer release, Mikalla Mist, and it was a beautiful, bright, crisp Pilsner! I also had their Belgian style Gold Fist. It was nice and hoppy and perfectly sour. My final beer was a stout and it was something about the Simpsons. It was also really good.  Great place, awesome tacos, fantastic beer."

                "description": "Beer is great and reasonably-priced with good variety. The food truck out back is far better than it has any right to be, with delicious mexican food at a reasonable price.   I highly recommend the fish and barbacoa tacos, as well as the burrito+quesadilla. The chips/salsa aren't too shabby either.   Haven't tried the burgers so can't comment on those.   If you want an affordable spot to come eat, drink, and be merry in the Austin area, look no further!   Plenty of space to sit inside, or if the weather is nicer, even more space out back! You order everything at the bar, get your beer immediately, and pick up your food from the truck out back if you ordered that."

                "description": "Megaflora has reinvigorated my love for IPAs, which waned heavily after I hit the quarter century mark. I think it's the hazy kind, and they mix it up with melony goodness (love melons - all kinds of melons). Your palate ends up fielding a fruity punch; no getting your jaw kicked in by puckering hops. Great shit. They made it year round too, with the badass stylized can design and all (most of those ones are seasonal only).  With that being said, please offer La Verdad year round. Please  These dudes' merch game is on point, they really need to take their little stylized logo print for the cans and sell it on more apparel. Whoever does their art is a fucking genius. I love my Cold Glory shirt and my Megaflora mask. I love my Lazer Salad pint glass cup thing. They have a bunch of badass koozie designs. Basically, their merch game is next level already, but I see so much potential. I guess they are keeping their operation relatively small scale, and there are only so many ppl who are going to buy brewery merchandise in central Texas, but I dunno. Love the art.   At the end of the day, though, nobody is going to buy any merchandise if the beer sucks. Beerworks' beer does not suck. The new Eastern Philosophy beer they came out with is a great example of Austin Beerworks' beer not sucking. When I read it was a jasmine tea infused lager (I love jasmine tea) I had to check it out. Super solid, 7.5% but doesn't taste like it. You're supposed to drink it over ice. So novel, so well thought out, and so well executed. ABW's motto (I think) is \"Hellbent on Excellence\" and they are certainly living up to that standard. I'm so fortunate to live here in Austin with great breweries like ABW. I'll be even more fortunate when I can walk into HEB and buy La Verdad year round, but that'll come in time. Thanks, Austin Beerworks."

                "description": "I  came here the other day with a friend to have a chat and really get ready to center ourselves for the week ahead. I ordered a Lazer Salad which is a double IPA.   Here is the breakdown:   The beer appears as a golden amber color with a one finger head of white  foam. The aroma of the brew gives a tropical fruit vibe with hints of tangerine and mango mixed with some  undertones of a grapefruit hop and a little bit of pine. The taste begins with a tropical fruit sweetness mixed with a  doughy taste. As the taste lingers, more and more hop comes to the  tongue starting out with grapefruit followed by some flavors of an herbal and pine hop. The body of the brew is average in thickness and creaminess  with a carbonation level that is lighter. Overall this is a well-balanced fruity IPA that if you are not careful can put you on your ass!  #supportlocal"

I have enjoyed their Mexican style lager and other Pilsner style brews. They have some nice tropical IPA to satisfy even the most discerning of beer drinking palates. At least 8 tables outside that have shade, which provide a nice social gathering space to enjoy a sunny Austin afternoon with a beer and some fresh air as you contemplate the mysteries of the Universe. There is also a food truck that serves some decent fish tacos."

I had 2 of the cranberry frozen mimosas, which I could have sipped on all day. I was glad to see they offered other things besides just their beer. The space was perfect for our fundraiser. My kid enjoyed the play area with the hill/tunnel and there were plenty of other kids for her to play with. I'd definitely come back here to hang out with friends or family."

You could have been rigid about shooing us out the door on the dot, but your staff showed great generosity of spirit toward a grieving group, many of whom were in from out of state.

                "description": "I feel conflicted giving a fairly low rating given I consistently think of ABW as one of the top handful of breweries in Austin, but I'm giving this as a rating of the taproom experience moreso than a rating of their beers. I've also only gone during Covid, so I'm looking forward to giving them a try in the future when I can comfortably get the full experience.   Compared to other patios in the area I find theirs to be pretty lacking. There were no fans in the summer and no heat lamps in the winter. Their space isn't particularly large so there are fewer tables than other locations. This leads it to be uncomfortably packed on weekends, both in terms of how close tables are and the lack of distancing enforced in lines.   One weird thing working against them is just how available their beer is around town. Every HEB and bar will have at least a couple of ABW's beers available, so they lose out on the necessity of going to the taproom to try their beers. Even their seasonals get around town pretty well both in stores and on tap elsewhere.   On that note, and to not make this review totally negative, their beer is absolutely phenomenal. All their flagships are good to great examples of the style, my personal favorites are the Sun Shovel (think blue moon but with some hop prescence) and Fire Eagle (leans more towards West Coast IPA, but has enough juiciness to be really refreshing in the summer time).   Their seasonals also absolutely knock it out of the park. Sputnik (Coffee Oatmeal Stout) is an absolute must if you're in Austin in December and is probably the best beer I've had since moving here. The Heisenberg (a combination of a Pilsner and Hef) and Black Thunder (Black Lager) are two other stand outs to me.  The food truck is good enough that if you need something to snack on while you're there you won't be totally dissatisfied, but I've usually felt compelled to go elsewhere for food.  Overall, can't recommend their beer enough, but you don't need to visit the taproom to get the full experience."

                "description": "After three months of sheltering at home, Austin Beer Works was a first outing.  They did an excellent job with social distancing, wiping down each table after guests left, and mask enforcement (when not seated at table) in a firm but polite way.    No inside seating right now and the outdoor tables are shaded and a good distance apart. It is reservations only. depending on the time you make the reservation for, you will either get an hour to enjoy your table or two hours.  They go over all the rules with you when you arrive.  They have some great beers, both on tap and in cans. You can purchase some to take home with you as well!  I ordered a sour raspberry-lemon Einhorn.  So summery and refreshing!  I ended up drinking two.  My husband had an Essential IPA and the Small Spoon session IPA.   We didn't care for the Heisenberg Heff-lager (a bit too banana-ish).  The only thing that would have made the difference from 4 stars to 5 would have been some kind of food! Even a bag of chips or pretzels to go with the beer would have been awesome! We saw a food truck parked there but unfortunately it was not open."

                "description": "The COVID precautions are great! Tables are spread out indoors as well as in outdoor seating. I was impressed with the table cards that help guest determine if tables are clean or in need of cleaning. Overall very clean space.   As it relates to the atmosphere, like mentioned kept very clean, and customer service is great. Service was great inside was helped decide what drinks to get and given samples of a few to help make decisions. Service was also great outside with the food truck.   For the quality and experience the price for everything was great! The beers taste amazing and the kombucha was fantastic. The burgers were very tasty. Best burgers I've had in a long time.   A sight you just see for yourself!"

                "description": "The bartender who waited on us was so so sweet and friendly. We felt very welcomed. We got a flight which I felt was very reasonably priced and tried 5 different beers. Now I'm no beer connoisseur by any means, so I won't even bother rating the beers. For someone who likes beer but doesn't necessarily like anything super strong or any craft beers for that matter, the amber we tried suited me perfectly. This is definitely a cool facility with the rooftop deck and plenty of seating. It just so happened to be FREEZING when we were enjoying our time on the roof. This was overall a great experience."

                "description": "Loved Middleton before COVID, managed to still support them during, and am delighted to be back now that we're on the road back. They spent the pandemic brewing up some tasty new beers to add to their already delicious standards, I think Good might have replaced Third Coast as my favorite while Evil has supplanted my husband's usual Juicy Visions. And have to give a shout-out to the edition of the Burger Truck--wonderful, especially the bacon/Brussels sprout combo (I know, sounds weird but so good!). We were so worried about our local hang-outs surviving the pandemic and couldn't be happier that Middleton not only survived but is coming back stronger than ever."

                "description": "I'm going to get this out of the way real quick.  There was a cat walking around on the bar.  Yes, you heard me.  ON THE BAR.  I knew it was a dog friendly place, but come on - a cat ON the bar?  It even walked over to my side of the bar, sat down, put its leg behind its head like cats do, and then proceeded to lick its butt in front of me.  Hey cat, I'm really impressed that you can do that, but you're not getting a tip from me.  The staff member that it belonged to shooed it away, but it stayed on the bar.  Subtract one star for this show.  Next up:  As I said, it's dog friendly.  VERY dog friendly.  There were two dogs belonging to customers roaming around freely inside the place.  A third dog was on a leash, but it kept barking at the other dogs.  This wasn't outside on the patio, this was all inside.  When I go somewhere to hang out and relax, I don't want to deal with barking dogs (in my book, it's akin to bringing screaming kids into a bar).  Subtract one star for letting the dogs inside.  Keep the cats and dogs *outside* and this would be a five star brewery to chillax at.    Beer:  They have a decent selection of brews and like most breweries, they have some permanent ones and some seasonals that rotate in and out.  They have five or six store bought wines available.  Staff:  VERY knowledgeable about their beer and can suggest something for you once you describe your taste palette to them.  Food:  The food truck out front is permanently hitched up here, the one in the back changes occasionally.    Plenty of seating inside and outside, there's even a spacious deck on the second floor.  Growler refills are $14 and crowlers are $9.40 (buy three crowlers and get 10 percent off).  If your selection is over 8 percent ABV, additional charges may apply.   One more note about the dogs and I'll put this puppy to bed.  There's a fenced off area downstairs to let your dogs run rampant in - put them in there instead of bringing them inside - or better yet, leave them at home.  This whole thing with people bringing their dogs everywhere is getting out of hand.    I was going to give them two solid stars, but now that I think about it, if they let cats run back and forth across their bars, how clean is their brewing process?  It's a cool place with good brews, and I want to like it, but when I think about the animals everywhere, I think twice about what might be in the beer."

The table next to us also had multiple issues with their orders that they were loudly complaining about. I asked for the loaded tots with no beef and he said he couldn't ring them up that way. We weren't asking for a discount, just remove the beef???? So then he said to get regular tots and add cheese and onions/jalapeños. What did we get? Plain tots. He was also so fricking unfriendly. The table next to us retired a burger that had the bun top black/burned, and apparently he complained about redoing it. Brewery needs to rethink this employee."

                "description": "Middleton is a must if you're stopping by or even in the general area.  We were driving from Wimberley (a fun day at Jacob's Well) towards the San Marcos outlets, and had to double back even to come to Middleton! We were so glad we did. My bf even walked out with their peach crowler...just a warning though, bring a cooler of some sort so it doesn't explode in your car with the heat! Totally speaking from personal experience, sadly.  We shared two rounds of tasters, which come with 5 different selections. So come with friends and try them all! You'll be surprised at how delicious they all are. Middleton is also HEAVEN for Belgian lovers. Good thing we love Belgians. Little did I know that a microbrew outside of Austin would be a great place for craft Belgians. I'm an all-around beer lover--everything except saisons, NE pale ales, and lagers, whereas the bf is a Belgian enthusiast. He always goes for Belgians. So you can imagine why we decided to get a taste of everything Belgian. I also enjoyed their Easy Ride PA, but was not a fan of the chile IPA (to each their own). It was almost impossible for me to compare and contrast the beer quality to the all-around atmosphere of the place. It oozes joy and love--they have brew dogs (and customers can bring doges too) who basically just lie around and nap, PLUS they have popcorn that is self-serve from those tiny machines that you see in Disneyland and other carnival events.  Will definitely be back to Middleton. Clean restrooms, and large space indoors for bigger groups (WITH TV's!) and cool fun outdoors games like human jenga outside. There is plenty of parking in their private loose, gravel parking area, and they had a food truck parked right outside. Awesome spot, great beer, fantastic space!"

I will confess I am not a huge beer lover but my friends are and were raving about this place so we  stopped by to watch the Euro Cup game between Germany and Italy.  The brewery is well design with great bar space and patio area. Dogs are welcome so bring your pup, children not so much ;-).   Step up to the bar and build your own beer flight you get five picks of 2-3 ounces each for $12. There wasn't a beer I didn't like! From the Porter to the American Red there were all good!   Live band was great and the two flat screens more than met our soccer watching needs.  So if your looking for a place to get your hops fix in the Texas Hill Country this is it!"

Wonderful atmosphere.   2 world famous brewery mascots; Pinky the dog (as white and large as Gandalf's horse). Dunkel the cat (omnipresent and all-knowing)  Dunkel is the sweetest cat and deserves to be in the brewery hall of fame. Some heartless punk in the reviews below complained about Dunkel. This same guy has a Lonestar beer as his profile pic, so at least we know he has ZERO brewery review credibility.   As a result Dunkel's been banned from the taproom. So, Thank you, Lonestar bro, for driving out from your big city to a enchanting, rural, authentic hill country brewery and complaining about an animal for no good reason.   Knowing the type of compassionate, animal-loving people who frequent this place, I'm sure we can rally together to #FREEDUNKEL."

My wife and I are avid animal lovers and thus it's hard to describe our feelings about this place. On entering, there were numerous dogs wandering around and a cat walking across the bar, and after we sat down there were animal feces and urine on the floor. Needless to say, this was offputting to our group. Unfortunately, we did not notice the animal waste until we had already ordered. The service was average and somewhat lackluster. Nobody checked on us after we ordered our beer. As for the beer, it was good quality craft beer but nothing stood out at us. Take him away the issues with the animal waste, we still would not have found this an impressive venue and probably would not return. This is truly a shame, given the place's 4.5-star reviews on Yelp."

Perfect place to bring a group of friends, all get your own food, and then get some drinks at meanwhile brewing. You can order drinks both indoors and outdoors, so if you feel like just staying outdoors you can definitely do that! Drink options are super varied, so likely you will find something you like... Even if you're just sleepy and need coffee :) Definitely check it out if you're looking for an outdoor drink and food place to hang out with friends.. dog.. etc. It is kid friendly, too!"

                "description": "I've been hearing \"You need to checkout Meanwhile Brewing sometime\" ever since it opened, and I FINALLY got to check it out!  First off, the building is massive and almost looks like a Church...for beer (aka the best kind.)  When you enter, you are greeted by bright and welcoming decor, and plenty of plush, velvety booths as well as tables/chairs for additional seating in their \"private event\" space.  There tends to be 3-4 bartenders at all times which is great, because there really isn't a great space for lining up so patrons end up in cluster/blob.  (Not super important.)  Beer wise, there is an extensive menu with an adequate mixture of flavor profiles.  They have several non-alcoholic options include coffee and tea, as well as some mixed drinks and even a sake?!    Their Black Lager was a personal favorite - smooth and despite its dark color from malt, it wasn't overly malty.  All around great flavor and a tad too easy to drink (wink, wink)  Their Blueberry beer had a slight tartness and sweetness.  Very pleasant.   Their Hefe was slightly disappointing for my tastes - it just felt a little flat.   Regarding their outdoors space, wow.  We came during music performances in the evening, and they went all out!  I will note that it was incredibly loud and hard to hear, so if that's not the vibe you like, avoid their music sessions.  They have three food trucks on-site to help you stay awhile!  Plenty of picnic tables and loads of doggy friends to meet!  Overall, great experience and will definitely continue to make the trek out!"

Better yet its family friendly with a soccer field, playground set, and more open space for kids to round around.  The drink menu has a little bit of everything from coffee to cocktails and of course beer. If its a warm day I'm going with the Who Doesn't Like Pineapple because it's tart and refreshing. It'll give you summer beach vibes but without the annoying tourists and sunburn. Well maybe not the sunburn part since it's TX.  With several food trucks on site it tempts you to order something from each to share with the group. Just make sure to save room for dessert at Besame!"

                "description": "Such a fun brewery about 10 minutes from the airport! We had several beers and got food from the taco truck! I tried the Pub House Ale, the Pilsner, and the Marzen. They were all super delicious! They also allow you try samples at the bar. If you're not a beer drinker, they have cocktails, wine, and coffee to choose from. They have tons of food trucks outside that seem to rotate daily. There was a taco truck today we really enjoyed. There's tons of space indoor and outdoor for seating. It has a great vibe and is also dog friendly. Highly recommend, especially if you're waiting to check into your air bnb! Definitely check it out!"

                "description": "I'm a thirty something with a toddler and this is my paradise! Meanwhile is practically in my backyard in Southeast Austin. I can choose from a variety of beers, cocktails, wine, Frose or coffee to sip on AND they have a selection of 4 food trucks to fill my belly. Wait for it though .... I can enjoy these things while my kid expends her energy in a safe, kid friendly environment! Wooohoo I'm here for it! This absolutely is my favorite spot in town right now. Our family can't get enough of it.   My favorite beers are the sours! They have pizza, BBQ, taco and ice cream food trucks, so everyone can surely find something they love with this variety. The open outdoor space is magnificent. On the weekends recently they even have some flea market vendors out which is fun. The best part though is the playground for my little one! Also the astroturf seating area with the little hill my kid loves to do rolls down! At this stage of my life I don't think it can get much better than Meanwhile. I love this place."

                "description": "Meanwhile Brewing is massive. Meanwhile has the following food trailers: pizza, taco, barbeque, and ice cream. They have a great little stage for entertainment, a good variety of beers (as well as wine and cider), and it's extremely kid and dog friendly. There is street parking (there's a parking lot, too, but it's definitely small for how many people can fit in this establishment). We thought the bartenders were friendly and efficient."

                "description": "Update:  Since management respinded to my review and mentioned an outdoor beer station being added, I'll up to 3 stars and try again after they do open the outdoor annex, at which point I'll update ratings again.  The beer and mixed drink choices were large btw.  :)  Cool venue, so I bumped Meanwhile Brewing from 1 to 2 stars.  MEANWHILE (so aptly named), below are pictures of 2 lines to get a beer.  Neither moves fast.  Really.  At a brewery?  Is this their 1st rodeo?   What's the point of having a venue if you have to wait in line 30 min or more for a beer?!?  I'm just gonna bring my wife her beer and she can hang with friends while I simply get in line again and try and tell myself not to be grumpy that my life here will be a circle of order a beer, drink it in line to get the next beer or perhaps letting an advance beer get warm so I can be out of line for a few minutes between trips."

                "description": "One of my favorite spots in Austin. I love the venue under the live oak trees, the open space, and the playground. No hard alcohol, but I feel they make up for it with their creative cocktails and house-made seltzers.   The food trucks give enough variety that there is something for everyone -- pizza, BBQ, Mexican, and the BEST ice cream! But the best part for me is sitting back in the Adirondack, cold drink in hand, watching my little one playing on the playground with a live band in the background.   I hope we continue to get more places like this in Austin!"

                "description": "Easily my favorite brewery in town.   The food trailers here are all bomb and on point. This is an awesome spot for lunch. You can get everything from world class tacos, great pizza to Texas Monthly Top 50 ranked BBQ.   The beer is absolutely amazing. The collabs with local breweries and bars such as Cosmic and St. Elmo are all cool and tasty -AF.   The to go beer options are always great. You can have a few pints and come home with some amazing beer to finish the night at home watching a movie with.   I've seen a few shows here. Saw Eternal Champion here and had a blast. The venue is great for live music, anytime they have a live show its worth the cover to hang out and see some live tunes and have some amazing beer.   The best thing about Meanwhile for me happens to be that its extremely family friendly. They have a playground a soccer court and large open field that is perfect for flying kites. They are all fenced in so its the perfect spot for me to bring my daughter to play. My family comes here regularly and we really enjoy the family friendly aspect Meanwhile offers.   I could go on and on about how much I love the beer and just this space in general. Its really do not miss Austin location now.   Thanks for offering so much good stuff Meanwhile you rock!  edit: I almost forgot to mention how awesome the coffee and breakfast tacos by Pueblo Viejo are here."

                "description": "A hidden gem! Meanwhile is one of my favorite places in Austin! It is located in the middle of a business park, but once you get on the grounds you feel like you are truly transported. Not only do they have their brewery and taproom on site, they also have 4 food trucks! You can pair your beer with tacos, pizza, bbq, or amazing ice cream!  My personal favorite beers here are their sours. They keep their menu fresh and change it up frequently, so if you see something you might enjoy, go quickly! The best part about their location is the open space and seating area. There are so many tables and benches throughout the back and they even have a stage with live music on certain days. The environment is so fun and you will see lots of dogs and children around too. I appreciate that they have a playground for kids.   If you are not a beer drinker, they also serve cocktails made with seltzers and amazing coffee drinks! I love their vanilla latte and will opt to get that most of the times I go there!  Overall, there is something for everyone here! Between the drink selections, food options, seating area, and live music, everyone in your group will have fun! I will always recommend Meanwhile!"

                "description": "Here's a secret, a lot of folks who go to these breweries don't go because of how good the IPA or the cider is, they have a long list of other factors.   We had an IPA and a cider, they were good, not life-changing, but decent. I have yet to sample the entire beer selection but I will. And you know why? Because of everything else the place offers ensures I'll be back.  The tacos from the taco truck were really impressive, exceeded expectations actually. The pizza was equally excellent.   The set up for the grounds was spot on. The trees, the playground, the environment with families, dog owners, young people, it all meshed well because everyone had a section that fit their methods of socializing.  You can't tell me this isn't a science because significant thought (and money, I'm sure) went into developing this experience. Bravo!  Now I need to drink some more of their beers."

                "description": "This is probably one of the best breweries that opened in ATX in 2020 - during a pandemic at that! Since their opening, they've been doing gangbusters business with no signs of slowing.  Obviously, when you visit, you'll notice they have a huge space and $$ was spent to fully build it out. It's not a small brewery that grew up, it was built to be big. There is plenty of seating inside and even more seating outside on the turf + mulch area. But, be forewarned this place is busy. Saturday afternoons are packed with people with pets and families. There is a playscape so parents like this place.   Now, to their beer. Meanwhile brews consistent and good beer. They have a variety of beers from regular German Pils to New England IPAs. Nothing infected and nothing with off flavors. They always seem to have a good rotation of beers.   Don't like beer? They also have wine, cocktails and coffee! Something for everyone.   While they don't serve food, there are numerous food trucks to order from.   Even though the lines can get long, they do move pretty quickly (especially the line that is at the main entrance).   We would come here more often if it were closer to us, but getting across the river is the hardest part. :)"

There was a kid's bday party there and we didn't notice (yay for our dog). There was plenty of water to help yourself to as well as a nice list of beers. They were all incredible (even the German ones)! They also have some cocktails, frozés and coffee available. We got an iced dirty chai on our way out, since their coffee looked and smelled good. WOW! Nice and strong! I am very picky about coffee being too weak and having to add extra shots of espresso, but this was on point!  We will definitely be back! Great, friendly staff, and we especially loved that we could order beer starting at 10a on Sunday! In early and out early!"

The interior has cozy decor, a good selection of interesting beers and plenty of snacks. We ordered a flight of 6 beers and they were all good. I especially liked a very unique cucumber infused lager that was cool and refreshing and got better as you drink it. It also went great with salty snack mix. The place was clean and well kept. The outdoor area seemed cozy too with a firepit going and lots of comfy seating. The staff was super friendly and we met the owner and he was a super nice guy. Would definitely go back!"

A little landscaping to eradicate the poison ivy around the oaks would be nice.   Tried a couple beers and settled on the Tang IPA. Refreshing on a hot day, with a hint of citrus, but not terribly awe inspiring. Bring your own munchies. As they're a few miles from anywhere, they could use a food truck.   Really like the setting and we'll definitely try to make it back next time we're in the neighborhood to give it another try."

I seriously had no idea this place existed - I spotted it when driving by and had to do a U-turn to check it out.  It's been open about a year, has a clean bar and seating area inside, has a covered outdoor patio, and a food truck.    The brew is good and cold, they have 12 of their own brews on tap, including two meades.  64 ounce growler refills range between $16 and $25 depending on the brew you choose.  A six flight sampler is available for $9. You can even purchase six packs of some of their beer to take home with you.  Plenty of room for the kids to run around outside and stay out of your hair.  They have a corn hole washer game, the \"ring-on-a-string-on-a-hook\" game, a giant chess board (you know who you are), tether ball, horseshoes, and a swing.  Try the Buff Hefeweizen and the Sunset Lager - both are sehr gut!  They have sodas and water for $1."

They have some interesting flavors, but nothing too crazy like some of the Austin Breweries. Every beer was good, but I'm going to say the Kimber Lyte was my favorite. An easy drinking beer with more than 5% alcohol. Tang IPA was finally a great tasting IPA, which I normally don't drink... don't worry they have other IPAs for IPA lovers.  The Stout was pepper flavored but good.  But they also Change things up and now they have a coffee stout.  Plenty of other beers to taste.  They have growlers and some of their stuff is bottled.  Hard to find in grocery stores.  Try HEB in San Antonio. And total kudos to the Bartender, great knowledgeable guy."

Bought a six pack of Sunset Lager as a compromise to the better half and really enjoyed it. They are certainly off the beaten path but are worth the effort. During times such as we are experiencing we are trying to support local businesses and I highly recommend that folks in the north San Antonio area make the journey and enjoy the outdoor beer garden. Next up for me will be the IPA!"

We visited this place with friends and their 4 year old daughter was attacked by a massive dog who was situated next to the kid swing. Based off how the facility handled the attack it was clear this dog had been there with his owner multiple times and the bartender actually defended the owner and his dog, saying it was a \"good dog\" and the owners are \"good people\", even after the owner made threats to my husband for stating that the dog should be put down. Given how everything was handled, I would not be surprised if that dog is back on the premises next week. Please do not risk your children's safety by taking them here it's not worth it."

The best thing to do when you go is to get a flight so you can try all of their flavors. My favorites are the kimber light which has cucumber, their bock, and their Gone Pickin apple lager. They sometimes have food trucks out there as well so I would recommend following them on Facebook to keep up with when you can go and get great food and great beers."

The location is just off of 173 (I think) right near 281 and 46. The location is quaint with beautiful trees. As we drove in, the first things that I noticed were the games set up around the yard. They have a large chess set, corn hole, a swing, and a game were one has to swing a ring and catch it on a hook. The second thing that I noticed was a barbecue food truck. We had gotten subway sandwiches to have with our beer but ended up getting a little barbecue also. We headed inside and were promptly greeted by the bartender. The building is really clean and the tap set up is modern. I ended up doing a flight which has 6 samples from the list of 12 beers on tap. All in all, a really great experience and will definitely plan on visiting again!"

                "description": "Beer was mediocre... I generally don't have high expectations for microbreweries in Texas and I would lump the beer here with the rest of them. Tangerine IPA was one-dimensional, drinkable but that's about it. Facilities were clean and spacious. We chose to stop by here because I had heard good things about it and Yelp claimed they're \"Kid-friendly\"... This was FAR from accurate for us. I came here with my pregnant wife, my 3-year-old son, my good friend from work, his pregnant wife and his 4-year-old daughter. In the time it took for us to find a table to sit at outside, my friend's daughter was attacked by a large mastiff-labrador mix. In a matter of a few seconds, this dog managed to escape its owners and clamp onto my friend's daughter's torso, leaving several puncture wounds, scratches an bruises in the process. Once everything was all said and done, the bartender on duty defended the dog and its owners. There was little in the way of apologies or effort to rectify the situation. I had to call 911 to ensure authorities were made aware of the attack and dog's vicious nature. I would have expected folks working the establishment to at least handle this; they did not. After EMS and Sheriff personnel handled the situation and left, I witnessed the bar server on duty taking a smoke break with one of the members of the dog owner's party... clearly small-town, take-care-of-your-kin mentality going on here. I do not recommend coming to this place unless you're part of this inner circle."

I had multiple beers from here, but my absolute favorite was the Dye It Black.   It had such great flavor and was very easy drinking.  The other ones I sampled were also really great and it was very difficult to choose.  This brewery is kind of out in the middle of nowhere.  It's got a rustic outdoors-ish feel to it.  There were benches throughout the brewery to sit at and nothing was done up too fancy, and almost felt like you were hanging out in someone's garage (which isn't a bad thing).  Patty was our bartender and she was absolutely fantastic!  She offered wonderful hospitality and when she found out it was my birthday, she bought me a birthday beer!  Tip - If you check-in on Yelp, you get a free pint glass to take home.  It was a great souvenir to have to remember this great brewery!"

Technically they don't own where the tables are so another company is sponsoring it and letting us sit at the tables and enjoy your beer to go.

Located after Hudson Dam, nestled in a small retail/manufacturing area, you can drink inside a small area with full view to the tanks used to make the product or sit outside on wooden benches/tables.  On weekends, they have great 2-3 person music sets, sitting on top of an antique delivery truck, or inside, depending on the weather.  Personal favorites are the Peanut Stout (think Guinness but with more flavor), the Czech dark lager and my wife loves the Sex Appeal!  The bartenders are all fun, with stories and a bit an attitude, feels like old Downtown Austin.  If you are a local or guest of Austin, Infamous is a must place visit!"

                "description": "We stumbled upon this unassuming brewery during our family trip out in Austin. We needed a few hours to kill and I'm so glad we decided to stop by here.   It is a no frills and very homey brewery/tasting room, with a few tables inside and several outside. I didn't want to risk getting bitten by bugs so we opted to stay inside.   I did not catch their names but we were helped by two ladies and they were extremely nice! We settled on a flight and a pint of their gose (from a can, as it was not available on tap). She was nice enough of offer to open the can and just include it in my flight, but I didn't want to waste any gose and had her just give me the entire pint.   Most of the beer we tasted were delicious. We picked up a mix and match 6 pack, since I enjoyed their gose so much. It is really hard to find a brewery that does the gose the way the Germans in Leipzig do it, as it is supposed to be a bit salty and lightly sour, with some funkiness to it. It definitely isn't for everyone and Infamous does a pretty decent job at making it. Most other breweries treat it as a straight sour beer, so you'd get a big sour kick in the face.   Other beer worth mentioning are the Hijack cream ale, Bugsy's fire bush amber ale and Destination red ale. Also there is a Yelp check in for a free pint glass, perfect free souvenir for myself!"

Some of the best beer out there I think and they've got awesome food to go with it. Burgers are really good along with all of their bar type things.  Pretty good happy hour specials during the week.   Good amount of space inside and out with a ton of parking and it is right next to Better Half so easy to hit both places without having to go anywhere."

I was lucky and somehow got in line to order at the counter before the line got too long, and the food/drinks came out quickly after that.  It's above-average bar food, with nice and crispy curly fries and in-house baked chocolate chip cookies, which were nice surprises.  The one tip I'd make about Hold Out Brewing is to Uber there.  We drove, and the parking was somewhat terrifying.  There's actually a good-sized lot out back, but it gets really busy during happy hour."

                "description": "In this town, if feels like there's a brewery popping in every corner. I'm not complaining, simply making an observation. But what this means though is that you have to do something to stand out. You can't just brew your own beer and sell it in the warehouse, those days are gone.  Hold Out has a unique and very advantageous situation. They're next to Better Half (I think they're the same owner or partners?) and make great use of the property together as well as the opportunity to collaborate.  Additionally, Hold Out has their own food. While their menu isn't as complete as Better Half's, it's pretty decent for a \"happy hour at the brewery\" trip.  But you can't asses them without considering the Better Half contribution, which I've reviewed separately and loved.  The beer is good, although it lacked range in variety as there wasn't much darker beer. A lot of IPA selections, which I'm sure the market loves...but I don't.   I stuck to the lager and a couple other beers, all with weird names but I guess that's the game these days.   I had the vegan frito pie which was way more delicious than expected and had an interesting mix of flavors.   Of course, it all tied in well because we had dinner from Better Half and I don't need to tell you how good that was. You gotta try the grilled halloumi, trust me.  All in all, good vibe, great property."

                "description": "Loved this place! All of the beers we tried were great. Not necessarily knock your socks off beer but definitely quality, good beer. I like that then allow smaller pours such as 8oz and 10oz. The staff was super friendly and easy to talk to and ask questions. Boyfriend and I both ordered the Hold Out Classic burger and it was just that - a classic burger with smash style patties. Super tasty. I ordered the comeback sauce on the side which helped make the burger not so messy. The curly fries were good too although I felt they were a little over cooked (but my boyfriend liked them crispy). If we lived in Austin, we would definitely be returning to Hold Out! Oh and also great seating options from indoor, outdoor with a covered patio and then non-covered outdoor seating."

The food arrived an hour and a half later. I am confused how it could've taken so long for food to arrive. To make matters worse, the waiter said \"sorry for the hold out\" and laughed when he gave us our food. I held out on my laughter for that one. It should not take that long for pancakes or burgers to be prepared. No clue what was going on behind in the kitchen but the chef definitely holding out on cooking or something. Hopefully this was a one off experience, but I'm not holding out faith for this place."

                "description": "Wow, I would say this was our favorite place on our recent trip to Austin, tucked away on a side street off of West 6th it is a true hidden gem although no hidden handshake was needed to enter the converted spacious quonset hut.  Out side under cover were rows of picnic tables, beer was served inside and the food was brought out.  While the beers were outstanding, the food was unexpected, beyond the burgers which we did not try, they had a few interesting dishes such as a Crispy Artichoke  and Pimento and a Indian chickpea inspired take on the chili Frito pie, both were excellent and we are not vegetarians, we just wanted to try something new.  The smoky Rauchbier styled Marzen (?) was unusual and worth a taste but a pint was a little over the top.  Note for those who commented on slow service we were there on a Wednesday and there were no issues, I am sure a nice weekend might be another experience."

The sandwich came with delicious fried fish and various sauces (with a bit of spice) in between amazing thick toasted slices of bread. The sangria was refreshing and sweet, great for those who like fruity beverages!"

Vegetables are fresh and crunchy, the beets are chilled, the nuts crunchy, the small pear shaped tomatoes are excellent and the dressing is outstanding.  1/2 for $6 is incredible value. The burgers are great and the crispy chicken sandwich (during the week ar lunch) is one of the best in Austin and for the price is perhaps best value too. Have had some ciders that seemed very vinegary and perhaps not right but food is always great."

I love sours and got the \"syke!\" And I thought it was great. They have food as well which we didn't get to check out but it looked awesome! I grab a cute cropped tank before we left. Hold out has a covered patio with a good amount of seating and seating inside. Our favorite part by far was the bartender that helped us. We didn't get his name but he has red hair and a mustache to match. He gave us some awesome recommendations to check out in Austin. Go for the beer stay for the hospitality!"

Good drink prices and a good selection of beers, but I didn't find the two beers I tried to be anything special. They have a great food menu and the burger is really good, but it took quite a while for my food to come out. The ordering process was also a little chaotic -- long, long lines and loud music at the counter so it's hard to communicate with staff. Parking can be a nightmare if the lot in the back is full, and the roads are very narrow and uneven when you arrive at the brewery. Ultimately I think this is a good place for those looking to get the Austin experience, but I don't think I'll add this place to my usual rotation."

Street parking is all around and there is a parking garage across the street at the hotel.  Experience: We came here to kill time before our flight, and I am sure glad we did. Their selection of beers were right up my alley. They had a variety of fruit flavored beers. The brewers were super friendly and inviting, I even let him choose my last flight choice. I loved the ambiance of the industrial rose gold with the green wall paint, and the live plant accents. It felt like a relaxing place to go work, study or just hang with friends."

                "description": "Really enjoyed this spot. Didn't hurt that it was 2 minutes away from where we were staying and pretty much in the center of downtown.   Love any place that offers beer flights, as it's the best way to really know what you like and what your taste buds are in the mood for. I typically go for lagers or Belgian-style beers and personally loved the Lingering Sunshine and Wit-Tington.  The atmosphere is chill, laid-back, and the plants everywhere are totally my vibe. You can tell it's frequented by drinking tours as there was constantly small buses/vans waiting outside for parties drinking inside. Music also made for a nice ambiance and the girls who took care of our order upon arrival were very sweet and informative."

Was so good we came back Monday to finish off the weekend.    There's a good variety of beers so we did eight tasters and ended up with three separate glasses.  They had a special when we were there called the Apple cinnamon sour; it tasted just like apple pie.  If they reproduce it, I highly recommend a glass.    The place itself is super posh, establishment clean, service was great and staff very friendly.  I would def recommend this brewery.  Oh, met Cooper...he's one of their brewers.  He's really nice."

                "description": "I stopped here on a whim while exploring Austin via Lime scooter, and it was a solid find! A no nonsense brewery where I genuinely enjoyed every beer I tried-- A gem!   We sat at one of the handful of the tables they have sprinkled in the sidewalk outside. The street was pretty low key for being to close to 6th, so it was enjoyable on the sidewalk! You still order at the bar which was no problem, and the service was quick and efficient!   Rhythm is a Dancer stole the show for me! It's a sour, but it is muted enough that I could drink multiple without my mouth being pursed from tartness! The Kolsch was great, as well. We also tried the soft pretzel which was SO airy which I loved. It also came with a garlic sauce so not your typical pub pretzel, but a very tasty take on one!  Employee's wore masks and maintained distancing, as well, which is great. We found this brewery on a list of spots still enforcing safety restrictions, and can confirm they were!"

Bumped a star bc of their limited seating (one barrel table) outside, the main bartender was not very helpful and some of the drafts we wanted to try were out.

The standout was the Wit-tington by far. The Strawberry Wayne was pretty unique and had a nice pink hue to it. The  staff was very friendly and gave great suggestions of which beers we should try. You can get a crowler of any beer, which was great for us to take home! Can't recommend CDB enough!  Really enjoyed the indie 2000s playlist as well!!!"

Customer service and courtesy are typically top-notch because...well...it's a brewery.   First let me point out this rating is based more heavily on service than the wonderful beer they served( I'd give a solid \"B\" on that spectrum).  Walk in, bartender says \"hi\" and starts cleaning mugs. We look around trying to figure out when he'll actually approach us. Ok...oh look menus, guess I'll grab one. Standing there waiting for the \"what can I get ya?\" Or \"first time? Here's our menu, let me know if you have any questions.\" Bartender jargon. Nothing. My wife says \"yeah it's our first time here.\" \"Oh, ok\" responds bartender. Finally we decide on our own we'll do a flight and order a pretzel. I'm assuming they specialize in IPAs since they have 4! He takes the order.   I return a beer because a random fly fell in one. I tell the bartender I hate to waste good beer but can I get a new one, a fly fell in mine.\" No reaction, he just asks which beer and refills it.   Good craft beer, subpar service."

My sister and I were visiting Austin, TX awhile ago and wanted to do an Escape Room -- There is one right next to this little brewery, so after we finished the Escape Room (we escaped, by the way!), we decided to enjoy some beer and celebrate.  This spot is in a less busy part of the city and there were not a lot of people inside, but I was in love with the interior decor and the ambience. Very calm, chill and relaxing. We enjoyed our beers too! Overall, I loved it and wish there was one near my house."

The women-lead space and brewski selections are rockin', but they're missing a key component--wifi.  I know, I hate sounding like your typical phone-using human being, but every time I'm downtown wifi is super handy. It helps us decide where we want to go afterwards! Anyways, Central is set up like your typical clean and succulent-friendly microbrewery these days. They have board games and serve yourself water (sparkling OR still. THAT's a first!!). They don't have outdoor seating, but plenty of seats indoors. They also sell small bites and other drinks like wines and ciders. Their guest list is pretty solid with brews from Zilker and Independence to name a few other Austin loves. I got a taster of Central's own beers. We really did not enjoy the milkshake IPA that had a strong vanilla aftertaste. It was way too sweet, but to each their own.  Their restrooms are clean and they allow outside food too. SCORE! Now if only the owners would install some wifi...our taptender told us that the owners are still getting that set up. So that's a great sign! They also don't validate parking, so if you need to drive to get here...come on a Sunday when parking is free downtown. Pro. Tip."

You can of course get a flight of beer to taste multiple flavors and I'd recommend doing that...then going back and buying a pint of what you loved the most.   The service was A-1. The woman at the front was very friendly and was open to answering my 500 questions about when they opened, if I can taste different beers, what're those people in the corner with the purple drink drink drinking? In addition to that I'm pretty sure the owners were also just hanging out in there and they were chatting with different guests which made it feel very homey and inviting  Price- on par with other breweries  Great location! Especially if you're just moseying around town ( like I was) and happen to stumble upon it.   The aesthetics are on point. Beautiful Edison bulbs and plan fixtures. Both benches and tables so you can come with a large group or chill on a date."

First, the shop is quaint and located in a very cool shopping area off of HWY 12. They also have a decent selection of classic and unique cigars. That is the positive.   However, they are selfishly thumbing their nose at COVID regulations. The staff does not wear masks or require patrons to wear them when they are up and about. There is absolutely no social distancing and it is usually packed to overflowing on weekends.   When a business refuses to abide by local and state guidelines in something as serious and life-threatening as COVID, it makes you question where else they ignore health and safety protocols. I do not trust that they keep their shop or the tobacco products safe and sanitary if they are unwilling to adhere to these basic guidelines. This should be a MASSIVE red flag for anyone thinking of shopping here.   I do not trust an establishment with this mindset, nor the local authorities that refuse to enforce these rules. It is shameful."

We quarantined with each other for months. We stayed 6 feet away from one another. I know; I was there nearly every day. It's difficult for any business who had to navigate the tricky waters of early 2020's pandemic onslaught. It was new territory for everyone and significantly different messages coming from authorities in the \"know\".  And with all that being said, you have a fairly recently opened small business trying to survive.  IMHO, anyone hating on this establishment is welcome to stay away.    Great cigars, great beverages, great community support. Don't change a thing.  Levi"

                "description": "My wingman and I were chilling out at Treaty Oak Distillery having a few cocktails and enjoying watching round 3 of the Masters. When by pure coincidence I met a couple who I have not seen in years. We mentioned that we had cigars but it was too windy to smoke em. They said there was a chill cigar bar right up the street. We watched Tiger make a par on 18 and off we went.  We were greeted immediately by Allison, the manager, and given a quick tour of the venue. There are comfy seats and a small bar area that serves beer, wine, and water. The humidor is laid out very well and their cigars are stored perfectly. Allison patiently explained that there are two sections in the humidor the usual favorites and \"her\" boutique cigars. I selected a beautiful light Nicaraguan rolled cigar. This baby smoked smooth right down to the label.   The lounge itself is ventilated nicely so you are not smoking in a haze or smoking your cigar and other guys cigar as well. There was also a good beer selection. We had a blonde ale from Two Wheel Brewery in Buda. Good choice.   Smokey's is a chill venue, friendly patrons, and professional knowledgeable staff equal 5 stars all day!"

My only feedback is for more variety in cigars - they had a lot of local brands which isn't bad but not a strong selection and to choose from. The service was excellent and the place was clean."

Prices are great, and the beer selection is fantastic. (Try the maduro) And if you like a little adventure, try the port with your next stick, a great pairing!"

                "description": "I'm so glad we finally got a cigar lounge in Drip and Smokey's doesn't disappoint. I didn't get to sit and smoke but I saw how relaxed everyone was. I love that many of the cigars in the humidor are made by guys in Texas, especially the ones by a veteran who lives nearby. How cool is that? Make sure you talk to Allison too. She gives you the low down of every cigar and helps you find the perfect one for you. She's really nice and very helpful in her descriptions. My husband and I are looking forward to a date night at Smokey's."

                "description": "I was lucky enough to find Chris for my wedding. We thought their airstream would be a fun \"man cave\" addition to an otherwise very feminine wedding...boy were we misguided! Half the bridal party and many of our female guests ended up checking out the cigar bar and loved it! As a woman, I feel like creating a space where women feel welcome in what is traditionally considered a masculine space is a clear indicator of the quality and professionalism of their business.  Not only was Chris helpful, very communicative and and priced well - he and his wife were so much fun to be around! They both made our day special and unique and I highly recommend them for events. They definitely went above and beyond to ensure the day was special and went smoothly.   The airstream itself is luxuriously appointed and classy. Their cigar storage and bar amenities were top notch and I'm sure their huge tv would be great for sports games and such. Definitely a fantastic addition to my big day and I'd highly recommend them!"

Located 40 minutes West from downtown and perched on top of a cliff with sweeping views of lake Travis, this is the place I bring my guest on their last evening in Austin to watch the sunset and to serve as a poetic end to their trip.  Things I like: - The view, absolutely stunning, come hear around sunset and listen for the bell they ring as the sun sinks below the horizon. - The food, the truffle fries here are awesome and for $9 they can feed 4 people, they even have great salads and a wagyu burger all reasonably priced  Things I don't like: - Oasis is kinda far from Austin, there isn't much they can do about it, but the drive is definitely worth it from time to time - The lack of space on the balcony, if you want to sit on the balcony overlooking Lake Travis, you may be disappointed, the tables by the ledge fill up quick so you should get there at least an hour before sunset   protips: - get there early to get good seats for the sunset - avoid the oasis restaurant, they have long waits for sub par food, just eat up here instead  - TRUFFLE FRIES"

                "description": "There was so much going on at this venue, so let me break it down based on my experience -   1. Views - INCREDIBLE. If there is one and only reason to visit this spot, it's for the view. All of their restaurants overlook Lake Travis. And it's stunning.  2. Space - there are multiple venues here - restaurants, brewery, cocktail lounge, some gift shops (closed as of Mar 2022). Every space has a viewing deck, which obviously gets filled fast. There was ample space inside and outside too. Each one is on different floor. And you cannot carry your drinks to the restaurant space as they don't have license. 3. Live music - there was no live music when I visited on a Friday. But they did have some pretty neat setups 4. Food - French fries was meh! Wait time was HUGE!  5. Cocktails - Skip them. Not worth it.  Can't speak about the beer itself as I had not tried it. 6. Accessibility - about 30 mins from Austin, so not that much of a drive.   Would come here again for the views I!"

We went upstairs and got lucky as we snagged a table right as some people were leaving. We ordered some apps and some beers and spent some time taking pictures of Lake Travis. The view was awesome and a great way to say hello to Austin.  The place doesn't have much in the way of vegetarian options, but I did enjoy the appetizers and the view :)"

                "description": "Made our way to The Oasis during a recent trip to Austin with some friends. It was definitely a bit away from the main city, but a beautiful scenic area. The Oasis is right on Lake Travis, and features a bunch of small stores and outdoor areas in the land surrounding it. We were there on a Friday afternoon, and surprisingly not a lot of stores were open, which was a bummer. Of course though, we were there for the brewery, which we were able to make it to. They offer plentiful indoor and outdoor seating; it was a nice sunny day so we opted for the outdoor seating. It was lovely outside but it was SO windy, even after we tried to switch locations outside. It was hard to keep our food from blowing away! The view was super nice though, so despite the wind, we appreciated the scenery surrounding us.  For food / drink - of course, I focused on beers. I was a bit disappointed to learn that they didn't offer flights - they had a good number of offerings, it would make sense to do flights! Oh well, at least they offered half pours, so I was able to try 2; I went for the gose (kiwi dragonfruit) and the Oktoberfest. Both were OK, not the best ever beer but refreshing; I definitely favored the gose! My friends enjoyed their pours as well. For food, we all split some apps, going for the OTXBC trio, the bretzel, and the truffle fries. The trio was a bit disappointing - it was underwhelming and a little piecemeal (we had thought everything would be mixed together but it was just a pretzel on top of the chips with the dips on the side). The bretzel itself was tasty, but the sauce was interesting; we thought it came with queso, but the dip we received looked nothing like queso and was thick with chunks of something in it (pepper maybe?). It was tasty, but unidentifiable. Lastly, the truffle fries were the best option - they were nicely seasoned and crispy with a large volume. We all enjoyed those! The prices were relatively reasonable for what we got in terms of quantity and quality.   Overall, we enjoyed our afternoon at Oasis Texas Brewing Company. The space is lovely with a great view, but the food and drink is just OK; you're definitely more there for the experience. I would definitely make it back to OTXBC during a next visit to Austin to try more beers and take in the nice view!"

We got to experience and enjoy the best of both in a way.   Amazing fresh made as well as barrel aged cocktails, a nice range of food options, and of course, breathtaking views.   The Barrel Room is rustic chic with fancy couches and a pool table. The tap room is plain rustic with a live music stage. The tap room had burgers and sandwiches to accompany the beers brewed on site. The barrel room offered pizza and wings to eat in between cocktail sips.

Even on this cloudy day the sunset still peaked through and gave us a show.   Drinks are good but food isn't really anything to write home about. Its more about the experience you get here for sure.  They have a large parking garage and parking lot on site with plenty of free parking even on a busy night. There's also a golf cart shuttle to get you from the lot to the entrance if you need it, but it's also a walkable distance.   Really great spot to visit if you want a nice spot to watch the sunset and definitely has that wow-factor for visitors!"

The space is large and everyone seemed to be following the safety rules while indoors. We were a party of 8 and we had plenty of space.  I ordered the basic burger and they usually prepare it Medium rare. I asked for medium well and wanted only mayonnaise and cheese. It was cooked the way I requested but was very dry since they did not give me Mayo. My wife ordered the Fish Tacos (3) and said they were great. She ended only being able to eat 2 and another guest finished her last one. She said she would order again next time.   All in all is was good just not great."

The whole experience overall is just underwhelming? If thats the right word. There is always the steps  1. get in line to get on to the wait list 2. once in front be told the wait is 1-2 hours 3. get in line again for the bar  4. finally get seated and wait again for slow service.   One question is Why? Why would you even go here? The wait is 2+ Hours sometimes. The food is cafeteria quality at best. They are SEVERELY understaff. Oasis Brewery has better food and literally the same exact food. The quality of the experience over all does not justify the amount of time, money and effort for this place."

Just knocking one star because I could only find one elevator and it was out of service. I'm in a boot and it was hard to get up all those stairs. If you need help call first to make sure the elevator works."

                "description": "Views: 5/5. Such a scenic view overlooking Lake Travis. My favorite time to come is when the sun sets. The Texas skies are truly breathtaking during this time and Oasis is perfectly positioned for patrons to see all that the sun has to offer. Come 1 hour early to snag a table next to the railings in order to get the best (unblocked) view.   Food: 3/5. My date and I only ordered the Pico Verde. It was a refreshing snack but nothing special. We would've ordered more but there wasn't a huge selection and nothing that caught our eye.   Drinks: 3/5. Very limited selection of beers. It's almost weird that this place is called a brewery because there are literally like 8 to pick out of. Most people just come here for the view though so it's not a huge problem.   Overall, definitely a gem in Austin. It's a great place for dates or just to hang out with family or friends. It's so pretty here that it doesn't even matter what I'm eating or drinking!"

                "description": "Family visiting Austin, Oasis is the must go place to see the beautiful lake and sunset!  We were at the brewery on third floor, ordered some beer and food, kitchen was bit slower than normal (they were busy! So that's fine), we ordered 3 items and they only gave us one and the guy took my call alarm and about to walk away, so I asked him where are my other two items, and he looked confused then asked me, else you ordered? So I told him what they were, and took him a minute to look around, and it was sitting right next to the first item, but he just simply looked confused!  I wouldn't suggest to come during busy weekend, unless you don't mind of waiting longer time, and getting mixed up on what you've ordered.  Overall still a great place to take visitors."

                "description": "Just go! You won't regret it.   Everything is was amazing! We had French fries and avocado dip to go with our beers. Fries comes with a truffle aioli.   For the beers we had Grand Cru Dark Ale and Samurai Lager.   The Grand Cru Dark Ale comes in a small cup. The server assured me that was a good amount unless I was really found of dark ale. He was right that was a good amount because that beer is strong.   I pretty sure I wasn't going to finish the beer if I had asked for a double sized cup.   Really nice experience over all.   I would recommend this place a million times."

                "description": "I truly wanted to love this place.. Texas weather is just right this time of year, the views make you want to make the drive from Cali to the lone star state just to get that perfect pic over the lake with a drink your hand in the free state of Texas....but don't be disappointed when you are greeted by a not so friendly mask police manager that wants to wear his mask under his nose ....   the guacamole had zero taste the salsa was watery and had zero flavor... the chips were the bottom of the barrel... all of the guests seated around us were unhappy and didn't receive good service either but were happy with the views. The fellow guests/visitors we met were super cool and that was the best part... the drinks food and service were way below average... what is it with these places? get it together! the views bring us there but you need to pick it up from there... managers are clueless... bartenders were so rude....embarrassing for Austin...  so many visitors and this is their first impression of Austin unfortunately... we can do better.  We ordered 2 pizzas and left 80% of them on the table....Tasted frozen with ragu sauce.... I can't even begin to explain the regrets I have going here... The guy that gave us a ride on the golf cart up was very nice and now I feel he may have been trying to warn us about going there..  Bathrooms were gross and tables were nasty... nobody was cleaning up after people.... trash and masks everywhere and near the water... I follow not unfollowed their social media page and the pictures are very enticing but it's the exact opposite of what you actually get... from the drinks to the food.. Fire pit was a nice touch.. we stopped to talk to other guests there on our way out... Its a one hitter quitter for all..  won't be back... what a waste of location."

I completely love visiting here and I try to keep suggesting everyone to go here at every chance I get. Hahahah!   Parking can be little tricky on a weekend evening/rush hours. But we eventually always find it (maybe 5-10 mins of struggling later). They have enough space for free parking.   There is \"Spicy boys fried chicken\" food truck here at all times, which is just absolute best. Again, I can go and on about the delicious food they carry, but this is about the brewery itself. The food truck is a beautiful perfect cherry on top.   The brewery carries wide range of selection, and I thoroughly enjoy them. The service people are also wonderful. If you sign up for the rewards program, you can save some money down the road. So I suggest to sign up online for it.   Dogs are welcomed and Thursday evenings they have live music performance going on. Enough seating indoors and outdoors.  Definitely visit here and you can thank me later ;)"

                "description": "As we drove to the brewery it seemed like a bit of a strange area at first. The brewery is located in an industrial park that has some other stuff going on. We were surprised by how full the parking lot was.  We stopped by on a Sunday afternoon and decided to sit outside and it was very hot. There were fans but it didn't seem to help much. I will note that there was indoor seating available.    The food truck that was outside was really cool. We got the cauliflower wings with the Korean Buffalo sauce. You can order on your phone or at the window which is nice.   You can order beer inside, they have a variety of different options. I tried out the hop water (no alcohol) which was really interesting. Sparkling with some whatnot a tartness from the hops. We tried the hazy IPA which was pretty hoppy, probably not the best on a hot day. The staff was all very nice."

They don't sell flights, but they can sell you a half pint if you just want to taste a few different beers.   When we arrived, it wasn't too busy and you could just sit wherever even though all the tables had a reserved sign. Later on we returned for beer to go and noticed that you had to wait to be seated.   They have a food truck on site that also sells vegan items."

Great beer, good vibes...I just wish the food options were better. I hope they will eventually cycle new trucks there."

The coffe cream ale was delicious, and I don't do beer and after the tasting I got a glass!! Hubs got the hazy IPA-said not the best he's ever had but he likes it. He also got the double IPA and gave it a 7/10. They had 2 flavors of frozen cocktails too: strawberry limeade (tart) and frose.   Cute outside area. Inside smelled a bit like sushi...but they weren't selling any on the premises. ‍"

St. Elmo has consistently awesome beers (focusing largely on traditional stlyes, like their flagship kolsch Carl) and is suuuuuuper dog-friendly.  There's no better way to spend a few hours, in my book, than filling my face with stout and passing out pets to allllll the floof.   Fantastic food truck, soursop, on-site.  Tap list is regularly updated on insta.  Killer coffee shop further down in the strip, Spokesman."

Whiskey Business has a diverse, quality, well-priced inventory. They had everything I needed. Even took home a six of Boerne Brewery's Old Courthouse Ale at the owner's suggestion. It's like he knew what I'd like. He did. One of my favorites is an Irish dry stout {think Guinness}, and I've now found a new favorite. Love it! I'll make Whiskey Business my go-to.

Fine if the burger is decent size. We were both surprised when we were served P Terry's size burgers and less than 1/2 the fries. Honestly, nothing wrong with the portion size but it was absolutely not worth $12. The burger is clearly a frozen patty and the bun wasn't even warmed.   Just read through all the reviews and a HUGE props to the staff for enforcing mask wearing when it was required. That's enough reason for me to come back. We'll support this business and drink the great beer. We'll skip the food though."

Food in terms of the \"loaded\" fries leaves a lot to be desired (they're not really \"that\" loaded, so the price for the product is absurd); the pickles tasted good but the fry was quite irregular; the spinach artichoke dip is delicious but the chips cannot lift the dip without you helping them along, either by doubling up or scooping with a utensil.  Beer is alright.  One of the lagers is so-so but the raspberry sour is pretty good."

                "description": "Super excited to have another brewery in the South Congress area to go enjoy some tasty as heck beers and get in your order for some Southside Flying Pizza or other tasty snacks and items on their menu!  This location will forever be in my heart as the first time I ever stepped foot here was when we were in desperate need for some warm food, cold beer, and water.  Beers:  I have been enjoying the melon + grapefruit notes in their Simcoe Pale Ale as well as their summer seasonal ale Vaquero Ranchers lager that is just easy and smooth to drink down on a summer day.  Unsure what to get - check out their crowlers to-go and canned beers! I grabbed a sixer to take home with me the last time we were here just so I can try the variety of other options they have here.  OH! Also I noticed they have a frozen drink machine too!  check it out for me, eh?!  Food:  We came here on a weekend and there was a crawfish broil happening to our surprise!  Easy to order online, at your table, and/or at the counter. I really love the option to order directly from your table and be able to pay without having to get up and go to the counter especially if you are nailing that ping pong game against your friends!  We really enjoy ordering and eating pizza here as Southside Flying Pizza nails it every time and there is enough to enjoy with everyone.   Outside / Inside:  all COVID safety measures are practiced here and taken seriously both inside and outside.  There is PLENTY of seating outside and ample amount of space to move around without it feeling crowded at all.  Snovid: When we experienced about 5 days without water we noticed that Last Stand Brewing were offering water fill ups. We grabbed our containers and made the quick drive down South Congress to get our fill.  I am SUPER appreciative of the kindness, ease, and availability to be able to get some water for our needs during the snowpocalypse that all of Texas experienced.  I will forever be in debt to Last Stand as the showed their genuine willingness to help their community out in a time of extreme need.  THANK YOU, Last Stand! You are truly a life saver.  I appreciate your kindness and help always!"

                "description": "Well we gave it a try, so sister and I stopped here for a nice cold beer last night. We were stopped when walking in the door by a rude ass employee (dark curly hair with glasses) literally yelling at us about a mask from across the room full of people. We are fully aware some spots still require masks and as we tried to ask if we can sit outdoors she rudely interrupted us and continued to tell us she won't serve us unless we have a mask. Shit lady haven't you ever heard of customer service or even normal communication. She could have approached us and explained their policy it was not necessary to demean us for making a mistake.      We walked outside my sister was livid and embarrassed. I talked her into staying and me walking in with my mask since she has forgot hers and her sitting outside on the bench area. I saw the employee again and asked if we could sit outside at a table which was our original plan (if she listened and didn't scold us like children) she said I can order since I have a mask but my sister can't leave the table with a complete attitude. I ordered got the beers, drank them and we left.      The beers are good but not worth the rude inappropriate staff. There are plenty of local breweries with good vibes and good beer! Don't waste your time."

                "description": "My friends and I enjoy the atmosphere, but we frequently don't get good service here. The bartenders don't seem to be on the same page as far as pour amounts go, either. Depending on the bartender, you may get a tap beer in a small plastic cup or a pint glass. I asked a female bartender why that was, and she said they do either \"double\" or \"single\" pours. I went back the following week and asked for a double pour of the same beer from the week before - this time with a different male bartender - and he said they only do beers in pint glasses. I guess there is a lack of communication on that front but it's resulting in customers asking for double pours and being charged more for what should be the normal amount of beer and frankly that doesn't sit right with me.  The value of the food from Southside Flying Pizza is also overpriced. The quality of the food is not equal to what they're charging, and they're frequently out of menu items and condiments by the evening. I've never been for lunch but their \"special\" is a slice of pizza for $4, which hardly seems like a special to me considering the quality of the pizza.  They make tasty beer, though!"

                "description": "Easily missed if you're only looking on the main drag but this brewery is just off S Lamar on Oltorf. The beers are excellent of course but don't skip the food. Their pizza is the highlight to me. I would suggest getting slices because they are reasonably priced and it gives you the opportunity to try different options out. They have a wagu beef slice which is unique and delicious. My personal favorite is their Calabrese which I would describe as an elevated pepperoni pizza.  This is a great place to go if you don't have a reservation on a busy night because they have a ton of seating and parking.   Also check the schedule because they have live bands playing in the main dining hall."

                "description": "TLDR: above average beer and a really nice atmosphere  came here for a flight and a little snack after work last Friday. First off, I really liked the atmosphere. there is a bunch of outdoor seating, which is always a plus.  For drinks I got a flight, so I got a variety of beers. Overall, they were pretty good, however, they don't have a lot of variety in the styles available. I also got a slice of pizza, which was much better than I expected for brewery food. All said and done, it's definitely a spot worth visiting, but isn't the best that Austin has to offer."

                "description": "This is a Highly Recommend kinda place.   Staff - super friendly and knowledgeable about the drinks and food products.   Environment - lots of seating indoors and out. You can spread out and work. You can dine in and chill. Go alone or with a party and still feel like you have the place to yourself.   Food/drinks - i have yet to have a bad food item from these guys. Everything is delicious and surprisingly thought out. It will take you by surprise. And the drinks. There are plenty of options to taste and enjoy based on your preferences.   $$$ - it is a little pricier then you might expect. But truthfully, for what you get, I will continue to come back here and spend the money.    Give it a shot. I do not think you will regret it. I would recommend this place over Pint House pizza or even Dominoes ;)."

                "description": "10-24-21  As you can probably figure out, I like beer.  This is my drink of choice. And visiting breweries just takes the experience to the next level.  Quality/Quantity - Beer was mediocre. My family did not like the menu here, so I was pressured to quickly finish my beer and sadly leave.  It should be illegal to only drink one beer...  We hit Trader Joes on the way back and realized they carried the whole line of their beer, so as you can guess, I got two more six packs:)  Now, I am happier.  Atmosphere - You need a much bigger parking lot, especially since almost everyone drives a huge truck. We got lucky with a space, but had to share some of the space with the huge truck to the right and the huge truck to the left, LOL. Teri Joyce and the Tagalongs were playing tonight. They did a good job, the place was hoping. Both the inside and outside spaces are large; however, again too large for their parking lot. Can some people carpool? They also had a small outdoor stand to order beer and food. Additionally, there were plenty of seats at the bar. The team seems to be working pretty hard.  Service - The bartender was just okay. Not much to write about, I ordered, he gave me the beer, and I left; still left a tip though :)  Price - $6.50 + $1 tip  Owner Suggestion - Did I say you need a bigger parking lot? Wish I had more time to enjoy your place, but no fault of yours. Hopefully next time. Keep up the good work."

                "description": "We usually love ABGB, good food, good atmosphere, good service. It's a nice afternoon and we decided to come over for lunch and sit outside with our dog. Food was great as usual and initial service was awesome.   When we'd arrived, someone else was there with a big dog. Saw this person leave the dog unattended for a few moments and let it walk around off leash. This person leaves and everyone sitting outside can hear the staff saying someone let their dog poop by the tables, left it, and how gross that is. We agree, that's completely rude.   After a few minutes two staff come over to our table and loudly say something to the effect of  \"hey, you let your dog sh*t over here.\" We politely explain it was not our dog, perhaps it was the person here before us. Sounds like they knew that person because they walk off saying  \"x would never do that\".   I get it, super uncool to clean up after someone else's dog, but also uncool to blame us for it. We arrived, walked right by the same staff and directly to a table (no bathroom breaks). Created an uncomfortable situation which prevented us from staying longer and ordering more."

                "description": "It looks like a really nice beer garden.  The weather looked like rain so we sat inside.  They do have restrooms and they are clean.  Food is hard to decide if you are lactose intolerant.  We found a Pulled Pork and it came with a pint of beer. We also got two pizzas for the rest to share.  We had the wagyu and 2 choice of the specialty pizza cauliflower. That was a good choice.  I don't care for beer so I had a cider.   They were out of watermelon So I had cranberry.  Very tart but refreshing.  The bar tenders were all so friendly and nice.  I didn't see anywhere to get beer flights and my son had his bday.  Nothing special like a drink or come out to table.   It's a nice atmosphere with nice folks."

The food alone is worth coming for, it's upscale apps that are absolutely delicious and they also have pizza.  The con (and why I'm only giving 4 stars) is that this is a beer garden that has ONLY SIX beers available - all brewed in house. I wish they at least had some local options that made the beer list a bit longer, after all it is a beer garden. They also have a small list of ciders and wine available. The \"Industry\" Pilsner was great and a nice light beer but"

                "description": "*COVID Update*   ABGB is a must visit when in Austin. Parking in their lot is ample. Restrooms are on-site in the corner. Seating is self-served both indoors and outdoors, and there is free WiFi! Masks aren't required here, and most people don't wear them inside or outside. The menu is on a QR code, which is posted on each table. The water station is in the back.   I got the beer flight $15 as it was my first visit. The pilsner is definitely my favorite; it's a popular one! It's odd that there's only 6 choices, but it helps especially for those who are indecisive. If you order one beer, it's about $6. When I visited on a Sunday afternoon, they had live music and many couples were dancing along. I totally missed the memo to bring my boots and hat.   I tried the Calabrese and homemade sausage pizza ($3.50 per slice). Both were delicious.   Obviously with the live music, it's loud inside, but it's a fun place to hang out with larger groups."

I did a flight to sample their good stuff. It's 5 five ounce pours so it's filling! The bruschetta was good but needed more salt or balsamic dressing. It was still tasty. But the stuffed peppadews were really good. I'll need to come back to try their pizza. There's indoor and outdoor seating. Staff know their stuff. Parking seems to fill up fast. Right off of south Lamar"

It's nice because I can keep a running list of spots to check out when I find myself nearby and I don't need t hop on a zoom meeting with a client. ABGB is one of those spots. I stopped in here for a quick beer during covid and it was pretty solid, this is my first time back.   The wifi is good, clearly. I'm writing this review and it hasn't faltered at all. The beer selection is small, but what I've tasted has all been solid. Both in flavor and body, they are true to what they are brewing. Quiet and mellow atmosphere is lovely is for getting some work done and maintaining a medium focus. The garlic fries smell delicious.   The only downside is that I'm getting a little bug action. But I'm also sitting under a tree, in Texas, in June.     I'll be back and probably to eat."

Everyone is helpful and friendly regardless of how busy they are.   Food and service aside, this is just a great place to spend time with the people you love/like. Every time I've been here has been memorable.  Showed up on a Saturday afternoon with a party of 25+ and we immediately found a group of picnic tables and spent the next several hours just enjoying each other's company.   Everyone enjoyed their food and drink but what we'll remember and what I'm most grateful for is the ambiance and hospitality at ABGB.   There's plenty of places to go eat, but when you have a large party and want to make memories with an Austin feel, look no further."

Now, the \"free\" tasting is 3 tastes of anything they have on the board in the little taster glasses. There is an option to purchase full pours which includes a glass.  I have always been a fan of Thirsty Planet's beer offerings as I have had them at several brewpubs around Austin. Their Buckethead and Double Buckethead are my handsdown favorites! When I was out and about and headed to some other breweries, I stopped in here and was happy I did.  The staff was very nice and there is ample communal seating inside and out. They also offer tours, but I did not take one as I was a bit tight on time.   For a glorious afternoon in a chill atmosphere with great beer offerings and a little roadtrip out of Austin, this is a great place to spend it!"

Since they don't sell food, your pup is welcome and we had fun lovin' on some sweet dawgs! Uh, the four legged ones.  They are great at working the crowd and selling their beer glasses. Katherine was there at the door on the one day (Saturday) that we stopped by to explain how it works. Lots of t-shirts and ball caps to pick through and new fun people to meet. Everyone's happy with a beer.  I also love that Thirsty Planet supports Divine Canines, a therapy dog group that sponsors training for dogs to service hospital patients. Just wish they were open for more than 4 hours a week. Rumor has it this outstanding brewery will soon move to a new much larger space on South Congress."

It's cheap to get a few pours and most everything there is close to some ambrosia of sorts. I've definitely had the goat everywhere so I was glad to try the only-found in-house bevs.   I do not like IPAs so what did I try first, the double bucket head IPA of course. Awesome taste. Not so bitter but leaves you feeling good. Pretty strong so it was a great way to start the morning. I can't recall the other beers I tried but I do remember leaving happy."

                "description": "Stop one of three for a brewery tour...   I had three of their beers: Lemon Bitch - Special beer on tap. I don't have any of the ABV info but it had a nice lemon taste to it. Very refreshing for the hot weather.  Thirsty Goat - American-style Amber Ale, 6.5% ABV. Had a nice spicy finish with the beer.  Yellow Armadillo - Light American-style Wheat, 4.0% ABV. Very refreshing. Had some citrus flavors in there.   There is a nice outside area with picnic tables and plenty of seating inside and out.   The guys there were so nice. Very engaging and informative when it comes to the beer info.   When I make it back to Austin, I'll definitely be stopping by again."

                "description": "Stopped by for a tasting. There are a wide variety of flavors and I especially liked the Palehead. The outdoor \"patio\" area is lacking but the indoor tasting area makes up for it. From what I understanding they are opening another place soon.  Take advantage of the \"Barks for Beer\" sale. $20 for a special pint glass that's good for a free pint in several restaurants and other breweries."

But it's not like I didn't know it would be smoky.  I ordered it anyway and didn't like it so that's on me.  Regarding the brewery itself, it was a well thought out taproom with quality beers.  I liked that they have games to play - always a plus for me."

                "description": "More like 4.5. We had a great post-Zoo visit here on a sweaty Saturday afternoon. $10 for a sweet glass and three pints always works for me. They'll also give you a small tasting glass for free, but why bother with that?   I've been a fan of Thirsty Goat amber for awhile, and this visit turned me on to the Hoppy Blonde and Buckethead IPA. I'll be looking for all of them at local bars.  The \"tour\" is one room, but hey they're a small business, which is cool. Very informative, maybe more than the average beer fan will want, but beer nerds will love it and it's not hard to step out and back to the bar if you get bored.   One downside, it was super stuffy in the tasting room. Not sure if their AC was acting up or just couldn't handle the crowd and the July heat. However, that didn't stop my group for staying and drinking until closing time. I'd recommend Thirsty Planet to any beer lover visiting or living in Austin."

                "description": "Stopped by the brewery for a birthday beer crawl. (Is it really a crawl if you only go to 2 places?)  We signed up for the tour online (which is free) but there was no list and it seemed like they weren't going to do the tour at all. You might have to remind them. Once we mentioned our interest, they announced it and a bunch of people joined in. I'm not sure reservations are really needed at all for this. The tour was fine, nothing to write home about. If you've done a tour before you've probably seen everything they have.  I liked a lot of the beer we had, especially the thirsty goat ale. They were out of the wheat but had a rhubarb beer which was interesting.  Staff were friendly and when not totally overwhelmed with people, happy to engage in conversation about the beers.   It did get quite crowded and I understand why. The outdoor patio is lovely when the weather is nice and they have tons of games. For me it was a bit too crowded and noisy, but that's the small price you pay for free - $10 beer. (You can either get 3 tickets for a small glass for free or 3 pint tickets + a keepsake glass for $10.)"

                "description": "Checked out their brewery tasting and tour this past Saturday.  Warning: there are times it will be quite crowded like when bus loads of people stop by.  However, even despite the crowds, the bartenders did a great job of serving everyone.  $10 gets you a souvenir pint glass and three full pints (plus you can taste a few oz of the other beers they have for no additional charge, so really you can taste 7-8 taps for $10).  Their yellow armadillo and thirsty goat are both solid crowd and palate pleasers.  I liked their merch as well, bought a ladies tee for $18.  The tour was about 25 minutes long, but it was the hottest part of July and it was not a/c, so I think they mercifully made it quick for us.  We brought kiddos and the outside area was kid friendly, although not completely fenced in by the side of the road, which was a bit nerve wracking.  I wish I had brought some more small bills as tips collected in the tasting room go to a local charity, which rotates monthly or seasonally.  A fun way to spend a Saturday, would be even better in the cooler months of the year."

We stopped by this place and had a swell time. The owner/brewmaster was super nice and friendly, in fact, everyone who worked there was awesome. If you don't want to drink three beers, you get a tasting glass and three free tasters. But then you don't get an awesome pint glass...   Only gripe? No AC (in August, yuck) and it is SUPER LOUD inside. And it seemed that the more people drink, the louder they got and it was just incredibly noisy.   If you like Thirsty Planet beers, or beer in general, definitely worth checking out."

They were professional, yet easy to work with, responsive and surprisingly affordable. Jason did a great job behind the bar causally handling the beer orders while educating those who wanted about their beers.  PRO TIP: They use Sonos wireless music system, but do not have an external headphones jack. Download Sonos on your phone and the then manage/update your playlists and you can listin to an iTunes playlist by going to \"This iPhone\" (I assume the same for Android phones) and then Playlists. If you do not want an iTunes playlist, you can create a playlist in Sonos app ahead of time or play Pandora, Spotify, XM/Sirius, etc)."

                "description": "This is a great addition to Austin's micro brewery scene.  I first tried their Buckethead IPA at Second Restaurant and enjoyed it enough to look for Thirsty Planet's website, where I discovered they offer tours most Saturdays.  No information about the tours is provided on the website, but here's the deal: sign up online, when you go there's an optional tour, plus four 4 oz. samples for free, or you can purchase the \"souvenir glass\" for $7 and use it to get up to 4 pints free...a nice deal (although, I don't know about you, but I couldn't consume 4 full pints in 2 hours).  They have a nice large indoor tasting room with communal bench tables and an outdoor patio as well (but it offers no shade).  On to the beer:  * Buckethead IPA - one of my new favorite local IPAs; it is well balanced with the bitter and hint of sweet, with a pleasing Amber color and a mildly citrusy nose.  * Thirsty Goat Amber - a lighter amber, malty but with a slight hoppy finish.  * Double Buckethead IPA - an even stronger bitter taste than the Buckethead...save this one for last. * Yellow Armadillo Habanero - I could definitely taste the habanero flavor, but the spiciness was tempered by a pilsner-like base.  It's surprising how easily this beer can be consumed."

The place had a nice welcoming feeling to it, and stepping up to the bar got me a friendly greeting. I was not familiar with their brews, but saw one called \"Twist and Stout\", and being a fan of the dark stuff, went right for it. Oh my... *smiles coyly\" This stuff was liquid sex.... and I knew it was going to get me in trouble.  So next up, I explained my fondness of the dark, but felt the need to expand outward, what would they suggest. The man behind the counter said without hesitation - \"Thirsty Goat Amber\"!  Boyo was he right! After two pints of that, I had an expression similar to the one on the label, so I took some time in my truck to eat a sandwich before driving away.  Yup, I'm going back!"

I also felt kind of weird about asking for a flight but then being told uhhh we're not doing those right now- seemingly bc the line was long. It was odd.  Small indoor space, kind of lacking something aesthetically - compared to other Austin breweries.   Good truck onsite but it wasn't that good :/  Overall just meh!

                "description": "Love me some authentic microbreweries.  I haven't been to a solid microbrew spot since moving to Austin, so this was such a breath of fresh air. It seems like there are plenty of breweries that also double as restaurants and music venues--which is cool, I'm all for that, but deep down I'm a plain microbrew kinda gal.  Getting here got me so excited as our GPS took us to industrial surroundings AKA the location of every great microbrewery. There is plenty of parking, and they had a yummy-smelling food truck parked outside, but we already ate so skipped that. My friend and I walked in and immediately felt the warm, relaxed energy that Independence had. I couldn't decide on what pint to get, so I settled on a taster set of four for $10. Not too pricey. The selections were not really in my favor, as I tend to go for wheats, belgians, juicy or hazy IPA's, or oatmeal stouts. However, I knew I would find something I'd like. One can never be too picky about beer.  They also have board games and free stickers! I love that!! Their logo is the lone star on black fire--super cool. Our taptender was a wonderful and friendly man. I just wish he would have been a little more wordy with his explanations of the beer profiles. I'd assume that microbreweries attract devout beer drinkers and self-proclaimed snobs (like myself), so I would love it if he was able to elaborate more. Anyhow, I will be back even with a larger group (yay picnic tables!), but I hope that they have more varieties of beer, or that they rotate their taps often."

It was a bit sour, so it hit the mark.  But the one I liked the most was the End Credit Chocolate Hazelnut Porter. The hazelnut makes it smooth, and the chocolate flavor comes through as well.    The staff was cordial, not overly friendly, but it's patrons sure are. They made room for us to walk up an order, they asked what I had ordered, and made recommendations based on what they had already tried.  They had live music that day too.  Very entertaining, good set, he even dedicated a song to one of my friends.  Very cool!  They have games like chutes and ladders, Rock Trivia, Oversized Jenga, and more.  Beer and entertainment, can't go wrong with that!"

                "description": "This brewery is an austin staple. I say hidden staple actually because it took a while to find this place, but once you do, you won't want to leave. With awesome craft beer, great hipster service and entertainment usually on the weekends you will have an awesome time. Try the beers on special, but also try the ones that are mixtures between two beers they are special and only unique to this establishment. The bathrooms are clean and there are snacks by the register, but be sure to eat before you get here since some beers are heavy and you might get full which really isn't a bad thing, but good to know!"

I was a little taken back at how low in ABV their beers were but that isn't a deal breaker by any means. In fact, out of the entire selection on tap, only two were higher than 5% and they both happened to be a staggering 9%. The interior is nice and very spacious.  Cheers!"

It's a really large place and they set up picnic tables right outside the brewery.  The Sunday afternoon I went, I believe there was some event wrapping up. DJ was playing 90s RandB/Hip-Hop which contributed to the great vibe. All of their beers tasted amazing. I ended up going with their sour beer. Perfect balance of sourness and fruit. I would definitely come here again."

But once you arrive, there is indoor and outdoor seating.  There are occasional food trucks.  Plenty of games including jenga.  I like the chill vibe.  This is a great place for an afternoon drink or three.  The bartenders know their stuff.  Ask as many questions as you like regarding the beer choices.  You can do tasting flights or go right to the pint.  I prefer the Stash IPA which is one of my local favorites.  Other beers are good too.  Can't go wrong here."

                "description": "When I was visiting friends in Austin last month, a friend and I decided to hit up a local brewery for a couple of hours (it's a tradition of ours). I had to pick up my brother at the airport after, so I was looking for a place that was southeast, so Independence fit the bill. When I lived in Austin, I used to drink Independence beers all the time, but I never made it out to the brewery. I was impressed! It's really large! Tables inside and tables outside. They have several beers to choose from. The line for the bathroom was REALLY long, but we happened to choose a day that had an event (puppy adoptions I think) and it was PACKED. All in all, good beers, they were playing good music, and I had a great time with my friend! Great afternoon, and I'd go again!"

I messaged Jodie in April to see what her pricing and availability was for Memorial Day weekend and she responded quickly. Paid deposit through venmo and paid the other half day of our tasting. We did one winery, one distillery and one brewery. She gave us a small history of each of the places we went too. Her cheese board setup was amazing! Very sweet and easy going. I highly recommend."

                "description": "OMG, Jodie is FaNtAsTiC! My bff and I were on our annual girl's trip and wanted to book a wine tour before we left the Hill Country of Texas. We were staying in the adorable town of Wimberley so I researched tours in the area.  Jodie's Taste of the Hills Tour got great reviews and went to wineries close to the Wimberley area. The day of the tour ended up being chilly and rainy. As soon as Jodie pulled up with her spectacular shuttle-like van she was out like a flash with pretty umbrellas for us! We went to 3 different wineries which we thoroughly enjoyed! After the first one, we returned to Jodie's vehicle and she had a gorgeous tray for us of cheese,  sausage,  crackers,  grapes,  olives, dips.....simply divine!!! The tour was also just the 2 of us and we loved that Jodie still did ALL of this for a tour that I believe takes up to 12 people! The next time we plan a trip to the Hill Country we are going to do one of Jodie's Beer tours!! We had such great conversations with Jodie too! Thank you sooooo much for the GREAT time! Sooooo much fun!"

                "description": "Amazing tour!!! My wife and I came into Wimberley during Spring Break to relax from teaching and this was the perfect trip to do so! Jodie made us all feel like we were old friends, even though we had never met anyone else on the bus.  She was very detailed with the stories of each winery, and explained all the different varietals, answering our every question along the way. The bus was very comfortable and clean, and she stored each bottle we purchased until the trip was over, but we could have had the bottles on the bus had we chosen to.  The wineries all seemed to know her, so they were expecting us and were incredibly friendly. We were not rushed anywhere, and still managed to make it back into town to enjoy shopping on the square.  My wife and I were pretty hungry by the time we had lunch, since we didn't have breakfast, but the tapas style lunch was perfect for the glass of wine we purchased to have with it. The lunch was delicious and filling.  Overall this was an amazing experience and I will be recommending this tour to everyone I know."

We were fortunate enough to have great people touring with us, and it made the tour all the more fun.  She prepared the best picnic lunch I've ever had.  Sugar Shack cake balls, meats, cheeses, crackers, hummus, a goat cheese something served on crackers (that I LOVED, and I hate goat cheese), spinach feta rolls, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something.  She was fully prepared for everything.  Boxes for the wine we bought, umbrellas in case in rained (it didn't), plenty of water...this wine tour couldn't have been more perfect if she tried.

She provided an excellent variety of foods including a hot portion and gluten-free (just in time `cause I was lit after the 1st vineyard). The three vineyards for that day were selected based on the wine preferences of the tourists that day (A+ perk). We never felt pushed or obligated to buy wines, but we all did because they were very good (!), and Jodie kept our purchases organized and stored for us. She also gave a good background on each vineyard and on the Wimberley area in general. We learned a lot about Wimberley and wine and were able to get tipsy knowing Jodie was an excellent driver of her comfy bus. And have you been to Wimberley? That hilly countryside is beautiful!"

Our tour was originally scheduled for 10:30a, but got pushed back to 1:15p due to shuttle trouble (we had the option to receive our money back, but actually liked the later time).  We stopped at three wineries, including Driftwood Estate and Duchman Family Winery.  The views at all of the wineries varied, but each were unique to their locations.  Jodie provided an amazing picnic-style lunch, including a charcuterie (meat and cheese) board, chicken salad, nuts, walnut and feta salad, grapes, chocolate cake balls, bottled water, etc. At the second stop, Jodie was kind enough to call in people's orders to Salt Lick BBQ and had it all ready to take home by the third stop.

She gave us a lot of background information on the wineries as well as the town of Wimberley. She had a delicious assortment of snacks for us to munch on while we rode to and from each winery. She helped package our wine purchases and brought us umbrellas as it started to rain. She even went the extra mile, literally, and drove us back to our hotel since it was raining as we had walked to our meeting spot earlier in the day. We had another couple on the tour with us which was really nice since we had people to mingle with. It was a very personal experience and I felt as though we were all just great friends spending an afternoon together. Who needs Napa, everything is better in Texas!!! We will definitely be repeat customers."

                "description": "Yesterday, I decided to do a day trip to Spicewood today. It was first to Krause Springs then found out Iron Wolf would be open lunch time. After a refreshing morning at Krause Springs, we headed to Iron Wolf Ranch and Distillery for lunch and drinks.   They have a wide variety of spirits with several award winning ones. Tiann was great in making our drinks! I had the New Fashion made with Hotscotch (a little sweet and spicy). My husband had the Luna-tic made with vodka and several fruit juices. We enjoyed the drinks while we waited for our lunch from Craigo's. We ordered the specialty pizza (sausage, pepperoni, green peppers, mushrooms and onions) and barbecue wings. Truly phenomenal pizza and wings! We also had the Giddy Up Mary with horseradish-infused vodka and Wild and Tea, an Arnold Palmer with bourbon.   We'll have to come back another time for the tasting and meet Luna, a wolf adopted by the family (she's usually there on Fridays). Most Saturdays they have live music. Definitely check their calendar online."

It was fun hanging with everyone and hear what people like and have trouble drinking . We had vodka, gen, bourbon, scotch, etc. and we ended up leaving with a bottle of Hot iron. Can't wait to get home and have a glass of this in ice."

Disc golf. Cornhole. Food truck (Craig O's). We had a great time.   Specialty cocktails are a little off (and a little weak). Order your preferred cocktail and you'll be fine.   Didn't do the tour or tasting. Maybe next time."

Hahaha kidding but really this place was awesome, even though it was a day with drizzle still enjoyed it! First off the staff is beyond sweet, so warm and welcoming! The drinks were great and good price! Such a fun vibe with good music. Very mellow way to spend a Sunday afternoon. So happy they had a kids area because both my 8 year old and 2 year old had a blast and stayed busy so I could enjoy a delicious Bloody Mary. They have awesome lawn games to keep busy and a delicious pizza food truck parked on site. We will for sure be back!! Do yourself a favor and pay it a visit it was a lot better than most of the distilleries I've visited."

Very shiny stainless steel still, immaculate polished concrete floors, easily the fanciest metL building I have seen!    And they have good liquor!  The tasting is informative and interesting, even if all of the idetails on the fancy bottles is a bit overwhelming.  But the real wolf is interesting.   Try it al!!  The Giddy'Up (horseradish) vodka is better than it sounds - and it makes a fantastic Bloody Mary!  Several things were good, but you must BUY this - it is excellent!"

It has one indoor bathroom and one little pizza truck -which the pizza was Okay- the kids play area is huge tires with again NO shade. Please don't even say you have a play area when the only thing they could climb on are tires that would give them second degree burns. The solo artist singing was probably the only good thing as we also got 3 different drinks and didn't even finish half of it because it was gross."

                "description": "We stumbled upon this sprawling alcohol paradise on our drive back to Austin from San Angelo.  We originally stopped because the BBQ food truck they have on the premises is rated very high, but the liquor turned out to be the real star. Hubby partook in a liquor tasting that cost $10 for multiple samples.  They have some very unique flavors that I've never heard of anyone incorporating in a liquor before.  I ordered a bourbon and lemonade drink that hit the spot in the Texas heat.  This was a Mecca for bachelorette parties and large groups of friends.  There is plenty of room on the property to spread out and enjoy the weather.  They also host concerts on their stage next to the tasting room.  They are planning to expand their offerings here, so stay tuned as to what they build!"

Small but nice distillery has tours and tastings with a large outdoor area for hanging out and a stage for occasional music acts. I didn't play but the frisbee golf looked great.  Rum, gin, fireball, and few other mixed spirits to sample.  I personally liked and purchased the gin. Low juniper the way I like it.  Odd wild eye logo is off putting but very friendly staff."

                "description": "Iron Wolf Ranch and Distillery is a welcome new addition to the ever quickly expanding distillery scene in the Texas Hill Country.  The owners are a wonderful husband and wife team that we had the pleasure to chat with for awhile during our visit.  We visited soon after their opened, and I have been trying to find a chance to get back ever since.  When you drive up to the tasting room and production site you immediately know this is a special spot.  Their 15 acre property has been planned and well thought out.  The current building, known as the \"Still House\", is just one of several future buildings that they have envisioned to have onsite.  The \"Still House\" provides space for onsite production and a tasting room. They also have expansive space surrounding the building for the whole family to come out and enjoy.  They have huge oaks shading the property.  Elevated decks with cozy seating and beautiful 360 views. A fire pit, bocci ball green, human size beer pong, washers, horse shoes, and a 9 disc golf course.  Did I also mention the amazing sand box for the kids!  You could easily pack a picnic and make a day of it here.    For a nominal fee you can taste a selection of their spirits, or just purchase a crafted cocktail.  Their spirit options are Gin, Rum, Vodka, and Horseradish infused Vodka.  They also have two flavored Whiskeys - Iron Hot, which is a Whiskey with all natural cinnamon and sweeteners blended with Texas peppers. I saved the best for last. Their Hotscotch, which is Whiskey blended with natural butterscotch flavors and Texas Peppers.  It is sweet meets spicy.  All the spirits were well done. But Hotscotch was my favorite. Something unique.  I have enjoyed it in my apple cider!    A fantastic space, with great drinks, and awesome people. It doesn't get much better than this.  It will be great too see how this place grows and expands in the future."

Skip the crowd at Rock Rose Ave and come to Adlbert's instead. Not a single thing I would change about Adelbert's!    Adelbert's serves more than just brews, they also serve ciders, meads, wines, and non-alcoholic beverages. If you have never had meads, I'd start slow with a sample, as it's very potent in flavor! The Dale was refreshing, while the Sauvignon Blanc was a crisp white wine.   If you are wanting to host events of any kind, Adelbert's is here for it. Scott, the owner and Sean, the manager are incredibly accommodating!! They were so sweet to open early and to even allow the food truck on site to help cater to us. If you are looking for a quick tour, you can ask them as well to check out their facilities."

Unfortunately, they do not allow dogs inside. As a dog owner who lives in the brewery district, this establishment is simply off my list anytime I go out with my little gal.   I do love this place but it's hard to give a perfect score to a place I can't frequent. Especially when they have ~10 competitors in a 5 minute radius and none of them share the same policy. As a result, I am updating my review from 5 to 4 stars."

                "description": "I'm a fan of dark Belgian style beer that's not too sweet so Adalbert's gets five stars right away.  I love the Philosophizer and the October Rust.  There seems to be good social distancing. There's hand sanitizer on the counter. Growlers are a possibility as are CDB sodas. The people are friendly and seem to know about the beer. I only discovered this place after the pandemic it started so I've never really spent time inside. But I've been sitting on my own porch enjoying it quite a bit and when things get back to normal I hope to spend a few hours at Adelbert's."

The GM proceeded to stay late with us and show us the absolute best of the best mead I have ever had. He was amazing the bartender was amazing and if I ever re-vist Austin this is a must have on the to do list. Do NOT miss out on this amazing experience. Do not go to Austin beer works this place is literally 10x better if not more."

The neat thing is that they have artwork that's for sale on the walls. The art adds character and is a large variety of different themes all from local artists.   No good is served inside the brewery but there is a really good food truck on the outside.   The beers are amazing and you can sample before you buy.  Liked this brewery and beers are very creative."

They have a food truck outside with I think chicken I usually just get the fresh popped popcorn it's delicious and great to snack on while drinking beer. They have a Nintendo Wii with Mario kart and two old-school arcade games they also have a Foos ball table and darts. There's also boardgames that you can check out with giving them your ID, an awesome place to hang out with friends, kids and dogs!"

                "description": "I had my first Adelbert's beer through HEB, with their Naked Nun witbier. I have been hooked since then and finally made it into their tasting room.   It. Was. Heaven. They have an outdoors area that's shaded for those with doggos or who want to enjoy the heat and eat from their food truck. I had the Triple B, which was surprisingly crisp and floral for a belgian. They had a variety of beers which I wanted to taste, but we arrived late with one hour to spare before closing. That just means I need to pay another visit to truly enjoy the place.  They have a private parking area shared with neighboring businesses and strong wifi. The best part is the indoors games like 4-player Mario Kart (WHAT!), darts, and a bunch of board games. They also give free stickers, plus our lady taptender that day was so kind and welcoming."

However I checked out their site, saw they had some wine options and a food truck--so I happily tagged along. The bartender who greeted us gave us the rundown of everything. Served us with a smile and was very informative about the beers, of course. I had a great bottle of pinot grigio while my friends enjoyed the various beers available. I had a great time checking out the art that they have on the walls for sale. We also played a game of jumbo sized connect four and Mario Kart on the big screen. A large collection of board games are also available to borrow while hanging out enjoying your drink in the taproom. Very cool place, warm vibes. Great food truck on site as well.  Definitely will return soon and bring my beer drinking friends."

Get the wristband if you're a first timer- only $15 for six \"half pours\" which are definitely more like 3/4 pours haha  The mango wit, naked nun, and hibiscus saison are AMAZINGGG.   Cool art, live music, food truck (although they left early, which sucked).  The only real disappointment? The brewery closes at 10- we coulda stayed all night!"

                "description": "Three words: Belgium style brews! Oh my goodness, where have you been hiding from me Adelbert's?! This is by far one of my most favorite craft breweries in all of Austin, if not in the United States. For those of you that really know me, you know that I L.O.V.E. Belgian beers...so much so that, yes, I traveled to Belgium JUST for the beers (okay, I ate some mussels and saw some pretty cool stuff too, but...). For those of you not in the know (no insult meant for those who are), Belgian style beers are pretty high in ABV, so amateurs enter gently. Just looking out for my Yeeps! :D  Adelbert's doesn't look like much at all from the outside. Tucked away in a warehouse district, it can a tad difficult to find, particularly at night - just look for the little white lights and the picnic tables outside. Park, walk through the plastic flat \"doors\" and you will discover a beautiful huge space with stacks and stacks of barrels, merchandise for sale, lots of local art hanging on the walls to purchase adds to the ambiance; plus games to play such as giant Jenga, foosball, and darts and that's one fine outing.   But the beer! Oh my gosh - the beer. Handcrafted at its best. So amazingly fantastic and such a great deal. On your first visit be certain to buy the 6 half pour (really close to full pours - yay) tastings for $13. You get to keep the glass and get $2 off beers when you bring it back on your next visit. Regular prices range from $4-6 a glass, which is phenominal in the first place for such high quality ale.   ALL great, two personal standouts for me were: *Flyin' Monks Quadrupel: 10.9%ABV, aged in rum barrels with hints of spice, deep, dark, and lovely. *Philosophizer Saison: An easy choice. 7.8% ABV, very mild carbonation with a hint of pepper. Fantastic.     To add some icing to this already oh so sweet find, the founder and brewmaster Scott and staff cannot be any more friendly or knowledgeable about the beers and brewery.   Highly highly highly recommend. Simply doesn't get better than this IMHO. Cheers!  TIPS:  *The brewery has a license so you can take a large bottle home for a reasonable price of about $9 to $12, which is average. They also sell retail at area Austin locations (visit their website for exact locations).  *Tours are available (see website for details).   *They typically have a food truck on site on Saturdays.  *Fido friendly pergola area - not allowed inside."

                "description": "Ya'll are probably already aware of my latest and greatest obsession with collecting pint glasses from assorted breweries. For our first stop in Austin, we stopped by this unassuming warehouse. As we walked in, the live jazz band was jammin' and the beer taps were flowin'.   Michael and his bearded friend were fantastic bartenders. I really appreciated their hospitality. Michael instantly could tell I was new to this particular brewery and proceeded to explain the process to tasting their beer samples. He even noted that I had a minor with me and offered a brewed hibiscus tea for him. They really cater to all ages! We paid $13 for six half poured samples from a souvenir Belgian tasting glass. One yellow wristband later, my siblings and I were playing ping-pong and giant Jenga in the back of the warehouse.  The stringed lights on the ceiling made it feel welcome and homey. They had a wall of local art for sale ranging from $30-$300! I had my eye on a Sinatra painting, and as luck would have it, it was indeed the $300 piece lol. I stared at it longingly for most of the night, but couldn't bring myself to throw down on it. My favorite craft brews of the night were the Naked Nun and the Philosophizer. Brilliant names and great hoppy flavors.  Once it got too muggy in the taproom, we ventured out to get some grub. The food truck of the night was Emoji Grilled Cheese. (See their yelp site for my review) It was mouthwatering and delicious. We visited a couple other breweries throughout our trip, but Adelbert's was my all-time favorite.   Thanks for a great time!   -xoxoxo"

                "description": "Great place to spend an afternoon. This another place where you pay a fee, get a glass and then you get 6 pours of whatever they have on tap. I could only do 4 pours due to a time constraint but what I had was very tasty. The mango wit was a standout for me as I could actually taste the mango unlike some other brews which lose that flavor in the process. Black Rhino was also very tasty. Besides the good beers the place has TVs and games and most importantly art to sell! If I hadn't been flying on that trip there were a couple of pieces I was interested in. Overall a worthy stop in Austin instead of having to drive to Dripping Springs for good beer."

I wish that they had more food options when you drink and or a bar that you can walk up to, but all good things come to those who wait!!   My second time around I ordered a cheese tray from a local artist and brought it to eat outside. It was perfect. My husband loves their beers and always asks to go their before our date nights!

                "description": "This little watering hole is what I love about Johnson City. Cold beer, good music, pool tables. Here you can find a mix of blue collar native locals and your more affluent transplants. JC has grown so much and its population changed that I can come here and easily not be recognized.   The service here is friendly, yet endearingly salty enough. Salty in that weathered Central Texas way that you can't find anywhere else. Hon, need another beer?  Next door is the Hot Mess Pizza truck. You will see many people here washing down a delicious hot fresh pizza with some cold Lone Star.   I highly recommend this place for the reasonable prices and the unique atmosphere."

Amazing selection of beers and the bartenders were so friendly that if we lived I. The area I would certainly make this a regular stop. As it is, we will make it a point to stop in when we visit the area. Both places were absolutely great finds."

                "description": "Hell yeah. A great local watering hole with a story, great ownership and service, and a more than fine beer selection. Local flavor at its finest.  Mike and Leslie used to run a construction equipment rental business out of this location. 2008 hit and they closed their doors in 2010. Years later after the family got into home brewing and good beer in general, they started over with a new business model: a local bar with an excellent beer selection - And wine, too. Local brews, too.  The building is awesome. Repurposed buildings like this make for some of the best bars and restaurants. It's gritty and has character. The decorations are cool. They have a smoking and non-smoking side. Cinder blocks and corrugated metal. The bar itself actually has some great wood and is well done. The patio is covered and was perfect for the family, including a play area for kiddos. (Mike and Leslie have a 3-year old grandson who needed a spot!) Nice breeze out back, too.  Good local hangout. Fun talking to Ron, a 20-year local and supporter of the bar. Funny - most of the locals were enjoying Bud and Whatever Light instead of the excellent draft selection. Hope they have enough demand to keep those great beers on draft! They've been open 2 years, so they're off to a great start. Mike and Leslie themselves work the bar, so you know you'll get great service.  Cheers, y'all!"

A rustic but clean establishment, it is definitely worth a stop in if you find yourself in the area. The staff is super friendly as well, bonus!

Whether its your regular Bud Light, Lone Star or unique imported craft beers, the list of choices is impressive. The owner Mike is also the bartender, super laid back guy who knows his craft beers and wines (which he has 6 or 7 of on tap alongside 25 local craft brews.) The atmosphere of the bar is cozy, a little rustic with amazing artwork on the walls. By the way most of the art you will see there were done by Mike. If you haven't been to TAPZ you are missing out on a one of a kind place."

After a day of fun with the family tubing in New Braunfels we headed to Austin to try Slab BBQ which we had seen on YouTube and It didn't disappoint!  The staff was amazing we had the nachos, the donk sandwich and ribs ... it was amazing!!! The nachos great amount of cheese and bbq!!! The donk was so good, meat was falling of my bun and I forgot about my table manners and I was picking it up with my hands!! The ribs are so tender and awesome no bbq sauce was needed! and   The staff was so kind they gave us free banana pudding but we all were so full we could only take a bite. I ate my banana pudding for breakfast the next morning and enjoyed it with my coffee, the banana pudding was light and sweet; simple amazing!!  Sorry we didn't take pictures ... the food looked so good we all just dove in an ate our food! (We forgot about our posts and timelines) The food is awesome best first restaurant visit ever! (Even though it is inside a bowling alley)"

Perfect amount of spice rub, tender, fatty, delicious. Can't wait to go back and have a full plate."

One of the items I ordered was nachos, and the queso wasn't even completely melted. As I was pouring the queso on top of my nachos, two massive chunks of unmelted cheese (at least I hope that's what they were) came plopping out. Also, the brisket wasn't warm, as if it had been recently pulled from a refrigerator but not heated. So disappointing! Do better, SLAB!"

                "description": "This review is based solely on the food of our last visit. Our first experience with Slab was ordering a smoked turkey for Thanksgiving of 2020, and it was one of the best turkey's we've ever had. Smokey, moist, and lovely. But, since turkey is not a regular meat on their menu I am reviewing strictly on our last meal.   While down in S. ATX, I stopped in to give the restaurant a true try. Upon walking in, the menu was posted on the wall, but confusing. All we saw were sandwiches, no mention of meat by the 1/2 pound or pound and no price. Would be cool to know what options we have with a little signage. Is this a sandwich spot or a BBQ joint? Long/short, they did let us do 1/2 pound orders, so got some brisket, a few sides, and some beers.   Sides were solid. Twice baked potato salad and the smoked mac/cheese were both great. The brisket on the other hand was meh. Maybe i'm spoiled with Texas brisket and its smokey, red tinted smoke ring and crust. So it was a little sad to get something that was not that. The meat, while tender, was almost more like a pot roast. Seems like they take inspiration from many different styles (KC, Carolina, TX, etc) with sauces, so maybe this was the point, and I'm sure slathered with sauce and tossed on a bun it's probably pretty good. But if i'm going tit for tat on sliced brisket, elsewhere will allow you to fly closer to the Texas sun.    Not sure we'll be back if we're wanting true BBQ, but if we're in the mood for a BBQ style sando, we may swing by."

The tender, flavorful melt in your mouth, slap yo daddy and kick your cat good brisket. Tasty sweet BBQ sauce. Classic queso and what makes the whole plate a hit...chopped up pickles. A little burst of crisp vinegar to cut the richness of the cheese is a bite of what I hope clouds would taste like.   We drive from San Antonio to eat here and you should too.

                "description": "We were looking for a BBQ lunch spot and SLAB delivers! The meats are smoked to perfection and because we couldn't decide on what to try we got two of the best sampler options on the menu - the slider trio (chicken, pork, brisket) and the epic DONK sammich (all the meats - chicken, pork, brisket, sausage and all the sauces). We also tried two of their sides because YOLO - Gouda Mac and the twice baked potato casserole. Legit, UNBELIEVABLY good. My favorite out of the slider trio was the chicken - sauces were on point, chicken was tender and juicy. The Mac and cheese was EPIC - it's a wet Mac which I love. Super creamy, smoked Gouda is just divine. Twice baked tots were also good (but my heart belongs to the Mac). If you're here for epic then go with the DONK. Single portion was HUGE but it delivers on flavor! Stacked high with meats it's also smothered in delicious sauces, crunchy onions and jalapeños. Honestly, will come back for that! Beer selection is fantastic. Get you some SLAB!"

I haven't tried anything other than those items because they are just so good every time. They make their own bbq sauces which are for sale I believe, my favorite is the dank white!"

                "description": "I've been a long time Patron of Slab off of the Burnett Location and this New Location doesn't disappoint.   Sometimes when there's a new location, there's a drop in quality, but not here.   Its actually 2x bigger, nice and bright, just missing the Hip Hop Feel of the original location.   If you like BBQ or BBQ sandwiches, then this is the spot for you.   They gots a variety of meats for your meat eaters, sorry, I'm not a vegetarian so I don't know what they got for folks here.   The Nachos are awesome, prob best to share than eat alone.  If you don't know what you like, give the Trio Sampler a try, its a very nice place to start.   All the other sandwiches are massive (and good), and will prob put me in the hospital if I eats them again, so my goto sandwich is the McDowell, oh man, puts the McRib or any Pork Rib to shame, its executed so well.  Always tender fall off the bone rib mean between your choice of bun, bbq sauce, and pickles, so good.   The Sides are ok, but the Desert is the best, the OG cookie is so drip!   Give this place a try, its great!"

The nachos were big. Between the two of us, we had 1 slider each and about 1/4 of the nachos each. I didn't even have enough room to try the casserole... tomorrow's lunch for sure.   We'll definitely order from SLAB again!"

Their staff is always friendly and professional. Stop by their tasting room and say hi to Melissa or Marcus for a great tasting experience. Marco at the brewery is sure to steer you in the right direction for beer lovers and a great time at the restaurant. The grounds are lovely and you're sure to come away with many Instagram worthy photo ops!"

                "description": "Accommodations were very good, the room was super clean and really nice. I loved that they were villas so you're not sharing common space with anyone else during Covid.  The spa not being open was a big bummer. It was partially the reason we chose here so that was disappointing.  The staff was nice, they were super welcoming.  There is no daily cleaning or maid service due to Covid.  Nice location being a short 20 minutes or so to Fredericksburg.  There are numerous wineries between here and there to keep you entertained! I like that they had on site live music (one night instead of the two advertised though) and loved the open area with bandstand, comfy chairs and cornhole games to entertain.  Overall, a solid 4/5 but once spa is open and \"normal\" post Covid life resumes, I'm sure this will be a 5 star location.  We will come again and will update after we do."

                "description": "We really wanted to love this place, here goes the story... We had reservations for a Saturday arrival, we called and spoke with the most unpleasant human on this planet named (Becca-Becky-Rebecca) you get the idea, not sure on the spelling so lets go with (B) - The interaction went something like this:   (Scott): Hi, we have a confirmation for checking in on Saturday, we noticed the check-in time is 4pm, we have a wedding to attend at 5pm... is there any chance to check-in slightly early maybe 3-3:30 so we have time to get ready, and also make the 30 minute drive to the venue?   (B): What is your definition of early since you stated the check-in time is 4pm which is the actual check-in time.   (Scott): Oh, ok.. well let me get with the wife and figure it out, thanks. Bye.   (B): Phone Click  Now I'm basically just flabbergasted at that point, like whoa... did this really just happen?   Long story short, we called in the following days and decided to cancel the reservation, we spoke with Susan who was amazing, and apologized! She Stated that (B) comes across that way sometimes, and she will bring it up to her. Anyways, it's sad that (B) was the ultimate factor in the loss of revenue for the resort. Being a Titanium Elite Marriot member, I average over 75 nights a year at various hotels, NEVER in my life have I had a similar interaction. Wish we got to try the wine, maybe another time....."

There is plenty of space here so you can unwind and enjoy the company of your party. I especially enjoyed their sparkling peach wine - I could have easily polished off more if I didn't have to drive! It was very crisp and refreshing. Service was friendly and attentive as well."

                "description": "4 star review, mainly for the beautiful setting they've created. It's pretty ingenious to put up a resort and spa out in Hill country. They're going to make a ton when things get back to \"normal.\" It's connected to the 290 brewery and restaurant where we ate dinner. They provided us complimentary wine tasting. I wouldn't go home to mom on the wines but the food we ordered hit the spot. We sat inside where it was easy to socially distance and enjoy our meals and tastings. Outside was packed and people were definitely not distancing over the holiday weekend. I think the brewery could do a better job at pushing tables further apart to try to account for this. The service was a bit slow but nothing to complain about since we were enjoying the AC room.   some of the disappointments were more towards the resort. They seemed to be a little understaffed since we couldn't even check in at 5 when the booking said check in started at 4. The pool was packed the evening prior which meant no clean towels when we went the morning of our check out. The continental breakfast was cheap and limited to individual prepackaged muffins, cereal, cereal bars and yogurt. I understand covid limits what they could cook, but even hard boiled eggs wouldn't be that difficult.  The staffing was otherwise welcoming and friendly and wearing face masks. Parking is limited to the upper area so you have to walk down to your cabin. Would also recommend a better walk way to the restaurant, but we loved the wild flowers and it was a nice reprieve from the day in the sun."

We were able to choose five wines from the extensive list of award winning wines. He graciously poured the wines we chose, with knowledgeable notes and recommendations. The Grenache Rose, dry and tasty. Plateau Red was a delicious blend. Tempranillo true to the varietal. The Brut was a delightful and Dominum Tinto Port so luscious. Cody was Texas friendly and a true ambassador of the wine region."

                "description": "Not at all what I was expecting! We were very disappointed overall. We planned an overnight near Fredericksburg and booked here fully expecting to visit the restaurant which is only open Thursday through Sunday. We were staying on a Tuesday night. We also planned to book spa services but the spa isn't open yet.  After attempting to turn onto the driveway which has no lights near it whatsoever we had to u-turn further up the road and attempt again. Not being from the area, you cannot see the driveway at all so I'd definitely suggest arriving before nightfall.  Upon arriving at reception, the representative had the personality of a turtle. She was not friendly nor rude. She was merely there. It was a \"No, the restaurant isn't open. No, the spa opens next year.\"  It'd been nice to know this prior to booking as we would've booked elsewhere. The price point wasn't cheap through Hotels.com either for nothing being open at $160 + tax.  Our room was beautiful and smelled like new construction. The room itself was a perfect suite and would accommodate three people perfectly with a twin pull-out couch in the living area and a king bed in the bedroom. We really loved the bathroom with double vanity, large shower and separate water closet.  The room included a small refrigerator, coffee pot and bathrobes. Although the bathrobes are not \"one size fits all\" and tend to run on the smaller side.  Overall we'd stay here again if the price point were the same or close to the same and the resort is more operational."

                "description": "Beautiful vacay spot during the pandemic when you don't want to fly. Sure, the wine won't taste like Napa Valley or Santa Ynez, but beggars can't be choosers during a pandemic. However, the owner started his first winery in Temecula in 2003.  We received two vouchers at check in for either a tasting or a single glass of wine.  The overnight resort is GORGEOUS! I wished they delivered meals from the Old 290 Brewery, but I understand it's covid. Each villa has its own separate entrance so there's no risk of catching covid from other guests. These are brand new villas, only one year old, and they're beautifully built! Beautiful upgraded bathrooms and everything is new. There are two tvs in each villa plus a gas fireplace! Four star hotel which allows dogs!  It's located fifteen minutes from Andalucia Distillery, Hill Country Lavender, and the Exotic Resort Zoo."

EXCEPT.... the Migas from  the breakfast menu, The Migas are terrible. Hands down the absolute worst Migas I've ever had. There is no eggs at all in the meal, what kind of Migas has no eggs? it's just bad.  Their \"Migas\" are really more like brisket nachos. They need to either rename the meal to Nachos, or revamp it, or just remove it from the menu. So.... Stay here for a great time but just DO NOT order the Migas for breakfast."

                "description": "Visited this place for a recent meeting and let me say this is one of the few wineries and maybe only winery with resort style accommodations. From the moment we checked in we were promptly greeted and given our rooms. While visiting we had the opportunity to eat lunch and dinner at this place and the food was really great! Kudos to the chef for the wonderful food and great pairings of wines. This was truly a fantastic visit and stay. While having lunch one day, we got to meet and visit with the owner Jim was who a great and friendly man and made us feel very welcome. He introduced to balsamic vinegar and it was amazing! This is definitely a must buy when visiting. Additionally, he told his story about this winery and it was a great story! Some employees who really stood out were Sheldon, Ethan, Marcus, and Dee! Thank you to the entire Carter creek staff for making our stay and meeting an excellent one. We will definitely be back to enjoy the Carter creek experience! If you are in the area, this is must stop especially on Fridays and Saturdays when they have some live bands. Nothing beats a hill county evening with some wine, food and friends."

There were no microwaves in the rooms which is a very basic amenity for hotel rooms. The grounds were beautifully landscaped and the villas were very clean and nice. The restaurant on the property was not open on Monday and Tuesday. This was also a huge disappointment. You receive two vouchers per room for the wine tasting on property.

Only downfall is price but that's probably not something that can be controlled and not even a biggie. It could be worth it bc it seems like 6 people could stay in one suite.

                "description": "We waited until Slackers released their own brews to visit. It's great to have another brewpub open in the CP area. Slackers is located hard off 620 in the same strip mall as Interstellar BBQ.Hmmmm BBQ and beer, OK.  Slackers currently have 3 Slacker brews available and a slew of local and not so local taps. Their Belgium lager is a perfect beer to sip on a sunny day.  Round 2 was a Brooklyn amber lager. This brought back memories of our NYC trip and discovering the Brooklyn Brewery. This is a great representation of what an amber beer should be.   There are alternatives to beer such as wine. Got the munchies they have you covered. Check out their menu online.  The brewpub is very welcoming with a bar area and plenty of seating. Games are available and even a foosball table. Outside there are a few picnic benches where you can enjoy the sunshine and bring your mutt. Folks on both sides of the bar are friendly and if you are there for more than 10 minutes you are engaged in a conversation with a fellow pubster (sic)  One nit servers should be able to answer questions regarding their guest taps.   A solid 4 plus stars and Slackers is now in our brewpub rotation. Support Local!"

                "description": "Went there last night, the place is awesome! Currently they don't have their own beer, supply issues but they have some amazing Austin, Texas and other craft beers. Family friendly spot (a kids play area with kitchen and all!!),good music playlist and eventually some live music. They just have snacks right now but eventually said they'll have a menu. Oh yah and coffee too. We got to meet Derek and his wife, the owners. This is such a great spot to go and work or to relax at after work! Will definitely be back and can't wait to watch this business grow.  We were having so much fun I forgot to take pictures! I'll update with pictures next time I go."

We decided we didn't need to bother reserving space as many people would come and go during the day. Ultimately most people stayed as the beer, coffee, and food were great. We were also able to secure about four continuous tables which was great to host our family and friends.   I plan to come back as I've heard their beers are gluten reduced as well."

The beertender literally saw me walk in off 6th before a tech bro on the side closest to him, saw me, then proceeded to serve the other guy...the line was so short with only 2 people (one of which was me. So I walked over to the other area and he walked away. Luckily another server saw me and helped. Not sure if he was judging me bc I was wearing a mask (I'm traveling hence being in Austin)...but check your self brah. If this review was based on him alone, I'd say f--- this place.   BUT I'm basing this review on my beer experience and that is a solid 3-4 star. I had the winter warmer during my first visit and it was tastier than others I've had. More recently I had the lightning wolf IPA which was a bit more watered down than i was expecting. Still flavorful, less hazy than I thought it would be, and very subtle."

The atmosphere is great for hanging, day drinking, or even work related meetings. They have a huge patio space and the inside is also nice to hang.  Overall where they excel at, is their tacos! I got the carnitas and asada thinking $4 for a taco was too much... but then I got them and they are bigger than expected. My bf got the two chicken tacos and we ate them soooo slow just because they had so much flavor and the meat was so tender. I'd go just for the tacos every time. Hats off to the cook!"

I wouldn't say it was the best or most authentic street tacos but it hit the spot just fine. It's a dog friendly place but if you're wanting to sit inside, let's aren't allowed because it's against health code. They have plenty of seating outdoors and you can also reserve a room for reservations if you have a big party. Beer was good and they also have a 20% off promo for wine if you order a whole bottle on Tuesdays!"

                "description": "Thursday late afternoon - stopped by here to check out yet another brewery on the street. Mostly packed with people working on laptops, but the open air setup doesn't make it feel too crowded.  Was able to quickly get a seat at the bar and order from the scannable menus. Decided on the Prodigal Pills ($6) to go along with a Breakfast Taco ($3.50). Pilsener is light and crushable, though not much flavor. Breakfast taco comes out fast - packed with eggs, cheese, pico de gallo, and bacon. Thankfully not a stale tortilla and even balance of ingredients. Finished the day off with the Double Predestination IPA ($7)- definitely more of a kick, possible some overkill on the hops.   Service is a bit hectic as the bartenders work off the many tables. Fine spot to relax, especially outside where there are tables available."

Their guacamole and tacos were good and so was their beer selection. I honestly don't remember which one we got, but just had whatever the servers recommended and they were all good.  The outdoor seating area was nice at night with the hanging lights and is dog friendly (always a bonus for us!).   Street parking is close to impossible to find in the area, but there's paid garage parking. It is pricey, but the only spot we were able to find that wasn't too far from Lazarus."

I got a Disco Prophet, a strawberry lemonade sour, and a Big Sky IPA - delicious and refreshing.  But the real star was the appetizers. We got chips and fresh guacamole, which paired excellently with the beer. But the real winner was the fried chickpeas, which were like seasoned corn nuts! I've never had anything like that, and it's enough for 3-4 people to share, despite only being $3.  The place was clean, staff was friendly, and there was plenty of seating. Definitely a must-see brewery if you're in the area."

Showed up on a Thursday evening for dinner and was impressed with the amount of people who were here. There is picnic table seating out back with tents in the front for additional seating. There is also plenty of seating inside. There is plenty of seating but the like to order may take some time to get through, so plan accordingly.   I went with the torta as my meal. The bread was authentic and the fillings inside were great. If I had to change one thing I would have asked to get the torta with chorizo although it isn't listed as a protein for the sandwich.   This is a great local spot to check out and a place I will most likely be a regular at."

                "description": "This place has plenty of outdoor seating with fans that keep the flies at bay mostly. The inside was nice and they have everything you'd need to hit the spot. Tacos and beer.   The beer was pretty good. The only sour beer they had at the time was a Rosé flavored one that unfortunately tasted a little too much like wine, but was still digestible. My hazy IPA was not hazy at all, but was still fine. I wish the beers were served a bit colder.   The fried chickpeas were a good deal for $3 we thought they could serve like 10 people. The 2 of us only made a dent in like 1/5 of the bowl. But hey, they're snacky so maybe someone could down the whole thing if they really wanted to!  The carnitas taco was really good. I highly recommend it. The al pastor was alright but didn't pack the flavor punch of the carnitas. I doused my tacos in the free salsa that was in a mini fridge nearby. The red salsa was so good and added a layer of light smokiness to my tacos. But then after a while I thought I sensed some heat? I assumed it was the green salsa so I continued to douse my tacos in the red. Idk it must have been the red salsa that was hot, because by the end of my meal I was feeling sick to my stomach. Never felt that way from spice but needless to say the beer didn't taste too good after that either. Luckily I recuperated by sipping 2 glasses of their Yeti water until I didn't want to vomit anymore.   I can't place my distaste after this meal on the restaurant since it was mostly my own doing . I assume they label their salsas and I just didn't see it."

                "description": "Hands down the best brewery experience we encountered in Austin. It's a little bit if everything and that's not at all a bad thing as without exception they are all done well. We saw they were open early so we went in on a weekday thinking we could knock this off our list of a full day planned. We weren't real clear on their hours entailed so there was a not so unwelcome idea of a little day / morning drinking to get the day started. We realized this was going to leave us with the opportunity to have a few small samples or perhaps one nice pour. Upon our arrival we were impressed at how the location spanned the corner of the street and had many \"compartments\" of seating areas. I'm no way were Amy of them on the smaller side. Street parking was easy enough and we headed on in.   Very impressed to be greeted with smiling faces along with plenty of good morning exchanges. We were very pleasantly surprised to see they offered an array of espresso drinks. What a welcome pivot to our plan. We ordered up and came to realize they had food as well. Pretty happy about that. There were the assorted pastry items and breakfast TACOS! I noticed there was also queso fondido on the menu and that was screaming please try me. I went to order and was told this item is generally served later in the day. I suspect my sadness to hear this news showed as there was a quick offer to fire up the required kitchen equipment to make this happen (the salamander for those curious).   The lattes were delicious. So much so we ordered up a second round. Near completion of those the awesome cheesy chorizo goodness arrived. Bubbly hot and looking superb. It was all I could do to keep myself from grabbing a chip and putting a scoop of this bubbling sub nuclear cheese in my mouth at the price of completely burning my entire mouth. With a little patience I snuck a few small bites being mindful to blow as to not scorch my mouth. OMG was this delicious in every aspect.   Right away we knew this was just fine with a latte but was screaming for a beer to accompany this perfect breakfast fast. Such an awesome selection of beers. The bartender was beyond sweet and gave us many short pull samples of the tappers. I landed on the one that worked for me. My wife found one that worked well for her. By the time the beers arrived it was clear this was not going to be a short stop. Instead it was clear this was our impromptu plan for the morning. Completely five star experience from the word go. So much so we took the liberty of an evening stop later that week. The vibe of this place was so cool with any hint of pretentiousness. I'm no expert on all the brew options in Austin but this was clearly number one for us based on all it included and the absolute outstanding hospitality from the coffee bar to the bartender to the cook who brought us the miraculously amazing queso. No matter you plans I would highly suggest  in fact nearly insist this is a stop not to be missed. This reviews has been locked in draft land fir a while but there is no doubt this place is still thriving and for all the right reasons."

                "description": "This place is awesome and maybe a little too family friendly.   So 5 soul owns all the property that the brewery is also on. When we went there, they had 2 food trucks. One did pizza and salads and the other hamburgers and other food.   Inside of 5 souls is wicked cool.  We tried many of the red wine and they were alright.    The staff is super friendly and patient.  They also have non alcoholic  daiquiri  for the kids. Just a few flavors, but the kids enjoyed them. Of course they did they are just like smaller but more expensive Slushies.   The wine itself is pretty good and a tad on the pricey side IMO. $12/glass or $36 per bottle. But the atmosphere is so darn cool. It's probably one our favorite places to go to right now. Unfortunately or maybe fortunately they are an hour away."

                "description": "Not 5 Souls, but 5 Soul.  This isn't really a winery, the grapes come from far, far away, from the land of California. This wine bar seems to be the alternative to the brewery across the lawn. This is part of a larger complex of pickle ball courts, disc golf course, brewery, and artificially turfed biergarten. This is a very family friendly place. Like one other yelper said, maybe too family friendly. \"Mommy! That's your fourth drink already!\" Don't mind screaming babies? Love having kids come and interrupt your drinking to ask questions? This is the place. Children are largely unattended here- you're drinking in a big play area. In fact, you can rent the wine bar for your tyke's birthday party! There's plenty of things for them to do. Whoever thinks it's appropriate to bring their children to a brewery and get upset when you curse ?  They serve up charcuterie plates that are prepackaged. They're in the fridge. The wine comes in pretty bottles. Based on the price points, it's encouraged to just get a bottle instead of going glass by glass. My favorite thing about this place is that they have (G-Rated) games to play, so everyone can play!  Parking was a bit of a challenge, but the place is clean, well lit and easily accesible."

                "description": "5 Soul is easily one of the coolest wine bars and tasting rooms I have ever been to. Co-located at the same address on Bob Wire Road as Frontyard Brewing, this facility is an impressive one. Their tasting room had lots of space - both indoors and out.   The indoor space was open and airy with tons of natural light from floor to ceiling windows and a modern interior. The service here is also a highlight as we noticed that everyone = the servers, bar managers and the owners were ALL making sure that everyone's experience was top notch. We found them to all be very friendly and personable - like those cool neighbors that you REALLY want to hang out with. One thing I liked is that this tasting room also had great energy to it - something that is missing from a LOT of tasting rooms and even some breweries.   Outside, the covered patio is large with plenty of seating for friends, families. The yard is extensive - an amazing space to bring your kiddos and just let them play and have fun.  This really is the kind of place that you wish was only 5 minutes (and not 45) from your house - so check them out."

                "description": "I chose this winery for my husband and I, because I found the \"Grape Escape,\" and it was seemingly a perfect choice. A full tasting + a glass of your favorite from the tasting + a pizza to share. (And I sprung for the custom-label bottle to go with it!) It was $40 a person -- closer to $45 each at checkout with fees and what not -- which I already thought was ridiculously well-price for what you get. But then, they blew us away with the location, service, quality, and overall experience. The tasting wasn't just a cookie-cutter preset selection. Our \"experience guide\" asked us what flavors we preferred and talked us through multiple options for our tastes. It was awesome! Now, I'm not a wine aficionado by any means, but our guide was clearly knowledgeable and passionate about his work. And I enjoyed all of the options he brought to the tasting for us. (My experience was that all of the wines were quite unique in flavor, and the tasting consisted of lots of new wine-types I'd never even heard of!) Then, icing on the cake: getting to pick a favorite to have a full glass of! *chef kiss*  The pizza ended up coming with a starter salad as well, which was a nice surprise. The food was delicious. Well made, not over-the-top, but rather just enough to satisfy our bellies and our palettes.   After finishing up with the Grape Escape, my husband and I went for a walk around the property on a trail that leads you around the vines and gives some awesome views. This was arguably my favorite part. The property is huge and gorgeous! But, it was a gloomy and COLD February day when we visited, so we will definitely be back to see the property in bloom and in warmer weather."

The founder of the winery, Madelyn, visited our table and we chatted for quite a while. Great plans for the future! Our meal was incredible. One person in our party said it was the best meal  she has ever had. That is quite a statement! We asked to see the chef.  Executive Chef Shawn graciously accepted our kudos and applause. We walked the property and will always remember the great experience and fabulous property views. Well done!"

                "description": "My daughter gave me the gift of her time, along with a 3-course meal and wine tasting, to honor a special occasion. We decided to make this a weekday outing, to minimize traffic and the possibility of large groups being at the winery.  We were promptly greeted and seated upon arrival. The dining room was largely empty, and we had superb service. This was our second visit to the winery, and we plan to return.   We tasted 7 wines in all, 3 of which were paired with the November menu of panzanella (a bread salad), fennel-crusted pork tenderloin, and cannoli. The wine pairings were excellent.   We were not big fans of the panzanella. It seemed to need additional ingredients to make it more interesting and less dry. The main course, however, was fabulous. The pork medallions were crusty and flavorful. The linguine accompaniment was wonderfully garlicky, making it almost possible to ignore that the pasta was overcooked. And the cannoli was excellent. I think of cannoli as a finger food; these mini cannoli were made pretty with their presentation but more messy to eat because of the chocolate sauce. The cannoli were served with a very good port wine.   All in all, we had a very nice meal and enjoyed the wines... which we drank. No spitting for us! We are not connoisseurs, but certainly enjoy good quality wine. Some of Flat Creek's are very good indeed.   This was not a cheap excursion, but the 2 hours we spent there were worth it. This would be a great place for a romantic date, and also worked well as a mother-daughter excursion. Flat Creek has other dining options that include pizza, and there's a disc golf course on the premises. Do make advance reservations for your visit, as this isn't a large establishment and can be a long (but pretty) drive from the Austin area."

We did \"the grape experience\" for 2 people which included wine flights for both of us and a pizza each. Payed $80 not including tax + tip left on site. When we purchased online, the description said one pizza per 2 people and 2 salads but when we arrived we were given a pizza each so we had lots of leftovers :) Pizza was just okay, nothing special. Salad was really good! It was probably my favorite part of the meal. I didn't love the wines I tried, but I do tend to go for sweeter wines and these were all pretty tart. Overall, I had a nice time and the staff were all very nice."

We met the new owner Neal and John the restaurant manager and they were genuinely amazing people. They initiated conversation, asked us if everything was going well and the owner took the time to come by our table to ensure we we were having a great time and thanked us for our visit. They understand that we could've chosen to spend our afternoon elsewhere so they were genuinely appreciated for our business. The food was amazing, the servers were attentive and courteous. Then later we met Clare, a young lady that came around and asked us what else they could do to make our visit even better. She brought some wines for us to try. Incredibly amazing experience. They're a family place where you can bring your kids, your pets without feeling that you're bothering anyone. They have plenty of seating areas and amazing views. Their wines are super good and the owner explained to us that they're going to start a renovation and having a new winemaker so I can't wait to see all the great things they will accomplish to make the experience even better! Wow hard to say because they're already exceeding my expectations!"

At one point we felt like Remy in that scene from Ratatouille, the one where he pairs the strawberry with some cheese and feels fireworks... yes, it was really that good!  Carmen was a priceless part of the already amazing experience, she was so friendly, enthusiastic and helpful! Ask for her to be your server if you can!

                "description": "It hurts me to write this review. We truly want every small business to thrive. My family and I went to the Vineyard on a Friday afternoon for an intimate celebration of my husband's birthday with our mom, dad and children, it ended in my 5-year old little one being verbally attacked by a man in the pavilion, who identified himself as 'the owner'.   We decided to try the disc golf course, and we loved our experience with Casey, he is a gem! Very knowledgeable about disc golf, and very accommodating. We let him and Madelyn (the owner's wife) know we were celebrating a birthday. The course was fun, but ridden with fire ants, red ants, sticker burs and bull nettle. It was not the polished experience we were expecting. But still fun for our family.   We finished disc golf, and returned to the pavilion around 6:00pm.  We ordered a large dinner, but since we were not offered to sit in the main seating area, we sat under the outdoor pavilion. We were in the pavilion for less than 5 minutes, and the adults arranged tables so our family could sit together (there is no waiter in the pavilion so we had to move tables on our own). During those few minutes my two small children were playing under the pavilion, not causing any harm or damage, just laughing and trotting around like kids do outside (he is 5 and she is 7).   Out of no where a man started verbally attacking my 5-year old. This man who looked to be in his 70s, was sitting at a table drinking bottles of wine with 2 other people. He continued to yell at the top of his lungs scaring me and my babies. They came running to me asking me why the man was yelling and whistling at them. It broke my heart. A complete stranger was attacking them for no apparent reason.   After protecting them, my dad and husband approached the man who was yelling the obscenities. This is when he identified himself as 'the owner'. He told us our children were 'out of control' and we needed to get them under control. I asked them what they were doing to display out of control behavior, and he didn't say a thing, besides he had guests with him and they were disrupting his evening. My father let the man know if we were going to be patrons of his business, we would not tolerate his verbal abuse of our 5 and 7 year old children. My father also told him, \"We don't yell at our kids like that and if he had a problem with the way our children were behaving he could have stood up and walked over while we were arranging our own tables and told us in a normal tone of voice the problem he saw.\"  After the incident, the man sat at his table continuing to drink wine for 45 minutes, and sadly never came back to our table to apologize to our children for scaring them because of his obscene behavior. As we left, both of my children continued to asked why he was so angry.   We now understand this pavilion is in 'the owners' front yard. On this evening Rick (the owner) had been drinking with friends and our family was interrupting their evening. His behavior not only made us feel the most unwelcome as paying customers, but was abusive and completely out of control, especially as 'the owner'.  We should have been able to have this conversation with the business owner. Unfortunately, he left the pavilion to go back to his house, and did not return or offer an apology.  ***Update in Response to Owners Apology Below***  Your apology ends with 'resolve any confusion or fears the children had regarding why they were reprimanded'. The main point of why this experience was so horrifying: No one should ever reprimand a 5-year old child, except that child's guardians. If there was an issue with a child's safety, that concern should have been directed to the guardians who were standing between the children and the owner. Never should a stranger, much less a 70-year old man who is consuming alcohol ever 'reprimand' a child, ever! Of course of case the outcome was severe harm to the child, in this case, our 5-year old was not in severe danger.  Regarding the excuse that you 'witnessed dangerous behavior, and you had to immediately intervene': If there are components of your business that are dangerous to patrons, you should immediately remove these hazards, so that they don't become a safety issue. If you feel your deck boxes are not safe, you should store them in a storage facility where patrons do not have access.   Regarding your comment that 'you wish to leave discipling to parents but are forced to intervene when there is a safety concern': We were a party of 4 adults, and we were less than 10 feet away from our children. While we were bussing our own tables and arranging furniture, we were not aware my 5- year old sat on the 'deck box' and got down by jumping off. This type of 'danger' (i.e. sitting on a sitting area, and jumping off something that is no more than 2 feet off the ground) should not elicit the response of 'discipline' by a stranger, or 'immediate' intervention."

                "description": "Covid/\"reopening\" June review.   Signage not great, and cell reception can be spotty, so be sure to download the map to your cell phone in advance.   Beautiful location and building. Plenty of parking.   Inside tables by reservation only. Nicely separated, no issues being close to other guests. Not the same for reception or table service.  Server was pleasant, but had zero concept of social distancing, no mask and was right in our faces each time we had an interaction.   Menu/tasting a little confusing. Basically you prepay $40 each and get whatever you want from the menu, including wine to drink there or to go. Most wines were available for tasting pours, but not all. Some wines good, some not so much. Liked the primitivo the most of the many we tried.   Very nice for the setting and service. Great set up for limited capacity, but they really need to work on wait staff protection."

The baked Brie was great, but the \"roasted\" Brussel sprouts were truly just steamed and served on a sizzling cast iron skillet -- definitely NOT roasted. It honestly was a let down as \"roasted\" truly didn't mean roasted. The wine was great, service was great.... But food was just mediocre for the price."

No more running up too ATX, San Marcos, or SA to try great, local, craft beer.  By local, they really mean it. They are trying to get brews that are local to the Buda area. And while they may carry a tap or two from breweries in Austin/SA, they really want to spotlight breweries that are not Austin or SA based, really defining \"drink local.\"   We went during their soft opening and they had a steady, if not busy stream of customers, which all managed to get served timely and had their questions answered (some customers were new to the craft beer scene).  Really look forward to coming back here and setting their additions (outdoor seating).  No food as of yet but you can bring your own or call it in (pro tip: there's a Papa John's next door and a Thai restaurant a block away)  Looking forward to many more pints at this new hang out spot in the 78610."

I've had five growlers \"filled\" at your place, and not one was actually to the top. Need to keep the O2 out or my beer goes flat.

We were pretty full from lunch at Franklin BBQ - but they had a food truck at the ready if your stomach started growling.  We sipped our brews out side but they have a nice sized indoor seating area too if the weather gets a  bit chilly.  Super cool neighborhood vibe as I saw several families and even a softball team enjoying a pitcher after their game.  I wish I had more time here but am bookmarking it to visit again the next time I'm in Austin."

Large space with both inside and outdoor seating as well as a food truck parked to the side.  Decided to try a couple beers: Marco IPA ($6) and Friends with Benefits ($7). The Marco is well balanced but still had plenty of hops. Friends with benefits is more on the hazy side that sticks with you. The latter paired just fine alongside one of the sandwiches from the food truck.  Service was quick as there weren't many people at the brewery yet. A couple hours later the spot was packed, so best to come early."

They have indoor and outdoor seating and from my recent visit, I discovered they even sell wine here!  They had a food truck on the day they went so I'm certain there's food to wash down your IPA."

                "description": "All the 4 and 5-star reviews are spot on. Zilker Brewing is a great venue to have a brew or two and people watch from their 6th St patio.  Their indoor taproom is closed and they are adhering to the social distancing guidelines. We had a large picnic table to ourselves and were very comfortable chilling out on a breezy Sat afternoon.   I really enjoyed their Lazy Daisy Hazy IPA. It's a wonderful IPA that has a hint of sweetness and a citrus finish. Plus 1 gave 5 stars to their LA Beer American Pilsner. This is a typical Pils that drinks lite and is a perfect brew for a warm day.   Hungry? Spicy Boys Chicken food truck is onsite and is producing wonderful spicy chicken (Duh). They offer a range of sauces from sweet to hot as hades. We went midrange spicy and felt the heat.   Not a beer drinker, they offer wine, water, soft drinks, and surprise a frose' .  Solid 5-stars!"

They have the best hazy IPAs and great sours and generally interesting seasonal drafts, friendly staff, and a super yummy food truck (Spicy Boys) right in the patio area. Only thing is it gets pretty busy on weekends so it can be tough to snag a table sometimes, but it's worth it."

I've checked out several local breweries in the area and this one is at the top of my list right now. The beer is great and the service is awesome. The staff are welcoming and willing to help you select a beer if you're undecided. Spicy Boys food truck is in their parking lot, so grab a few beers and enjoy the awesome food. Plenty of seating outside with some seating inside. This place is popular, so the seating will always fill up quickly. Dog friendly as well"

The space both indoors and out is perfect, and encourages coming together. Great for groups, but would be fine for a date night as well. A few bar stools but mostly community style seating. The food truck permanently stationed out front is great. The beer is excellent, focusing on IPAs but having many other interesting seasonals. Prices are more than fair, swag is cool. Zilker has it all, ipA to Z. Drink local!"

I wasn't sure what to expect, but it didn't take long to realize that not only is Dale a great tour guide, he's also a very personable and knowledgable man who makes you feel like an old friend.   The points of interest were superb and the last stop we made provided one of the best meals I've had in my life and most likely the best ribeye ever.   The day lasted longer than expected, but it was a wonderful day and ended up being just perfect. We are planning to use his rental venue for a retreat in the coming months and looking forward to it. I highly recommend his services."

                "description": "First I would like to start with the facts.  1. We booked this tour months ago but unfortunately had to reschedule to a later date. (due to Covid19) This was not an issue for anyone attending the tour and the company got all $2800 paid for in full. 2. Yes $2800. We had 28 people in our group, It required two buses that were at their max capacity.  3. I would give a HUGE ZERO if I could.   The buses arrived at the pick up location 25 minutes early and expected us (all 28) to load up. Not all 28 people were even there yet. The male driver already seemed annoyed at this point.  We ended up pulling out at the agreed on time. When trying to leave the 2nd winery we couldn't. The drivers HAD LEFT and weren't there to pick us up. We waited outside in the sun outside for 30 minutes before they even got back.  But that unfortunately is not why I am writing this review   As we were loading the bus to go home the male driver said that would be charging us for a cleaning fee ($300) because someone spilt something on the floorboard. Pretty steep for a small spill that could be wiped up with a Clorox wipe but she agreed to pay it she sat down. Comments started to be exchanged about the steep fee and how the day had been complete chaos up until this point. The man began to get pretty heated and slammed the door. When he opened the door to his seat he said \"who the f**k spilt something in my seat.\" Nobody had spilled something on his seat. Upon looking at the \"spill\" it appeared to be sweat from Him. He continued to cuss and yell and eventually told us to \"get off his bus.\" We all piled off and the other bus also unloaded.  Now it is important to note the other driver said we didn't do anything wrong and that she didn't agree with how he was handling things. He told her he was in charge and that he would make the call. She became quiet after that. They ultimately left us there to find our own rides.  The male driver was rude and didn't speak unless spoken to the entire day. A beautiful day with amazing company was RUINED by this company and I will not recommend them to anyone!"

                "description": "I booked a birthday trip for 6 people, hoping to add 2 more. Dale told me I could book the trip for 6 and then add the 2. When I called to add the 2 he told me he would have to see if that was even possible. I didn't understand why after he assured me it would be fine and a sprinter van hold more than that. He had given the sprinter van to a larger crowd and downgraded us to an SUV without asking me (same price). I asked him when I would hear back and he said whenever he located another vehicle. I made some calls and found a better business who really wanted to host me and our guests. I called again to cancel with Dale and was told I am not the type of customer he would want. I guess a customer who wants to pay more money to add more people isn't good... very strange. Talking to a woman like that is not ok. I hope that he was having a bad few days and that he doesn't always behave like this, but I was really shocked how rude and unprofessional he was. Pros: I got my money back."

                "description": "One of the WORST experiences I have ever had with a \"wine tour\" company. I have been on many wine tours in my days, across different parts of Texas, and their unprofessionalism and lack of customer service and just blatant disrespect was appalling.   This \"wine tour\" had a total of two buses and a party consisting of 28 people. A group of people that I have known for years that have the utmost of respect and common courtesy for any company that they hire or work with.   From the start of our experience, both drivers were incredibly rude and unfriendly. The bus lacked any amenities one would think this \"Premier Hill Country Wine Tasting Experience\" would consist of.  The first winery.  * We arrived at the first winery at 10:48am to learn that the winery doesn't even open until 11:00am and that they WEREN'T expecting us at all... * Not the wineries fault. They were fantastic.  The second winery.  * Again, wasn't expecting us, causing us to have to sit at a tent down a road from the winery. Again, not the wineries fault, they handled it incredibly.  * When trying to leave the second winery, we couldn't. The drivers HAD LEFT and weren't there to pick us up. We waited outside in the sun outside for 30 minutes before they even got back.  The third winery.  * As we were loading the bus to go home, the male driver said that they would be charging us for a cleaning fee ($300) because someone spilled something on the floorboard. Pretty steep for a small spill that could be wiped up with a Clorox wipe, but she agreed to pay it. (*To clarify, open containers were allowed as stated on their website: \"Consumption of alcohol on the bus is allowed unless there are minors present.\") Minor spills like this are inevitable when providing a service as they do. Comments started to be exchanged about the steep fee and how the day had been complete chaos up until this point. The man began to get pretty heated and slammed the door. When he opened the door to his seat he said \"who the f**k spilt something in my seat.\" Nobody had spilled something on his seat. Upon looking at the \"spill\" it appeared to be sweat from him. He continued to cuss and yell and eventually told us to \"get off his bus.\" We all piled off, and the other bus also unloaded.  I know these times are hard, especially for small and locally owned businesses, and by no means and am I trying to make it harder for them; in fact, I am going above and beyond to support them. After yesterday, I do think that they need to take a step back and re-evaluate their actions and really think long and hard about what they do and why they do it. In the end, when providing a service, the client always comes first."

To be honest, the cost seemed a bit high at first but having never been on a wine tour before and I really had no idea. Afterward I realize it was worth every bit of it. Dale picked us up at our BnB along with everyone else on the tour that day and we were off to the first tasting.  He seem to know everyone along the tour and at each place they were very welcoming and grateful to have our group. It really was a fun time and we had the chance to try many different wines that we would not have normally picked.  Lucky for us it was a beautiful day and everything was just perfect. I would definitely recommend this tour to anyone interested in checking out some Texas wines, for a nice weekend getaway, or just to try something different.  It definitely helped that we had a good group of people who were also on the tour that day as well. It was a blast...I just wish we had taken more pictures."

First off, Dale is a pretentious, \"underpaid monkey\" as he likes to be called. He is rude, unprofessional, and has the audacity to 'hate mail' potential clients and I know I'm not the first one because I've seen the reviews! I don't have much else to say but be careful and do your research before spending any money on this place! The owner seems to not have a care in the world if it's not benefitting him. Also, be ready for rude phone calls and emails from Dale if he doesn't get his way. He was hard to get ahold of from the jump, not to mention I live out of town and couldn't wait for days in between responses. After not being able to make it to my appointment because he had failed to get back to me promptly, I proceeded on with my day. The next morning I wake up to the most rude, despicable email I've ever received. Just be careful and read reviews because from what I've read, if you want a beautiful wedding with NICE, FRIENDLY people, this isn't the place. I'll attach one of many emails. STAY AWAY FROM THE HEART OF TEXAS RANCH ALL TOGETHER!!!"

Picked us up at our hotel in Fredericksburg, went to pick up lunch, and then on to first of 4 wineries. She took care of everything. Even loaded up our bottles/goodies in the back of the bus and kept the AC on to keep it all cool.  Christy went above and beyond to keep everything organized, she set up our lunch, picked up our trash, offered to take us anywhere we wanted to go, and she kept us on time to all of our tastings. We bought a bottle of wine at the 3rd winery and drank in the bus on the way to the 4th. Lunch was a boxed lunch bought at local deli (very good). Everything was included. Everything was professional. The bus was large and comfy. Highly recommend this tour company!"

He was also very accommodating as the number of girls going on the tour changed at the last minute. We went to Fat Ass, Six Shooter and Fiesta Vineyards which were a blast and everyone enjoyed the tastings. Our driver Rick was funny and a true gentleman. It was raining that day and he had an umbrella to escort everyone in and out of the tasting rooms so no one got soaked. One of the girls left their phone on the tour bus and Rick came back later that evening to return the phone even after we offered to meet him half way. We had a great time and would recommend this tour to anyone!"

                "description": "We paid nearly four hundred dollars and it was a joke. What was supposed to be a winery tour was a tour of places that sold wine. We went to a store in downtown marble falls, an art studio, a grocery store and at the very end an actual winery. This constituted our day.   This is NOT a day of going to wineries in the hill country. Everyone was disappointed on Valentine's day.   The guy who led the tour was nice but they clearly got kickbacks where we went.   When we went to lunch no one got their order and right when we were leaving this sandwich shop the tour guide asked, \"everyone went to the tasting room, right?\" We're talking about a sandwich place being a stop on the wine tour people.   Horribly disappointed. Considering tastings were at most $10 for each of the four \"wineries\" we went to, it was a rip off in value.  The company clearly avoided going to respectable wineries and instead went to dead end places where they could maximize their profit margin.   Avoid at all costs!!"

The bar staff is friendly and accommodating and there is plenty of seating from couches to regular tables. If you're going to be there for a while drinking be prepared for a hefty bill as nothing is inexpensive here. The awesome lake view helps to ease the $$ pain though. This place lends to awesome people watching as well since this area is a big tourist draw, so overall you can't really go wrong by stopping in here for a weekend libation."

I wasn't greeted by anyone because you have to go up to the bar to order, which is pleasant for my kind of personality. They have very loud music to fit the vibe of the room and plenty of places to sit! Most importantly was the food; I was absolutely amazed by it and it was so delicious! I ordered the sisig and it was the best thing I ever had. I also, ordered a side of Caesar salad, but this was no ordinary piece of salad. It was presented gracefully and tasted extraordinary. The staff is very kind and fast paced with receiving orders. I am very glad that I came to this restaurant and hope I can revisit this place in the future!"

The brewery does not have an actual taproom open regularly, but instead is open only Saturdays from 12-4 pm in their parking lot. I went during their anniversary event and it was $25 for a glass that you keep and 6 8 oz pours of your choice (you can do 12 4 oz pours instead). Majority of the pours turned out to be larger than 8 oz so you can really get trashed here. They had 44 beers on tap. Pretty insane. Unfortunately, none of the beers were that great. They had like 4 food trucks and a lot of porta potties (lines can get long).   Overall, this was a quantity over quality brewery. We had 4 people in our group and none of us were impressed, although, we are from California and are spoiled by all of the good breweries out here. If you just want to get the job done and get trashed on a Saturday afternoon, this is your spot. If your a real beer lover, you may be disappointed"

Maybe it's an exclusivity thing...it sure works. If you are visiting Austin and have a free Saturday early afternoon, be sure to hit up 512 for your beer desires. You can take your tasting cup home as a souvenir. They have outdoor seating, merch for purch, and are kid and dog-friendly. Double wow! My boyfriend and I made it to 512 at the tail end of their Saturday hours, but we were able to share a tasting for one. That was perfect because it was the safest way to drink, play some ladderball (it was my first time playing that!), and drive to dinner afterwards.  They have clean restrooms and an easy way to purchase your guitar picks as proof of beer-drinking capability. When you park (plenty of parking btw), walk first to the door on the tasting room's left. You can purchase your tasting power, then head over to the main room for the adventure. When we went, there was basically one taptender pouring while a barback was helping him out with the glasses and stuff. It seemed like a lot of regulars were there, mostly 30+ in age, but all having a great time socializing. There wasn't a food truck there, nor any food on site, so bring your own or head out to eat afterwards."

You get to taste 6 full glass beers or 12 half glass beers and can pick if you want them to pour half a glass or full glass. The beer list was extensive! There were probably 2 beers we really liked and tons of unique ones that were puzzling to us. They also served some complimentary cheeses. There's also a few food trucks for hungry people. The only thing bad about the event was that restrooms were porta-potties. Many people brought their dogs to the event too. Cool to people and dog watch."

                "description": "512 Brewing Company review could be short and sweet. Only open on Saturday's 12 to 4 pm (taproom). Ugh... 512 Brewing Company was the first beer I tasted in Austin. Had an IPA. Very tasty. I like. Me, happy camper. 512 Brewing Company taproom mostly outside. Ugh... You buy your beer and hang outside in beer garden. Very unique way to order beer. Buy tokens (12 for $24) at one location. Then walk to beer taps. Ugh... They give you two 8oz glasses. Yeah... Never a fresh clean glass to try delicious beer. This is a comfort I like in a taproom I feel it makes a big difference in flavor and service. My two cents. I have only had their IPA. I am an IPA guy. I like the classic flavors and full body beer. 512 Brewing Company IPA does a good job for me. I would like the tasting experience as an option. I really enjoy a 4oz sample to try all the beers. Not a fan of using my beer token on a maybe. Oh well. 512 Brewing Company I will be back just not that often..."

                "description": "I used to take the train downtown so I'd always stop at Champions by the station and have a Pecan Porter or three while waiting for a pick up.  After relocating and driving myself to work like a pleb for the last 2 years the thing I missed most was the beer.  The few times a month I'd venture into Specs I'd always ask the beer guy about this(and Hitachino) and was always met with the tired response citing the owners devotion to sustainability.  I grew to loathe the environment.  Every time I'd toss something in the blue bin at work I'd scowl.  It just wasn't worth it.  I wanted this beer in something other than a keg.  Low and behold on my last trip in I see a stack of 4-packs of Pecan Porter.  The most perfect stack since the pyramids.  Beer guy saw me and came over to share in my unbridled joy.  I cursed the owner one last time for making me wait so long.  And grabbed two."

                "description": "512 had the honors of providing me with my first brewery tour. It was great, but definitely a little different than I expected. I attended the first weekend where they changed their \"style\" of the tour. They have not updated their website to list the correct details. Admission is $12 per person. This gets you the tour (optional), a small 512 glass souvenir for tasting, and 6 tickets for beer tasting.   The tour is said to start Saturday's around noon. However once you arrive, they will let you know how long they are going to wait based on the amount of people waiting. (they like to fill up)  That being said, we had about an hour wait outside on the patio-ish area (no cover, bring a hat and shades) to enjoy some brews! The weather was great and they have giant Jenga and corn hole for you to enjoy. Dogs are also welcome outside. If you plan to skip out on the tour and just enjoy the beer, bring lawn chairs as the tables get crowded after a while.   IF you decide to attend their tour, keep in mind that it may not be exactly what you expect. The brewery is small and there are only about 3 sections to view in cramped spaces. Get up close to the tour guide so that you can hear because they do not use a microphone. They have some work do to on the tour, but overall I enjoyed it.  Stop by 512! Besides, you can't beat $12 for 6 beers!"

For $12 you get an 8oz 512 glass to keep and 6 guitar pics to trade for different brews. There beers were all great, we even got to try some limited edition that's not being distributed yet. The \"bartender\" was really cool, knowledgeable about the beers, and overall pleasant to talk to. The only thing missing would be some type of food truck or snack.   Definitely give this place a try if you are a beer lover!"

                "description": "It's pretty rare that I like MOST of the beers at a brewery. Usually there's one or two stand outs, and that in itself is unusual.   However, 512 takes the cake on my brewery tour of Austin this time around. We showed up around noon, definitely past their \"tour\" time and it wasn't even available on their eventbrite / website anymore. Regardless, the brewer (New-ish Guy, woo!) let us in the tour and filled our two glasses with delicious Pecan Porter that was on nitro at the time.  I definitely loved their IPAs (IPA and Seven), their Wit was also not bad at all. The only thing I was a little eh about was their Pils and that's ok with me. They were incredibly knowledgable, the tour was fun, and they're doing some really cool barrel aged stuff that you don't see at a lot of breweries. They're also very dedicated to self distribution, despite how difficult that seems, so I'm definitely looking forward to other 512 beers I can get my hands on in the future."

There was beer for the whole family and the outdoor seating area came complete with bags, jenga, and ladder toss. The cost is $12 for 6-8oz beer samples! Probably the best deal in town. Highly recommend this place if you are looking for a place to hangout with friends. I'd recommend bringing food with you as there isn't much close by, but otherwise great place to just go and chill."

We spoke to Lauren, the owner at Aquabrew and they were incredibly kind and generous with allowing us to use their venue for after the service. When we got there, the GM, Hannah, took such great care of us and everyone else who attended. They went above and beyond for us during a difficult time and helped take one thing off our shoulders and for that they have earned our business forever. Really good people! Great beer!"

When we walked in we were very disappointed in their craft selection. I had researched this prior to choosing to go there based on their craft choices showed online. Again, something else that needed to be updated. Also, they aren't serving food. There was a large dog walking around that would come right up to you or sneak up under the tables and lick your feet. I like dogs so it was ok but for someone that doesn't..... Would not go back here until they get fully moved or opened."

                "description": "They've thought about everything at this brewery.  Great food, live music, seating inside, outside, and UPSTAIRS on the deck!  When the weather is right, they have the big glass garage doors open.  Yeah, they brew their own beer here and they have a decent selection.  It's not your typical brewery where you can just stroll in and choose the table you want to sit at.  That's because they have full table service for food and drinks.  I prefer breweries that let you wander around from the bar, to an outside table, to an inside table, and then back again - you know, rinse, lather, and repeat (relaxed and unstructured - I need that once in a while).  If you just want to stop in for a quick beer, you can sit at the bar.  The bar is quite large but also very popular with the college crowd, so it's hard to get a seat at times.   Now to the serious stuff - the beer!  I've had their Kolsch (San Marcos Blonde) and their Vienna Lager.  The blonde was the run of the mill Kolsch, not bad by any means, but the Vienna Lager - wow!  It had a great malty taste to it.  I liked it so much that I purchased a crowler of it to take home.  I rarely do that, so that tells you it must be good.  Enough useless banter - here's everything else you need to know about this place:  Free parking lot right next door or free 2 hr street parking.   Patio areas in the front and the back with overhead infrared heaters and fans with misters (they have both Texas seasons covered).  This place is popular with the college kids - TOO popular.  Growler refills are $12 or $18 for 64 oz, and $24 or $36 for 128 oz, depending on the beer you select.    Crowlers to go:  $8 or $10 (depending on the beer).  You can get three for $20 or $25 (depending on the beer).  Plenty of food options.   And I almost forgot to tell you - they have a FULL bar, not just beer!"

                "description": "Aquabrew is definitely a gem in San Marcos. I learned about it through the purchase of the brewery tour on Groupon. The tour was quaint because it's not that big, but very interesting.  The gentleman who gave the tour seemed a bit rushed at the end, but he answered our questions and seemed very knowledgeable.   At the end of the tour we got to sample some beer. They also have a beer club where you buy a growler, we got the one for $100, and join their beer club. You get a punch card for 10 refills on the growler. My husband and I got one each for $200. I was thinking it an \"okay\" deal i guess. Truthfully I wasn't that thrilled cause of the price. But OMG!!!! IT IS WELL WORTH EVERY PENNY FOLKS!!!!.   Aquabrew has some of the best beers around. I am Army and have lived and traveled all over the world and this lil place holds its ground when it comes to beers! Purchasing the growler is the best deal too.   I have not had the food yet, but the place is always busy and people seem to love it. And they have some of the cutest guys behind the bar.  In all, I give this gem an A+"

This place really has a community feel with longer style tables and an incredible open patio with fans and lighting, ping pong and live music... and of course... beer.  The food was very flavorful. Thai chicken had good spice and the chicken thigh was tender and juicy. The Margarita flatbread was fresh tasting. The arugula salad was huge and bursting with fruits and flavor.  The beer was excellent and just what you'd expect from an onsite brewery.   Overall, if you're looking for a fun place for you and your peeps to chill, eat and drink in San Marcos... you'd do well to try this place. Plus it's right up the street from the Cheetham St warehouse."

Long tables instead of individual tables to encourage people to meet new people ! Which is a really awesome concept . Also there's a large bar since it's also a brewery.  Food- my food was about a 3.5/5 , but my friends was a solid 1. Her salmon Benedict had almost uncuttable biscuit since it was so hard , and the most burnt potatoes I've ever seen. My food which was the stuffed French toast was pretty yummy, but not a lot to it.  Noise level - 1/5 THE BAND WAS SOOO LOUD. I couldn't here my friend talking 1 foot in front of me :(  Price - 2/5 wayyyy overpriced for what you get.

Easy to get a seat and our waitress was very attentive, despite it being happy hour and slightly busy on a Friday after work.  As a table, we ordered the: a) Brew House Pretzel - Amazingly soft and the beer queso is a great pairing  b) AB Bacon Jam Fries - HOLY! The bacon jam itself is something I've never had before and I must say this makes it a must return for me  c) Glass of Imperial Pilsner - Smooth and pretty standard for a Pilsner  d) Glass of Artificial Intelligence Tripel (9.72% ABV) - Yeah...the ABV tells the story itself  This spot has a great atmosphere, very rustic and cozy. Definitely a nice place, just wish you could order directly from the bar for faster access to beer."

                "description": "You know when someone takes a picture of themselves and posts it on Instagram,and it's at just the right angle to make them look super attractive? The Yelp reviews of this place kind of remind me of that. It's not that it was bad, but I was expecting a lot more.  The highlight of my meal was the Mosaic IPA. Balanced and drinkable, this beer was really enjoyable. I also tried the Swine Dive IPA. The taste of this was a little too clean for an IPA and just didn't have the hoppy depth to add to its character. Not bad, but I wouldn't get it again.  Overall the food I ordered was really lackluster. I didn't hate it, but it certainly wasn't a memorable meal. My chicken empanadas were oily, and had very little chicken in the filling. The whole thing struck me as more of acorn dog egg roll hybrid, and didn't really seem like an empanada at all. I was grateful for the spicy sauce it was served with, which was pretty tasty. I also ordered the brussel sprouts. There were some decent flavors here, but I would have really preferred them to have a little more char on them. They came across as slightly undercooked and worse yet, very wet. A little crispness would have gone a long way.  Service was fair, friendly enough but really on the slow side. It took me almost a half an hour to get my food and it wasn't crowded. The couple at the bar sitting next to me ordered hamburgers. I have to admit I was a little jealous because they looked good. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. Maybe it was a bad night. Whatever the reason I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again."

                "description": "Great location and cool venue. It's evident a lot of time and thought were put into this place.   Great beers, especially liked the Ape-ricot Wheat.   I wish I saved room for the Porter Ice Cream Float.   The AB burger was solid, maybe a little messy tho.  Forget the fries tho. The regular fires were under seasoned and chewy. Think Wendy's fries when you  don't finish them at lunch and try to eat them at the end of your shift. Bleh  The staff was super friendly.   The outdoor portion looks great but a bit too hot out today to go and enjoy it."

That portion of the night really sucked.  Howeverrrr, the street corn, queso, crispy tuna, edamame, and loaded fried were reallyyyy good. We especially loved the street corn. I wish we would've gotten the delicious food on time, instead of having to remind the staff multiple times butttt at least it tasted amazing??   I can't give them more stars even though the food was great because service is so so so important."

                "description": "Unfortunately the new menu and chef drops the rating from 5 to 4. Still friendly waitstaff and excellent happy hour. But the reason I come to AquaBrew and recommend it to everyone I meet is the food. The \"new\" salmon dish isn't even close to the goodness of the previous balsamic salmon with veggies. Dry. Lacked flavor. Sticky rice instead of the delish potatoes and only green beans instead of a mix of seasonal veggies. Hubby had the tostadas and 'meh' reaction. Will give it one more try before relegating it to happy hour only place with 3 stars. So sad."

                "description": "Just left after lunch. Cute/hip spot with friendly staff.   We ordered the AB burger and I did an upgrade to their bacon jam fries ($4 upgrade). I was so excited to try these fries but they were very underwhelming to me. $4 is steep for an up charge but had I enjoyed them I wouldn't have minded. The burger was the best bite on the table. It was small in size but very juicy and tasty. Not one to split.   Next up was the fried chicken and eggs. It has so many things I typically like - fried chicken, cream gravy, bacon jam, eggs, but I didn't like this dish. It lacked dimension of flavor. It needed something. The herbed fries that came with it were good. I liked them better than the $4 bacon jam ones.   Our kids split the stuffed French toast. The only ate a little bit because it was too sweet. If a kid thinks something is too sweet you know it's toooooo sweet. Neither ate it. It was a waste of money.   Overall I'm glad we tried it but don't need to return on our own accord."

I really enjoyed the margarita I had and the atmosphere was nice. Are usually never think of AquaBrew to eat at, but now that I finally tried it, I will definitely go back! Love it! The shrimp and grits is super buttery but I LOVE IT"

My husband followed it up with the classic Good, Bad and Ugly, a pepperoni, sausage, and pepper pizza that was elevated by higher quality ingredients. I tried the mushroom pizza, which was tasty as long as you're looking for something different. An umami bomb with a mushroom purée sauce, speck ham, and rosemary.  Two pizzas + the cauliflower = 2.5 meals for us, so plan for generous portions/leftovers."

I started coming here a few months ago and will continue to come - every time I am here the pizza is amazing and the staff is friendly.   The arugula pizza is my favorite. I also tried the bad decisions pizza and it was good - I am not a fan of how greasy it is but it is a pizza so that typically comes with the territory   I recommend this place to anyone who wants a casual bite with a fun atmosphere and good drinks!"

                "description": "We recently purchased a lake cabin in Spicewood and stumbled upon this place. Great outdoor ambience and delicious pizza! We love how family oriented it is too. Why 3 stars then? Unfortunately both times we visited our service outdoor was almost non existent. We waited a very long time before someone would make eye contact with us and come over to take our order. On both occasions it took over 2 hours before we actually received our food, due to waiting so long to finally be served. I know how important reviews are to businesses so I was reluctant to give a low rating, however I really think the service outside needs to be improved. We really want to love this place and hope management takes this review into consideration."

No one told us that market is only open on Sunday and it was Saturday. Ha!  So we tried this place out in their dog-friendly  backyard covered patio and we were not disappointed!  - Fresh craft quality cocktails on draft  - Super fresh ingredients in the salad and pizza  It was still pretty early so we had the breakfast brunch pie and a light fennel salad and it hit the spot perfectly. When you visit, you can order straight from the bar and Emilio will happily take care of you."

                "description": "Sorellina is hands down the best pizza in the hill country. The pies are creative, well executed and feature ingredients from local farms. I don't care for the clam offering, but it's hard to choose a favorite among the others. I guess I'd have to give a slight nod to the 'Nduja Sausage though. Regardless of which pie you choose, the crust isn't just an obligatory substrate; it's got great flavor and texture.  The cocktails are outstanding, especially the prickly pear margarita. Sunday is Bloody Mary day, and you won't find a better one outside of the next one. The mix has got just the right amount of spice and it's filled with a skewer containing salami, pepperoni, an olive, a tomato, basil and mozzarella.  The owners and staff are great, and they recently remodeled an already great patio area to include a beer garden with 30 beers on tap."

                "description": "This is a really cool place to stop by and get a pint of a regional beer or refill your growler with your favorite brew to take home (growlers only, no crowlers here).  Friendly, and more importantly, knowledgeable tap masters that can match your beer tastes to the selections on tap.   You can order a pitcher of beer at this place!  I don't see this in many growler stations.  All in all, it's a very fun place.  The staff and the customers are very chill and down to earth.  It's in a strip center at the corner of LBJ and East Sessom Dr.  The address is listed on LBJ and while you can enter there, it's a lot easier if you enter from East Sesson Drive.  And there's a LOT more parking on this side."

I love the music they play there as well. It is very low-key so if you feel like just sitting down and having a couple beers in talking with the regulars it is perfect perfect"

Very interesting pieces. But enough about that.  This place is loaded with craft beer from Texas. Texas is apparently pretty big in that regard (and nearly every other regard). For a place as small and intimate as it is, there's a lot of seating packed in it and even some outdoor seating. There's games, lots of games. Card games, board games, darts, pool, and sometimes even a live DJ.  If you dig the craft brew scene this place is surely right up your alley. If you find yourself in San Marcos come check em out!"

The staff is friendly and can also help me decide what to order if I'm unsure. I've had fun trying to new beers and discovering what have become my go-to selections. (Bonus : All the beer they serve is from Texas!) Between the mix of good people and good beer - this has become my favorite bar."

They have all Texas craft beers, 28 on tap, fresh, and they even have a few selections in cans and some wine!      I was shocked when I saw they had The Infinite Monkey Theorem Rose' ....impressive.   The vibe is awesome. Super laid back, chill, artsy, and hipster. Loves it.       The owners are lovely people. So nice, great service, and very informative on every single beer. They make it their priority to get the perfect beer for you.   They have some savory oyster crackers for you to enjoy while you booze it up. Cards Against Humanity is also available to play for free!        The decor was my favorite. I was super into the refurbished wooden pallets, the art work, the baby succulents, and the colors!   Will definitely be returning many more evenings."

Great selection of Texas beers. Very helpful staff who encouraged us to sample several based on our likes including several blends we may not have thought of trying. 2 beers led to 3 and then 4. Sad to leave but had a game to catch. Until next time, keep up the great cheer and beer!"

                "description": "As far as growler places in San Marcos, The Growling is as good as it gets!  With that being said, I've been to growler places in the greater Austin area and IMHO, I think The Growling is better than most of them.  As previously mentioned, there are 28 beers on tap, all Texas-made stuff, but unlike other growler places I've been to they have a bar and you can drink a pint, invite friends, and just hang out. The owners are super friendly and work hard to set you up with the perfect craft beer experience! They even have a stage setup for live music and get live acts mostly on the weekend.  Also, as previously mentioned, there is no kitchen but they allow outside food and with Pie Society, Bobcat nation, Dos Gatos, Mocas/Javas, Rose Garden (Chinese), and Thai Thai in close proximity; you won't have to go far to fight off those hunger cravings! They haven't been open very long (less than 2 months) so they're off to a slow start but hopefully as word gets out they'll start getting busier and maybe even expand on what's an already great start! If you're in San Marcos for the River, the Square, the Hill Country, or in school looking to skip class, The Growling is every bit worth checking out!"

What a great spot - the staff is very welcoming and friendly and are very knowledgeable about the different brews on tap to help you find the right one to fit those taste buds. The beer flight the bartenders picked/poured for me were great and I look forward to coming back and tasting the other brews on tap. Looks like I found a great alternative to overcrowded beergardens in Austin so cheers to more trips I'll be making to San Marcos!"

They seemed to have attitudes of a bar that is not in a college town but a boujee downtown bar. The bartender who was close to my age charged me for regular priced drinks when we ordered 2/3 of our drinks in the happy hour range. When I came to close out and order our (3rd) last drink. The bartender said \"do you mind if I close you out?\" I thought this was very odd as it was a Wednesday evening and I was purchasing not only alcohol but food. I do believe they have an amazing food truck that supplies great food. I am sure this was a one time fluke as the rest of the experience was great. I do stand by my opinion that the staff maybe biased to certain crowds so be weary."

Loved the atmosphere and customer service and ice cold beers. My bestie and I had a mini day in San Marcos as a girls trip within in COVID rules and we loved this little spot. We found it while looking at houses in the neighborhood surrounding the bar. The staff was kind and courteous and the misters and fans were a nice cooling off touch with the Texas heat."

They have happy hour everyday from 2-7 ( and all day on Sunday) which include a big 4$ strawberry margarita that I could dieeee for! If you are under 21 you can't stay past 7 which has always been a little upsetting considering some of my friends are underage and they are very strict about it , but still one of my favorite bars on the square ."

You said I was \"punching down for laughs\" when he was greeting me to your establishment.   First of all, he was the one \"punching down\" since he kept making his jokes loud so that all the other employees around could have a laugh. He never greeted me to the establishment. Also, I kept my mouth shut, took his rudeness in stride, manned up, and moved on. Apparently his and your feelings were hurt by my relatively insignificant review and you just had to make a public display.   I neither live in the area nor will return to your business, and in the end, neither of us should really care."

                "description": "We were in town and decided to stop by for lunch and reminisce on the good old days. We came in knowing it was under new management but wanted to still give it a shot. The waitress was very attentive and checked in on us often, and when she gave us the menus we instantly realized NOTHING WAS THE SAME. I had always ordered (and was craving) the jalapeño queso burger but that was now named something else, and based on the description I knew I wouldn't be a fan. We both ordered their 1/4 smash burger with grilled onions and a basket of fries. When we got our order we both looked at each other and knew this was not the Taproom we had during college. The food itself was okay (not great as before) and the amount of grilled onions was significantly less... unless we are in an onion shortage I feel more could've been given. After we finished eating we both agreed this would probably be our last time coming for a while. Just not the same.   Again, the waitress was very attentive, checked in often and food was okay, but it's hard to not compare the past to present."

That being said, we all got burgers so I feel like it could have been faster? The food hit the spot after a day on the river but just to get the waiters attention was hard work as they only had 4 people on duty. Then to pay the check again it was another long wait. I can't recommend this place if you're hungry, but if you have the time, sure you should go. Prices were reasonable."

                "description": "Salty with a side of Micro transactions.   I have had a few items here and I would have to say this is the saltiest food in San Marcos and not in a good way.  Their menu is very over priced and boy do they love their micro-transactions or add-ons.  Fries are extra with their expensive and average burgers. BACON is like $2 extra.  They charge you for using a credit card and so much more.   Their queso is Velveeta and rotel and not even that good. Most of their chips they serve with the queso is tiny broken scraps and they get annoyed if you ask for more.   The staff is either uncaring or over-worked. I have had many incidences where I am eating solo and am ignored in getting service initially and after.  This is most likely because the server is more interested in dealing with the beer drinking frat guys. Almost every time I have been there I have been left without a basic refill of water. Many times i have also sat waiting for my food with no sight of my server.   The only saving grace of this place is the half price wings on Wednesday, but even then I would get them to go."

                "description": "Drove up to San Marcos from SA to meet sister and niece to help move into dorms.  They were running late, so decided to stop here for some drks and grab a quick bite.  Place was not that crowded (in the front) and the tables were spaced out.  View was nice to enjoy those strolling by  the sidewalk.  The sign at the front said $3.50 bloody mary's, so I ordered one and it was the bomb (see pic).  Perfect drink that had all the fixin's.  The Chicken and Waffle Bites caught my attention, so I ordered that to hold us over.  These were really good and worth the appetizer! The reason for 2 stars knocked off were the service that was absent throughout our time here.  He disappeared all the time and couldn't find him once my sister and niece showed up.  This service made me decide to go somewhere else for lunch.  The other star was due to being charged full-price for the 2 bloody mary's.  I didn't say anything, as I wasn't sure when the waiter would come back and also felt small businesses need any extra cash during these times.  I still tipped the waiter, since they need money too but not sure how he was so busy with a light audience in the place."

They are my go to burger when I get a burger craving. However, I have heard that all their other specialty burgers are amazing as well.   My one complaint is the service. It's mainly a bar, it's going to be busy- I get it. I've worked the industry. But every time I've gone, something is wrong with my order, I'm double charged on something, or the waitress hardly ever comes to check on us.   I'll keep coming for the amazing burgers- and they deserve the stars, but the service needs some improvement."

They refused to serve me and I refused to stay quiet. I escalated to the owner after his employees all worked together to ensure that customer service is not important to them at all. I spend a lot of money eating out especially to try new things and I support local businesses. But I couldn't try their food because they don't accommodate properly to accept mastercard payment on a to go order (which they now claim they do allow). Hope you all decide to go somewhere else that values you as a customer. Support black owned businesses.  I hope the COVID hits them hard in the pockets."

                "description": "My husband and I were in town for the weekend and found this place a short walk from our hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The Bourbon Berry Cocktail was my favorite! We also enjoyed sampling many different beers and wines on tap. Their crispy chicken sandwich was delicious! Very crispy on the outside and moist on in the inside.   They have crowlers and growlers for 25% off everyday. I really wish they had a smaller to go container as I would've loved to have taken some of the Berry cocktail home - I can't justify the cost of it to take home a crowler or growler. We would definitely go back if we were in the area again."

                "description": "We really enjoyed this place which was an accidental find on our way back from one of our activities in Austin. It is a self-serve concept, so basically you are given a card to scan anytime you want to order a wine, beer, or a cocktail from one of their many taps. You also place your food order at the counter and they bring it out to you.   The fried avocado tacos were amazing and my significant other really enjoyed whatever tacos he had, which I believe were the Carnitas. Why four stars then? Two reasons. One is I was really confused on how much I should tip. I usually don't struggle with this being a bartender, but since we had to pour our own drinks and order food at the counter , I wasn't comfortable leaving a full 20%. Second, when you are pouring your beer, the price adds up very quick. There was one point my boyfriend poured a pint glass and the beer ended up being $22. That was a bit of a letdown. Otherwise the staff is VERY friendly and welcoming -they run a very tight ship. The bathrooms were exceptionally clean and the layout with a big outdoor patio is a bonus. Highly recommend, just watch the higher ABV beers because they add up fast!"

                "description": "The uniqueness of this place really sets it apart. You are given a card to pour any of the beers on top yourself, which I had seen before and always love. What I hadn't seen was also you can pour wine or cocktails! This experience is perfect for all of those people crawling out of quarantine and not knowing what to do when they cant pour their own drinks. But now you can! And despite the setup involving many hands, Oz. keeps the place sparkling clean.  I can't speak much to the food menu. It's mostly a meat-forward fare. They have a vegan burger patty, but I was told neither of the buns are vegan. Since the patty was really soft, I am not sure it would work as a lettuce wrap. It seems weird to have a vegan patty when you can't have a full vegan burger, but at least there is a vegetarian option.  My mom liked her fish and chips.   I am really just here for the taps though!"

                "description": "How lucky are we to arrive in Texas and meet this amazing place! It was like stepping in paradise. Delicious food and a whole variety of beers.   We tried a few of the beers and had some Tex-Mex.   I tried the sangria beer. I believe it was number 32 on the panel. If you like sangria and bubbles go for it, It's like sangria with bubbles (GF)  Husband had a few other kinds of beers which I tried and oh Man, It was very good! Nothing like I ever had before.   I also had the house tacos (3) with chicken, steak and fried avocado. The fried avocado was definitely a hit for me. It was full of flavor, creamy and crunchy at the same time.   If you are visiting Austin like us and want to drive away from the city you won't regret going to Oz Tap House.   Also, one of the owners is supper friendly we had the pleasure to speak with Sean briefly. Staff is also very nice, patiently explained to us how tap works.   Thanks Oz Tap House for such a memorable welcome!   I recommend this place to everyone!!"

                "description": "I just ordered lunch from Oz tap house. We got fish and chips, fried pickles,  a baked pretzel, a Caesar salad and a cheesesteak.   The pro's: The ranch dressing that came with the fried pickles was pretty good, As was the coleslaw.   The cons:  The fish and chips portion was small and soggy. It was two pieces of greasy fish, that iterally had no flavor. Fish and Chips is one of my favorite foods and I've had it all over the world. Never had I gotten it without flavor. How do you make something taste like nothing? Granted. I asked that the fish and chips have no hot pepper on it. Unfortunately, Hot pepper is the only spice Oz uses.  The fries were cold inside - clearly not hand-cut. The Caesar salad, was spicy in a weird way. It was not good.  The Philly Cheesesteak was very very spicy and greasy.  The Baked Pretzel - Auntie Ann's does a better job, this was a VERY basic, previously frozen pretzel. Nothing special and not worth the price.  The fried pickles - under seasoned and instead of crisp, they were chewy. Again not good.    Everything was extremely spicy, from the fish and chips to the Caesar salad. Food items that traditionally aren't spicy, were all grossly over spiced with hot peppers. Oz Tap House needs to learn how to use spices without making things spicy. Go back to cooking school - Spiced and Spicy! There is a difference! One more thing,  Read dietary notes. There's a reason why people write them."

We were greeted when we walked in,had the process explained etc.  Beers, a couple of ciders,and wines on tap. Pretty cool. I did semi accidentally pour myself 9 oz of wine, so it was a $12 glass, not what I'd typically spend on a glass of wine, but I also typically wouldn't be served 9 oz.  Our food came out quickly and it was really good!  I don't know much it was (folks mentioned auomatic gratuity) bc my husband paid, but it was great and we will definitely come back. They had a playground in the back that we saw,which would be great to come to with our lil people."

                "description": "Stopped by Oz. Tap House for the first time after a Vandegrift H.S. football game, recommended to us by a family member.  \"Go to Oz (pronounced Oz, like wizard of Oz) Tap House, is great.  First things first, we realized later it's not Oz it's Oz.  Notice the period after the z.  Oz. = ounce!  Makes perfect sense when you see the concept.  Dozens of self-serve taps, pouring cocktails, beer, wine, etc.  Way cool!  We couldn't tell how much vodka was actually in the Cosmos we had, but they were tasty!  The Community brand ice tea off the charts too.  Any place serving Community products knows their stuff ... oh yeah, the food.  Definitely \"gotta go back for more\" fare.  Fried cauliflower and jalapeños, nice ranch sauce.  Our server, unprompted, brought some buffalo wing sauce, \"dip a little in here, then the ranch.\"  Awesomeness!  House tacos and cod tacos were delicious, depths of sublime flavors layered into top shelf flour tortillas.  Our only observation was using the house taco slaw on the cod tacos may be a better pairing than the sautéed cabbage... at any rate, the tacos were outstanding.  We'll definitely be back, lots more on the menu to explore.  And a special shout out to James working the register.  Explained the concept, led us through the process, and answered quite a few \"newbie\" questions.  He was great, no need to hire more employees, clone James!"

They are also dog friendly outside as long as they're leashed. I had a half order of carnitas nachos which was pretty good sized.

                "description": "So I traditionally love Easy Tiger and we frequent the North location for happy hour pretty often. We ventured to this South location excited that they have an outdoor space for kids.  The good:  Beautiful place with indoor and outdoor seating Fenced area for kids to run around Delicious food, beer, coffee  The not-so-great: When we arrived, there were a ton of open tables but we were told there was a 30 minute wait to be seated. After roaming around for a while and seeing none of tables were getting used, we asked and were told that they were giving the kitchen a \"chance to catch up.\" I wish they would have let us go ahead and get seated while we waited The prices seem to really be going up. $14 for a pretzel? I mean they're delicious and the cheese sauce is amazing, but I'll probably never order one again if they're the price of an entre.  In conclusion, we'll probably be back, but if we have the kids with us, we'd probably only go for happy hour or just coffee and pastries rather than a full meal. It's just too long a wait and too pricey for a family meal."

There are ceiling heaters for the colder days, and long family-style seating primarily. That patio also has a bar, or you can order food through table service as well.  Mostly glutenous things on the menu, so would not recommend for special dietary needs. I had the waffle fries, which were tasty and served in a small bowl. Would definitely return again."

                "description": "I still remember the first time we went there. It was on the slow end of Dirty Sixth, where the old Havana location was.   I recall it vividly because of an interesting Interaction I had with the bartender.  As I looked at the menu, I asked about the pastrami and he said, \"Its good. So good in fact, it's the second best in town, behind Pious Pizza.\"  I remember thinking how it was honest but cocky at the same time. Sure, you may not think it's the best, but you sure you're second best?  Well, he was right.  Fast forward to a cool, hazy night in 2022 at their South Lamar location. First of all, the building is immaculate, an intentional nod to their style and culture. I love it.  My wife had the prosciutto baguette, which was delicious. Although the bread almost stole the show on that one.  The kiddo had the chicken schnitzel and, man, who puts that much effort into a kids plate? Really tasty and well executed.  I, like always, went with old faithful, the pastrami sandwich. My old friend was as delicious as always, as it didn't disappoint. The bread was great but didn't come close to stealing the limelight.   I've always worried about Easy Tiger turning into one of those Austin brands (talking to you Torchy) that loses its way, and I'm sure some may feel that way, but the experience at South Lamar could've been back at that old Sixth Street basement.   Five stars, folks."

                "description": "I have been dying to go to Easy Tiger ever since they opened on South Lamar. Today I was craving pastrami in particular and was in the neighborhood so I decided to go get the pastrami sandwich to go.   First impressions: convenient location, lots of parking options, clean restaurant and bathrooms, friendly but unknowledgeable staff, quick service but the restaurant was nearly empty at 3pm in the afternoon.   When I checked out at the counter I was taken back by the price. $23 for a sandwich ($18+ tip). Probably the most expensive sandwich I've ever ordered, even when staying at a five-star hotel and ordering room service. OUCH. I still purchased it in hopes for a big fat pastrami sandwich that I could possibly split up for two meals.   When I got back to home and opened the sandwich I was hugely disappointed. Where was the meat?! It only had a thin layer of pastrami and sauerkraut between two thick slices of oversized bread. WHAT?   The taste was average to mediocre. Absolutely nothing special about this sandwich. Bland, no substance, too much bread. I felt ripped off.   On the positive side the sandwich was homemade (fresh baked bread) and fresh prepared  sauerkraut and dressing, so at least I knew it was quality food/whole food and not processed junk. Sadly that wasn't enough to make it remarkable or worth the price. I was also very disappointed it did not include a big fat pickle. That would be a very easy and tasty addition.   This is Austin full of amazing food and amazing restaurants. Easy Tiger does not make the cut for me, nor would I recommend it to anyone else local or coming from out of town.   Recommendations to management: pile on the pastrami, reimagine the sauce and include a pickle. House made potato chips or even any kind of potato chips would have helped justify the price a little. Also, more training and knowledge needed for the staff as they could not answer my questions about the products and menu items.   Don't waste your money and time on a boring sandwich. I so wanted to love this place."

                "description": "Okay so, I ran across this post of super cute bars in Austin. Well of course I had too try them ALL. Starting with Easy Tiger.  Location: upon arrival it looks like an outdoor situation but once you park your car around the back you slowly realize it's a indoor/outdoor vibe. Areas have great coverage from the sun and I love that they have fans as well as Heaters on the ceiling!   Food: The Food was Fan-Freaking-Tastic. I won't lie first glance at the menu I was ehh. Nevertheless I asked my waiter chandler what should I order he made wonderful recommendations.   The pretzel  10/10: crispy outside pillowy soft inside   The Cajun Chicken Sausage 10/10: that prefect snap you want from any sausage casing and the home made Chow-Chow was the prefect topping.   The breakfast potatoes  10/10 : It was like the par-boiled the pots then fried them    Brussels sprouts 8/10 : Great flavor just wanted them a little more tender   Our cocktails 8/10  We order 3 different kinds all three were just okay.   The dessert and bread too take home was also really good.   All in All I would definitely recommend stopping by."

                "description": "This one hurts my heart because I had been so eager to come here.   A big group of myself and a bunch of other girls had decided that Easy Tiger was the place we wanted to support this night! I was so excited because, like I said, this was a top place on my list of places to go!  We had called the day of to make sure they could accommodate a large group. They said yes. We let them know when we were coming that night and how many of us it would be. All good (we thought)!  Our group starts to arrive at Easy Tiger and we realize that they thought we were coming the next morning and not the time we had told them. Okay, no biggie, we can fix this. We had also been told that there were only two servers that night. You could tell they were overwhelmed. We had made it clear that we wanted to make it as easy as possible for our server since there were so many of us. We were told that they would be able to give us two long tables next to each other so our group would be at least semi close. This didn't happen. Again, whatever... It just kind of sucked.  Now on to food! Yay! Most of us were starving. I can't speak for everyone else but I decided on the Pretzel. It looked so good in the IG photos. When it came out (fast if I may say), it was cold and not soft :( The cheese and other sides it came with felt like they were just taken out of the freezer. Inedible. Sad Ashley.  I drank a Peach Mule that was A1!! That was the highlight of my time here!  Would definitely come back, sit at the bar, and maybe order something different. I'm sure this was just a case of miscommunication and I'm excited to give them a second chance!"

                "description": "I LOVE THIS PLACE! I always leave with a fresh loaf of sourdough bread. The pretzel and beer cheese is the perfect snack if you're attending one of their weekly trivia nights. My personal favorite sausage is the kielbasa - it tastes as amazing as it looks. My favorite cocktail here is their aperol spritz, or one of their weekly beers on tap if I'm doing well in trivia and need to keep my brain on. Highly recommend!!!"

                "description": "The beer at here was pretty good. I liked the heavenly haze and my friend got the pog-slammer. Haze was a IPA similar to electric jellyfish from pint house. Pog had very citrus-y flavors which I liked. I also got the pretzel which was decently sized. The dips were good for the pretzel.  The bad part... the service. We ordered three beers the first time around, which took around 15 minutes to arrive. The beers weren't really cold at this point. I am not sure how that would be possible but I expect it to be the waiting staff seemingly lounging around talking to each other doing nothing. We asked for the waitress and it took an additional 10 minutes for her to arrive. We then ordered more food and drinks which took additionally extremely long amounts of time. The kicker was that there were two other seated tables so the place was basically empty. I would really recommend going to the 7th location over this one, at least while the current waiting staff is still doing what they did when we went.   Food was alright. Service was shockingly bad."

                "description": "I went mid-afternoon to pick up salad and bread. They texted me ahead to let me know they were out of pre-sliced bread but had whole loaf of same flavor. I accepted it but had wanted pre-sliced. There is a lot of construction underway and it makes parking cramped.   Also, I could not locate the curbside spots. I went to the host stand to pick up. Nearly got run over by an impatient driver driving around the \"Slow Down, Stay Awhile\" sign. Ironic.   The Winter Kale salad seems overpriced for the portion size. It is tasty, just on the small side.   The North side location is much better. Maybe this one will improve after construction."

We all shared a sourdough bread and wow it tasted so fresh and tasty! It was as if it was freshly baked (which I believe that's what they advertised) and it was more than enough to take home to enjoy for breakfast the next day. We also all shared the sausage sampler with the sauces that go with each sausage which I LOVED. Each of them had their own taste and they did an excellent job pairing them with the appropriate sauce.   As for my entrée, I ordered the prosciutto baguette which was quite huge! Very delightful, but I ended up not finishing it. Their bread portions are very generous.   Would love to come back!"

                "description": "A beautiful fall evening in Austin deserved a patio visit. We sat upstairs and the view didn't disappoint. We just missed the sunset but the sky was still stunning.  We grabbed some menus and decided on drinks and a giant pretzel. We also got the charcuterie board. My friend got a margarita which is said was 4/10 on a scale of margs. I tasted it and to me it tasted like a melted frozen margarita. Way too sweet for my liking. I wanted a cab (wine of choice) which they didn't have...I got a Malbec which wasn't horrible but I prefer a good bold cab.  The pretzel was great as always and the charcuterie board was well laid out. Neither one of us like the almonds. They had some sort of oil on them. What I really was sad about was the jam. I was hoping for a fig jam but it was not. My first bite was not good at all. I even asked the waitress what it was...she very nicely called down to the kitchen on her little mic and found out that it was a strawberry ginger jam. Those two flavors do not go together in my personal opinion. The ginger was way too strong and over powering.  The cheeses on the cheese board from Antonelli's Cheese Shop were on point. The goat cheese with honey was great. The blue cheese was yum and the Gouda was \"Gouda\".  ba dum tss.   Overall- this place is a no brainer for a casual night with friends over a pretzel and a beautiful view."

                "description": "Easy Tiger has a warm special place in my heart. When their 6th street location closed I was so sad, but then like gremlins overnight they multiplied in the best of ways. Having an east austin, and south austin offering and more is such a boon.   We love their snacking/grazing boards. What millennial wouldn't? They're basically adult lunchables. Meats and cheeses and nuts and jams, oh my.   The pretzels and beer cheese are also legendary. But so much so that they sadly often run out of pretzels like they did for us the other day.   We love the use of covered and outdoor seating, especially in this time.   Wanting more substantial fare, they got you. The sausages, pastrami, the blt, all incredible. Really you can't go wrong. So, go!"

                "description": "Easter Sunday and no reservations? No problem. My friends and I decided to check out the new South Austin location of Easy Tiger. It was my suggestion and, thankfully, everyone loved it!  We started with a cinnamon knot, a soft pretzel with mustard, and a round of mimosas. The pretzel was out of this world! Warm, with a light sprinkling of Kosher salt, a crispy exterior and the lightest, fluffiest interior EVER!  We got it with a nice whole grain mustard; cheese was an optional side. The cinnamon knot was pretzel dough in a different shape with a sprinkling of cinnamon (it was savory, not sweet). Good, too, but it wasn't warm, so it got overlooked as we focused on the warm pretzel. As you can see from my photos, we were overcome with hunger and I almost didn't get a picture of the pretzel at all! It was that good.  We moved on to the Grazing Board, a side salad, and avocado toast.  The grazing board was truly a show stopper. It included a blue cheese, guyere, and brie, Prosciutto, sweet red grapes, dark and white raisins, slices of sour dough and walnut cranberry bread, tiny, tiny gherkins, candied walnuts, apricots, whipped butter and other toppings. It was visually stunning, but equally delicious. The house salad had the best, giant croutons and a light, delicious dressing with fresh greens, cherry tomatoes, radish slices. The avocado toast was a thick slice of grilled sour dough topped with a generous mound of mashed avocado, cherry tomatoes, and thinly sliced radishes. Delicious!  The space at the S. Lamar location is very nice, bright and open. There are several outdoor seating areas, so no problem finding a spot to sit. There might be an issue finding parking, as the parking lot is small (and each parking space is tiny!)  I cannot wait to go back and try some other things on the menu as everything I saw coming out of the kitchen looked good. I want to try it all!"

                "description": "This is a joint review from me and my partner. We went on two separate occasions. I went with my coworkers on a Thursday for an outing/birthday. The place itself is cute. Allows dogs. Twinkling lates. Cornhole off to the side. Just a cute, trendy, Austin-like place. But the experience was lack luster. The food took very long. The establishment didn't own enough cups, so part of us had to share cups or just didn't have water. The food was mediocre, save the fries. In this kind of weather, you should be prepared for flies to constantly fly around and land on your food. The drinks are also weak and the time between them will sober you up.   My partner went a separate time. This time I had three things to eat: a strawberry and goat cheese salad, French toast bites, and ricotta toast to share. The salad was ok, but smelled absolutely rank. Even the vinaigrette smelled super off, and not in a heavy-in-vinegar kind of way. The goat cheese wasn't the best, and frankly you could see the indentation of the packaging. The French toast bites bad poor texture. You'd expect to use a slightly stale brioche but instead was a baguette style. It was not soaked enough in the egg mix before cooking for it to have a fluffy texture. Instead, it was hard and unenjoyable. A poor quality baguette instead of the nice ones at real boulangeries. The ricotta toast was the best part, but still wasn't that great. Texture was also off, like an overcooked steak that takes too much force to rip apart. Not only that, but the food took 1 hour to get here.  At the end, they took his card and forgot to return it for 30 minutes. Couldn't get a hold of the waiter and left very late due to him forgetting about us.  Twice have they been very disappointing! Don't recommend this place unless you just want to waste money on a company credit card or take your young mother-in-law that you hate."

                "description": "What a gem on South Lamar! There are some business that have survived the pandemic, some that have folded, but there are very few that have creatively embraced it. Easy Tiger has gone beyond that where they started the business during the pandemic and built something absolutely majestic.   Drinks - Ofcourse the beer selection is amazing but the best part is that there is something for everyone. They have a great selection of wine and some really cool cocktails.   Food - This was a pleasant surprise. I have never heard my food snob wife utter the words \"This may be the best avocado toast I've ever had\" .. not just that the Brussels sprouts are a delight and the egg sandwich is really good too  Ambience - This is where they go from being great to phenomenal.. the outdoor area is a perfect setup and the best part is that they have a little kiddie park for the little ones. All this overlooking the green belt.. does/can it get any better?   One thing to add .. on a good day parking lot gets full very fast so plan accordingly!   A must must go for a nice sunny day or otherwise :)"

I filled out an inquiry form and then was contacted right away. We booked a private tour for a couples trip. Alee was great in providing suggestions and making sure to fit what we wanted as part of the tour. We got to tour Hawk's Shadow, then had a tasting at Duchman and ended our tour with some delicious BBQ from Salt Lick, next to Salt Lick Cellars. Tom, our driver was so nice and flexible with our schedule. He reminded us of how much time we had but did not feel rushed at all. We'll definitely be booking Slowpokes for any future trips!"

She provide a very nice lunch and snack trays. Everything about the tour went so smoothly and was planned our perfectly. We even were picked up at our rental house so no one had to drive after drinking. All the girls on the tour said they would defiantly do another tour with Slowpokes Wine Tours!"

There was a total of 8 girls on the tour with a couple that was paired with us and we were the perfect group.  Linda was the best tour guide anyone can ask for.  Our group had a blast and the lunch was an added bonus on the tour!  She kept us informed along the way and gave us the best details of each winery/distillery that we visited.  Linda was very personable and every location we visited had its own special charm!  Thanks for an amazing tour Slowpokes Wine Tours."

After talking with her she designed a day that was diverse and showed us a number of new things in the Dripping Springs area.  Our day included several of the high country wineries, one brewery and a visit to the quaint town of Wimberly. We highly recommend this group over  other Austin wine tour groups as they create a very personalized day and made sure everyone enjoyed the stops.   Our day started with lunch at Homespuns in Dripping Springs - excellent start to a beautiful day!  The Bloody Marys are highly recommended."

Lindsey chose our wineries very wisely; we started with lunch at Crowson (whose owner will drop incredible knowledge on you), enjoyed a rainstorm and a glass of red at the beautiful Ron Yates, and ended with cheese and BOOOOM wine at Hye Meadow Winery. It was lovely day of booze, conversation, and sisterhood. And, yes, we loved Lindsey so much she became a part of our wolfpack. Lindsey was fun, energetic, and knowledgeable about the area. I would definitely do this tour again!"

                "description": "I decided to surprise my mom with a wine tasting tour for her 60th birthday. Linda went above and beyond to make this tour special. She made a wine bottle with me and my moms photo on it with a sweet birthday message and quote.  She took so many photos of us, and really made us feel special. We were able to choose our wineries and she even picked us up and dropped us off at our BNB. She had the most amazing tapas tray, with cheese, mixed nuts, her special dip, crackers, breads and meats. She had this prepared and sat out for us at Wimberly winery,  halfway through the tour. At the end of this stop, she even had cupcakes for my moms birthday. I had actually called around different wine tours in the area and Slow Poke Wine tours offered the best value and I can tell you now, the best service. We wouldn't hesitate to do it again. This trip with my mom was priceless and so special. I thank you Linda for making an amazing memory for my mom and I."

We went to a beautiful winery to begin and enjoyed a lunch spread while there; then we went to a distillery with AMAZING frozen mint juleps, outdoor games and great scenic views; finally we ended at the olive oil and balsamic producer for more snacks and great wine. Linda was very attentive to us and did a great job of keeping us on schedule without rushing us, she picked us up around 10:30AM and we returned around 4:30PM. Hope to enjoy this tour again in the future, a very diverse experience that I think even the guys would enjoy!"

                "description": "I used Slowpokes Winery Tours to go on a Hill Country wine tour on the day I got engaged, and I could not have asked for a better experience.  My now fiancée and I rode in the Model T Ford, which was all-original except for the brakes. I contacted Linda with any questions, concerns, and booking, and Linda picked up my fiancée in a Mercedes van.  We went to a great breakfast, and then David drove us around in the Model T Ford. The route was scenic, breathe taking, and beautiful.  The wineries we stopped at were great, and, the customer service from Linda and David was unbeatable.  They have a unique business that is more than just a van or limo driving you around to distilleries, breweries, or wineries (although they also have a Mercedes van option).  I am now going on another tour with them for a bachelor party, and they could not have provided more prompt replies to my requests for information related to travel, pick up at different locations, types of tours they offer, and pricing.  What a great business run by some truly nice and professional people who offer very reasonable pricing.  I plan to use their services again in the future."

                "description": "Blue Owl Brewing is known for their sour beers. I am happy to report that they also have a normal pilsner and IPA, as well as ciders and some sort of frozen beer drink. The bartender was super friendly and let us know we could split a tasting between the two of us (one of us would get a glass cup we could keep and the other person would get a plastic cup). Since I am currently short on glasses, I chose the cup I wanted. They had 4 choices at varying prices. We really enjoyed all of the beers we had - they are definitely unique. I did the hazy IPA and a coconut IPA. They also have a ton of soft shirts for sale, which I am a big fan of. This is a great spot to grab a cold beer on summer day, since there is indoor seating, as well as a covered patio. I will definitely return to this little gem."

                "description": "Buyer Beware!!   You don't get to have a choice in whether or not to buy a souvenir beverage receptacle :(  Unfortunately, Blue Owl Brewing doesn't sell beer. It sells cups and glasses, which come with beer in them.   I paid $9 for a cheap blue plastic souvenir cup in order to get one beer. I was traveling to Austin by airplane (during the weekend of the TSA meltdown at the airport) and don't have room to carry around a cheap plastic cup, much less a glass.    If you think you might want to drink two beers you have to upgrade to buying a glass for $22, which then entitles you to two beers, at $11 each. One of which comes in the mandatory souvenir glass -whether you want it or not- and the other in an even cheaper clear plastic cup. If you want to share four beers with friends you have to buy the largest glass for $32 (I may be off slightly regarding the price) and they will give you a souvenir glass and three, even cheaper, plastic disposable cups. You can also choose to refill the same glass four times. In any case this will cost you $8 per beer which is the cheapest options if you're looking for volume.  Please note, you are not allowed to bring your own reusable glass/mug/plastic cup and buy the beer. Because, this place sells cups and glasses. Not beer. The beer is a byproduct of buying a glass.  From an environmental perspective, this is not a responsible business model. Stop selling plastic cups and start selling beer. Get a dishwasher so you a can re-use your glass inventory.  When you go to a brewery it's usually because you want beer. Not a glass. If you do want a glass you can pick one up at the gift shop. Honestly, my friend and I should have walked out after learning of the cup-buying scheme, but we had just walked two miles to get there, and watching the confusion spread over the faces of thirsty consumers who came in after us was priceless.   Locals with B.O.B. growlers didn't seem to mind. I have no idea what a growler would cost, or how many,even cheaper, plastic cups it comes with.  We won't be going back unless they start selling beer instead of glasses. The business model didn't sit well with either of us. Granted this is a subjective observation. One star for the server as she was polite and seemed a little exasperated in explaining the business model. One star for the beer, they have some good flavors here. And one more for the atmosphere as it had a nice vibe.  We both placed our cheap blue plastic souvenir cups on top of the growing stack of other cheap blue plastic souvenir cups  in the recycle bin on the way out."

I think we got there at the right time because we were able to secure a seat inside where it was considerably cooler than the outside seating.   The process for ordering was fairly simple and the lady helping me was kind enough to break it down for a new out-of-towner. We got 4 sour beers and they were really interesting. On this particular occasion I had a new experience after I finished my 2nd sour beer. I learned that sour beer gives me heart burn. 1st time ever. I was asking my friend what this fire in my chest was. She loved the sour beers she ordered and we got glasses to remember the occasion. BOB... you'll always be my first.   I recommend checking it out and if you like sour beers Blue Owl Brewing will put a smile on your face. The staff is friendly and hip, and the beer flows as does the good times.   Prohst!!!"

We ordered a glass and got 4 beers with the glass, if you are not able to finish your 4 beers, they will let you take the extras to go in cans! I believe the size we got was $20 per person. They had about 3 different options for sizes of glasses. The girl said we could even share one order if we wanted less beers per person.  I love all the options of the beers (they are all \"sour\" and DELICIOUS)!! My all time favorite that I tried was the Jubilberry!  The only complaint I would have was parking was a little hard to find but we ended up parking in a lot close by.  We will definitely be coming back when in Ausitn!"

She came outside and said we had to drink canned beers off the property and took away our drinks saying she could bring us new ones in glasses -- AND SHE NEVER came back. There was NO CLEAR MARKING that canned beers were equivalent to to go beers and QR code's we're on the tables with the option to order canned beers. Little to no seating and a water fan was blowing, causing the customers to get wet. I would never recommend this place!"

I cannot recommend it enough -- thought I didn't like sour beer, oh boy I was wrong. Absolutely ADORE the Tangerina, Tiki Hop Totem, Plum de Plume, Limetastico and Jubilberry beers. And they had a Plum de Plume + mango beer slushee, so yum! Patio was very full on Sunday so we had to wait to snag an outdoor table but it was worth it. The staff is always incredibly nice and feels safe for COVID. Every Thursday they spin a wheel for a growler deal -- entire growler of amazing beer for $9! And their merch is so cute, definitely have a koozie collection now. Biggest perk of in-person is if you buy a beer glass (pictured here with a very cool design) you get 4 pours for $16. It really doesn't get better than this."

                "description": "A brewery that does only sours! I was so happy to find this place while exploring East Austin. You know, it's been a while since I walked around a neighborhood without my phone constantly telling me where to go. This time I did, and Cesar Chavez led me here and to so many other amazing spots!   You walk in, order a glass that you get to keep! And then you get 4 beers in that glass! The best part? If you are like me and get the cool goblet at 16 oz. you can't drink that much beer at once. You can keep your tasting card and come back for the other 1 or 2 that you maybe couldn't do at visit #1! I think the limit is about a month between visits, but I'm not sure. Honestly, we came here 3 times. One time we didn't have our tasting cards so just did 4 tasting size glasses. Yes, we are big fans and came back to Indy with 4 glasses!   The patio is covered which is great during Texas spring/summer. If you're lucky, and someone leaves and hands you their card, double bonus!   I highly recommend visiting because even my husband, who does not love sours as I do, found a beer he liked (Van Dayum), and we even passed on the love to my sister-in-law who lives in RR! (How has she not been here yet?!)"

                "description": "Spent a whole evening here due to the unusual policy of requiring you to purchase a glass that comes with 4 pours. We drank our 4 14 oz pours over the course of a few hours, but it's nice that we had the option to bail earlier and take home a can instead. The patio is nicely set up with distanced tables, fans, and hand sanitizers at every table. We brought over food from Vegan Nom, a couple minutes walk away. My partner and I each tried 4 different beers. All were delicious! This was our first visit to the brewery despite buying the beer from stores many times. I would definitely come back but with the awareness of the policy that you have to buy at least 4 12oz pours (you can split amongst multiple people though). I think the real highlight of visiting the brewery are the frozen beer drinks. They had a \"Mexican Marteeny\" available the night we went, which is based on the Teenybopper ale with some other things mixed in. Amazing, and a great final glass! The bartender was lovely and was able to answer all our questions, too."

If you don't like sour beer, verify by trying the definition of it at Blue Owl Brewing because \"The Owls are not what they seem.\" - yep, they're Lynch fans of the best show to make it to TV.  BOB is your uncle and your favorite sour beer. Come in and select a size, get 4 samples in that glass, and when you finish - keep it! The glass is yours.  Heavy rotation keeps its original and I love it. They have some staples for those trying to have a routine.  Buy some swag and get the brand out there! #LittleBossIsMyFav #BlueOwlSightings"

Sure, you can split it or take some home but sometimes I just want 1-2 beers on site and not have to buy 4. My boyfriend and I came and bought the 4 but then wanted one more. Nope, buy 4 more or none. We picked none and left. I just wish we could come and buy one or two beers without being forced to buy 4."

                "description": "If you like sour beers, youll love this place. Personally i find it gimmicy. The sour beers dont do it for me. Also they make you buy a pint glass before you can order.  The main draws are that its in a cool neighborhood, i like that the beers are highly alcoholic. Also their patio is dece, but it could use more seating. Finally, their gimmicky ordering system causes people to leave free beer tickets around constantly. I like free beer.  The big gimmick, which I find annoying, aside from the sour beers buying a glass when you to get a drink. When you buy one, you're basically comitting to four 12 oz. pours and possibly coming back in the future. There are other sizes, but the 12 oz. Is the best value and it feels weird drinking beer from a shot glass.   You can bring a glass you already bought, but overall its annoying to bring a pint glass to a bar. If i wanted to clean my own glasses, i would drink at home. Thats why youre kinda commiting to coming back by buying one.  They give you a sheet to check off the number of pours. The sheets are transferable and can be used on different days so make sure to hold on to them. Also, we usually find a sheet of people who didnt use all their pours so youll usually get a few free."

                "description": "Came here with a couple of friends on a Friday night because of a recommendation from a friend of mine, and it did not disappoint. For $16, my friends and I each got a normal sized glass to take home and 4 pours of any choice (you can do 8 half pours). There are also different types and sizes for glasses, so you could opt for a bigger or smaller glas.   Beer/Sours: Great quality drinks with a wide range of flavors. If you don't like sours this may not be the place for you, but definitely give it a shot if you like beers in general.   Service: Nothing to be said here, super nice and friendly staff! Felt right at home.   Atmosphere: Great! Nothing that prevents you from enjoying your afternoon or your conversation.   Definitely coming here again, hopefully I'll collect all 4 glasses!"

                "description": "When we were walking over to this place from Lazarus brewing my wife said, \"I think they only have sours\". I was like no way, I will just grab an IPA or something... Oh man was I shocked to see that they literally only had sours. With that being said let me start this shockingly high review for a place that only has sours by saying... i do not care for sour beers. So a 5 star coming from a person who doesnt enjoy sours should say something.  I loved everything about this place. This place is in a cool location, has a great logo, has great aesthetic, and a really cool flight idea. If it wasnt all sour beers... I would live at this place.  Let me explain how the flights work here. You pick your glass size... If I were to guess I would say 4oz, 8oz, 12oz... but honestly that is a guess. Then you get 4 samples in that size. You bring up your sheet, they check off the beer and you sample it. Oh and the best part is that after you are done you get to keep the glass. Oh and the prices are not crazy. I want to say it was $6, $8, $10, but that might also be off. This is definitely one of the coolest strategies I have seen for flights at a brewery ever... Oh and the glasses all looked really neat for sure.  Now onto the beer. Like I have mentioned multiple times already, I am not a fan of sours, but I liked the initial flavor of most of these beers. We had the wee heavy, the red, the earl grey one (lazarus colab), and the cherry stout. Everything had a great crafted flavor, until I hit the sour note. I relied on my wife to drink most of these, but I was very impressed by everything for sure. And my wife was happy with everything as well.  I would suggest anyone in Austin come visit this place for sure. Definitely worth the trip and more so if you like sours!!"

It's dimly lit inside and not too bright outside either but provides an overall chill mood and environment. Food truck outside serves a good sausage and fries but everything else besides that is about $8 or more, with most things averaging out to be $11-12 per menu item, a little pricey in my opinion for food truck foods.   One ask I'd have is that they install some light features above the dartboards so it's easier to see and play on."

                "description": "This is a fun place to grab a beer with friends, especially during the pandemic since all of their seating is outdoors.  Beer is decent; not the best I've had but definitely a good effort for their own craft brews.  Atmosphere is a good cross between German and Renaissance-y, almost felt like we were hanging out at the ren fest.  They have a contactless ordering system set up - all ordering is done via website and they call your name when your beer is ready at the main indoor entrance.  My main complaint is that every individual order on the website REQUIRES a food order ($3 french fries from the nearby food truck when we were there).  So if you're chilling here for an extended period of time and like me, order your beers sequentially after you finish each one, you have to get an order of french fries with every single beer order.  I understand this is because of the Texas law requiring 51% food sales in order to classify the establishment as a restaurant to stay open during the pandemic.  But don't force me to help you meet your 51% quota with each drink order I place.    If other breweries can do it without adjusting their way of ordering, it can be done. We eat too many french fries, we won't have room to try more of your beers!"

                "description": "The Draught House Pub has been around for 50 years which is unheard of from a business perspective so hats off to them! I'd say there's a lot to like about this pub which exudes a European vibe with all the wooden decor and dark lighting. The first point of interest was their tap board which was operated by Digital Pour. This thing gives you a ton of info! Not only does it list the beer name, brewery, ABV, style, and price, but it mentions the serving size and gives you an illustration of the serving glass and -- the most intriguing feature -- the keg volume status. You're even able to deduce if they have more than one keg of said beer. I have never seen this anywhere before as most pubs and breweries -- if they use a digital tap board -- turn to Untappd. The only downside is that they have a crap ton of taps, so you have to wait for the projection to scroll through a few screens to get an idea of the full tap list.   The initial impressions were already very positive, so the fact that they served tasters was another added bonus. I believe they are known for their nightly specials and there was one going on for that night which I think was 50% off their house beers. The flight wouldn't have applied for this offer, so like we ordered a half pour of their *Triple Double*, an excellent 8% IPA. Very surprising, but the stout they brewed for their 50 anny was fairly normal. Roasty, easy-drinking, and mild.   Overall, this is a legitimate watering hole, offering the variety needed to appease every kind of drinker and the chilled out atmosphere sought after by every thirsty adult."

                "description": "I'm thrilled that we finally hit the Draught house for a few cold beers on a hot Sunday. As others have noted this a chill pub with a million (really about 70) beers on tap. They even had a Frose' available, not sure why.... (joke)  There is limited parking on site but on the weekend there is plenty of parking next door. check their website for additional parking Info. You can either hang inside, in the AC, or chill outside in the shade. Be sure to bring your mutt as well.   The beer is king here! If you can't find a beer to your liking then you ain't looking hard enough. Their Summer Ale and Rosedale Blonde was perfect on a hot day.  They were out of their featured IPA but the Bombay IPA was perfectly fine.  This would have been an easy 5-star review except for the bartenders on duty this past Sunday. Maybe I did not have a cool enough t-shirt on, was not a regular, or my 20% tip per round wasn't enough but lose the effin' attitude. When I walk up to order and say hi don't just nod and ask what do you want. when I ask you how would categorize an IPA don't respond with \"it's a regular IPA\" WTF is a regular IPA there are about 10 different styles of IPAs. When I ask is it similar to a west coast same response...   Seriously, if you just want to serve your regulars put a sign out front stating so. We'll return for the beer selection as it is fabulous but I'll be sure to adjust my expectations regarding the service..."

Really hits every variety and they offer tastes even before buying.  I went with a flight to try 5oz of 4 pours.  Good portion but I was charged $1 which is pretty excessive in my mind.  Other than the price, I liked the place and location.  Really a beer forward establishment with no TV, darts, and tons of seating indoor and outdoor.  This is not your new age place - come here to drink and to conversate.  Dogs welcome and parking tough in the lot but plenty along the street.  Overall I enjoyed myself and considering free WIFi I can  forget about the lack of TV.  For beer, this is on the short list in Austin."

                "description": "One of my favorite stops on my first visit to Austin! My friend and I chatted with the bartender, who helped us each chose our own flight of beers. We have very different tastes and were able to find four beers each that we absolutely loved. Lots of local options!   They also had a food truck outside, which provided some much-needed sustenance after our flight. We shared the falafel plate with fresh veggies, pita and hummus.   The back patio was a nice spot to relax in the evening air under a heat lamp. We moved inside for a cozier atmosphere once it got too chilly."

Works for us early in the afternoon.   Of note: our waiter Kyle was very informative and quite engaging. However, we didn't see Kyle's bio on the website, but you have two house dogs? Where's his bio. Come on. Don't worry, you still rate five stars."

I tried the Kielbasa and the Fig and Duck sausages. Both were perfect. The fig and onions paired amazing and want more as I type.   The pretzel and friend pickle spears were also a lot on with flavor. Many places do a big pretzel...this one does it right!"

However, our food came out late and close to closing so when they set our food down, they opened to doors to try and get people to leave. It was below 37 degrees and our food was cold in an instant and we were rushed out of there despite it not being our fault. Not the best experience.   I would recommend the Poutine, Mac and cheese, and the Bacon and Fig Sausage."

The vibes flow and the service is top tier, we waited about 40 minutes (not bad for a sunday brunch) and only took 15 or so minutes for food to arrive. Bangers is getting 4 stars due to the fact that the champagne for the manmosas are pre poured, so you get no bubbly - but a flat champagne. Other than that, such an amazing establishment and good live music!"

                "description": "Bangers is a great spot for a large group bunch or just day drinking under the sun! Came on a Saturday afternoon around 1pm and didn't get seated til around 1:45pm. They have an outdoor bar and a few open seats which makes it easy to grab a drink or two before actually sitting to order a meal.   The manmosas are large and charged with champagne goodness! Note, you have to order a snack with a purchase. I highly recommend the chicharron or pretzel!  Once you're seating, service is quick and organized. I was surprised how well our server was able to keep everything in order while we were ordering left and right. I highly recommend the smoked turkey sandwich or one of the meat plates. The meat is tender and smoky. The picked veggies on the side are like icing on the cake!"

The vibe is truly what Austin represents and is in the perfect location.  The beer garden has so many different beers on tap, especially the best local ones. I strongly recommend the Live Oak Hefeweizen. If you're in the mood, they are also famous for their Manmosas which are an entire champagne bottle mixed with Oj. Their food is also amazing too - I always get their jalapeño cheddar sausage. The giant pretzel and Mac and cheese are great as well!"

Service is excellent and great beer choices. I didn't immediately realize you can order flights, which is always a game changer for me.   Pro-tip: If you're not \"eating\", you can bypass the wait and go right into the bar... where you can also order a very large pretzel the size of your head. What else could a girl need?"

                "description": "I'm still in awe from my wonderful experience at Bangers yesterday. On a rainy and cold Saturday morning, I realized my previous plans to host a 2 year old's birthday party outdoors the next day was significantly at risk. In a state of panic, I called Bangers to see what last minute options there were for 35 people including 8 toddlers. Having worked in the service industry for over a decade, I recognize this ask is a nightmare of epic proportions.  Thankfully, my prayers were answered when Chris, the head of operations answered the call. Right away he went into problem solving mode, suggesting the upstairs area and letting me know he'd build a big ol fire for us.  When we arrived the following Sunday, Chris rolled out the red carpet. Even though he was having an office day, he proceeded to give us coffee from his own office, access to his own private bathroom and served us brunch items even though were weren't technically a table. And y'all, HE REFUSED A TIP AT THE END.  There are no words to express how meaningful and special this day was for me, my two year old, friends and family. What an amazing and good hearted person you have to be to do that for complete strangers. Chris, from the bottom of my heart, thank you."

                "description": "Bangers is not only one of the biggest establishments on Rainey Street, but they also have one of the largest beer selections I have seen in one location. The large smokehouse out back provides an aromatic invite right off the street.  Living up to your name is easy for Bangers, they offer a very unique and impressive sausage menu, and if you're not a fan of sausage they have plenty of other options available. Although I did not try the vegetarian options, I was told they were phenomenal by some pretty picky vegetarians!  The sausages are absolutely excellent, they seem to love the garlic aioli here which I do now as well, ketchup isn't the only thing that belongs on a brat. The beer garden is plenty big for any size group and the staff are excellent hosts.  Cheers!"

                "description": "TLDR; Beer selection 5/5, food 1/5  When you arrive on Rainey street, where Bangers is located, you'll see tons of bars, restaurants and food trucks! The street is really charming. Bangers was super packed at 2 PM on a Friday afternoon, so I was excited to try it. There are 2 options: Full menu and Light snacks/beer  During my first visit, we went with light snacks and beer. Snack selection included chips, pig skins, pretzels. Not much to choose from here. The beer selection however, was a large selection and we were really impressed! Each beer ranged from $5-10  During my second visit, we came back to try the food. It was quite disappointing and really heavy. The servers were great though CHARRED LETTUCE: Lettuce did not seem fresh, too much sauce LOADED FRIES: There are a few different options for the loaded fries, but all of their fries are thick cuts and very starchy  DUCK FIG HOT DOG: the sausage was piping hot when it got to our table. The fig and onion were on the top, but only enough to cover the middle of the hot dog. Sausage felt super heavy and my group of 2 couldn't finish it Would probably come again to grab a beer, but pass on the food"

Unfortunately over several attempts this year, I've found that not to be the case.  Most recently not only was the ability to split checks super reduced, the waitstaff was also unattentive, ingenuine, and borderline rude.    I've definitely also had positive experiences before their big expansion, but it seems clear that quantity is winning over quality at Bangers these days."

What could have been a chaotic day due to inclement weather (think 35 people including 8 kids under 3 huddled under the relatively small awning - each child taking turns grabbing pretzels from strangers picnic tables and dipping their fingers in beers - \"my germs!\") turned into a wonderful experience thanks to Chris and all others working on Sunday.  Without us asking for any special favors, Chris and his team went out of their way to provide us a private upstairs dining space for our party last-minute, doing so with genuine smiles and positivity despite the busy Sunday rush.  I absolutely urge anyone planning an event to consider Bangers' amazing food, beer selection, and most importantly, kind and empathetic service."

We were served promptly and the food came out relatively fast. The fried pickles were the best thing I've ever put in my mouth as weird as that is they were just delicious!!!! The hotdogs we got were super yummy and the garlic aioli sauce was lovely too. We also got the passionfruit cider which I loved and was recommended from the waiter and the giant manmosa which was huge!!!!  The toilets were modern and clean and the atmosphere was fun.

                "description": "The inside/outside atmosphere is really cool being in an old home/building that has been redone to preserve the old age beauty. I spent my time at the patio bar. Both bartenders were such a joy; not only to myself but everyone. They spent the necessary time greeting everyone and helping to figure out how to get to a table asap. Even among small conversations between tables, the bartenders were on top of their serving game.   I have had the waterloo and center cut pork chop. I'm not usually a pork kinda person but the peach chutney was SO good. It was the perfect amount of food and tasted so yummy.   I will definitely go back when I am in Austin. This is the type of place to visit with friends and family for a great evening of sharing small plates, good drinks, and lots of laughs. Or it's old-timey beauty makes it a wonderful date night place. Or grab a cocktail and sit on the front porch people watching... the diversity of the restaurant is really for any occasion.   I can't wait to visit for a weekend brunch!   Thanks so much for the food, drinks, and amazing service!"

If you're only looking to grab drinks or even a drink after dinner, Moonshine recently opened a Speakeasy inside the restaurant. @kinfolkaustin can be found downstairs and it's by reservation only    Moonshine has been a favorite dinner spot of ours and we always look forward to each meal here. Highly recommend for the food, experience, and service  Big thank you again to Sera to making our dinner experience even more enjoyable."

                "description": "#2 most reviewed spot in Austin and it did not disappoint. Southern food usually means being unhealthy and my ever failing diet goes further down the rabbit hole. No regrets what-so-ever.  We got here around 7PM where we had a 5 minute wait before a table opened up for the two of us. I got to see how massive this restaurant was as we were lead to a heated tent, which was set up adjacent to the building. The table comes with free popcorn, but we had to ask the server about it as they were never pre-served before we arrived. NBD.  I started off with a Good Hearted Old Fashion ($13). First thing I noticed was that the glass was only half full, but it's supposed to be like this due to the nature of the drink. Tastes great and it's the popular drink ordered. Just sip slowly.  For appetizers, we split the Fried Green Tomatoes ($12) with smoked shrimp, tomatillo aioli, and pimento. Pretty much a way to saying you weren't all that unhealthy, when in reality it's also battered and fried. The smoked shrimp makes it worth ordering from a price perspective and they happen to taste great together.We also ordered The Original Moonshine Corn Dog Shrimp ($12), fancy enough to their own trademark on it. Came with a honey mustard dipping sauce. Tastes pretty good, but it wasn't unique as I've had similar items like this, just not served on a stick.  For the entree to split, we got the Chicken Fried Steak ($18), essentially a giant batter fried chicken with chipotle cream gravy and yukon mashers. This alone between the two of us along with the appetizers was enough to fill us up generously. Tasted amazing and an excellent option if you're not feeling the pork or beef, essentially tired of consuming BBQ all week.  Overall, great food, great service, and a great experience. Would recommend making a stop here if you're making a stop in Austin."

                "description": "EXPECT TO WAIT!! If you are trying to find convenient parking, they offer valet. Went up to the hostess stand and for a table of two, got quoted at least 90 minutes. That was a true 90 minutes. We were lucky enough to get a seat at the bar after 20 minutes but people who checked in around us were not so lucky. Even after people turned in their pagers and left, the wait was still true. While you wait you can order drinks and appetizers at the bar. The bartenders were friendly, helpful and attentive. We ordered Brussel Sprouts, Chicken Fried Steak, Chicken and Waffles and Banana Pudding. My favorite part was the Brussel Sprouts. They were simple, slightly sweet and cooked nicely. The chicken and waffles were good. It seemed like there is cornmeal in the waffle. I enjoyed this as I thought the similar taste to corn bread really preserves the savory part of this dish. The chicken fried steak was just alright. Expected more after hearing it was the 3rd best in the state. The pudding was great. Great flavor but if you like an abundance of wafers it might not be for you. Overall, this place is great if you do not mind the wait. I do not think I would wait that long for it again."

                "description": "In an effort to clear out more of my old review drafts, I'll be posting some that are long overdue. Unfortunately, some of the finer details are now lost in memory, but Moonshine Patio Bar and Grill was our last meal in Austin, Texas. It was for a Sunday brunch (8/15/2021).  Conveniently located in Downtown, we were actually able to walk here from the hotel. At over 5.1k reviews, this would definitely appear to be one of the most popular restaurants in the city. That said, I was pretty interested to see what it was all about.  To eat, I ordered the steak and eggs. It took a little while to get our food, but service was friendly. The place was packed, as expected. Overall, I thought the food was good. The atmosphere is what really stood out to me though. While I wasn't super impressed by the food, I would not be opposed to returning."

                "description": "Came for the Whiskey selections and left pretty happy with trying that out! We sat out in the back covered patio area which is cozy. The food was very good, but not amazing. I think it's a fair price point for being downtown and being a more talked about Austin restaurant. My pork chop dish was ($22), looked good but tasted like nothing special. I would come back to try the brunch, but I'm not rushing back for anything other than the drinks and outside atmosphere.   It took a long time to get our food even though there was only 2 other small tables of customers outside and a few inside. Our waitstaff was very attentive and had great recommendations for drinks after talking to her a bit. They have vast options for drinks and drink deals on certain nights which is why we stopped by.  Street parking is a hassle here, especially on the weekends, but luckily it's close to a lot of places downtown and makes for an easy walk."

                "description": "Despite the high ratings, I was underwhelmed with Moonshine Patio Bar and Grill... I came in for brunch and ordered the Chicken Fried Steak. Moonshine is the definition of a southern brunch, as there are no light meals here! The Chicken Fried Steak was nothing extravagant, comparable to Jack Allen's."

                "description": "My friends and I came here for dinner the other night. I want to say that Yelp led me right with the photos and recommendations. Everything with the Yelp Hype is real. This place and environment overall is awesome. The staff here was  is really great! Plenty of seating, but I can see how this place would have wait when it's busy.   The place has a outdoor heated seating. It was very warm and toasty comfortable. The sliding door of the patio, you could feel like the Hulk when you're trying to open it.  All the beers we had were in a can, and we came just at the right time for happy hour. As other Yelpers stated I was truly amazed with the prices and portions of the food. I had the pork chop and man that chop was so delicious!! Another buddy of mine had the same thing. Another one had the turkey club sandwich and that thing was huge!  We also ordered some pretzel sticks and those were the perfect appetizers. You also get a bucket of free popcorn.  One thing about coming here it's easy to find; however, parking may be a bit of challenge when busy. We lucked out during our visit here and were able to park right on the front of the building.  I definitely want to come back and try some other items on the menu. Great food, drinks, and the prices are right here!"

                "description": "We came to Austin and Moonshine was the first lunch place we hit up, based on a friend's recommendation.  I wasn't super hungry, so decided to try the cornflake battered chicken salad. The chicken was excellent. Crunchy on the outside and very moist inside. The salad came with 3 large pieces. But my problem was that I dumped the dressing throughout the salad so was therefore stuck with it. And I thought it was a not great honey mustard dressing. I am usually not at all picky, but the dressing was too thickly and too mustardy. If half stars were an option, I'd give my salad a 3.5.  My husband ordered the chicken steaks smothered in a white gravy, and really liked it. Before our entrees came, we were brought a large basket of popcorn. That was a nice touch."

I believe my friend ordered a steak with grits and I wanted to take his plate as well as mine.    The service was amazing and the atmosphere is on point. I will be returning even if it's a 48 ago but the experience is quite intense and is great for any type of meet up for business and personal."

                "description": "On a trip to Austin, we came across Moonshine and really enjoyed our dinner here.  We started with the pretzel sticks and pimento cheese as our appetizer - so good! The pimento was very flavorful and the pretzel sticks were baked to PERFECTION.  For my entree I had one of their fried chicken sandwiches. The chicken patty was very thin compared to most fried chicken sandwiches I've had, but the flavor was still there in every bite. The accompanying fries were yummy as well!  NOTE: on Mondays they have 50% off wine bottles. Just in case that's useful for you ;)"

It was walking distance from our hotel on Third Street.  We got seated at the patio outside for a party of 5, and they adjusted the shade for us since the sun was in our face.   The service was okay, the food was pretty good. The size of that chicken friend steak was definitely Texas size! The cocktails were delicious. We even got a flight of moonshines, but that was a bit hard to drink. It was way to sweet for me personally.   Overall: Cleanliness: 8/10 Food: 8/10 Service: 7/10"

If you're looking for something on the lighter side, go for the Migas. Both the Beyond Veggie Burger and Backyard Chicken Sandwich hit the spot as well. They even accommodated my friend's request to switch the bread to a biscuit. The sauce that comes with the Sweet Potato Tater Tots is phenomenal.   They have great heated outdoor seating (tent style), wonderful servers, and generally a great atmosphere!"

                "description": "This restaurant just kind of pulls you in from the street. Being one of the oldest buildings in Austin, this place is obviously well known, and we were lucky to get in.   The atmosphere inside the restaurant just emanates southern charm and the menu offers some excellent southern comfort food entrees. Any time I find an appetizer not normally seen on a menu, I have to try it, and in this case, it was the deviled eggs.   I typically don't have the courage to try anyone else's deviled eggs because I am very picky when it comes to those, so I swore they better be good and they were very good. They were creamy, flavorful and had no pesky surprises like celery or relish.  One thing I never thought I would eat for dinner is chicken and waffles and being in Austin I decided I had to try. I was impressed with the seasoning of the chicken and the light breading. The waffles were fluffy, they came with plenty of butter and syrup. This entree was the epitome of sweet and salty, and a little bit spicy.  The staff are great, the drinks are great, and the atmosphere is alive. Cheers!"

                "description": "Decided to take a break from bbq and try something different. After a quick yelp search decided on this place and glad we did. It was an easy walk from our hotel in downtown Austin so that was a plus. They start you off with popcorn which is something different and nice. The popcorn was jazzed up with what I believe to be garlic and paprika and was amazing.  I got the old fashioned and wife got a drink called the fiddler which was whiskey spiced up with jalapeño. Both were really really good.  For an app we got the deviled eggs. Got to say not impressed. They used a lot of mustard and neither me or the wife cared for them.  For a main course we shared the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes. It was absolutely enough for both of us and must say it was delicious. We also shared a side salad.  For desert we shared a banana pudding. Let me tell you order this it's fantastic.  The staff were very friendly and helpful and the ambiance of this place was also super nice and unique.  Definitely recommend and would come back."

Had we gotten there later, I think we'd have had to wait quite a while. Its flooded with customers on the weekend! Curious what it would be like during the week? ‍  Service was wonderful! Our waiter was fun, knowledgeable and attentive! I think that was the case across the staff. They take the service seriously!   The food is decadent! It's heaping portions with a southern flare. I got the green chili hash that was pretty good. My favorite part of the meal was the biscuits we ordered as an appetizer. Delicious!   This is a great spot! My friends and I enjoyed it! The menu is pretty straightforward. You'll walk away full of yummy food."

And greatly mouth watering. I got the jalapeño shutter steak which at first site looks small but will fill you and and have you in an awww that was good. Marissa our server was very attentive and could run us through the whole menu and make sure that we choose what we were craving. They start you off with popcorn at your table for some finger food and homemade cornbread with every meal. My wife also said that there moonshine was very smooth to the taste and went well with the meal. High recommend coming and eating at this reatraunt.

I had to ask the waitress where mine was, she checked and said it was next up. 10 minutes later still no lunch. I checked and it was behind 4 other orders! Their excuse was that mine had to be cooked, but it doesn't take 30 minutes to tear up a couple tortillas, heat them in salsa and fry a couple eggs to put on top!  They won't have another opportunity to provide me with bad service and excuses!"

                "description": "Food was amazing but service was eh. I've been to my fair share of food halls and similarly set up places, but this one was a little confusing walking in. Think hop daddy or a similar restaurant. Once you order at the front, grab your seat and make yourself comfortable. I stopped by on a Saturday early afternoon, and luckily enough it wasn't super busy. If you if anyone was wearing a mask. But since this is Texas I guess COVID doesn't exist.  Onto the food! I ordered off of their brunch menu which was super delicious. The Chilla Quiles were enormous l!!    I sat down at the bar, which was OK and really where my four-star review comes from. The bartender was nice enough, but really didn't seem interested in actually serving people. She's definitely one of those bartenders that wants to give you your drink and then get you out of her face. It wasn't super clear to me how to check out so I asked another random person that came by and they were kind enough to explain the process to me. Being from out of town, folks in Texas sure aren't as nice as we say we are. And I say this as someone born and raised in Texas."

I also accidentally ordered a breakfast shot, which I thought was just a drink.   It ended up being good and unique but got me buzzed so I had to chill a bit since I'm not a big drinker.

                "description": "We happened to be in the area and stumbled across Industry as a brunch option. First, today is pretty cold outside and their wall windows (?) are wide open. I get it, it's their design. We were considering finding another spot, but decided to stay and try it out. I ordered the chilaquiles w/ chicken, hubs got the chicken sando, and we had a side of the green chile queso. The food came out at a decent pace. The queso was barley luke warm. Why? It tasted okay, flavors are nothing special, but I was expecting it to be warmer than what it was. When our order came out, my chilaquiles were also luke warm, if not almost cold. Is the cold air chilling the food quicker than normal? Probably not. The side of beans and rice I had was piping hot and I ate that towards the end of my meal. The chilaquiles were made w/ the chips that they serve with their chips and dip; not a fan of that. The hub's sando was good. Overall, 3 stars cuz the flavors weren't that bad: I was willing to overlook the cold dining room, but not the almost cold food."

                "description": "TLDR a-ok to I'm a fan despite some bumps  My first time ordering for pickup. Everything was delicious, it was ready at the time promised. The big flaw was I didn't get the beer battered squash I ordered and paid for, but as Mr R didn't check the bag before leaving we cannot lay that all on them. It was a very busy night and mistakes happen.  The other error was I didn't get the 30% off to-go booze still advertised on their online menu which is why this isn't 5*  Mr R is besotted with their black bean veggie burger. I think there must be spice in the patty as none of the other listed ingredients explain its lovely low heat. He also likes the texture of the bean patty, he wanted me to mention that.  The salmon burger was good, huge, nice fresh veg, I love the spice in the aioli and poblano ranch, but I REALLY wish they still did the smoked salmon bagel I had one brunch there long ago.  The farm beet salad? Gorgeous. Mr R gleefully ate most of it on his own and he often eats salads with a sense of duty rather than joy. I loved the white balsamic vinaigrette it came with, I'm going to need that more often in my life.  The drinks to go? Hooray! One note, bring your own standard brown pulp drink tray if you think you'll need one because they didn't provide one. The pours were fabulous on our mimosas, The Closer and White Box. Ice was the perfect amount.  The transaction could have gone smoother, but the meal went down great. This remains a place Mr R wants to go *every* time he's in town."

                "description": "We ordered from UberEats and after having them call to say they were out of the Salmon Burger and Catfish with Chips we opted out for the Chicken Friend Chicken and Fried Chicken Burger. The order was delayed by 35 minutes which is understandable since they had to switch out our meals. But once we got our meals we realized the sides that come with the entres were missing completely as well.  Starving my friend dug into his Chicken Fried Chicken and I took a few bites of the sandwich. He was basically done with it when he cut into the last bits and realized that the food was indeed cold and fleshy. I stopped to look at mine and I was baffled by the underlying pink on the bottom of the chicken patty. He immediately regurgitate it back up and I stopped and threw the rest of my sandwich away.    We spent over 70 dollars on a meal that had to be thrown away. The only things we did eat were our Brussels sprouts and cheese fries.   Will not be eating here again."

I gave them an over all three stars only because they lost one star on my dish, I ordered biscuits and gravy super dry not enough gravy for the portion of the biscuit. Then they lost the second star because half way through my meal, my mimosa never arrived! I was parched and when I asked the waitress she said \" I lost your ticket, I will put in your  order\" I don't understand how that even works when you order at the front of the restaurant.

The $11  mimosa carafe special immediately got my attention. I knew I had to have that. Found us a booth on the left corner by the bar. Ordered the mimosa, 2 industry burgers, Parmesan fries and the tater tot casserole. The mimosa was disappointingly room temperature. The burgers were bordering on salty but were good. We especially liked the chips and salsa that came with it. The fries were good but a little expensive for what you get. The tater tot casserole , we didn't like at all. Very salty and the hot sauce did not go with the dish at all. Don't think we'll come back."

We also had the chicken tacos and the person who had those raves about how good they were! We also had the queso, salsa, fried squash, loaded fries and Brussel sprouts for appetizer and all were a huge hit!! Most of the teenagers had the burgers and did not like them. They said they tasted like sausage. I think the issue is the burgers were very, very lean and smoked so they were a little dry.  The BIGGEST COMPLAINT were the flies...OMG!!! So freaking annoying to have to constantly be waving your hand back and forth so a darn fly does not land on your food!! Do something about that bc we would never come back solely for that purpose!"

EPBG has made a HUGE change to the menu and quality of ingredients!  #NewChef #GoodFood #NewBrunchSpot #TheNewOasis  A friend wanted me to go to Brunch and said I could pick the place.  I wanted to go somewhere new and saw that EPBG had a great menu for Brunch.  I had recently heard that the food was good now, so why not give them a try?  You know it is difficult to find a great brunch spot, not to mention one without an hour wait or more.  I ordered the Hippie Scramble and was very pleased.  For $14 the dish came with fresh spinach, wild mushrooms (not some cheap white mushrooms), heirloom tomatoes (that tasted like they just came off the vine and red onions.  The dish was topped off with homemade Hollandaise and Goat Cheese.  I told the Chef multiple times that I was in love with his goat cheese.  OMG I think I could have eaten a plate of that alone.  My friend had the Crab Cake Benedict, and I must say that too was delicious.  Tasted like fresh crab (it was not Krab) and the portion was too large to finish.  The fresh dill on top complimented the dish nicely.  Special shout out for the high-end paper plates.  Seriously, they were so nice that from a far they looked like real dishes.  I will definitely be back to try out more dishes on their new menu, enjoy the live music, libations from the bar and take in the phenomenal view."

We need more places on Lake Travis and EPBG is such an iconic spot, BUT they have not/are not properly handling the COVID-19 pandemic. They have taken very few measures to keep their staff and patrons safe from possible infection (sure, I'll take a little hand sanitizer).   As an area resident, I've visited EPBG (and every other name it ever had since Carlos n Charlie's closed) many many times. I want the property to be open and thrive, but not with an owner who apparently places little value on human life. Plus, to be completely honest the food is barely above par (wings ok) and the drinks are $$$! $7 for a CAN of Infamous that I can buy a 6-pack of for $10 two minutes away directly from the brewery. I get, lake prices...look at comps though. Speaking of drinks... color me intrigued that EPBG is labeled as a \"restaurant\" (i.e., more than 51% food sales). Anyone else ever been the weekend drunk fests? I have. Hmm...literal food for thought. Shame on you Barrett Branam!"

We ordered a few items to include loaded queso and the double cheeseburger.   The Cheezborger! Cheezborger! You want doublecheez?!?Who's next!?!\" -SNL  The quality of an establishment's cheeseburger often tends to be a good indicator of the quality of the food in the establishment, especially if that establishment that tends to have a limited menu which highlights the burgers such as this one. My double cheeseburger was outstanding. It was freshly grilled and the charbroiled smokiness  could be tasted throughout the burger.   The view:  As far as this locations view was concerned, it was simply breathtaking at dusk. If you are in the area on a cool Sunday afternoon, there are very few consumers here and you are sure to get an exquisite shot of the sunset. Even if you don't come here for the food, come here for a relaxing time with some friends, you won't regret it!"

It's a new endeavour in a tried and true location so being in the hood we wanted to give it a chance and try the food.....pfffft!  We looked at the menu and most prices were average.

The filets, if you want to call them that were not recognizable and they were as thin as a quarter.....yes, a 25c piece, kinda leathery and shouldn't be served as food.    That's a typical drinking straw in the photo.  Real catfish filets are 1/2\" to 1\" thick.

Not a very big menu, and the majority of it tastes like a lunchroom from 6th grade. Oh and let's not forget, just about everything on the menu will run you at least $15.   Besides the views and TVs, this place is meh."

                "description": "We like to try different restaurants on the lake and were nearby so decided to give it a shot. Bad idea. First, the view really isn't that great especially compared to other establishments on the lake. Second, drinks are pricey. $7 for a bottle of corona and $7 for a Truly is pretty high. Finally, my meal was just awful. I got a Texas Cobb that was missing blue cheese, avocado, and croutons when it came out. It maybe had 1/4 slice of bacon on it and that's being generous. The cucumbers were old and soggy so didn't get eaten.  One very small egg and few bites of weird looking chicken were hardly filling. At $14 this salad was an enormous disappointment. We definitely won't be going back."

When you make a 30 minute drive for the music, it's pretty disappointing to find out it's wrong. The food was mediocre. The good: It's hard to beat the view... Sunset over the lake is magical. Bartender Jena is AWESOME. She's smart, sassy, and has great customer service. I wish she'd been there the second time we went back... That might've made up for the music snafu.  I'm not sure we will be back... Maybe if it's a band we want to see, we will call and talk to a manager to make sure."

                "description": "We regularly would come here after a day on the lake for a bite to eat before the drive home. Always enjoyed the poke bowls, tacos and salads. We went Saturday and there was a new menu (no more of most of our favorites) but tried it out. We ordered two pizzas, a burger with fries and the stacked Cobb salad. None of it was good. The pizzas were undercooked and greasy and for the price of $18, highly disappointing. The Cobb salad had a nice presentation and toppings but lacked lettuce. There was no crunch at all. The burger was an improvement from the previous menu but the fries weren't done. You could tell they were undercooked. We won't waste our money on food here again and are super disappointed in the changes made. Bummer for Lake Travis boaters!"

                "description": "I've been here for a Sunday funday and more recently did the 2021 Cookies and Craft Brews at-home virtual tasting with Circle Brewing Beers and Girl Scout Cookies. The vibe at the tasting room is casual and approachable - the staff is friendly and unpretentious. For the virtual tasting I did, they had the packages ready for pickup and hosted the tasting on Zoom. It was fun even if I was tasting solo from home as there were others on the Zoom and the two who guided the tasting were informative and engaging. Here were some notes I took during the tasting:  Alibi Blonde and Shortbread - a nice blend of the maltiness and breadiness of the cookie. The beer is a blending of German Maibock style with American Blonde Ale, resulting in a rich, malty flavor with a clean, crisp finish.  Blue Texas Hefe and Caramel deLits and Peanut Butter Sandwich - this is their best-selling beer (about 2x any other) and is a traditional German Wheat beer with a touch of caramel malt and an emphasis on citrus notes. It's refreshing and definitely a Texas twist on one of my favorite types of beers.  Envy Amber and Toast-yay! - this is a new cookie this year and they paired it with the first beer they ever brewed, although it's not the first beer they released. The cinnamon toast crunch flavor of the cookie worked well with the robustness of the amber. It's an English style amber with an emphasis on dried fruit notes - they use two types of British caramel malts to contribute to the well-rounded flavor of the beer.  Ladybird American IPA and Lemonades - this was one of the pairing favorites of the crowd and I definitely liked it a lot too. It's a West Coast style IPA that is very hoppy, but not overly bitter. Solid pairing and solid beer.  Tuxedo Shirt Black IPA and Thin Mints - the hops in this beer are changed annually, so it never really has the same flavor profile year to year. I was not familiar with roasted IPA malts, but it's basically an IPA with black malt. It has a bold, roasty flavor, with a solid body. It was a smooth pairing with the Thin Mints.  Nightlight Dry Irish Stout and S'mores and Peanut Butter Patties - this beer is the CO2 version of Guinness. There is a slight bitterness to this, but it has a rich flavor with a very light body.   A few other bonus takeaways shared in the tasting conversation: * Epic Playlist is a beer that they created to interact with their fans in the market. It has a QR code on it that connects the drinker to the Circle Brewing Spotify playlist. * Devil's XX is a barrel-aged version of the beer (XX) and is sold in bottles. * They are keeping this tasting room, but also expanding and moving to a location in Elgin where they can grow their own ingredients to put in their beer on the 23-acre property."

                "description": "Came in this past weekend to celebrate the weekend with my friend at Circle Brewing.  I love their beers and have had them at bars and restaurants around town but had never been to the brewery until this past weekend.   Circle Brewing had easy parking as soon as we pulled up even on an Austin FC Saturday game day. It was pleasant to not have to figure out where to park when they have their own parking lot with plenty of space.   Easy ordering but hard decisions to make on what pitcher of beer we were wanting to try. We noticed they have Austin FC game specials that includes their Austin Anthem draft for $18 a pitcher which is a great deal! I also saw signage on the tables that indicated 1/2 pints during the Austin FC games. Double check that is right because it almost sounds too good to be true, right? I even saw a green cup special going on - ask the bartender what they have on special just to be sure.  They have a lovely and large screen set up right in the middle of their taproom to watch any games including those Austin FC games. They have a couple of tv's as well located above the bar to keep your gaze on during any game not just Austin FC.    If you are coming in the summer especially day time be sure to wear loose clothing and/or be ready to sweat. Even at the bar top with the fans going we came out of here sweaty which is typical anywhere you are during Texas summers. Just want to give you a heads up!  Huckleberry is the food truck that slings all sorts of seafood and burgers (surf and turf!) with some easy ordering from inside the brewery.  We didn't get a chance to try out their food as we ended up brewery hopping around right after we had our pitcher of Blur (hefe) at Circle.  This may be the closest brewery to the stadium (?) but if not it sure looks like it as you can see the Austin FC stadium right from their parking lot.  Excited to come back when I am headed to a game and/or in the area as Circle Brewing beers are divine!"

Some in our group loved certain beers, including some of the lighter bodied and hoppier beers. Others in our group liked the beers but didn't find any favorites from among the fight. Overall it was a nice experience - perhaps not our favorite stop on the brewery tour- but one worth going to again."

                "description": "I've come by a few times and always found it to be a good experience. The staff is friendly, the beer is consistently good and they go for styles that are much less popular from Austin breweries. They also participate in some fun events throughout the year, in particular I really enjoyed the beer/girl scout cookie pairing event and the red line brewery tour.  Highly recommend trying the Blur, its a Hefeweizen and their staple beer. I would put it up there with Live Oak's Hef as a common point of comparison. If you're around in the winter time their Doppel Blur is probably the best Hef I've ever had; Imagine if your alcoholic grandmother made banana bread in liquid form. If you're looking for something darker the Tuxedo T-shirt is a black IPA, I really liked the combination of roastiness and hoppiness. It sounds like it would clash but I found the hop flavor subtle enough to work really well.    The one negative I would have is that the interior really makes it feel like they're trying to get you to sit outside, which given the vast amount of space available in the parking lot makes sense. However I don't feel like they do a great job of utilizing it, there aren't nearly as many tables as you would think and the ones they do have aren't particularly well spaced out.  The food truck situation seems to rotate pretty frequently, I've found most of them to be misses but it's a roll of the dice depending on the day. There's also plenty of good food options in close proximity that it doesn't feel like a major negative.  Overall I think Circle makes for a good hang out spot and a change of pace from the typical Austin brewery experience."

                "description": "Beer is good, staff always friendly... but damn does it get hot as the third ring of hell during the summer in there. Maybe \"stuffy\" or \"swampass humid\" is more accurate, but it's uncomfy when busy. I'm from southern Texas, so I'm used to it.. but it's even hot for me. Need some big ass fans or something. But.. the cold beer does help! And the food truck outside always looks good, but I've never partook in the tasty treats.   Gonna be a go to for many (including myself) pre-FC games, just hope they're OK with me only wearing my FC boxers once I've been there for 20 and sweat through my less-than-fancy Target shorts I got for $20, so I'd have more $$ to spend on their tasty beer."

It just so happened it was a special beer release event and charity donation (for Pink Boots Society and Pink Velvet Collaboration IPA), so it was crowded.  We lucked into a table inside and tried a sampling of beers while we played a game and listened to a few interesting sounding bands that played (standing on the loading platform).  Because it was so crowded, it took a while to get served and the line for the single person bathroom was very long.  The beers we tried were good, and we would definitely stop back by on a day that wasn't quite so crowded."

                "description": "Perfect day to celebrate Circle's 6th anniversary. With the Temps hovering around 90 degrees what better way to while away a Sat afternoon than having a few scrumptious craft beers, street tacos and listening to some great music.  My companions opted for their Alibi Blonde it is a German-inspired beer but it drinks pretty light but with a hint of flowery hops that gives it a good aftertaste. I opted for their Ladybird IPA that also drank surprisingly light for an IPA and was perfect for a hot early spring day. I did see a lot of folks drinking their black IPA but it was too warm a day for that, next time.  The event was top notch 15 bucks, American, got you a cool pilsner type anniversary glass and 3 beer tokens. We gave 3 tokens away at the end as we were getting full and we !had! to attend a friends crawfish party later that afternoon. Got to leave room for dem bugs and more brews!   The first band was a Go Gos inspired female band that rocked and the second band played some great 70s, 80, and 90s cover songs. Since I was wearing a Boston Sports shirt I got to meet some other Massholes which only added to the fun.   Good times, great beer, and a wonderful event!"

                "description": "I was so pumped to check our Circle during a brew-crawl, but the ambiance left me feeling unimpressed.  I had my first sips of Circle after being introduced by every Texan's good friend HEB. I believe it was the hefe that reeled me in, so I was excited to go to Circle during the Red Line Brew tour (check it out online if you've never done it). I was so excited to try a few beers, but knew I could only focus my tastes on one since we were on a crawl. I went with their Cereal Keller kellerbier which I've never tried before. It was described as \"unhinged\" probably because this stuff is unfiltered and not clarified! I was psyched to try a grittier version of the lager. It wasn't as funky as I thought it would be, but instead felt light, simple and slightly malty/sweet. I enjoyed it. I was pretty curious about all their others like their IPA's and the Doppel Blur, but that's for next time.  The space itself is definitely reminiscent of your small-production and grassroots taproom. They had two porta-potties outside (along with a food truck), but only one restroom inside. It got pretty crazy with our crawl of beer lovers. I can't imagine the staff members sharing one restroom, especially when the brewers are in there doing their thang. Someone's bench with weights and press station was still out, and there wasn't that much open space indoors for the lot of us to all be in there, so outdoors it was! They allow dogs which is awesome and they also have wifi. Parking seemed a-plenty, but we took public transport so that's that. Their gigantic chalkboard menu is beautiful and fully rounds out their super relaxed and earthy vibes. The people here are friendly, chill and the brewery gives off a neighborly essence. It's not an instagram-hotspot like their new next door neighbor Hopsquad. And that's the beauty of it!"

                "description": "Circle brewing is definitely my favorite brewery to come to in Austin. Not only are there tons of events that are always happening there, just for fun or to support local organizations, all the employees there are so kind and really attentive. They also change/add different beer options often which is great if you're looking to maybe get your favorites and try something new. I'd highly recommend the doppel blur and although it isn't on tap, you can still get a can in a glass of you want. If you're really wanting something on tap then I'd go with the blur! I'd definitely recommend going and bringing your pup because they are very pup friendly everywhere !"

                "description": "I love Circle. Not only is the beer great, but the location and setting speak to the nostalgic part of me that's seen a few little start up breweries begin to flourish out of industrial parks, and often with their taprooms in the brewery space itself. That's what this space is--Utilitarian is too strong a word, but it's comfortable, practical, and cozy. We've enjoyed days playing games out on the picnic tables, and others indoors on the barrel tables. The staff is friendly, and there's always parking available, or you can take the light rail or easily bike from this brewery to others nearby!"

                "description": "Ok, I want to give the 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding down for the blatantly misleading name. This feels a lot more like a sports bar with some outdoor space than a \"beer garden.\" When I think \"beer garden,\" I picture something with more ambiance (for example plants, string lights, communal tables, music maybe). Instead, here you have a patio with many TVs blaring the game and a dark, concrete/rock picnic area. Yes they have some string lights... on the outer edges of the parking lot #doinitwrong.  That said, they have a great selection of beers and the bartenders are really friendly and helpful. We also enjoyed the food trucks out back. Soooo, if you're looking for a chill spot to catch a game with some great beer, this will fit the bill! If you're looking for a \"beer garden,\" like for a casual date, not so good."

I think there was two or three bars. We never had to wait in a long line. The drinks were fine, nothing crazy! The food is what I was a little bummed about. I ordered the cheese steak and the mac n cheese (game day special). The cheese steak was okay but the cheese tasted so weird - I'm not sure how to describe it. The bread it was on was hard and overall, extremely messy. The mac n cheese, I think, had the same cheese so it was just a little off putting. I would definitely come back, just wouldn't order food!"

                "description": "The place has a roadhouse atmosphere, most of the staff looked like they were operating a biker bar which at first made me feel a little intimidated, especially when they ignored me. The gentleman at the bar acted like whatever paperwork he was doing was more important than paying customers.  After getting my beer I walked out to the patio to find a place to sit. I was greeted by what I assume was the owner (but again the biker appearance threw me off). He was polite, welcomed me and my party and let me know that he was there if we needed any help.  The seating was comfortable and fun. There was a food truck where we ordered nachos. They were good.  After returning for my second beer I recognized that the beer was flat. I alerted the staff, they gave me another but it was still bad. I suspect the lines need to be cleaned she apologized said she would take it off my bill, I chose another beer and moved on.  Later when lying she charged me for the bad beer anyway, so confused.  Anyway, overall I was disappointed with their beer selection, and disappointed with the staff attentiveness to customers. Had they taken better care of their beer I could have looked past their other shortcomings, but you have to get the beer right if you advertise yourself as a tap house."

Laid back, chill vibes, CHEAP beer (I don't know if it was happy hour or what, but my local hef (forgot the name, but not Live Oak) was only $4 (feel like I'm usually paying between $6-$8 for local draft hefs everywhere else), and there are TVs everywhere playing all the sporting events televised at the moment.   It's super spacious, there are wooden picnic tables everywhere for seating (covered wrap around patio and outside near the BBQ food truck), and there's also a handful of arcade-y games (not sure if they're operational at this time but they added to the backyard fun aesthetic of the place).  Nice staff, all the safety precautions accounted for, and off the beaten path cool.  Stop by just because or if you're making your way to/from Valentina's ;)"

Instead, it's just a BBQ trailer and every menu item comes covered in that awful bright yellow plastic cheese you get with your movie theater nachos. I don't remember the last time every single family member said \"I don't like this / this is not good.\" The drinks were good and the staff were super friendly. The kids had fun running around on the seesaws and outdoor area. But there's simply no excuse for such terrible food in Austin in 2022. Would not recommend unless you just want drinks."

                "description": "This review is mostly for the food. As of June 2020 the food truck on site is HBQ bbq which doesn't seem to have its own Yelp page - which is a serious problem because it needs some serious love! You know the standards for bbq are high in this town, and HBQ holds its own very well for being virtually unknown. My favorite part of a bbq meal isn't actually the meat, it's the sides, so I was excited to see the selection! I ordered a little of everything (well, not everything, but about half the menu... enough that the cook asked if it were for one or two people when he saw a tiny girl come to pick up all of it!) I ordered what I thought would be a chicken salad sandwich, but maybe I ordered wrong or maybe their idea of \"chicken salad\" is different than mine, because what I got was a typical chicken sandwich - sliced chicken, slaw and what seemed to be mild hot sauce on a hearty roll. Despite the initial disappointment, it wasn't too bad for a chicken sandwich. It was huge! A good deal for the price. However, I didn't want to fill up on it, so I was glad when my friend's son expressed interest in the other half of it. More room for the sides! The hatch creamed corn was amazing - other friends raved about it too. It had a bit of a kick after a few bites, but nothing a spice wimp like myself couldn't handle. The mac and cheese was billed as \"sriracha mac and cheese\" but was not spicy. It was average in a good way, slightly on the not-so-cheesy end, that would be a disappointment to have alone as a meal, but definitely enjoyable as a side dish. The cucumber salad was surprisingly good. I didn't expect much. Who gets excited about cucumbers? I ordered it out of curiosity and so I could feel good about eating some token vegetables. It turned out to be a real sleeper hit! It was a bit like eating pickles, toned-down enough that I could eat a whole cup of them without being overpowered by brine. When they loaded the \"loaded potato salad\" they weren't messing around! It had a lot of cheddar cheese and bacon, and some green onion. Apparently they rotate their pie selection, and this time they had peanut butter ice box pie. The cook asked how much whipped cream I wanted on it and I told him not to hold back! It was obviously delicious. Obviously. You're probably wondering about the meats, because this is a bbq truck. I was with a large group, so I got to hear everyone's review of just about everything on the menu, and everyone was impressed. I know they tried brisket, pulled pork, ribs, mac and cheese loaded with meat and queso, and queso as a dip. All servings were a pretty decent size for their price. The queso was the only unusual thing - it was more like movie-theatre nacho cheese that most Texans wouldn't call queso. However, apparently once it was mixed with brisket, it was good, and I saw several servings of it get finished off.  Like I said, I was with a big group, and the venue accommodated is well.  Drinks seemed satisfactory. (I only had water.) I think I heard live music coming from inside. Kids enjoyed the small playground. (And to tell, the truth, at the end of the night, I went and climbed on it too.) Picnic tables, shade coverings, parking bathrooms and all those important amenities were good. I wish this place was closer in to town, but if it were, that might ruin what they've got going. Despite the long drive south, I'll be likely to return! Update: I checked their menu and they have two chicken sandwiches. It looks like I ordered the wrong one. No wonder I was disappointed, but that's good news for the rest of y'all to know that their chicken sandwich is a decent take on a typical chicken sandwich. But I'm still craving a good chicken salad sandwich..."

It was rather cold that day but we opted to sit outside so we can have prime view to the TV screen.  They brought out heaters for the outdoor seating so there was some warmth to be had.  The drinks were a bit on the expensive side but they're showing the fight with no cover so it was worth it.  What I really enjoyed was the food trucks out back.  The food was amazing!  I had the BBQ plate and the cream corn and mac and cheese were so delicious!!!  The BBQ itself was great of course.  The atmosphere was really fun and I definitely would come back to watch the next UFC fight."

                "description": "This place was so cute. Stumbled upon it as we were looking for a spot in San Marcos and went on a Tuesday night and dang, this place is poppin on a Tuesday!  All the outdoor spots were taken, so we made our way to the upstairs outdoor balcony, until we were able to snag a table downstairs (which is where you want to be). We quickly found out it was BINGO night. Yes, bingo night! No, it wasn't a bunch of boomers either! I wish I had gotten her name, but the girl hosting Bingo was incredible - great personality with lots of jokes and she def knew how to work a crowd!  Cons - sadly there are some. The sangria flight is awfully sweet. The pizzas are good but took soooo long to get. The food menu is very small so you better not come starving or with a picky eater.  However, if we're ever in the San Marcos area again, we will definitely be back to just enjoy a night on their outdoor patio!"

Also the cider flight is $10!  The pizzas are pretty good! I got the white blanc both times and added pepperoni and jalapeños to one and just jalapeños to the other!  Again, i place to stop by after floating the river( normal times) or shopping at the outlets!"

We were a bit more casually dressed as I would've liked, but it's okay because it was our first visit.   The vibes here are amazing. Everything looks nice and sophisticated. We both had drinks, a couple of martinis and something else that I can't quite remember.   The Brie was something new to my boyfriend, and we really enjoyed it. My Margherita pizza was perfect and my boyfriend Chicken Blanc pizza was also sooo good. I think his was better than mine, lol!   I recommend this place to everyone I run into. It's so cute and the perfect date night"

This is the only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars Bec we expected more selection. They have a few cheese plate options and small gourmet pizzas. I chose the pear and bacon pizza, which was delicious. my husband had a pepperoni pizza. I also ordered a sangria flight, which was quite nice. On Thursday nights they offer a free lava cake with the purchase of a flight. The lava cake was tasty. The servers were friendly and the decorations were nice."

I ordered the white sangria, which fair warning was very sweet but it was still delicious. The menu said the white sangria had ginger in it, although I didn't taste that specific ingredient I was hoping for, it was still a good choice. They do wine flights as well, and have a pretty good happy hour.  We ordered a cheese board and sat at the bar. The cheese board was generous and filling, the service was great, and the atmosphere was on point. It is a casual wine bar, and they had live music outside which would have been nice to watch aside from the cold weather. They have a lot of seating outside, and a good amount of community seating inside.  Overall, great experience here and will be hopefully going back!"

Let me start off by saying that the staff is some of the friendliest folks I've met. We had a waitress who helped out our waitress and she did it with a smile.   We ordered the chips, queso and salsa to start off with. At first glance the salsa looked like it was marinara sauce but it was actually good. The queso was a little thin but still good.   We ordered a steak salad and a cheeseburger and both meals were good. The cherry limeade was delicious and seriously I can't think of a bad thing to say about this place.   It's located on the water so you can sit outside and take in the views or sit inside and sit by the window and still have a beautiful view.   Give 'em a try!"

I'd imagine before covid the dining room held a few more tables.  The Paul's chicken is a large breast breaded in chips, topped with lots of hatch Chile and shredded cheese. I liked it better after asking for a side of white gravy.  The green beans are honest, not cooked to death, still green. The baked potato was typical, though not seasoned on the outside like I'm used to.  All in all, it's plenty.  The chicken fried steak was two pieces, actually seasoned in the breading, tender enough, and disappeared quickly. Gravy is good too.  The scratch cheesecake was good. I got plain, without toppings, which they offer a few. It's baked, not too dense, thick enough crust.  The bread pudding was a cereal bowl full of yummy. Pecans and raisins all smothered in a bourbon sauce, not an icing. Very good.  Prices are a smidge high, but expected for the area.  Staff was pleasant, quick to respond.  I'll come back next time we are in the area."

There's outdoor seating as well as indoor seating with large window with beautiful lake view.  The service is very fast and attentive. I ordered calamari which are top with cheese powder which seems strange, it's also like a calamari fingers instead of rings. With cheese is not my favorite part. The fish taco came in three large pieces of taco with the two pieces of filet in each taco, huge portion. The green chili burger is juicy and has a good kick to it but the buns are soggy which needs some improvement."

                "description": "I want to start by saying that the service here is probably the beat I've experienced since the pandemic began. In a world where so many restaurants are understaffed and waiters overwhelmed, the team here could not have been more attentive from the moment we sat down. There was no waiting for anything - they were incredibly intuitive and knew just when to check in with us and offer refills or bring extra napkins. 5 stars for the service.   The food was pretty good which is why I'm giving 4 stars. I had a delicious green chili burger, but the calamari fell flat for me. I don't know why they sprinkled parmesan cheese on it. My recommendation would be to offer this on the side.   Overall, solid option in Marble Falls with beautiful views over the lake. Sit outside when the weather is tolerable."

I got the famous pork chop and green beans and it was delicious.   The atmosphere is great. We sat inside and still had great lakeside views. The parking was easy and even at prime time, we easily got a table.   The staff was friendly but the service was disorganized and slow. That is the only reason we aren't giving it 5 stars."

Called 2 min before getting there to make sure the wait time was acceptable for a group of nine and the manager lied and said we took 10 minutes to get there and the tables that they could have used for us, were given to other parties and that they couldn't hold the tables for us. Trashy place, smelled disgusting, save your money and go elsewhere with better service!"

We got a table on the balcony. Weather was perfect, staff was friendly, food was good and view is awesome. I had the fish tacos which I loved and she had the pulled pork tacos that she liked a lot. Portions were perfect as was flavor. My only gripe would be paying for salsa and chips. This is Texas! It should almost be a given to have chips and salsa at the table! We will most definitely be making a return trip."

The shrimp were OK but cooked just a little too long for our liking. The sweet potato fries were just barely cooked and were just limp and tasteless. The cole slaw was actually pretty good. I doubt we'll return, which is a shame given the nice view they have."

My sweet tea tasted like catfish and so did the green beans. I was very disappointed. My wife had a steak sandwich which she couldn't eat either. If your a fan of catfish then this is the place for you. I am not and don't want want my sweet tea to taste like it was brewed in the lake nor the food that I ordered. We both did not feel well after our meal, maybe it was just in our minds because the meal was such a disappointment or maybe it was because everything was cooked in the same grease as the catfish?"

I told the hostess this was our first time here and wanted to celebrate our anniversary on the patio. She immediately took us to the worst table on the patio. Thanks. The waitress had no problem putting us at one of the best tables on the patio. Your awesome! All staff were wearing masks. We ordered the Texas grilled Reuben and the Buffalo Chicken sandwich. Both were wonderful. Very seldom does Glenda finish a sandwich! Fries were good and the coleslaw was wonderful. I'm a huge fan of  Long John Silver's coleslaw, sweet and creamy. Very few places make it like that. River City Grille's was a perfect copy! Glenda stopped me from licking the bowl. Now, if your eating wonderful food on a wonderful patio at a wonderful restaurant facing a wonderful lake, your going to pay through the nose. Nope. Normal prices. That's why 5 stars. We will definitely be back."

We never had an empty water (or beer) glass, and they were just plain nice. With so many restaurants struggling with staff and service, it was a welcome change. The food was top notch as well! I had the brunch burger and my hubby had the mango habanero wings, and we split the queso and chips. (And by the way, their queso was hella good, especially considering they aren't a Tex-mex restaurant!)"

Got cut off because we were a large group that had a large tab even though no one showed signs of having been over served. Don't plan on returning at this point. Wish something close had a late kitchen, but at this point I'd rather have Top Ramen than go here to get food after 10. Slow service and management that pretends to have people's best interests makes it a no. Food is good, but management that seems judgy makes it a no."

My first review came shortly after opening and we all know it takes time to get things in a good rhythm and sorted out, especially in the restaurant business.  The menu was a little odd to me when opening but has since won me over. They often have specials and have even opened up for lunch. Last weekend they had a crawfish boil at a very reasonable $7 lbs. The beer selection seems to be somewhat static, fortunately they have several to choose from, but it would be nice to have several rotating handles, given we are in one of the best craft beer markets around. I was a bit surprised to learn a local Pinthouse beer was $7. It's only a dollar more than at the brewery, but still, this isn't LA.  All and all, I like the direction this place is going, nice outdoor, dog friendly patio, food specials and hopefully some new local beers on my next visit."

Most places are these large indoor/outdoor spaces with music and food trucks. Or located downtown. Or you have to drive 30 plus minutes.  Vincent's Sports Pub is just down the road from home. It has plenty of TVs. I mean plenty. You can stand or sit anywhere in this pub and watch your game. AWESOME. A lot of thought was done here with the placement of TVs.  Service outstanding. A very friendly and nice Team. You like beer. You have choices. Lots of drafts and bottled beer choices. Great feel. Very welcoming pub. Plenty of tables. Great looking bar. Nice crowd. No jerks or muscle beer dudes. I judge a place if my wife would feel comfortable alone. Vincent's Sports Pub passes with high marks.  The food is very tasty. I had most of the apps and was very happy. Tasty. Great to share. Shrimp dish very good. Crispy. Wings have some pull and good. Nice pub menu. A scratch kitchen. I did not feel or taste it was a frozen product.  Vincent's Sports Pub will definitely be my go-to pub for drinks and sports on TV. It has a nice welcoming feel. Combination of design of the restaurant, the bar placement, the tables, food and most importantly the staff.  Plenty of parking. CC friendly. Union payment option."

                "description": "I met my friend here for a HH and to catch up on life. Vincent's sports pub just opened recently inside a small shopping center that includes a nail place, a dental office, and a cosmetic store.   We met up on Wednesday around 4ish and the place was quite busy. I found a table near the bar and my friend showed up shortly after. The waitress handed us the drinks and cocktail menu for our viewing pleasure. The drink menu on the back included 31 drinks on tap to include cider options.  My friend and I ordered our drinks and those were a little slow coming out to us both times. My friend had a cocktail so that is more than likely the reason plus it was busy inside the bar. We didn't order any food but what I saw did look pretty good.   Overall I really liked this place and reminded me of place that I have been to down in Buda. Everyone seemed friendly and it was a down to earth bar. I foresee myself coming here again in the future."

The dude behind the counter knows more about beer than most sommeliers know about wine. That's just icing on the cake. They get every limited release and seasonal that drops.

                "description": "If you haven't been to The Brewtique in Cedar Park, you definitely should check it out.   Anytime you stop by, you'll meet either the owner or his wife and they are both nice and very helpful. You can pretty much buy anything they have in singles and they always have their inventory listed online along with the untapped rating for each beer, which I find very useful. They have a solid selection of local stuff and occasionally some more rare stuff as well. If you're immunocompromised, you can call your order in and they'll bring it to your car; they also have a very sanitary setup inside and require masks (of course) and make everyone use the hand sanitizer when you come in. We've been there about 5 times mixing that in with buying direct from breweries but I really love the diversity you can get while supporting local at the Brewtique"

                "description": "Great place to try out a new beer then buy a six-pack or two. We had a couple beers each (they sell singles if you are hanging out) and then bought some to take home. Taco Truck pilsner was great, Mama Pisner, and there was a pickle beer that was probably a tad too pickley for me (go figure).  Great/fun selection, good prices, knowledgeable staff, and lots of picnic tables out to keep you spread out and safe. You can get snacks too, or play Starship Troopers pinball (Do You Want To Know More?!?). We had  a good time just chilling there on a Sunday afternoon.  Oh, and they recycle those plastic can holders that craft breweries use. Bring yours back to help out the brewers in town!"

If you're more beer curious, head over and chat with these friendly folks. They know their stuff and helped me to pick out some new beers.  There's a good range of price points here too so you could find a good gift here.   Website is also really useful and lists out everything they have if you like to head in with some ideas of what to grab.   Good atmosphere in there too if you're drinking in.

I could go on but that's it. Come here and drink good beer, but.  These guys got it goin (sic) on where else can you find a Maine Brewing Co beers or a selection of IPAs that will blow your mind.   Folks here are friendly and of course knowledgable and provide a high level of customer service. Case in point I was out of town and a pal informed me that they had a very hard to find beer available. These nice folks held my order until I arrived, almost at closing time.

This place is totally chill with a few picnic tables to relax and converse with friends. There is also a couple of other chairs if that's your thing. Sampling on sight is totally cool too.  On to the selection of beers. All I can say is,if you can't find something here that you would like, go home,empty handed and admit you have no taste. That's right, I threw the blame squarely on you! Why? Because they must have better than 300-400 different beers to choose from!  Now go, prove me wrong and try that chocolate oatmeal stout or triple ipa !!"

The team is incredibly helpful, very knowledgeable about their products, and all around just a couple of really cool folks.  Just tell them what you're in the mood for, and you'll absolutely receive a satisfying recommendation.  They're dog-friendly both in and outside, and are super welcoming to well-behaved pooches. They also do some really cool charity events on behalf of some great organizations. There's almost always something going on in the evenings -- live music, comedy shows, football games, game night, beer tastings.  They also have some neat retro arcade games and board games on hand to entertain.  There's always a reason to pop in and have a drinks!"

Owner(s?) seem to care a bunch, and have been available to point out new releases/limited beers, make recommendations, and take pics of my dog.   Prices slightly higher than other big retailers, but selection is much better (tip: check their Instagram for limited beers and new stock). Also, a good selection of CBD products for those interested. I have never hung around to drink there, but you can for a small per-beer charge if you want.   Hope this place keeps getting tasty limited beverages and doesn't turn into a vape emporium like the last one!"

                "description": "Okay this is my favorite coffee shop in the Austin area period.  I love how big and spacious this new location is, but the coffee is WHERE IT'S AT.  Definitely come here if you're looking for the perfect date spot, study/get work done, or just to enjoy a nice morning coffee and breakfast.  We ordered a hand pour over, a Chemex, and a double espresso.  The double espresso came out first and this one definitely packed a punch - don't let the espresso size cup fool you.  If I was just here for the caffeine content, this one definitely would've done the job alone.   The hand pour over came out next and the presentation was super impressive!  They bring you the entire carafe with the dripper on top, so it's definitely a lot.  Considering this is only $4, you definitely get your money's worth!  This one was so flavorful and the fruity notes definitely stood out while drinking it.  Now the Chemex...just wow.  For $5, they bring the entire Chemex setup to your table and you pour our of it as you drink.  The fact that they trust their patrons with the Chemex really speaks volumes about how much they care about the presentation piece!  Looks aside, this coffee (I believe we got Ethiopian) tasted amazing and on-par with the pour over.  Don't let me forget the breakfast tacos.  This was such a treat.  I got the Migas breakfast taco and this one was stuffed FULL with eggs, tortilla strips, and pico.  It was delicious and filling and for $3, this one definitely hit the spot alongside the coffee.  I also bought one of their coffee beer stouts to take home...I believe it was the House United coffee milk stout.  If taking home, you either order beer in a Crowler (two pint cans) or a Growler (64 oz).  I can't wait to try their coffee IN THEIR BEER.  But most of all, can't wait to come back here every time I'm in the area!"

This spot is much larger, has a bigger (and better menu) and great service. We tried the Cali burrito (cuz I'm from California and honestly looking for the perfect Cali Burrito) and it didn't disappoint. Beers were great, bartenders had good advice for certain beer tastes and overall a great experience!"

And we are loving the new Cedar Park location as well. Grab a great beer, (so many options you can't go wrong), and a taco! Tacos at Cedar Park. (Get the deli salad at the Parmer location. Its simple  but amazing!)  Who doesn't love an amazing taco! Vegan options too! Bring your pooch along and sit outside and enjoy the sunset."

Unfortunately, the $7 queso was basically Cheez Wiz with some jalapeños, and the beef fajita on my taco was all gristle and had no seasoning.  They could have at least cooked the bell peppers.  The other Red Horn location is much cozier for enjoying a beer.  I'll just go there next time."

I think it's so versatile you could bring family and kids here, or turn down in the evening with a hot date for a nice dinner.   The cocktails are very good. I had the \"Room Service\" which is a refreshing gin cocktail.   The smoked salmon appetizer was sooooo good with the saltiness from the capers, perfected toasted ciabatta, and perfectly cooked egg. Highly recommend!   The Shaved Prime Rib sandwich was very good as well, and my son had ordered the Turkey pastrami sandwich, which was also very good!   We sat at the bar and the staff was top-notch. Friendly, attentive, intuitive and on their game!   I recommend this place for any occasion."

(there was a 5 min wait for tables not bad )  I ordered the peachy mimosa and added a tequila shot it was perfect . My boyfriend ordered the breakfast sandwich he  loved it For food I ordered the hash bowl another great choice no complaints ( it did take a while to get your food which is the only reason for my 4 star review ) but the wait worth it .

                "description": "Culinary Dropout, more like you'll wanna Drop In...bad puns aside, easily one of the best places in the Domain to gather a group of friends and enjoy their very spacious patio. Certainly compliments the great food they have to serve as well.  Atmosphere: Very fitting of the domain and Austin, modern hipster style so very open with a nice view of the domain surroundings. Live music is played on occasion as well, which really makes for that feel of a local flavor styled joint.  Food: Having come here several times and trying most their food items, you can't really go wrong with any particular choice, just whichever suits your craving for that moment. My personal favorites though is the Fried Chicken. Most certainly worth the wait, and comes with flavorful mashed potatoes and gravy mmmhmmm. Meat is well cooked with good texture and doesn't have an overly heavy taste or feel that most deep fried foods commonly come with.  Service: Every time I've gone services has been great. Staff is friendly and can help accommodate any assistance or questions you may have.   Hungry around the domain and need a place that will leave you full with a good experience? Drop-in to Culinary Dropout. Perfect for anyone seeking a casual and enjoyable night."

                "description": "Joined folks for lunch and I think I went wild on the appetizers that I was full when it came time for the main dish. We ordered the Brussels, deviled eggs, and  bread, my sister ordered the kale salad with steak and my friend ordered the chicken bbq salad.   So I'll start with the bread - it's grilled and has some balsamic on it. A little salty but good. The deviled eggs came 3 to an order and I love a good deviled egg but this was \"meh\" at best. Seems like it needed a little more seasoning and there wasn't anything special about it. I will say I'm not usually a fan of brussel sprouts but these aren't mom's brussels. These were fried and then tossed in a sauce (Korean go-guchang) and is a little spicy but oh so good. The kale salad was a lot of small pieces of kale, the steak was tender but I can't say I'd order it again (or steal it off my sister plate). The chicken salad was good and came with a deviled egg.   Overall, it was a good lunch - we did order 4 drinks and the total came up to about $100.   We were able to sit outside on the porch under a heater which made it a great atmosphere. I will say that I saw the chips and dip and will come back to try that."

The outside patio \"pre-COVID\" had lots of games for guest to play. There's enough TV's to watch sports from anywhere you're sitting. I recommend ordering the fried chicken and homemade mash potatoes. I think it's their most popular dish. The dish is fried to the perfect level of crisp, and it's very juicy!  I also like their salmon!  As far as the drinks, if I'm not ordering my usual Austin Eastcider, I'm getting their jalapeño margarita! One of the best in town!   The vibes are always good here."

I was happy to see CD had an Austin location!  We came on a week night and it was still pretty crowded. Wait time was about 30 minutes, so that gave us some time to walk around and do some window shopping at the Domain. Once we were seated, we put it our order right away.  Pretzels and Fondue: The softest pretzels!!! Perfect for dipping in the provolone cheese sauce. We actually got 2 rounds of these as they were that good.  El Matador: tequila, elderflower, ginger agave, and orange bitters. This is my favorite drink here. Has enough of a fruit taste without being overly sweet. And the bartender made it with a lot of love. Lol. Only 2 drinks and I was finished for the night.  Our server was really great and kept checking on us throughout the night. Fun crowd. Fun music. And a really fun time."

                "description": "Just tried to eat here tonight (Tuesday 2/15). Got here around 7:30pm and was told there was a 30 minute wait- no problem we waited. At 8pm on the dot we got a text our table was ready. We were seated and already knew what we wanted so the second our server came over we ordered, maybe 8:05pm. We saw tons of dishes coming out but figured with how busy it was it might be a bit. At 8:35pm someone (not our server) came over and told us \"so sorry about the wait, you're up next\" we waited 15 more minutes after at least 15 orders came out and finally couldn't stand it anymore and left. We wasted an hour and a half and still left hungry.   The sad part is this is not the first time we've experienced bad service here. Last time we came here with a reservation and were sat outdoors when we reserved an indoor table. 20 minutes passed and no one came to our table even though multiple servers passed us. We asked a girl who was clearing tables if there was someone who could take our order and she came back and said no one wanted to so she took our order. I guess that should've been our red flag last time not to visit again but we love the food and gave it another chance.   We've been to Culinary Dropout at several locations in Arizona and never experienced anything like this. The Austin location definitely doesn't hold the standards of the others. We won't be returning and suggest you don't either unless you have 2-3 hours to spare to wait for your food."

                "description": "Originally was going to stop for a quick lunch but got ahead of ourselves when looking at the menu.   Brussel Sprouts (3/5): not crispy like I expected it to be but the flavor was solid and unique.  Salad (4/5): they made kale taste good. that's impressive!   36-hour Pork Ribs (3/5): very sauce-y and therefore, very messy. At least the flavor was decent. The ribs itself were are not very tender.   Steak Frites (3.5/5): not bad but also not great. The salad on the side was great tho.   Korean BBQ Skirt Steak (4/5): lots of flavorrrr. Better than the Steak Frites. The meats on these two dishes actually tasted the same but this one had sauce. I actually liked this main the most out of the ones that we tried!   Overall, chill spot for a nice dinner with friends. I would rate this place a 3/5 for the food but probably bump it up because of the ambiance. There's lots of space and a few games to play so the vibes probably make up for the food."

                "description": "Located in the Domain, this is a hoppin' place on an evening for a weekend dinner. Bit of a wait for a table for 4, but no worries.  Eventually we were  seated and our server was super friendly.  We ordered a couple of drinks to start. I didn't care for my cocktail two to mango at all. Hardly tasted the fruit flavors of pineapple, guava, orange or the mango white claw, since it was so overpowered by the vodka. I just passed the drink onto my son. We put our order in for our meals and it took quite a bit of time for the meals to come out. We had to flag down our server to find out what was going on. She mentioned they had many orders and were backed up.  We were a bit disappointed when our meals arrived. My burger was super dry and my son's salmon dish looked like an appetizer. The portion size of the salmon was small and the amount of risotto it was sitting on sad. We left very hungry. Service was slow, food and drinks are overpriced. Not sure we'll come back."

                "description": "We had a party of 8 at 1:30 pm on the Friday of ACL weekend. It was pretty packed, but they were able to accommodate us. Service was great!  Here's what I tried: - Evil Jungle Princess ($13): This fruity rum drink was good! - Soft Pretzels and Provolone Fondue ($13.25): The pretzel bread was good. The cheese was good. $13.25 is a lot for what it is though. - Gojuchang Brussels Sprouts ($6): It maybe came with 5-6 total brussels sprouts. It tasted good, but super not worth it. - The M.A.C. Burger ($14.50): Their take on a McDonald's Big Mac. It was good!  Fun vibes. Convenient if you're staying in the Domain."

Culinary dropout is great. We love their grilled asparagus, it comes chilled and their seasoning plus whatever methods used really brings out the sweetness of asparagus.  Fish and chip is the real deal, been to many places and felt disappointed, NOT here. Pure deliciousness and we can't wait to come back for more!   Sorry for my rather short reviews nowadays, my hands are kind of full lol"

                "description": "10-25-21  Quality/Quantity - Gochujang Brussels Sprout - I would have preferred the brussel sprouts to have been a little more crispy. Could not really taste the gochujang flavor, not spicy at all. Kurobuta Pork Ribs - My favorite, good flavor. Would have preferred more fries though. Spicy Vegan Curry - My daughter's choice, I guess it was good, but not something I would have ordered. Had a hint of lemon grass after taste, which is a little different from Indian or Thai Curry. Separated rice versus rice combined in the sauce is also preferred, so we can control the flavor.  Atmosphere - This is a very good spot. I like both the indoor and outdoor space. There were a few activities (cornhole, etc) for the guests. I like the choices of seating - regular tables, high top tables, bar seating, couches, etc. Additionally, your huge wrap around bar was nice. Lastly, I am always a fan of an open kitchen concept.  Service - Julia did a good job; she came back and refilled our water often. It was really busy and the entire team seemed to be working hard. I also noticed 2 employees picking up garbage as they walked back and forth serving customers, this is always a positive plus.  Price - $49.80 + tip  Owner Suggestion - Seems like you are very successful, owning quite a few restaurants. Congrats on all your success, and wish you many more. I look forward to trying your other restaurants in the future."

Place was very busy on a Saturday night - multiple parties out on the porch.   I still dream about their chopped chicken salad! - so good!    They have a big drink menu with cute cocktails. Staff was so nice and my dog loved all the loving he got from everyone there.   It's definitely a casual/loud/fun ambiance!"

                "description": "This is one of the biggest bar/restaurants I've ever been to in America! They have indoor seating and half outdoor seating (it's \"outside\" of the restaurant but still covered on all sides - great for when it's cold out!   It's a cool bar with live music and games but my favorite part is the food!   We got the cheese fondue that came with a bowl of pretzels and it was nothing I expected at all - pretzels are okay at best usually and most places has cheese that taste gross but this was the best pretzel/cheese combo I've ever had!! The pretzel balls were pretty big in size from what I was expecting, they were warm and perfectly seasoned and delicious! And then the cheese - wow I could literally drink a jar of it if I wasn't my age and getting heartburn everyday as is. I haven't stopped thinking about the pretzels and cheese since my first bite! I definitely want to go back to Austin just for this dish.   And then for entree my boyfriend and I split the butternut lasagna and they were so nice enough to split the dish for us without us having to ask.   Oh yeah and for drinks (I forgot to take a pic) but we got the Smashed Irishman and it was so good we ordered 5 through out dinner.   The staff was really nice and the place was super busy so some things took a little longer to come out and we were forewarned before ordering anyway."

To my husband and my luck there were 2 seats open.  It was Sunday around 2ish and there was a guy singing with his guitar.  The speakers were amazing you can hear him inside and out on the patio.  Friendly staff. The food was so good. My husband and I are some carnivores but today we both ordered vegetarian options  Don't let that fool you. Both dishes were packed with flavor. My favorite was the vegetarian spicy curry. Holy cow was it good. So good. Would definitely visit again!!"

This is a great place for large groups. More bar than restaurant.   Cocktails were tasty and reasonably priced. Large selection of beer on tap. The menu is a little thin, and our brunch items weren't anything special.   Service was top notch. We'd come back for happy hour, but probably not for a meal."

                "description": "I used to love going to Nate's until recently. Aside from the great ambiance, open patio, fire pit and decent drinks, I love the location. However, during my last visit, I had a really off putting encounter with one of the male bartenders. When I first arrived, I was carded by a female employee who served me two drinks upon reviewing my Texas issued ID. I went to sit down with my friend and after finishing our drinks I went back into the bar to order two more. When I went inside, the male bartender stared at me for sometime and then offered to assist me with getting two more drinks. He requested he see my ID again after I had already been carded and served two drinks with an open tab. At first I gave him the benefit of the doubt because I understand that I do look very young for my age and he was just trying to do his job. In addition, this is a neighborhood bar with many regular patrons so he probably had not seen me before. Thus, I went back and got my ID from the table and showed it to him again. After three minutes of him starting at my ID he took it to the back and questioned the female bartender about my ID who had already checked it. He then started scratching at it and bending it several times to see if it was fake. I told him that I was indeed over 21 and had other forms of IDs to prove it but that he was making me very uncomfortable with his odd approach.   I started to get flustered because it was getting the attention of other patrons and I felt very singled out especially being the only African American woman in the entire establishment. It truly me feel as though that because I was a young black women who seemed out of the norm, it took part in his  questioning of my integrity and the validity of my ID.   After several minutes he finally gave me my ID back and told me , \"fake IDs are really getting great these days...don't get upset..at least you can take it as a compliment that when you're older you'll still look so young.\"   I was very taken a back about that comment as I felt that was extremely misogynistic of him to say as a woman's beauty and looks aren't tied to her age. Regardless of looks or age, every woman deserves to be treated with kindness, respect and the same standards that any other patron would experience.   This entire encounter really upset me because I felt that prior to this experience, Nate was a very friendly, safe place for people of all drinking ages, ethnicities and genders to have a relaxing drink and watch the sunset. This encounter made me feel otherwise and hope that this review draws the attention of management so that other's don't have to experience."

                "description": "Stopped in for a nightcap and stumbled into trivia night. Perfect. What wasn't perfect was the bartender. Husky Filipino/ Hispanic bruh with a gray shirt and backwards cap. Never got his name because he was too busy looking pissed off at the world and just couldn't be bothered. Ordered two drinks, a beer and a cocktail. He poured the beer then asked for my card. I said \"Oh, I also had a whiskey\". He said \" I know\". Pretty rudely. Asked if I was starting a tab. I said \"No. I'll pay as I go\". Then not a word after. Now I work in the airline industry and have really thick skin. But, his attitude did not set well with me. Especially since his job includes tipping for service. Why cut your nose off despite your face?    Told my wife what had transpired. She went in to see for herself. Even she said he was rude.   But he had time to chat up regulars and a cute girl sitting at the end of the bar.   The only thing that salvaged the experience was the host for trivia night and the waitress working the outside patio. She had lots of people out there. Took care of all of us with a great attitude and friendliness.   Probably will not come back. Too bad. The place had potential."

                "description": "After getting the frozen margarita flight next door at Los Olivos, we weren't quite ready to head home, so we walked over to Nate's where my bro and his wife got another alcoholic beverage, while my partner got an espresso and I got a hot chocolate. The hot chocolate is a bit pricey ($4) but it's prepared with the espresso machine to froth the whipped cream directly, so it gives it a nice smooth feel that's quite a yummy experience.  Their outdoor seating was pretty full, so we opted to sit indoors and take one of the corner booths where there were pillows to cozy up on. The outdoor deck is really nice, positioned under a grand oak tree with lots of string lighting, along with a long firepit for cooler weather! Get there early before dusk to secure yourself a spot, is my advice.  While there are a few deli sandwiches and the like to partake in, this joint is mainly a bar with a variety of drinks. Scan the QR code to view on your phone and order with the guy behind the counter.  The inside decor rocks the industrial vibe that's become so in fashion currently. Bathrooms are clean and well-stocked."

I went there yesterday on a Monday, March 28th, with a girlfriend of mine to celebrate my birthday. We walk in and go up to the bar, the bartender was a philipino/Hispanic looking guy, and was very rude and had the worst attitude. We go up to the bar and he just looks at us with no greeting or anything, so I finally say \"do y'all have any menus we can look at?\" He hands us two menus which only had about 4-5 drinks on there. Me and my friend saw on their website that they have charcuterie boards, so I asked him \"do y'all have an appetizers or finger foods?\" And he said \"this isn't a restaurant\" so I told him \"okay well on your website it says y'all offer these meat and cheese boards. \" so he pulls one out and puts it in front of us so rudely. We order our drinks and me and my friend sit outside. Everytime we went up to him he seemed so annoyed and bothered by us trying to order something. Literally the worst service. Everytime I have been here the bartenders are so rude. Do yourself a favor and take your money elsewhere! I honestly shouldn't have even left a tip for this guy, that's how bad his attitude was."

When I gave our order she made an ugly face as if my order was a bother. She continued to get worse during the night. She doesn't belong in a career of customer service.

She is super rude and I asked why she was being so sassy, and she said \"because it's fun\".  All of the other bartenders/servers were absolutely delightful and I hate for this to make them look bad.   Here's the thing, I have worked in customer service and in the industry for a long time, I get it, some days SUCK, but the way that this young lady was acting was unacceptable and I agree that she does not belong in customer service. I also agree that Nates is losing money and customers because of her.   I hope that she finds another industry that she enjoys, because clearly this isn't it and her tone clearly states it."

                "description": "We approve of Nate's. Buda deserves a great neighborhood bar. Like the industrial decor. Great seating inside around the bar, at tables, and outside on the patio. An abundance of Misters and fans make even an August afternoon comfortable outside.   Great selection of local craft beers on tap and nice happy hour prices.   The real reason we came and why we'll come back: the Bartenders. They are friendly and know what they are doing. Well crafted original and classic cocktails. We threw a few obscure requests their way and they made perfect drinks without having to consult the \"googles.\" That will always get my crowd to become loyal repeat patrons."

                "description": "I'm saddened to say that I don't think I'll ever go to Nate's again.  I have lived in Buda for several years and make an effort to support local businesses but I have tried Nate's 3 times now and every single time the same bartender has the WORST attitude and has ruined my night out for the last time.  The first couple of times I just brushed it off but he seriously is so foul and unwelcoming that I can't stand going there.  He not only has been rude to me, but also my family members, and most recently friends visiting from out of town.    Management- if you want people to frequent your business, get rid of staff that obviously hate their job."

                "description": "Linda listen.  You have ATX. You have SAT. Each great in their own right in terms of culinary and mixology prowess.  Enter Buda, TX.  Nate's could be described as country chic meets 21st century industrial look.  The 3-4ish times I've been have been exceptional. Not only is the staff fantastic but if you ask nicely, the staff will share their beverage and beverage history with you.  Nate, Shelly and Clarie are personable and what the ideal bar staff should be: professional,  knowledgeable yet friendly and engaging.  If anything, their old fashioned is a must; best I've had.   While they do not have a kitchen, they do offer snacks.  These are brought in daily from local businesses  (sandwiches, salads, etc.) They do have meat and cheese trays they make there which are made with quality meat and cheeses. The selection changes daily so check the counter (immediately as you come in) for what they have available.  18 craft beers on tap and craft cocktails? Buda, you're soon becoming my favorite non metroplex destination.  Muah!"

                "description": "Cocktails and bartenders were not so strong when it first opened but each year has improved dramatically! Went for Maddie gras this past February and it was crowded and still tons of fun. Great event-themed cocktails and great bartenders that know what they're doing. The cuvée coffee isn't my thing but it appears to be a big hit with other people! Had some cake balls while enjoying my fruity cocktail that was delicious and beautifully decorated. Nate's is a solid local bar for hang out time with friends, casual trivia game playing and for unwinding after a stressful day."

I've seen some people bring pizza on the patio from an outside restaurant but not sure if that was technically allowed.   I get the drink special every time and so far I've never been disappointed. Been about 3 times and I'd say the only thing \"bland\" is the service. I hate to say it but my service experience every single time was less than friendly. Not rude but.... just not welcoming. Which is sad since this place is so awesome. It's not bland enough to keep me coming back, just hope they see this and take it as constructive feedback and hopefully improve!!! I think the girls have been more friendly than the guys.   Either way, 4 stars! YUM."

                "description": "There is a lot of breweries in the area but Celis is one of my favorite. They are family and women owned and very receptive and kind to their customers. They have reposted my pictures on social media and allowed a close friend to film a short film there for free. The beers are unique and delicious, with lots of options on tap! They have nightly specials and events, all of which are fun! For example trivia on mondays and Thursday, and they have little long horn saloon come do chicken shit bingo once a month there as well. At one point I was going every week for the Tuesday 99c east coast oysters. Among many other specials. There has been some miscommunication in the past with showing games but the manager working at the time is always very quick to help out. For example none of the TVs had sound on when they advertised they all did, there was confusion inside but the manager was outside and apologized and immediately turned on the sound inside and changed to social media to reflect inside. I also noticed that someone had paid to play the juke box and he paused their songs and gave them a free beer for rhe inconvenience. The dog park is also very nice and spacious and the new beer patio is very well put together! I am looking forward to live music!   Unrelated to Celis itself, but Black draft pizza truck is good there but overpriced. I am excited to try the new con todo truck!"

This place should be pretty chill - there's nine people here either chatting (or trying to) or working as I type - but they're blasting the music as always. It's kind of bizarre, doesn't fit the vibe, but they always do it. Thus I knocked off a star.  Look for oyster nights, a real highlight here."

I think the food trailers consisted of pizza, tacos, German sausages, and sliders. I loved the ample seating, mixed crowd of people, and the decent variety of beers. I am pretty sure it's strictly beers and ciders here - no wine or cocktails.  This place will be great for a hot summer day and cold beer."

They were blaring music so loud - outside - that we couldn't have a conversation across the table. Every customer looked like they were only there for Instagram pictures and the perfume was so thick you could see it hanging in the air. The waitress inside is ummm... dressed to get big tips. Ahem. Then you go back to the outdoor concert area, and it's a lot of families with kids and regular people. Weird. Beer was okay, but after the cloud of perfume I was honestly too sick to drink. Maybe someday I'll come back and avoid the front entirely. Then I went to cash out and the walking cloud of perfume was in front of me in line."

They also have events pretty regularly like weekly trivia and I saw posters for a democratic debate viewing party happening the next day.   The vibe here is very relaxed, they're dog friendly, have a couple of board games and a ping pong table. They had a food truck outside that seems to rotate fairly often. If you're up around the area and looking for a chill place to hang out after work you can't beat the vibe.   The only thing I had to give them a small knock for was the beer. I tried a flight and went mostly with the (very friendly I might add) bartenders recommendations. Outside of their standard witte they were all quite extreme versions of their respective flavors.   Their hazy ipa was super biter and lacked that usual juicy quality you'd expect from the name. The lime Berliner weisse and raspberry wheat were both missing much non fruit flavor. If you has given them to me blind I would have thought they were both sours."

Celis, as y'all know, is an Austin institution- steeped in history, the first craft brewer to bring Belgian beer to the craft world in ATX (I think), so y'all can rest knowing that their wheat beers are AWESOME.  The tap room is large, airy, albeit a little dimly lit. There's patio seating outside and get this- DOGS ALLOWED INSIDE AND OUT!   They also welcome kids! Actually I think everyone is welcome here. It's one of the friendlier breweries in ATX IMHO.  We've visited almost every Sunday during covid and I can say that they're taking every precaution. There's live music on the weekends from 6-9pm.  Beer wise - I like the options. If you're a sour beer connoisseur, you'll enjoy the raspberry sour. Light beer? Lo Lo Lager. Safe, easy drinking? Celis White.  I know this place has had its ups and down but as Austinites, we need to show support to our local businesses and just be cool with each other."

                "description": "We came here what I believe was opening weekend! They had 5 beers on tap, with the option to get a flight (3 pours- $7), beers to go, or full pours to enjoy. They  had staples like a Pilsner, or you can try something a little different like the sparkling golden ale (IMO heavy on the brut flavor). They have seating inside as well as outside, and they're dog friendly! They also had some cute shirts/apparel with their logo on it for purchase. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying this place once they expand their selection a little bit, but overall it was good! It's also right down the way from St Elmos Brewing, so add it to your list and hit them up when you're in the area/getting your beer fix."

The gentleman who served us our beers was also very friendly.   The beers were all very good and we enjoyed our flights.  Sometimes new breweries take time to develop a good list of beers, but I was impressed.   The setting was nicely laid out and decorated.  Indoor seating with AC for those hot days, as well as outdoor seating.   Check out Vacancy and support local independent breweries!!"

They release their weekly mixers during the week so make sure you're on their list serve.  I was able to get a holiday drink mix that I paired with some liquor I already had.  The mix paired really well and each drink would be the equivalent of a $16+ cocktail if I'd had it at most Austin establishments.  You can also recycle the bottles they use by placing them outside during your next delivery"

                "description": "I visited Austin about a year ago and I still remember this experience vividly!   First, the ambience was very casual but the food was so good! For all my people with a sweet tooth, this is definitely the place for you. With all the fried foods you can think of, I definitely had to pace myself.  I also got \"The Big Cheez\" (not pictured) to start. It was sooo good. It's mozzarella cheese wrapped in donut dough deep fried with a butter and cilantro buttermilk dressing. This is definitely not a place you go to and every week unless you plan to spend some nights in the gym LOL.   This is great for cheat days and I love that they have very fun takes on regular donuts.

                "description": "I LOVE THIS PLACE. The donuts are fried to perfection, every time. The plates are unique. Gourdough's is great to bring guests to experience what Austin has to offer.  Portion sizes are very filling, except for the Grilled Cheese. The prices are high, but you will have a quality, fun and delicious experience.  My second time here, I ordered the Country Clucker, and the Piña Colada (again). The Piña Colada was still delicious, but I fortunately the bartender did not go all out like last time (I missed the coconut shavings and umbrella). The Country Clucker was a solid choice. I LOVED the candied jalapeños (slightly spicy). The creamed corn was a bit flavorless for my liking, there was a HUGE piece of chicken, and the donut was great. I'm not sure if I'd order this dish again, but I did love the jalapeños. The entrees do not come with a side like the sandwiches and burgers, so my dad and I split a side of fried okra. The side of okra is different from the appetizer of fried okra - instead of frying the entire okra, it's just little balls. The side also does not come with the delicious dipping sauce, but luckily we were able to ask for it. I was soooo full after this meal. My dad ordered the Pork My Avocado - he devoured it! If you like fried avocado and refried beans, it's a good choice. Kind of a Tex-Mex spin, with the queso on top too! He always loves a local beer, and orders the McConaughaze beer every time. My sister ordered the Double D's. She couldn't finish it! Instead of the chips, she got the jalapeño potato salad (subbing a side will cost extra). It wasn't spicy at all, and I wouldn't say it was outstanding and worth paying extra for it. Her S.O. ordered \"built his own\" Grilled Cheese with garlic bread and two types of cheese. He is a VERY picky eater, but he loved it! Said it was \"better than anything he can make himself,\" which is saying something. He was the only one out of us who had room for dessert. He got the Sin A Bomb and ate it all up. It tasted like a king cake filled with cream cheese!  The service from our waitress could have been improved. She was not attentive, and the service was slow. We relied on communicating with other staff members for some of our requests."

Raspberry something Flora Dora... not good, tasted like chemicals. It was bad. Our sandwiches were extremely greasy, and brussel sprouts arrived cold. A table across from us sat empty and dirty nearly the entire time we were there. Waiter only checked on us once and my kid had to get up to ask a waitress for ketchup at the counter. It was all around just a poor experience.  The only positive I can say is that we encountered one friendly employee who said Hi while she worked on rolling napkins. She was busy and still made the time to be friendly.  Been here before and that experience was completely different. This was just regrettable! With so many dining options in Austin, I doubt very much that we'll ever go back."

For background, when we originally visited Austin several years ago we fell in love with Gourdough's (I have a really serious sweet tooth). Since then we make this a must-stop whenever in town.   We ordered the blue balls and the country clucker along with a regular coffee and the donut coffee. Blue balls was as amazing as ever! The country clucker was brought out WITHOUT the candied jalapeños and we had to wait several minutes before our server came back to check. The candied jalapeños really make the dish. We ran out of our drinks and also had to wait several more minutes for our server to come out with more coffee and water.    After flagging down the server 4-5 times throughout the meal, it kinda seemed like he didn't really care to check up on us."

My best friend was visiting from out of town during the holidays,. We took her there and she fell in love with the Nutty Valentine (extra pecans). She requested that we go there a second time before she was going to fly back. We of course, happily obliged! My go to is the nutty valentine with a topping of pecans, my son loves the black out, and my husband loves the black betty with icing on the side.  We hope to try the savory donuts the next time we're there, it's just so hard to decide between sweet or savory!"

As I type this I've been sitting at a completely empty table for 25 minutes without so much as a greeting from any of the staff. There are at least four servers milling about, but not one has offered me a menu or so much as a glass of water. Crickets. Even though it's close to home and I sit at the bar often, this experience is enough to burn the bridge. The food is solid, but the WiFi is even worse than the table service, and if their social media management is as bad as their patio service, I doubt they'll bother responding to this, which would hardly be surprising. What a clown show."

I'm not sure if this place gives sports vibes to anyone else but there were several screens/projections available to watch various games. The outside seating was adorable. They have a bar out there as well, I believe.   Our appetizer, Three Little Guidos, was sooo good. The bacon literally melted in my mouth. I thought maybe it'd be too much bread but honestly it was really good. The McGourdough sandwich was delicious and so filling. I loved how they utilized donuts in different ways. We shared a mimosa carafe. For dessert, we took home the Cherry Bombs donut holes. The cherries added the perfect touch.   Overall, I really enjoyed this restaurant and I am eager to go back."

Now, I revisit them every few months.   It's always dead empty, no matter when I go. It's so surprising how easy it is to come in for brunch on the weekends.   My go-to is the Dirty Plucker (fried chicken on top of a maple glazed donut), the Big Cheeze (giant moz sticks with dipping sauces) and pitcher of mimosa.   Service is generally great."

The menu is entertaining and interesting to say the least! We got the saucy cock (LOL) which was amazing! I was looking forward to the Count Gordough Cristo, but it flopped in my opinion. The sandwich arrived cold and the ham was colder so I don't recommend this dish. Other than that, lots of TVs to watch the game and great drinks of all kinds!"

                "description": "Gourdough's answers the questions that you didn't know you had. And the answer is always donuts!    How do you make mozzarella sticks better?   Wrap them in donut dough, aka The Big Cheez.   How do you make a breakfast sandwich better?  Serve it on donuts.  The McGourdough is maple sausage, egg, and cheese (on donuts, of course) with maple on the side (opted not to have the pour-over). There's plenty of maple flavor in the sausage so I never used the side of maple syrup.   Once again, how do you make Kolaches better?  You guessed it, use donut dough, aka Gotchie Yo Kolache  And finally, is it even possible to make a Cuban sandwich even better?  Yup! The Cubano, a Cuban sandwich on donuts.   I'm shocked that they didn't figure out how to serve me my beer in a donut!  That's right, a full-bar to go with all that doughy goodness!  Donuts and alcohol, what more do you need?"

                "description": "There is nothing I like more than mixing sweet with savory. It is extremely satisfying when executed successfully, so shout out to Gourdough's for doing it extremely well.   I was actually expecting the doughnut to be sweeter on my dish, and I'm happy it was not. Everything really paired well together.   The vibe is very Austin-esque and the staff was super friendly. My friend asked for no cheese on her burger, they put cheese, but the waitress happily got it fixed up for us.   I can't wait to go back!"

                "description": "This was my first by time here and was sort of disappointed in what I received; I guess my expectations were higher. The description state \"crispy fried fillet chicken breast smothered in honey butter.\"  I did request to have the honey butter on the side. I got two chicken tenders instead of a chicken breast (not to be too critical but the description should be updated if chicken breast = chicken tenders). The honey butter sauce was not what I was expecting; (not a fan). On the bright side, the donut was pretty good. Even thought it wasn't a chicken breast,  the tenders were tasty and had a good crunch.   I did order the miss shortcake and it was pretty good. But nothing special I suppose. Maybe I'll try a sandwich instead so get a full experience. I'll try them again and see if I get a different experience."

                "description": "I struggle with rating this place. The food is fantastic and different, when you can get it. Showed up on a Sunday for breakfast and there were SO MANY THINGS I wanted to eat. I picked one thing intending to visit Monday morning again to get the other.   Our group showed up on Monday morning only to be told that their ENTIRE brunch menu was not available during the week. What the fuck man? Nowhere on the menu does it say that. They list brunch offerings with everything else on one giant menu.   The waitress proceeds to tell us how she has to break peoples hearts just about everyday. If you have customers everyday that aren't aware of your limited offerings on a weekday, the problem is you, not your customers.   How hard would it be to add a little graphic anywhere on the menu that says brunch is only available on Sat and Sun? Not sure what genius decided not to include key info on the menu or the website about limited brunch offerings."

                "description": "I came here with a couple of friends yesterday and there was something off abt this place. The food was AMAZING, don't get me wrong, but off vibes.   1. Smells super weird in there Idk if I'm smelling old oil or what but it's weird.  2. There are lots of people working here, yet getting service or someone's attention was hard. We were approached when we first walked in and then after that, it was half assed.  3. I got the cucumber mint drink and it's like a mojito but with rum and cucumber instead of mint. Wasn't my fave, wasn't sweet enough, just tasted like cucumber water and lime juice.  4. Our donuts were really good but I was told by my friend that they were smaller than the donut food truck which is disappointing.  I got the sin a bomb and it tasted just like a cinnamon roll. My friends got the cherry bombs and peach donut and we all enjoyed it!  5. Vibes were just off and my friends agreed. If you're looking for good food, sure, but if you're a vibes type person like us, you'll feel weird here lol."

                "description": "The donuts here never disappoint! They are so good and delicious. I usually get the black out but this time I got the miss shortcake which was delicious and wasn't too excessive like the black out can be. Excellent dessert spot for sure. The reason I'm giving it four stars is because we had to wait roughly 40-45 minutes to get three donuts? That seems a little excessive especially since they did not seem to be understaffed. And when the donuts came out they felt lukewarm like they had been sitting out for 10+ min which is a bit disappointing. Maybe there was something extra going on which is why I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. Great taste which is why I recommend it but maybe just go to the food truck next time?   Overall: 3.9 stars"

The wait staff was super nice and helpful.    The menu is also amazing - so many thing we wanted to try. We went for the fried green tomatoes, the Buffalo chicken sandwich and the country fried chicken. When our food arrived everything was beautiful. Really great presentation. But unfortunately when we tasted it we were in for a big disappointment. Everything just tasted like salt. The flavors of the toppings and donuts all just blended together with nothing interesting or any pops of fresh flavor. I will say everything was cooked to perfection, but the flavor was just off/missing.   Bummer."

                "description": "One of the best \"better\" burgers in Austin.  Plain and simple.    It's a bit hard to find from Lamar because it's semi-hidden in the Midtown Commons apartment complex.  Like the Triangle and most other new Austin developments, there's retail and restaurants on the ground floor.  Decided to drop in here tonight because the burger came highly recommended.  I'm definitely glad I tried it.  The burger is deceptively small.  It looks like a smaller burger, but the density of the high quality burger patty combined with their bun makes it more than a meal.  Don't forget their fries, which were described to me as English style chips.  The fries look like flattened steak fries and are exceptionally crispy.  I'm not sure what the seasoning is, but it's strangely addictive.  Black Star has a huge variety of beers for the drinkers.  For the non-drinkers, they have a variety of canned and bottled soft drinks, although no fountain drinks.    Being a co-op, the service is friendly and obviously takes a lot of pride in their pub.  The quality of the food and the service both show that."

                "description": "Brewpub: dog-friendly, veggie options, friendly staff and strong wifi! SCORE!  Came through with a good friend and my pup. We loved it. Pups have to stay outdoors, but you're allowed to bring them indoors to place your order. They have tons of beer options, great in-house brews. I was floored by their options! I always go for the flight when I try a new brewery to get a better taste of what they offer. I loved pricing: 4 for $10, and my favorites were the Island Baby (pineapple what!!) and juicy Fructis hazy IPA. They had a bit of everything, so that's always nice for beer geeks. Quench my palate, Black Star! They have their beer menu overhead--super easy to read. They also have great happy hour, but we arrived later after it was over. The food menu is on the paper menu that they have at the front of the line. Grab yourself the menu while someone stands in line for ya!   They also offer food specials for that day. It looked good--I think it was some sort of tofu (veg) tacos, but I wanted fries...so went with their avocado club. It was a bit heavy on the mayo, but it tasted great. Their chips...crisps...fries whatever you want to call em were the REAL WINNER. Y'all. Fries are so crispy and uneven...wedge-style. BUT not dry or lukewarm. They are delicious. I would go back just for their addictive fries. Trust me. They also offer the impossible burger too for veg folks, and other options like grilled cheese. I just love how veg-friendly they are. THANK Y'ALL. Grilled cheese gets old for us who don't eat meat.   The atmosphere is very chill and with a darker ambiance. It seems like the perfect spot for group hangs or a relaxed date. Parking was easy, especially since there's a customer parking structure that's free. It's also close to public transportation if you choose to take it. I love this spot--I can see this becoming a new favorite."

I make an exception for this location due to the fantastic service I am given every. single. time. (NO TIPS HERE!! They work and treat you well because thy are paid good/decent wages!!!!!!)  Atmosphere: 4 Pretty big, can get crowded on evenings (cause it's freakin great). Lots of indoor seating and ample outdoor seating (covered)  Food: 4.5 Most of the food I have had here has been pretty decent. I knock off half a star because I've noticed a slight inconsistency in the servings (read about fish and chips) Fish and chips: my go-to food. Usually comes with 2-3 strips of fish and the potato wedges/strips are always well cooked, and come it's this out-of-the-world sauce!! Addicting af but wish they would consistently give 3 strips of fish ): Fried avocado tacos: awesome!! Sounds like it would be plain, but came with these giant thicc bacon strips on it that really added the savory taste Cheese board: nice variety, definitely love that the cheese is locally sourced from Antonelli's! Good mix for everyone's taste buds and really liked how there was plenty of bread too. Ice cream: seasonal flavors but I tried the pecan and regretted only having one scoop.  Service: 5 The servers here are always!!!!!!!!! SO cool and nice and helpful. Whenever we need drink recs, or anything at all, they are there to help! Even called in to ask if they were playing a game before, and offered to put down the big screen to have us come by and watch as we ate."

                "description": "I've always seen this place and been curious to try it. So, when my friend was visiting from Vermont, I decided it was the perfect time! I always like to eat locally. We split the tofu tikka masala and buffalo cauliflower (we added bleu cheese). I'm sure I could've eaten the whole bowl of of buffalo cauliflower by myself. It was super tasty. The sauce was just a little bit vinegary and the cauliflower soaked up all the flavor. Get it with the cheese, if you aren't vegan. It gives it that extra sharpness. The tikka masala was a bit spicy. I was surprised by that. We both liked it. The tofu was perfect with it. You have to know how to do tofu just right, and this was it! Everything was gluten free, for my friend. I can't wait to go back after I have my baby so I can partake in the adult beverages. I had my eye on some that they made there."

Foodwise, the only things I've liked are the chicken snack, and the seasoned chips. The burger is just okay, but the fish for the fish and chips needs salt and let's get some dang tarter sauce. They serve it with an aoli, which lacks seasoning. A side of coleslaw would go a long way too.  I'd be back, primarily for a cold one, and I would not not go for food again, but not by my will."

                "description": "Chill beer garden style hang out spot, having passed by a bunch of times it never seems crazy busy and on a beautiful Saturday night we were able to get a table outside without any issue.   Their beer selection is great, with a wide variety of beer made in house and other local breweries. The food selection leaves a little bit to be desired. The season chips were delicious, they reminded me more of steak fries if you put them in a broiler to give them a nice crunch. Besides the chips nothing on the menu really stood out to me as too interesting, and most of the reviews I read were pretty disappointed with their other food.   They also seem to have events  and good happy hour deals pretty frequently during the week. Overall, it's a good place to grab a beer in the area and enjoy a nice night outside, but I wouldn't come here too hungry."

                "description": "AMAZING!  I have been wanting to check out this place for 2 years and we finally bit the bullet. The hold up has been the negative feedback from my trusted foodie friends. However, I have a feeling they all must have visited during a weird menu transition that they did not find pleasing because Odd Duck has great ratings! I could not acquire a reservation for 2 so we arrived around 4:45 to ensure we at least snagged a spot at the bar. However, the hostess provided us with a table on the patio with the knowledge that another party would be arriving at 7:00, no problem! I was thoroughly impressed that they had employees lined up behind the hostess stand to show each guest to their seat!    Happy Hour runs from 5-6 so we took advantage of their delicious $8 paloma's! I could seriously drink those all night! They also have 25% off bottles of wine under $100.  We dined on the redfish ceviche which was refreshing, the cheddar cornbread that was so delicious, between 2 people, we ate the entire serving! The scallops were delicious, but I was obsessed with the celery escabeche that accompanied my husband's wagyu sirloin cap. I think the next time I will inquire about having the scallops prepared with the escabeche.  We also tried the chocolate fudge pie, but although the dried chiles were only sprinkled on top of the pie, it was still too spicy for my husband.  I clearly gave Odd Duck 5 stars because I was highly impressed and I plan on making a quarterly trip here to check out the new revisions."

                "description": "Underwhelming, overhyped, nonsense.  If you are going to act like the best restaurant in Austin then guess what I am going to review you like one.  First things first, don't bother coming if you don't have a reservation, they have the tables and the space just not the will or want to seat walk-ins.  First time we showed up directly at 5pm as the place opened.  There was a minimal crowd ahead of us, maybe 10 people.  We were informed for a table for 2 it would be a 3 hour wait...  The restaurant was practically empty.  If you are this lauded as a top restaurant but can't employ enough people to take a 2 person walk in at open, then something is seriously wrong.  So we came back the next day with reservations for 5 o'clock, again no shortage of tables, but a definite shortage in staffing/management.  We were seated promptly, told we could only order once from the menu, and our server didn't understand what or wasn't on the happy hour menu.  We were told 2 cocktails were on the happy hour menu turns out this was incorrect and was only corrected once we pointed out the cocktail we ordered was not listed on the menu as being discounted.  He was nice enough to \"discount\" the drinks, but again for a top restaurant in Austin your waitstaff seems to be poorly trained and unfamiliar with the menu.  By the way the happy hour is absolute worst.  5-6pm, 1 off a few beers, 8 dollar palomas, and 25% off ridiculously priced wine, and large beers.  The eazy peel from jester king was going for 44 dollars here.  I picked it up from specs for 15 dollars, absolutely outrageous.  Do not come thinking the happy hour will save you any money.  Uchi down the street does a much better job (not only at happy hour but for everything else in general)  We ordered the kale beignets, the achiote carrots, oyster mushroom salad, wagyu burger, seared scallops, and the sirloin cap steak with broccoli.  I will be the first to admit that the veggie plates were outstanding.  Really amazing flavor combinations, fresh ingredients, I was thoroughly impressed. The wagyu burger with collard green, chicharron and pimento was also a highlight, cooked perfectly and extremely juicy.  Then came the 36 dollar wagyu sirloin cap...  The aftertaste from this steak was horrid.  I've never encountered this flavor before but was a chemical taste that had me wretch, a few bites and had had enough.  My wife also felt something was severely off, and we sent it back.  The sear scallops (35 dollars) were just ok.  A lovely sear, mediocre sauce miso butter sauce and 3 tiny scallops a complete let down.  This restaurant thinks far too highly of itself.  If you are going to act like a pricey exclusive restaurant that makes me jump through hoops to dine here and charges an arm and a leg, I better be wowed at ever step, and that's far from what happened."

                "description": "Having really high expectations for a restaurant can be a tricky thing.  My expectations for Odd Duck were extraordinarily high... and the food, drink, and service blew my expectations away!  This experience was simply an incredible delight for my tastebuds!  I was seated at the bar and service was attentive and prompt!  Prior to taking my order, the bartender asked if I had any food allergies or dietary restrictions.  When I told him I was restricted to gluten-free items, he grabbed a special gluten-free menu for me and explained the differences to me.  Most everything on the main menu was either gluten-free or could be made that way without differing from the original recipe too much!  My visit was during Happy Hour.  Odd Duck doesn't offer a ton of HH drink specials -- in fact, the paloma is the only cocktail at a reduced price.  I opted for that and good thing I did because it was the perfect paloma!  Truly the best I have ever had!  Of course, I went there for the food... so let's talk about that. I started with the Redfish Ceviche -- I have enjoyed many variations of ceviche and Odd Duck delivered the absolute best!  So far I was 2 for 2... so I was quite happy with myself, but also a little worried that the entree could not live up to the rest of the meal.  My worries were silly and unfounded -- the Wagyu Sirloin Cap was packed with layers of flavor and was the best part of my meal!  Overall rating: *****FIVE STARS*****  Gluten-free rating: *****FIVE STARS*****"

                "description": "The old fashion was made well. The food had incredible flavors.  Tapas style. Loved the first two dishes: roasted carrots and mushroom tostada. The accompanying seasoning is incredible. The scallops were equally good, but only three scallops came in the dish. This was not so hearty given the price of the dish, but flavorful. The pork dish was nicely made, smoky flavor, had kind of an Indian grill feel to it... but for us the taste had a quick diminishing return. The dish was hearty though with a lot of meat on the plate.   I wasn't too much in a dessert mood. Was simply going to have a spoon or two of the chocolate pie, but they brought out the donuts by mistake. Thank goodness, they were amazing. I enjoyed it more than the chocolate pie.   Service tonight was simply outstanding. The waiter took my dietary restrictions to heart and really did a great job helping me navigate the menu. I wish more places did this. I felt the service here from our main and accompanying servers is what other restaurants should aspire to. Bathrooms were kept clean. I wish this place continued success. They have something really great going on!"

                "description": "This was simply the best dining experience I've had in the recent years or maybe, ever. From beginning to end, I was thoroughly impressed with the staff and how easy and enjoyable it is to dine at Odd Duck. It's a place with friendly staff, great drinks AND great food, and ambience is casual but unique. Perfection.  You can tell the owner takes their time to hire the right people because everyone we interacted with were so friendly. I think it matters a lot walking into a restaurant and enjoying a meal.   Parking around this area is usually not the most pleasant but fear not, they have complementary valet parking! That easily eases off the anxiety of missing your reservation time because you were looping around the area for a decent parking spot.   We came here on a Saturday at 5:30pm and it was perfect because I get hungry around that time. Okay, there are more reasons-it was not very crowded, it was happy hour for some drinks, and the lighting was perfect with the blinds pulled up since the sun has set.   Surprisingly, the drinks here were super good, like high quality to sip on. I got the draft paloma and it was very well-balanced. The other drink we ordered was Nice, Bryce, we were eyeing it and the waiter also made that suggestion. Both are different and definitely would get again.  Everyone was great about making their recommendations and the top choice was the scallops and ceviche. We couldn't get seafood this time around but I will definitely come back for those two items.   Waiter was great at making recommendations based on what we like and what he thinks is great. Easy to talk to, checking in on us just enough, and other staffs help with serving the food and filling up the water so that was cool to see everyone work as a team.  On to the food! So we got the cheddar cornbread, mushroom chorizo tostada, achiote roasted carrots, and wagyu sirloin cap. Cheddar cornbread is a must, it was fresh, the butter on it was amazing, and filling too. Mushroom chorizo tostada had a bit of citrusy to the flavor and it's delicious. For the achiote roasted carrots, what stood out to me was the burnt toast hummus!! I want a tub of that whatever it is! I think I would've liked more of the hummus and less chunks of the carrots. Don't get me wrong, the flavor profile is still very good, I think for my likings, the carrots can be slices so it's easier to consume. Wagyu sirloin cap was the star of the show for us, it was cooked very well (as in good job not well steak!), though I probably want it to be a bit more well.  We came here to celebrate our anniversary but it is a casual place so this is good for a date night or regular dining! The great thing about this place is that the menu changes so you can always find reasons to come back here. I can't wait until I come back."

                "description": "This place was delicious! The restaurant offers complimentary valet which is nice. The restaurant is decorated with wood from the original Shiner Brewery. The staff was very friendly and gave off the fantastic Austin vibes!   We sat at the bar and had the frozen chili margarita. It had great flavor and was well balanced. I tasted the Paloma and it was one of the best I've ever had! I also had the Naked Lunch cocktail which has beets. I'm not a huge beet fan but I'd drink this again. There was a special cocktail called Buckle Up Buttercup. The drink was a little salty, a little sweet, and you could really taste the bourbon.   For food we tried the kale beignets which were soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. We also had the mushroom chorizo tostada with beautiful, fresh bean sprouts on top. I LOVED the mushroom chorizo! I could put that s*** on everything. Lastly we had the ceviche. The fish was fresh and the homemade chips it came with were the perfect pair.   As a first time guest, I was very impressed! I'll be coming back next time I visit Austin. Make sure to call a few weeks ahead for a reservation. They book up pretty fast!  10 out of 10 would recommend. The food was too good to take pictures"

                "description": "Visited Odd Duck after months of waiting for a reservation, and was met with food and service that went above and beyond expectations. A local farm to table establishment with an elevated twist, I highly recommend Odd Duck as a go-to spot in Austin.   As many other Yelpers have surely noted, Odd Duck's menu is seasonal, so I'll spare you the details regarding the food I ate, as the menu has most likely changed. Feel free to sit back and trust your waiter's suggestions, as they are veterans of their craft.   One thing that I would like to commend Odd Duck on is their extreme attention to detail, which was immediately noticeable to me. From their unique plates and cutlery to the maintenance of their restrooms, this dining experience made it well worth the price point. Additionally, our waiter made it a point to clean our table throughout the meal, which was awesome.  5/5"

                "description": "Odd Duck is an OG in ATX's food scene; I've known about it since undergrad (10+ years now!) but haven't had a chance to try it until I was in town recently for work.   Before local/farm2table was cool - Odd Duck was doing it. It still feels great to support local farmers and producers though.   The food here was OUTSTANDINGLY flavorful -- bringing it to that edge but showing finesse and balance. I also appreciate that they made vegetarian versions of certain dishes so there are some options for Vegs!   My only regret? Not coming here sooner!   The menu will be different when you visit, but we thoroughly enjoyed each dish! We had the:  *Redfish Ceviche (leche de tigre, persimmon, cucumber, potato chip) *Cajun Pork Rillette (apples, pickles, Sour Duck Market sourdough toast) *Dry-aged wagyu burger (pimento, BBQ sauce, beer battered onion ring) - like an EXPLOSION of flavor.  *Wagyu Sirloin Cap (beef fat papas bravas, soubise, green bean salsa verde)  *French Toast (Vanilla Ice Cream, Cajeta, Apple, Pecan, Brown Butter Cereal) - yes, we had French Toast for dessert! So good and I recall just a pinch of salt from keeping it from being overly sweet!"

We picked the tomatoes, quail, and cornbread and everything was 10/10. I don't typically eat cornbread but theirs is MAGICAL and a must do! Their service was also A+, they were kind enough to mark the menu with vegetarian options, they even provided ways to alter some of their dishes to make them vegetarian (see photo). The French Toast dessert was also a delight. I'm a big fan of their rotating menus and will happily return to try more.   There is complimentary valet parking. You can also find street parking by the restaurant. They have happy hour 5-6pm daily with drink specials only."

                "description": "Review 10-K Odd Duck Trading Symbol: ODD  Item 1. Business The Odd Duck is one of the places that I've been meaning to try ever since I first came to Austin for undergrad so many moon ago. Generally, the dishes are thoughtful and come together in just the right spots. There are a few aspects of the dinner where the execution could be more polished, but I'd wager the average visiting venture capitalist would hardly notice.  Item 2. Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations The assets: - The roasted carrots were phenomenal. It's rare to find a dish where the carrots were the star of the dish, and Odd Duck hit it out of the park. If there was one element to highlight that enabled this, it would be burnt toast hummus. Spicy and savory, hell I'm waiting for this dip at the nearest Central Market. The crunchy fried chickpeas were a welcome airy, textured munch. - The wagyu sirloin cap was thoughtful in its conception. The celery, broccoli and dill really brought herbaceous elements that complemented the subtle earthy-funkiness of the dry-aged beef. Extremely enjoyable and every bite was as satisfying as the last. Medium rare but not bloody - Dessert was the dried chile chocolate fudge pie. Holy cow, while chile chocolate isn't exactly a new combination, it's certainly not seen in many restaurants. Who says you can't turn up the heat during dessert? The white chocolate peanut butter whip is something I'd eat by the spoonful (and I'm a 'cold brew, no whip'-kind of guy. *Chef's kiss*  The liabilities: - Obviously by the price of the wagyu, there's no way it's Japanese wagyu. But   I found the wagyu a bit *too* firm. You chew, and chew, and chew, and chew some more. It's really a mouth-work out, which can be so antithetical to how wagyu is classically portrayed, e.g. melt-in-your-mouth goodness. I get that it's not the real deal, or that it's just the sirloin cut, but much leaner and less marbled than I would've expected. - Cheddar cornbread was decent, but did not excite, which is something I'd expect given the rest of the menu. It's a fairly expensive piece of cornbread given the price. I will say the texture is extremely fine, but at least nostalgia's sake, would've appreciated more grittiness/texture, perhaps a thicker crust. One final point would be the consistency of the cook, the bottom 10-15% of the cornbread was under-cooked and relatively more 'mushy' than the rest - One suggestion for the fudge pie is to add an ice cream or light sauce element because the pie was fairly dry  Item 3. Other Information - Complementary valet parking is always welcome along South Lamar - Great vibes and ambience - Always appreciate when a place focuses on shareable plates"

                "description": "My first encounter to Odd Duck I went solo as my date was feeling ill. I opted to try two main dishes starting with the quail which was outstanding. The goat cheese stuffing was beyond perfection and while I normally don't like chorizo it wasn't overburdened w/ traditional spices making the protein aspect of the dish wonderful; crispy and juicy.  The baba ghanoush had just a weeee to much cilantro for my tastes but overall a spot on accompaniment to the dish. Finishing the dish the salsa macha hit the perfect notes for heat.   Being a huge scallop lover I'm a stickler for the perfect mollusk. Odd Duck seared them to perfection with a great amount of caramelization and tender on the inside. While the menu said \"celery puree\" I picked up right away the it wasn't something in my years of being a chef never experienced. The puree was Kohlrabi. The vegetable mash was a smart move as the acidity cut the fattiness from the bacon lardon. The chili crisp was a very nice addition as it gave the dish a sweeping hint of heat, enough to compliment, not overpower. Well done.  I paired my dinners with the Hi Sign \"El Berto\" Lager. A very nice draft beer which went down smooth and didn't have the \"hoppiness\" that a more robust beer like an IPA has. I also sampled \"The Hop Sauce in My Bag\". What a refreshing beverage. The codka went down smooth while the ginger and citrus flavors made me with I was on a porch with a nice cool breeze!   My second encounter didn't live up to the first experience. I split the marinated cucumber and melon salad which was perfect for an early July night. The melon was juicy and the fragrant herbs of mint and basil made sure each bite popped with flavor. Excellent starter.   I opted for the aged Pork and while flavored spot on had an extreme amount of gristle. I found it very hard to impress my date while having to napkin off my mouth to expel what I couldn't chew. The rest of the dish complimented the flavors very well so no complaints for the overall flavor profile.   This was my dates' first time at the restaurant and she opted for the nachos. It was a rather bland dish overall but was saved by the amount of chicken and a good choice of using vadouvan pico.   Dessert was the lime panna cotta. Let me tell you the citrus in this dish make eating it like listening to a symphony from heaven! The almonds gave a nice texture balance juxtaposed to the toasted meringue which gave a somewhat campfire marshmellow vibe.     We split a bottle of Elyse Zin which was bold yet smoothed out in the mouth after just a moment.  Very nice and went with both of our entree's perfectly.   All in all these were brilliant efforts and before I forget, the staff was amazing. Kudos to the hard-working chefs and the knowledgeable front of the house for making my move to Austin memorable."

                "description": "When people say Austin has a great food scene, I think of Odd Duck as the pillar of that. My friend and I both agreed that Odd Duck would populate our top 10 restaurant list that we had ever been to.   We had the scallops dish, ceviche, beets, and tostadas. Everything was delicious, but the scallops dish was the best.   The interior and service are on par with Michelin starred restaurants, but have a more authentic Austin vibe. A must visit if you are in town."

                "description": "A gem in Austin for their authenticity and willingness to explore.   I loved dining at Odd Duck so much that I'd say it's now one of my favorite restaurants in Austin (first time was earlier this month). I'd go through all the dishes but that wouldn't be helpful because the menu changes seasonally (since they are a farm-to-table restaurant +1). First, I love that it's tapas styled (+1) because it means you get to try more dishes and nottt feel like you're over ordering!   What stands out to me about this restaurants is their sauces. The ones that I had with the heavier items (the red meat dishes) were rich and dimensional. Some of the flavors were unique because it had some aspects of familiar tastes mixed with ones that were foreign to me. I loved being able to try all the dishes because I knew I was tasting a unique dish that was created (or crafted) by a talented chef.   From a bar seat, I could tell that the servers and chef love what they're doing (trust me, it doesn't go unnoticed). I love knowing that my meal was made by people who are exploring, learning, and having fun! I honestly think it's hard to NOT want to support a restaurant like this..   Every foodie's must-try for sure."

                "description": "Odd Duck is definitely a must-visit if you are in Austin!  This restaurant supports the local Austin community, so it is neat seeing the various sourced goods within the innovative dishes here. It started in a trailer but transformed into what it is today with its farm to table creations.  We found street parking luckily, which was right on Gibson Street W. I did notice there is a private parking lot with valet included in it. I highly recommend making reservations. I found my reservation about ~3 days prior to the date. There are bar top seatings and outdoor seatings available. It's great for dates, friends or family (more for adults).  FOOD: Cajun Pork Rillette (4/5; Apples, Pickles, Sour Duck Market Sourdough): The cajun pork rillette was decent but enhanced with the addition of the veggies. The pickled veggies brought life to the dish. It was my first time trying rillette though, which is pork meat that is submerged in fat then cooked at an extremely slow rate. Another important note was the sourdough (it was baked perfect).  Mushroom Chorizo Tostada (5/5; Squash and Pepita Butter, Radish, Pickled Onions): This tostada was something else! It is very unique, and I loved all of it (including the texture of the tostada). There are 3 pieces, but I ate 2/3. I could have ordered another one for myself. The squash and pepita butter had some flavor, which helped bring another part of the taste element into play. Nothing overpowered another.  Apple Salad (4/5; Smoked Squash, Lavender, Chevre, Black Pepper Pecans): This is a lighter dish. I am not a big fan of apples, but I can assure you that I ate them in this salad! Great flavors that burst in your mouth... even the black pepper pecans.   Wagyu Sirloin Cap (5/5; Papa Bravas, Soubise, Green Bean Salsa Verde): My date loved this. He is an all time meat-lover, and he raved about this. The wagyu was cooked perfectly at medium-rare. It easily became one of my top 5. I also have to mention the pickled veggies with the papa bravas because they were delicious. I did not try much of the soubise (white onion sauce), but it was not overpowering. It added a nice, subtle savory taste with the wagyu.   Service was great and attentive. Everything came out on time. Our drinks never touched bottom.  Would I come back!? Definitely!!! They change the menu pretty often too. I am a fan."

She created customized menus for each person indicating what they could/could not eat and even came back with variations of dishes the chefs said they could do. The service here is excellent, as was the food.  Food is tapas style, so we were ordering tons of dishes for the table. Their menu changes frequently, so what you get really depends on when you go. Overall, we had a great time here and would love to come back!"

We were greeted immediately by the hosts and taken inside. The drinks were amazing. we ordered cornbread to go since we heard such amazing things but I wanted to try so many things on the menu and there were only 2 mouths to feed.   Unfortunately no duck egg for the dinner menu.  We got the wagyu beef which was slightly a bit more raw then I would have liked it.   Drinks were pretty good with the Cucumber Daze and a watermelon drink (can't recall it was one of their seasonal drinks)"

                "description": "So right now this is my favorite restaurant in Austin. I think it's the best value for food, experience and price. I had their steak most recently which was delicious but if you're not looking to splurge like that the burger here is awesome.   The look and feel of this spot is super modern and cool.  But I think the best part of this place is the service. I mostly eat at the bar and they're exceptional there. One thing I was really impressed with is that they really take care of people that have different food preferences. I personally don't have eating limitations but for those that do they have curated menus so you don't feel that you have only one item to choose from if you're vegan/vegetarian.   Pro tip - make sure to take advantage of the valet. I believe it's fee (plus tip). The adjacent street parking on Gibson is a hill and is normally full anyway."

I was pleasantly surprised when I was able to order right away! I got an iced cinnamon sugar latte with almond milk which came out to about $6.25. The price is a little steep, but the flavor and milk substitute added about $2.   The coffee came out relatively fast and was pretty good! The cinnamon was subtle, but the coffee was smooth and rich. My fiancé and I both enjoyed it! I don't know if I would come out of my way for this coffee, but if I was in the area I would definitely stop by again!   The location is convenient and there are other businesses on the same strip to try out as well. I would recommend coming here and getting some coffee to go!"

I've been here a few times over the past years and it's a really cute, quiet spot for working. Today however I was served a matcha latte with a really funky taste to it. It seemed like the matcha powder used just sat in a thick later on top of the (1%) milk, without being well combined, and the milk tasted a little off to be honest. I regret not saying something but I think I attributed the taste to the matcha mixing issue at the time. The person I went with had a coffee which tasted fine, but used a different (dairy) milk from mine. Really a shame since my drink was so bad from the first sip, we just ended up leaving. Sorry stouthaus!"

It's pretty small inside, so if it's cold outside I wouldn't plan on finding a seat, but their patio is a nice addition with a beer garden feel. It is right off the highway though so don't go expecting a nice view of trees, but with the right company I don't think that really matters.  When I went the coffee didn't blow my mind, and they also didn't have any brewed at 1pm on a Thursday which was kind of strange to me for a coffeehouse so I had to wait. But that did mean it was fresh which is always nice.   They have fake outlets (they're stickers) which is kind of funny I guess but wasn't funny to me when I found a seat and my laptop died... they also have real ones though so don't worry.   All in all a cute little place and worth checking out if you're in the mood for a new local coffee shop. Or a low key place for a beer."

First off their beer (especially electric jellyfish) is amazing..ive never had a bad beer from pinthouse ever.Its much better to get it straight from them as it's cheaper and tastes better.  The pizza rolls are a absolute gift from the Gods.I could probably live off them.The pizza is always incredible as well.  The only downside is it's always packed no matter what time you go which should tell you what ya need to know."

Pinthouse has some great food and the craft beer selection is extensive and delicious. This place lives up to the social media hype for sure. Electric Jellyfish is one of my favorite beers.   It seemed like all of the employees truly enjoy working here. They were all super friendly and knowledgeable."

                "description": "Huge Pinthouse Pizza fan!! I was visiting from out of town have been craving good pizza for weeks.   We went on a Saturday night so it was lively and hard to find a table. We ended up finding a spot out on the patio and the staff was very kind to help with a heater so in the end wasn't a problem!   I love the casual vibe and energy inside. The restaurant has a \"seat yourself\" policy with long picnic tables inside. I didn't realize the location brews their own beers which was so cool - I loved the Old Beluga Amber Ale and Dry Irish Stout (I did have a sample of the Pastry Stout but decided the taste wasn't for me).   Pizzas and salads were all phenomenal. I love when a pizza can have a soft and fluffy crust without being too thick. The pepperoni was my favorite and I'd definitely order the Sundance Salad again.   Great experience and will definitely come back again!"

I'm not a huge beer fan, but I enjoy their selection of ciders and wines too. Also, another important tidbit to mention is PHP also has one of the best ranch dressings this side of the Mississippi. Actually probably on both sides of the Mississippi."

                "description": "I'm happy to post this follow-up to my previous review:     Stopped by today for lunch, and there's a great lunch special:  $12.50 for a personal sized pizza, small salad, and soft drink!  You can select from any of the pizzas and salads on the menu.  I had the margherita pizza and classic house salad.  The salad came out quickly and was really good:  crispy veggies, the house-made ranch dressing is delicious, and no skimping on the cherry tomatoes or parmesan!  Even though it is served in a small bowl, there is a lot of salad packed in the serving.  Loved it!  It wasn't too long before our pizzas were delivered (not sure if this is the normal pace, we were there about 1:30 p.m. after the lunch rush).  The pizza was good, too!  This was more food than I could eat; a really good lunch deal, imho.      The restaurant itself is pretty casual with picnic style tables placed end-to-end in rows and a few picnic tables around the perimeter of the large room.  Great for big groups!  The staff was unfailingly friendly and welcoming.  This location brews its own beers, none of which I tried so I cannot comment now.  Guess that means a return trip is in order!"

I love love love the crust on this pizza and the vegetarian options available are fun and intriguing. I'd definitely recommend this place to just about anyone!   The reason I'm not going to give PHP a 5 star is the damn bar tenders. OCCASIONALLY there will be someone nice behind the bar that I'd actually want to tip, but for the most part, y'all are horrible at choosing staff to run your bar. Literally I'd say the majority of your bartenders don't give 1 Flying Monkey Turd about proper service. For being a brewery and me knowing the \"selectivity\" of your bar staff, y'all could do better.  Come mainly for the pizza and brews, just ignore the idgaf vibes from the bar staff."

While it's certainly not the best brewery selection/pizza in Austin, it definitely more than hits the spot! Pizza is a tad on the roughies/chewy side, not too much of a char or crisp as I'd like but some people might prefer that! Fun topping varieties, although I'd stick to the classics, our cauliflower pesto pizza fell a little short flavor wise."

The outdoor patio has potential, but it seems to have been neglected. The few times I've sat outside I think the wait staff forgot about us. Not a huge deal, and they made it right with a feee pizza voucher.   All their pizzas are good and worth trying, but my go to is the pepperoni and basil."

Every single pizza I've tried is insanely good and their Pinthouse Salad is one of the best salads I've had in Austin.

                "description": "A great place for a casual get-together for unique pizza and drinks!  FOOD: Their \"El Queso\" (basically chips and queso) was delicious and a hearty appetizer for 2-3 people. My friend and I also ordered small sizes of the Banh Mi and Shroomin' Goat pizzas to share. The Banh Mi was alright - not amazing, but perhaps that is why Banh Mis are meant to be sandwiches. Beware: the Banh Mi has jalapeno slices on it that make the pizza very spicy, unless you're into that. The Shroomin' Goat is a balance of mushroom, salty goat cheese, fresh arugula, and garlicky goodness. Smalls are 10 inch and would probably be the perfect portion for 1 person to finish. Since we also had an appetizer and shared pizzas, we only ate about half of each. I would be remissed if I didn't also mention the huge selection of beers on tap. Since I'm not a beer person, I got myself an Austin EastCiders Sangria which was pretty good.  SERVICE: Not sure how to feel about the service because there wasn't too much to it. I was a little confused because there seemed to be separate counters for food and drinks, but apparently both have to be ordered at the bar. The server brought the food out to us and when we asked for water, he said that there were cups inside - this would not have bothered me if I wasn't finding myself filling cups of water at the same drink station where the server was filling up my friend's root beer float...The server also brought us to-go boxes for our leftover pizza. Overall, the employees were friendly, but I also wondered if they needed that many for so little to do.  LOCATION: The front is already inviting with a beautifully lit outdoor seating area. The host greeted us in front of the restaurant and takes you to a seat - we sat in their other outdoor patio area which ran along the side of the restaurant and connects to the inside. Unlike some other patio dining, there is plenty of space and tables. Inside, the restaurant is nice and spacious with lots of seating, although they seemed to be sticking to the booth seating for COVID precautions. We came here on a Thursday night and it was fairly busy, but not crowded by any means.  PARKING: Plentiful since it's in a shopping area."

                "description": "dank.   The Honey Pear pizza is a must try if you've never had it. The subtle sweetness of the honey and pear matched perfectly with the house cheese blend that Pinthouse uses. With some caramelized onions to top it all off, it was a great medley of flavors that paired nicely with the prosciutto.  Personally being a fan of meat-lover pizzas, we ordered the Cannonball as well. Typically, I find these types of pizzas to be a little heavy when it comes to oil and grease, but this wasn't the case for Pinthouse. The pizza was sparing with the oil, but still contained the substance you would be looking for. After eating 6-7 slices myself, I somehow didn't end up in a food-induced coma and even managed to shoot around for a bit afterwards.   Overall, great experience. 5 stars - will be returning"

The bagel was perfectly crispy and the egg + cheese went so well with the jalapeño cheddar bagel. My bacon was also extra crispy which I like! I also got a lavender latte, honestly not worth it and pretty pricey.   The inside also isn't very big so we had to wait for a table. They also have an outdoor area for seating, but it was too cold to sit outside.The staff is very friendly and our food came out hot and fast! Took away a star because of the over priced latte and lack of seating."

                "description": "Checked this place out after the Austin Half marathon to pass time before lunch reservation. The atmosphere was a really cool, college-like bar/cafe with fun music. Got a cup of coffee while my friend got a beer and he enjoyed his beer! The coffee was pretty standard. Got BEC bagel and unfortunately they were out of everything but the cinnamon raisin (we got there at 11:15) and it wasn't that great. Probably just alright. Overall nice place to sit down, grab a beer or coffee and read or just hang out."

The staff is always really friendly and do a good job of making sure that you're taken care of!  My favorite thing to get here alongside a cold brew is breakfast bagel sandwich. They serve Rosen's Bagels, which is the closest thing you can get to an NYC bagel in Austin (not an exact replacement, but close enough).  It's definitely one of the coffee shops that you need to cross off your Austin list!"

Con: If you order a triple shot iced latte, they'll just make a cold brew with milk to save time. I almost stopped coming here after that experience until my next hangover called for a breakfast sandwich.   Do: order breakfast Don't: order coffee"

I have ordered 2 versions of their breakfast sandwich S.O.B. And I have to say both are delish in their own way.  Vegan SOB made with beyond breakfast sausage and a house made cashew cheese. It's just stacked with flavor. Then their original SOB you can get a few different meat options I went with sausage - there some kind of aioli, avocado and taters! Such a mess but worth it!   They have craft beers you can take to go- I love that they carry the brand Untitled art. It's a traveling craft brewery that makes incredible flavors!   Dog friendly and just a must stop spot! GO!"

The flavor options, milk accommodations, outside seating, to go options all made it really inviting. Bagel with lox always a favorite and being from NJ it's a staple I usually judge pretty harshly on but was happy here during my stay in Austin. They also have cute merch, some CBD and beer items too. Local, small business. Would happily come back on my next trip."

                "description": "I visited on my last morning of vaca in downtown Austin due to craving a hearty bagel. It was easy to find from my hotel and primely located across from target on 5th street. The signage only says \"brew and brew\" so I was confused but soon confirmed that I was at the correct place. I know I desired the bagel with smoked salmon so I ordered it but was not impressed. The bagel was cold, flavorless and the smoked salmon was flavorless. I love a good culinary concoction but this just kissed the mary. It was pretty yet did not taste amazing. Presentation was nice however and service was good."

                "description": "Came here to do some work on a Wednesday afternoon. There were a good number of people hanging out, but plenty of available seating with large tables and ample outlets available. The noise level was perfect, not so quiet that you'd be uncomfortable having a private conversation, but quiet enough that you can get work done.   Coffee drink offerings were pretty standard in terms of options and prices. They have a really wide variety of beers available, as with most spots in the area most of them are localish. They could expand a little bit on their food options, especially on their non breakfast items since they seem to lean more towards the happy hour crowd.   I went for the cold brew which tasted great- super smooth and didn't need much milk to get a nice creamy taste. Be warned it is super strong, it takes a lot for me to get a caffeine rush from coffee and this really did the trick.   Overall I think it's a great place for a date spot, to get some work done, or hit a casual happy hour. I can definitely see myself coming back here in the future"

He was being a dipshit about his mask (like acting like he was wearing it, but then intentionally wearing it wrong so the staff had to say something). He took a call and didn't wear it and that woman said something so he got all in a huff and walked out. It didn't seem like anyone threw him out, to me. I did kind of want to toss him myself but guys like that always have some virus. Don't want to get close.   Anyway I've been home to Texas a few times lately. A friend told me to try this place and I've gone every time I'm home. The food, beer (I don't like coffee) and staff have always been really good. Made me feel welcomed home. They do it right. Ivan does it without his mask on."

                "description": "A local biz that I've frequented many times over the years. They help to keep Austin weird as they say.  Surrounded by many new construction projects is a small coffee and brew joint nestled on the corner - you might pass it if you drive too fast - please don't!  I came in recently for breakfast and I was saddened a little as the menu had changed from my last visit. I'm normally chill about this however my wife was excited about the breakfast offerings I described only to realize they trimmed the menu down a bit.  I went 4 stars solely due to the reduced menu from the past. I just wish they did more breakfast on the weekend.  The coffee is great (FlatTrack) and beer even better I'd say. I find going over to FlatTrack gets me a little more for breakfast vs here although the venue is larger.  This isn't a diss but a request to improve is all. The mainstream is coming and I want my local to stay."

Brew + Brew was the clear winner!  They had an extensive menu, with lots of choices -- a very big factor for me.  My vanilla latte and my everything bagel were delicious.  The staff was warm and friendly.  Of course, there's no indoor service right now, but you can sit and eat outside on the patio.  And it's conveniently close to Target and Whole Foods."

It's truly a Cheers-esque environment where everyone feels welcome and everyone knows your name (and drink)! Marissa, Kiyani, Sophia and Aaron all make everyone feel welcomed and valued. We've lived here (6 minutes away) for 10 years and this is BY FAR the best regular crew they've ever had! Management is a revolving door, though, and there have been some great ones along with dozens of others (good and bad) who are no longer at this location or with the company. Drew, who is newish, though, is awesome and one of the best to ever grace this location's presence.  All I can say is, if you're local and haven't been but are considering stopping in - go here. If you're out of town and visiting - go here. If you're a regular - write a review. You know the folks here who make this your regular spot deserve the shout out. I, personally, feel bad it's taken me so long to give them a public shout out!  Management - you're lucky to have a team like this during this time. Treat them as the valued people that they are!  Thanks y'all!"

Went tonight finally to get some fare on patio since it was such a nice evening, and omg, we were blown away.  Stated with the fried pickles, I don't even care for pickles, but with the Buffalo sauce! Uhmmm yass these were amazing! Perfectly crispy, crunch of the pickle, and the zip of the sauce, it was pretty darn good!  I had the spicy passion fruit margarita, it was more sweet than spicy, but still tasty. I liked the blood orange Bellini a little better, and the house margarita was also good.   I got the coconut shrimp for dinner, again, perfectly fried, with a nice crunch. The coconut was subtle but I really enjoyed the chile sauce with it. I got a \"side\" of fries to go with it, the fries could have been my meal. Super generous portion, and do yourself a favor, add the truffle, Holy moly!    Our waitress was great, as long as every other member of the wait staff that touched our table. We came on the recommendation of friend and I feel I have to spread the love. This place is a must try, and I can't wait to come back!"

We came at lunch and though I was initially hesitant to bring in kids, there ended up being plenty off other families in there. The menu was upscale American. Given it was lunch time, we went with hamburgers and sandwiches. The main dishes were all really good and a decent portion (not too big, not too small). The sides we got were a bit under seasoned though. Lastly, there should really be a hamburger on the kids menu.   Overall, really enjoyed this place. Will come back for dinner to try more of the menu."

Despite both being relatively small, there's plenty of seating.  Choose from high-tops to semi-circular booths to high-back swivel bar stools.  And they have an outdoor patio as well, but not much of a view.   The League is a great place to meet a friend for drinks, a casual date, weekend brunch, watch Sunday football, or to just to ride the bar solo.    Excellent food with new, weekly specials, including a burger-of-the-week. On Mondays they have 2-for-1 burgers for dine in - can't beat that!  They also have cocktail specials to go along with their food specials (in addition to their menu and drink standards).  I wish they had a bigger beer wall, but the selection is serviceable.   The League is one on my regular spots and I've yet to be disappointed with their food, drinks, or service."

Friendly service and helpful staff members greeted us at the door and I loved the Prohibition era style and decor. Lots of variety on the menu. I tried the Society burger which was tasty and my husband had the club sandwich. $3 mimosas and they sent us home with a complimentary dessert- can't beat that."

                "description": "Came here for lunch with a few of my coworkers and it was pretty good.  Lunch was solid service was good but I think that was partially because there were only 4 tables occupied when we were there but the service was attentive.  Menu is pretty large and has breakfast items during lunch so no complaints there because I do love me some breakfast for lunch or dinner.  Overall solid place would come back if I'm in the area not making a special trip here but if I'm here I definitely would come back."

( even asked about allergies ) There's definitely a spirit of cooperation- every employee was eager to help out.  Drinks : Bloody Mary's delicious and at $3.00 a bargain. Arron the bartender jumps in to help out in the dining area. Great guy !! Food : Pot pie (basically a biscuit with gravy with a fried egg on top - WOW filling and Delicious!! Wife had the steak salad - steak cooked exactly as she ordered it.  Mother in Law had a breakfast anytime.  All of our food was delicious!!  All and All we had a GREAT experience!! Definitely will come again.  A quality restaurant ! Absolutely nothing negative to report.  As a treat on your 1st visit - we'll show up and ask about it.  Prices were VERY REASONABLE!!"

                "description": "We have been going to The League for a couple of years now. I get my hair done around the corner so it's convenient for my husband to hang at the bar. Sometimes we eat here and sometimes not.   Upside; Bartenders are always friendly and welcoming, they have great happy hour prices on drinks and apps. Also weekly food specials.   Food can be hit or miss. Between the two of us we've had everything on the menu. Club sandwich is always as hit and so is the spinach artichoke dip. Burgers sometimes a bit dry. The salmon is usually perfectly cooked. Fish and chips over battered and greasy. Prime rib sandwich is hit or miss.  Burger of the week this visit was Frito Pie Burger. I had the garlic butter grouper, which was a huge portion, but lacked seasoning on both the fish and couscous. Garlic butter was on the side, but was just melted butter with a chopped garlic at the bottom. No other seasonings.   We will continue to come hang at the bar and eat here occasionally."

                "description": "5 stars for service and 2.75 stars for food. My 4 stars are on the generous side.  We dined here this afternoon. The server was very nice and took care of us. I'd give her service 5 stars.   For our food we ordered the chicken fried pork chop, the full rack of ribs, the southern burger, and the kids Mac and cheese.   Our little guy loved the Mac snd cheese. It was decent and definitely not out of a box. It didn't come with anything else but was only $5.   Hubby had the Southern burger with truffle fries ($2 up charge). The burger was solid. It could have been a slight bit juicer but it was a good burger. The \"truffle\" fries were not. The fries were limp and soggy and sprinkled with Parmesan but had no truffle flavor at all. Actually when you picked up a fry the cheese all fell off too. Pretty bad fries to be honest.   Older son ordered the baby back ribs and enjoyed them. They were your standard fair. Similar to what you'd find at Chili's but they cost $30 and come with a side of mashed potatoes.  I had the  chicken fried pork chop. It was very over cooked and dry and was topped with jalapeño gravy but there was no heat or jalapeño flavor at all. The gravy made the pork chop less dry though. I subbed Brussels sprouts instead of mashed potatoes ($2). They lacked seasoning or flavor. I like the taste of Brussels sprouts so I ate them but they had no other seasoning that I could detect.   The food was all fine. Not bad but at their prices I would definitely not run back."

                "description": "Tonight I met a friend to taste their Prime and Wine deal. Half price bottles of wine and two sizes of Prime Rib. The beef was perfectly cooked, nicely seasoned and fork tender. The mushrooms cooked in a savory salty balsamic sauce were the perfect accompaniment to the prime rib. I asked for fries rather than the Yukon mashed because I know their fries are fresh and hand cut. Some people complain about soggy fries. Well, if you put them in a cardboard box to take home, they WILL steam in the box and get soggy. Duh! But ours were nice and crispy. The cut of beef was thick which I really appreciated as opposed to a wide thin-cut slice. I think it was maybe 3/4 of an inch thick? Maybe more. I'm posting a pick but I had already dug in when I remembered to take a photo. Sorry. I like The league a lot. Even the Mgr came by to ensure we were happy. Nice young man was our waiter. This was all good!"

The Sunday crew in the bar was super fun, our server Aaron was really kind   Their Sunday drink special is $3 mimosa and bloody Mary's.   Their gluten free bun is the best I've had at a restaurant, it is nice and chewy and stays together.   The chicken sandwich was great, a huge chicken breast with lots of bacon and avocado. They do a \"first timer\" complimentary dessert of their chocolate dump cake, my husband said it was great!"

The sandwich was not an adult version and not elevated. Cold congealed cheese on what looked like white bread. No spreads or bacon jam or fig or combination of cheeses.. nothing to elevate this sandwich to justify the $13.00 price tag.  I make 'em better at home."

As a former restaurant owner / operator, I appreciate the consistency and quality of the menu offerings. The facility is always clean and tables are cleared immediately when a party leaves. They have some really good deals, like burger Monday where you buy one and get one free. They also have a mouth watering prime rib special on Thursday that we can't wait to try.  One more attraction is , if you are into science or astronomy, you might be waited on by Galileo."

We had no clue about this place until tonight when I was looking for a family friendly restaurant, Little did we know it's only 10 minutes away from our house that we lived at for over two years. We were greeted as soon as we came in, it looked upscale and as soon as we sat down my husband said \"are you sure this is kid friendly\"  it ABSOLUTELY is. The food was amazing from the appetizers, main course and dessert. The customer service here was outstanding, I've waitressed myself for many years and have been to many restaurants and have never had service like this. Sam took care of us tonight and was so accommodating to us and our 1 year sassy daughter. Zach the manager on duty was also outstanding as well, he took care of us well for it being our first time there, We left in disbelief with the service we received... thanks yall! We look forward to many more dinners here.   Plus I got a nice tote for the to go food"

It was nice to reminisce.   Meet a couple for dinner while going through town. They recommended this place because they have \"The Incredible Burger\", a vegan burger option. They have driven to San Marcos a couple of times from Kyle just for that burger. One got it on a Patty Melt and said the Texas toast was the perfect addition. The other got it on a regular bun. Both with fries. Both disappeared quickly! They also had a Bloody Mary each. The staff was very accommodating in regards to one's request for extra olives.   My husband had the fish and chips Irish style, so a Guinness based batter. I had the fish and chips Texas style, so a corn meal based batter. Both were fantastic. I tried some of his. His better was crunchier and crisper than mine. Both were very good.  My husband had the Solid Gold lager. He said it was pretty light but good.   The overall noise got a little loud quickly but it's a Saturday night in a college town so that's not unexpected. There are a couple of pool tables and several TVs. It's a great college hang out place.   Lots of beer options.   My husband said there was a trough in the men's restroom... The ladies could have used some attention but mostly well maintained."

Though that is just the tip of the iceberg. Got here 2 hours before the fight and they would not turn any of the TVs to the prelims out on the patio. We asked 3 times and the 3rd time they said they could not cause people wanted to watch the soccer game that wasn't even on yet, also we are the only people at the time watching on the patio. Next is there was no cover when we got here, walked in sat down been drinking and eating and they are coming around telling us we have to go buy 15 dollar tickets at the door. On top of that the food is not high quality but the most expensive on the square and the service just isn't really there.   Also half the TVs are the fight and they are small TVs! Like super and low quality  Just ripping regular people off cause they are the only people on the square that show the fights. Bad business."

                "description": "I've been going to Sean patricks for a couple years now regularly with my girlfriend and my service dog. Every time we go someone always makes a comment to me about how well trained and well behaved my service dog is, and this evening was no different in regards to that. I always had a great experience with nice employees who were very welcoming.  I've never had a worse customer service experience in my life as I did today. The manager on duty Marshall Wyatt or Wyatt Marshall kicked me and my service dog out because he didn't have a vest for show that says service dog on it from Amazon. I explained to him more than I legally needed to in regards to my service dog. He at first turned me over to his manager under him, who was very nice, as employees usually are at Sean Patrick's. I compromised with sitting outside as they were busy on the inside anyways, and I didn't want to cause any issues. Then we were getting stormed on outside with winds blowing everything off our table and getting rained on while we ate. We only needed to have their coverings for the outside patio rolled down, but they took forever, and after asking multiple times for someone to come take care of it, I began taking care of it myself when finally Marshall Wyatt or Wyatt Marshall comes out and attempts to take care of it, but the covering just kept flying into our table and hitting my girlfriend. While we are getting pummeled by their outside seating covering. I pointed at it while making eye contact with Mr Wyatt, he makes eye contact, but continues being fixated on a tv while he leisurely walks over to assist. He walks back inside after putting a chair in the way. Well, the chair blows back on us with the crazy winds. We walk inside and get harassed by a bar back because Marshall Wyatt instructed him to in regards to my service dog. After explaining the law to the bar back we sit down, and I determined it was time to talk to someone about the experience I've had tonight. I spoke with the manager under mr Wyatt. Again, she was very nice, welcoming, and apologetic. After speaking with her mr Wyatt comes over to ask me how he was \"rude\" to me. I explained to him my experience, and he proceeded to argue every detail to defend and deny his lousy service. I thought he would come over to take responsibility as a manager and apologize, so I was caught off guard and told him that I didn't want to hear his argument, he then snatched everything off our table and kicked myself and my girlfriend out, saying that my service dog was in there \"illegally,\" even though I tried to explain to him that he can simply refer to the ADA website. I cannot say I will be coming back until Mr. Wyatt is gone.  Owner Brian Jeffrey, please make this right, and reach out to me. I will miss going to Sean Patrick's, but who my money goes to is a huge thing for me."

We ordered drinks , chili cheese fries, and a DELICIOUS 2$ scoop of pistachio almond ice cream in a waffle cone . All the food was awesome ( which I can't remember saying in past experiences .)   After the game we opted for some shuffle board and darts , which was a great end to an awesome World Cup game . Couldn't have asked for a better place/ environment for watching , enjoying great food, and hearing a lively crowd !!!"

When their order came out the fish and chips were awful, breading was soggy and the 'white' fish was grey in color, they were refunded the meal, but didn't want to take a chance on anything else. Later I went to use the restroom, only to be in a stall that has no toilet paper. Very disappointed as I was from out of town and looking to try something local. Very disappointed."

                "description": "This place is far from being like an Irish pub with Irish food. Any Non-American visiting would tell you Shepard's Pie is made with lamb and not beef.  It's ok to make it with beef but one must correct their menu as it's correctly called \"Cottage Pie\" when made with beef.   Blackjack Burger - Pretty Good Philly Cheese Steak - No Flavour (yes, there's a damn U in it) Smithwicks - Ran Out (pronounced incorrectly... don't say the W)  As a immigrant this is far from Irish, in fact so far removed from anything Irish it's an insult. No offense, but an American would never know the bloody difference! In addition, the bathrooms are named \"Lasses\" and \"Boyos\".... the ladies is a SCOTTISH name and the men's is WELSH name; no S at the end. This damn place needs to learn some shit really quickly, because they look like fuck'n idiots to everyone out of county.  Skip this shit-hole and get a decent beer and food at Aquabrew down the street... you were warned, so go ahead regret it at your leisure!"

First off we ordered fried jalapeños and got fried pickles, but didn't say anything because it wasn't that big of a deal. The issue was at the end. We tried to tell him separate tabs, handed him a 20 and a credit card for the two tabs. He kept the 20 and didn't bring back any change, and charged all of the drinks on one tab- never saw him again. We were in a rush so couldn't track him down to correct it. Needles to say, a little disappointed..."

                "description": "This has been one of our favorite local places for years now. The new owner, who previously worked here, is a real stand-up guy and has been nothing but awesome towards us. He has taken on a lot more than being an owner; he actually works his business and takes serious pride in the place. Having taken over just before the pandemic, and knowing what that did to restaurants all over, it is hard to see people leave such horrible reviews. You can tell some of the reviews might reflect the person leaving them and not the place itself. Do not let those deter you from trying this place. You will not regret it. The area outside was a great addition for the dogs and kids run around. We have favorites but like try something new from the menu when we go and have yet to be disappointed. Also, pretzels and beer cheese with beers...mmmm!!! My husband likes big beers and I like Kolsch. Want wine? They have that too. They always have something that makes us both happy and that is what keeps us going back for more. Every time we have friends or family in town, this is always on the list to take them. Help keep this local gem afloat! They deserve it! And remember, the more we go now, means the better the place will be in the future. He has plans up his sleeve but that takes revenue :) Keep it up, Dig Pub!"

                "description": "Not too much to say.  The workers are very friendly and the beer selection is okay. It's a strip mall, suburban kind of bar.   The manager told us she was the manager like 50 times so we'll never forget that she's the manager.    \"I'm the manager\". \"So I'm the manager and I can add beer to our menu if you like\". \"I'm the manager, so I make decisions\". \"So I'm the new manager here and I can make things happen\".   It was definitely a laughable but enjoyable experience. Nothing to special.  Just convenient because it's located nearby.   The guests were mostly old white people. The outdoor area is nice.  At least they have that, so you're not cooped up inside a small space with die hard Trumpers who hate everyone and everything different than them.  ."

                "description": "Evening in the suburbs and the dining options were dwindling. I was getting hungry and being out with my buddy meant that I'd have at least one more beer. My friend went through his mental list of places and came up with The Dig.   We arrived there and fortunately got there in time, it was a slow night and the kitchen was about to close so we quickly made our choices. I saw that they had Scotch Eggs and I'm a sucker for Scotch eggs, but unless you're a vegetarian/vegan what's not to like about an egg wrapped in sausage that's then deep fried?  I also ended up getting their Buffalo Chicken Sandwich because...actually why do you need a reason?  The egg was good, a little thin on the sausage side but the mustard dip added a little more savory. The sandwich had a good amount of spice but the sauce was pretty runny so it was messy but otherwise good.  They do have a lot of taps and I appreciate that they try to have a little bit of everything and focus on locals. I get that they have to strike a balance between locals who want a beer that's cold, yellow, fizzy and domestic and crazy whale chasing beer nerds that are into barrel aged, wild/lacto, hopheads but for my visit it was a little more on the tame side. I had a sour from Prairie and a local mead which was great and at the time, that was about it."

                "description": "Drove by here today and thought I would check it out and I liked it! I ordered a Peacemaker Beer, an ale that tasted good. The next time I want to try the Blackberry beer. The name itself is appealing. Since it was close to dinner I figured I should order food instead of going home and cooking. I got the fish and chips. You can order the 2 piece or 4. I got the 2 piece with cut fries. It was cooked good. The fish was flaky and not oily. The pubs tarter sauce was good.. the fries were very good too..   The service was very good. There was a sign to sit yourself which I did and within 1 or 2 minutes my server stopped by to get me started. She showed me the ropes and got my beer and food quickly. I was really surprised at how fast my food came out. I can say it was just under 10 minutes but I was still surprised at the promptness. There was quite a few customers but the servers were on top of it. They talked to the customers as if they were family.   The place was clean and there was good parking. The beer menu had several types of craft and IPA beers. I'm  pretty sure I will return when I have time. My total cost including the food and beer was only $14, amazing! Thank you Dig Pub for being in Cedar Park and giving up another place to get a beer and some grub in a friendly way!"

The Sunday brunch is fabulous and should be famous, and the hollandaise sauce is definitely the best I've ever had. Topped off by Guinness and fried pickles, brunch was a hit. The chef hinted at more things in the works, like beer pairings and monthly specials, so we can't wait! Way to rock the craft beer, and now the food is being perfected by the chef, formerly of Snooze, Loro, and now the Dig! Awesome, mate."

                "description": "This place is interesting. The right side of the restaurant looks pretty nice and lively and the left side of the restaurant looks like they gave up or ran out of money on decorating and just put a few tables out. They also have an outdoor area but no shade so I didn't want to sit out there unprotected, otherwise, it would have been nice because I had my dog. It was a bit busy so unfortunately had to sit on the left side (maybe everyone else there agrees the right side is better and that's why they all preferred to sit there). It didn't look or feel particularly clean and I'm a clean freak so I didn't particularly enjoy sitting there.   The service was fine; the waitress was nice. The food was pretty decent, but nothing outstanding or memorable where I feel I have to come back again. It was fresh though and I appreciate that for comfort food, it wasn't soaked in oil. I think the ambiance had already turned me off so I didn't enjoy my food as much as I would have it was clean.   They are known for their beer but I don't drink beer so take my review with a grain of salt. Clearly I'm not a dive bar kind of girl (unless it's out for drinks and bar hopping) but plenty of people are fine/really like those types of places so if you do, you'll enjoy this place. I'm not knocking this place and I would come back if friends wanted to go but I like more of an ambiance when I go out to eat."

The adults got the Thor's Hammer and BLTA with fries and the table shared scotch eggs and pickle chips for apps. Sandwiches were straightforward and tasty and the fries were thick but crispy outside and soft inside.   Scotch eggs were better than Renaissance festival... but could have more sausage.  Pickle chips were average bar food. Overall, good meal and fair prices!"

My buddy and I stopped by on my first day in town, and we clearly started things off on the right foot. We each got flights - and I was very content with each beer I got; and they even allowed the barrel-aged stout to be one of my choices (some places can be somewhat stingy with their BAs).  Solid, under-the-radar brewery - will definitely be back next time I'm in town!"

I've been trying to branch out and visit more local breweries as of late.  I can wholeheartedly recommend this place as somewhere to just relax and hangout. Got a flight with a sample of 5 beers - can't recall off the top of my head the names of the one I tried but they were all good!"

Plenty of seating inside and out. Mutt friendly. Beer was pretty good. Not very hoppy IPAs but good nonetheless. I like places that don't have pretentious attitudes towards food when food is not their primary business. Paninis are perfect for a brewery - low fuss, easy, fast. And tasty! Had the Reuben and the turkey/pesto. Now that we know this is a midday weekday kinda place, we'll be back!"

Got a flight of 5 beers including the tropical haze, cider, PBB Stout, BBA Stout (11% but still very smooth and wouldn't be able to tell it's that high with how easy it is).  Enjoyed all the beers but went back for 2nds with the BBA Stout, comes in a 7oz pour due to the higher abv.  They serve a variety of diff sandwiches, we tried their Hartie Artie, basically a crispy sandwich with artichoke and tomatoes in it, real crunchy and satisfying! Whole heartedly recommend coming to check this place out yourself!!"

I've been here pre-pandemic and during, and I gotta say...I'm so glad they're here to grace the South Austin beer community with their presence. When I visited the first time they had just opened and their taproom was still a work in progress. They still had a good selection of board games, self-serve water and beer/cider in a dog-friendly taproom. Yes, I repeat...bring yo dawgs.  Most recently, I ordered a trio of their 32 oz crowlers. There was a deal going on, and I GOTTA SAY THE SEVEN STILLS OMG. That scotch ale was deliciously dark and creamy without being overboard. I was afraid it would be burning on the throat and too infused with that liquor aftertaste. BUT it was so deliciously decadent. It had a dark chocolate feel with a full and steady mouth feel! Deeeeelish. I hope they brew it again. Their Peak Season IPA was also SO yummy and refreshing. I just checked out their tap list and there are so many creative and interesting beers right now. SO GET ON IT Y'ALL.  Pro Tip: check out their instagram page because there are usually cool deals or posts (like one time they gave free warm pretzels to the first few customers)!"

Great people with great beer and unsuspecting great food.    Peak season is a top tier hazy IPA.  Radberry was a great sour that was sweet without being fruit juice.  I think it'd satisfy both the tart lovers and Kettle sour seekers.  I was saving my appetite for a BBQ heavyweight but after tasting my girlfriend's turkey pesto I totally regret my decision to not get food.  The whole thing was a delight.  The flavors and texture all come together to deliver one heck of a Sammy.   Definitely a destination to stop at!"

There was a lively bunch of people throughout our time there, but it never got too crowded.   Their beer selection was fairly limited, but it's understandable given they're quite new to the area. The bartender was super helpful and let my friend and I sample a few of them. Being indecisive I still chose to have a flight after.   My personal favorite beer I tried was the dry hopped wheat, but the hazy IPA and the raspberry milkshake IPA also stood out! Their menu was quite IPA heavy, so hopefully they'll continue to branch out, but it does look like they rotate their menu quite often.   There's also a fantastic Korean food truck out back that I highly recommend checking out while you're here.   Overall, I think the combination of good space to hang out, tasty beer, and delicious food is well worth checking out."

They have done a good job of making it a comfortable place to stay and have a drink.   While there is a German theme to the food and beer, there are plenty of other options. We really liked the Steel Drum Stout (Milk Stout) and the Disco Infiltrator (Sour Cherry Porter).   I need to mention the Soft Pretzel....It is probably the best pretzel I have had. Served warm and baked to perfection with just the right amount of salt.  Service was friendly. I know it is hard to find staff in the current environment, but the Brewtorium did a good job.  I'd go back if I find myself in the Austin area again."

                "description": "They have a wide variety of German style beers, with a few modern offerings and even mead on tap! I was not happy that they werent serving flights, but they told me they are understaffed and dont have a barback to deal with flights. Makes sense that all those small glasses would overwhelm the understaffed team, but a sign would have been nice explaining the situation.  The pretzels they serve here some of the best Ive ever had! It was actually soft, with a touch of chewy texture. The big malted bread flavors were pronounced, with the coarse salt on the surface being a cherry on top. The sauces they give you are horseradish, sour cream, and beer cheese. I mostly snacked on the beer cheese, but the other two were a nice change of pace every other bite.  Seriously these are the kind of pretzels I dream about or imagine tasting when I think of a good pretzel.   I will admit the seating situation is confusing. Yes theres a sign that explains the process, but what other brewery does this? This type of setup would be more manageable with a hostess, but thats not gonna happen with them already being understaffed. Ive only been here once, so Im not sure whats the reason for this unusual seating assignment. Perhaps too many small parties hog up the tables? This place is huge and has plently of seating, so its not a lack of retail space. Who knows but unless they figure something out, the current setup is cumbersome."

                "description": "This place is fine.   The whole seating situation is confusing. You're supposed to get assigned a table at the bar, but the sign is hard to see and if the line is long it seems like groups tend to seat themselves and send a person to the line. Then, the food menus are only at the bar or at a table with a QR code, so it's confusing how you're supposed to look to decide what you want, and you have to decide on the spot at the bar. After all that, our table was actually taken and we had to be reassigned, which isnt a big deal but the whole thing seems unnecessary.   Regarding food and drink, our pretzel was good but my Cobb salad was pretty bland. It was a solid burger with a good pickle but the potato wedges or whatever they are supposed to be are mushy and not like fries or chip. They were sold out of brats.   My beer was tasty, I got the Confabulator, but my partners beer was terrible. He got the \"Mark It 8, Dude,\" which is described as \"toasty, smokey and not out of line.\" It tastes only of artificial smoke and caramel. I drinkable in my opinion. Probably won't be back."

                "description": "TLDR: nothing particularly bad about it, but doesn't really stand out from the noise.   First off we will start with the beer. I had a flight, which come with 5 beers. I had the Dr. Doctor, the Skee-Ball champ, Electric Lederhosen, the Hopheaded strangler, and the barrel aged shadow tower. They were all pretty good. And in most markets it would have been a good lineup, but in Austin, it was nothing more than average, and they didn't really have anything that helped differentiate them from the competition.   The food falls victim of much the same problem. I had the Beer-Belly burger with German Potato Mashers. It was good. Nothing really to complain about it, but there was nothing that made it pop. It was a hearty heavy dish and delivered what it promised too.   The service was fantastic. Everyone was nice and polite, and I really had no issues with it whatsoever.   The atmosphere was so-so. The place was clean, well spaced and decorated, but the inside is essentially a large hall with a bunch of individual tables which gave the place something like a cafeteria vibe, which is the exact opposite I want in a beer garden."

We usually always go here for the beer and soft pretzels which are amazing, but I tried the Joe vs the avocado bowl today and it was incredible."

Cool Spanish music playing and really interesting bar with knowledgeable staff on alcohol. We had a burger with pork belly on it that was delicious...pork belly could have been a little crispier and burger a little less cooked, but that's just a personal preference. Flavor was spot on! Hummus was fantastic, and curried tomato bisque was AMAZING. Salad was okay too, but I don't think that's their selling point. Overall, great Austin eatery."

Food and drinks are ordered at the bar.   The menu is German inspired with items such as delicious and fluffy pretzels to flammkuchen (flatbread). The vegetarian flammkuchen is really tasty with the cashew pesto. I usually order the Stay Golden beet salad, which has quinoa and yummy toppings. I pay a little extra for chicken on top.  The beers are consistently good and the tap list is a good mix of styles. Chris, the owner/brewer (also former homebrewer), has always been great at German beers and he continues to do so on a larger scale.   If you're a non-beer drinker, there are wines and ciders available as well."

I feel like the lime wedge could've been more substantial, but that's pert near splitting hairs.   Buttery, chewy inside, baked to a golden brown and kissed with salt, the pretzel would please even the most cantankerous German tastebuds.   The currywurst consists of sliced bratwurst slathered with tangy housemade curry ketchup served over German potato mashers. It seemed ambitious and I was skeptical, but it turned out to be great.  And of course the patio is dog friendly."

Just to be clear, I'm not into drinking, so I can't say what the quality or character of the alcoholic drinks are like with confidence.  The atmosphere is consistently warm and welcoming, with cool, helpful staff and actually great food. The mac and cheese is amazing (which is notable because I normally don't go for that dish), and the pizza, specifically the Pearsciutto, is scrumptious. The wait times can get a little hefty if you come during peak meal hours, and food tends to run out on Friday evenings, but otherwise, it's a great spot to chill at with friends in the area. Expect to see leashed dogs and tired but happy boulderers enjoying a cold glass of beer and hot food with their friends after a solid session. Overall, one of my favorite places to be after bouldering."

                "description": "We got takeout from here during the pandemic, then went in person with an out of town guest recently. We're essentially vegetarian, so we tried several of those options: the pretzel, the mac and cheese, the corn cup, and the pizza that comes with tomatoes and balsamic vinegar on it. All four of those menu items are delicious - so much so that when we returned, we ordered the exact same set of food. Great takeout, great in person.   Beer selection varies quite a bit, which is nice because there's something for everyone. We've tried a few different IPAs and wheats, and they were all nice.   The outdoor seating was really nice, well spaced, and it was easy to get food and drinks. They have a setup where you can order from your phone, which helps with social distancing and makes it super simple to pay separately. There is a lot of seating in general, which was cool. I would definitely come back here, especially with a group."

All vegetarian as far as I can tell too. The drink menu also looks top-notch.   Parking is tightly packed and not much of it. Tarrytown is a neat area. Outdoor seating had some fun flames to keep people warm. We sat inside and had a reservation.   We ordered the Brussels Sprouts, the Buffalo Cauli, crabcakes and The Burger. Wow. I'm not sure I've tasted appetizers so well prepared. I wouldn't change a thing. All of it was so very delicious and filling. Its like magic: just the right amount of everything. This is how food at restaurants should be.  To drink we has the Hot Toddy and The Mule. Both perfectly flavorful and gorgeous. Food and drinks and tip for two was about a hundred bucks. Worth every penny and I'm going back for sure."

The Sriracha Brussels sprouts were tasty and spicy, but a little soggy and I like my sprouts a little crispy. So we took them home and popped them in the air fryer  the fries were delicious I enjoyed the spices on them, but I could not get over how tasteless the burger was (I know it's not real meat) but it's just not for me - I just think it needs more flavor/spice etc. All in all great vibe at the restaurant and would recommend to anyone who is vegan/vegetarian or wanting a healthy dining option."

Went there for brunch and ordered the oyster mushrooms and grits, fruit plate and a side of toast. The grits were great, but included a tiny bit of mushrooms and at $17, just absurdly overpriced. The single, thin piece of toast was $4 and the fruit plate consisted of a small handful of blueberries and a couple of melon chunks. The food is good, but way overpriced and of poor value. Maybe dinner is better - I want to come back and try it. On the plus side, the food and coffee were tasty, and service was friendly and very good."

                "description": "Read a bunch of restaurant reviews on Yelp before deciding on this place. There are so many great eats in Austin and this one is definitely worth writing about.   I went in on a Sunday evening around 8:45pm. There was hardly anyone inside so I decided to eat at the bar. The bartender (Laura Lee!) helped me dwindle down my options. I had read about the tomato and nectarine salad, but was worried that it would have a mustard flavor in it. She assured me that there wasn't and admitted that she, too, wasn't a mustard fan. SO glad I ordered it! It was such a perfect balance of flavors and I finished the entire thing.   Next up - should I get the eggplant parm or the \"crab\" cakes. She thought about it and says \"go with the crab cakes.\" Holy moly!!  These were INCREDIBLE! So flavorful and the sauce that came with it - just perfection! Highly recommend!!  Check this place out if you want something a little away from 6th street. It's just a few minutes away and so, so worth it. :)"

                "description": "Third visit to this upscale plant-based restaurant and were not let down. Recommend making a reservation especially if you want indoor seating. We enjoy the dimmed ambience, but sometimes large parties do make it loud inside. Our favorite starter: the Buffalo cauliflower with blue cheese. Favorite entree: the spicy \"chicken\" sandwich with oyster mushroom (nice that it isn't cauliflower). Not a huge fan of their Mac and cheese or loaded fries. On our most recent trip, we tried The 'burger' which was delicious especially if you like arugula. They serve upscale cocktails, beer, and wine. Pricing is pretty fair: $6-$12 for a drink and $13-$20 for an entree. Huge bonus: parking has never been an issue!!!"

Something is off with the hot crispy sandwich, maybe they changed the mushroom, but it not as delicious as it once was. many of the items I used to enjoy are also no longer on the menu. Service was good but the quality of the food, and limited options, no longer matches the vibe, or price."

I also tried a lot of the shareable appetizers such as the Buffalo cauliflower wings and those are also worth a try. The cocktails are also very creative. I loved the Nightwing (pictured below) which visually is very cool due to the activated charcoal."

Portions are very generous and we were happily stuffed. The cauliflower and Brussels sprouts appetizers are amazing. We split the kimchi grilled cheese and I crave it now! The cocktails were also great. A lot of people mention its pricy, but we really didn't think so compared to other restaurants in austin and for the portion size. We'll be back soon!"

                "description": "I feel bad for giving this place a two star review because the customer service was absolutely amazing. But everything else here fell short. First, parking. Super narrow, one way, extremely tight. If you miss the correct turn be prepared to either U turn out or drive down and hope you're not in anyone's way. Second, the wait time here is excruciating. Ordered an appetizer I'll be honest, I didn't time this part. But it was long enough of a wait to constantly wonder where's my food? There's a lot of waiting here. It was pretty insane. We decided at 5:20 we were done eating. We didn't see anyone to ask for our bill until 5:51 (I checked this time). When I finally got someone for some reason they looked confused when I called??? I went inside to pay I did not want to wait a moment longer in the cold. Even to pay I had to wait. Like I really can't catch a break in this place. Third, food was very disappointing. The Mac and cheese was good. But my entrees were subpar. I have very high expectations for vegan food in Austin. I usually get the best vegan meals here. But this place fell flat. Like 1/5 for sure. For $50 I expect way more in the flavor department. Also, the items on the menu on Yelp are different from items I saw here. Double check the menu before coming. I think they rotate through their menus. So I was also upset by my options. I didn't like the options I saw and assumed I picked the safest option The Burger. Hard to mess up, so I thought. They were out of pretzel buns so I was given sourdough bread. That is the toughest bread I've ever had. So that didn't work for me either. Mango ice tea was bad too. Just tasted like water. We also had the Kimchi grilled cheese which was just okay. Fourth, I'm not upset I was seated outside. I was freezing out there. Even with the outdoor heaters were on. I am upset that I could not make reservations online. I attempted to days before coming in but the website told me I could not make reservations for 2 people??? Bizarre. With such a rule one would hope they'd have plenty of seating. They did not. My options were either outside or at the bar. Don't like bar seating so we picked outside. Super chilly windy day so I was uncomfortable. With super tiny tables. We barely had room for all of our plates. Every time another item came we had to rearrange everything just to make the item fit. My server was very nice though. Just wish I saw him more often."

                "description": "A really fun concept. I love that everything here is vegan so I don't have to worry!   Starting off with the Sriracha Brussels - very tasty. I wish there was more glaze on it though and that it packed more spice. It's pretty mild but the sprouts were still quite tasty. The Carolina was a very interesting sandwich. I was expecting them to use jackfruit in a pulled pork sandwich but they used banana blossom instead. The flavor was there especially with the bbq sauce but the texture was definitely weird.  My favorite from this place is the kimchi grilled cheese! Being no dairy I have not had a grilled cheese in AGES and it was definitely something I really craved. This grilled cheese hit the spot. I love that they added kimchi and pear to give it more depth. The kimchi was pretty overpowering though. But overall the sandwich was so delicious.  Great food, slightly pricey."

                "description": "This place is pretty good for all vegan options. The food was flavorful and the service was good. We ordered the Nashville hot chicken sandwich and the hill country chicken and gravy. There was a lot of breading on both \"chicken\" dishes which was a bit much but the flavor was pretty good overall. The mac n cheese was a little bland, but that was the first vegan Mac n cheese I've had. We ordered the loaded fries as an app. Those were my favorite of everything we ordered. This is a pretty loud restaurant, but isn't always a bad thing if you get seated next to the right guests! Overall, I recommend at least trying this place out! There's an extensive drink menu, so it would probably be good for happy hour!"

The cocktails and food are great, moderately priced, and the ambiance is just intimate enough to enjoy your meal with your group without feeling too pretentious. Even if you don't have any dietary restrictions, I'd recommend trying this place out and enjoying an evening in this quiet neighborhood. No reservations required either"

I asked if I could just pay for something so I can use the restroom. I was told the cheapest thing was an $18 shirt. Upon checking the menu online, I can see that that was a lie. I would have gladly paid for $12 nachos to eat but nope..the cheapest thing was the shirt. Gotta keep people from not using the bathroom.  I can understand the policy. But lying and turning away a transaction to hold a principle? It deserves a Yelp review."

                "description": "I would really like to give Abel's their 5 stars which they probably deserve but the Restaurant sits at the bottom of a hill. This is not ok when you're bringing in a bus loaded with passengers. Shell passengers at that (Shell has a zero tolerance for unsafe practices). Cars on every side of the street so a bus would have to unload in the street. Luckily for me this time Heaven was on our side by allowing us to get our buses up from the hill. Going down the driveway was just as challenge because we had to turn just right to make the turn to drop the passengers off at the door.  The OS came when we had to turn the buses just right to get out the drive and up the hill onto the street. What makes this even more dangerous are the pedestrians walking in front of the bus, to the side of the bus and in the back of the bus.  It takes a skilled driver (like myself) to be able to get out of the mess I was in. This was the perfect time of all the times I should told my clients dropping them at the door was unsafe. But there I went.  If I didn't position the bus just right getting up that hill a tow truck would have to be called to unstick me. That's what we call bottoming out the bus, when the axil is stuck on concrete enabling the bus to move.  Now my coworker trusted me and followed me right down that forsaken hill and tried to get up the hill as I did.  Now mind you, if we get the buses stuck it will take a tow truck at least 2 hrs to be dispatched and out to our location. It's cost $$$ for a bus pull out, the restaurant is located in a neighborhood so they would have to use an alternate to their homes, patrons inconvenienced, our passengers stomachs full they ready to go to get to their hotel. Shell most definitely will report us for an unsafe practice and we would have to answer for that unsafe practice....just a mess. Anyways, I got my bus out and the other bus as well. There was no bus parking not enough curb parking so we were unable to dine at the restaurant. I forgot about that so I change my rating to 1 star. J/k"

My wife got sick from spoiled coleslaw in her shrimp tacos, my burger was bad but maybe it's just me with the burger bun was like some kind of home made wonderbread bun where my finger goes through the bread ruining the burger with such thin bread. The steak sandwich my son had was covered in processed cheese. processed cheese says it all. I might go back and order the club sandwich my other son had which looked as good as the classic plate gets. I'd love to see a new cook and menu take over this idillic location."

I have to say that I almost didn't go because of the reviews here, but my experience was totally different. And it was absolutely a 5 star experience.  Overall the Views are objectively great right off the water, the food has been very good both times - I had a really good Salmon dish most recently. But more importantly the waiter Rob has been incredibly kind and attentive - even offering Iced Tea \"to go\" both times.  I'd recommend you judge Abels for yourself and come to the restaurant -- I actually asked them about previous reviews and they did say they've been really shifting all of their service to be the best and that's what I've seen first hand.  I can't speak to how they were in the past, but today the experience is 5 stars!"

I used to come here frequently when I was new to Austin but I think my standards were lower and theirs were higher. First of all, it's a pain to get parking around here. Once you're parked, you're better off going to one of the neighboring establishments. The food is so mediocre and overpriced, and I've nearly tried it all. It's not bad, but I'd say it's on par with many chain \"bar and grill\" type of restaurants. The view of the lake is the only asset that draws crowds."

It was embarrassing for me because I picked the place. Thank God that my friends and I are pretty chill people, so we just rolled with it.  However the service was abysmal, the Mexican Martini was not drinkable, bathrooms were filthy and there was not a manager in sight the whole night. Well, at least not until we left and saw them all chatting on an unoccupied patio to the side of the restaurant. I guess it was socialization time while their servers are outside floundering. The girl who served us was seemingly taking care of the whole patio (although failing) and said it was her first week. Wild.   Two people from my party didn't get their meals until everyone else finished. We had to basically beg for our drinks. And the food was honestly 2 stars at best...  Only good thing about this place was the ambiance"

Although there was a wait for a table, Johnny, the BEST bartender/server EVER, found a couple of barstools and made room for us at the bar.  Johnny makes a GREAT host, and GREAT Bloody Mary!  World class. Perfect blend of spices with other ingredients.  I had the Texas burger (YUM) and my husband had Abel's Tex-Mex twist on a Philly steak sandwich. \"Absolutely delicious!\" The open air bar on the lake is a beautiful setting, the weather was perfect, multiple football games on big screens, and a great vibe.   Fabulous food, and not at all expensive.  But Johnny made our experience superb."

Abel's will be in my routine rotation from here on for dinner and drinks.   They have always had a strong kitchen for an affordable bar and grill - so much better than the place next door. Tonight, I was taken care of very well by two affable gents at the back bar, Stuart and Eric. Stuart told me I should try the blackened redfish. He shared it was a new rotating special. I was amazed how perfectly it was seasoned and cooked.  One of the best redfish dishes I have had in months. I immediately asked what I need to do to convince them to serve this on the regular menu. They said let our management know online so here it is.  I was texting friends about how good it was and that we need to come back soon. Please keep this dish on the menu - as often as possible - and give your chef a raise.    Another fun plus - Stuart and Eric know their sports. We had a fun smart conversation about all current sporting events.   Bottom line.  If you are a sports fan, go here. eat the redfish, ask for Stuart and Eric. drink, have fun and repeat. Also, brunch on Sundays for early fantasy games is another great call.   Five stars on this visit. See you soon."

                "description": "Sweet waitress. She was clearly slammed. That's not the issue here. Sweet potato fries were delivered to the wrong table by someone running food. Pancakes were burnt. Both out of her control. She got them both taken off rightfully so.  The BIG ISSUE was ours and two different tables cards were wrong up wrong, mixed up, and delivered to wrong tables. Our credit card went to someone else's table and we found it ourselves. Still not mad at that sweet girl at all for the record. Our tab came out cheaper and we signed it and got out. Forgive us of our sins. What was EXTREMELY CONCERNING is the manager approached my father IN THE BATHROOM and chased him out the front door. My father explained that a transaction was made and there was a signed document, end of story. Argue that with anyone especially when we were on the street walking to our car. What does the manager do? He THREATENED to call the cops! My husband, who paid the tab suggested to the manager that we go inside and talk privately. The manager proceeded to discuss this private matter  in front of customers IN THE PARKING LOT! Legally, we did nothing wrong. Transaction was made between the establishment and our family. Signed document. Off the property. Boom. If he would have came up to us and started with excuse me, we messed up, can we fix this please- would have been the start to a better approach. Chasing my father. Threatening to call the cops. Discussing in front of customers after we left. We could have sorted it out had he not been so aggressive. I was in the service industry for 8 years, he was 1000% out of line. The scenery is pretty nice though. One star fir that."

A person of color definitely did not make the chicken, because if they did it would have been seasoned. Best part of the whole thing was the Dos xx."

Came in with a few friends and sat for about 15 to 20 minutes, after waiting I had told the hostess that we hadn't been helped yet, she then said someone would be out shortly to help us. Waited there about another 10 minutes and still no help. They were not understaffed by any means, in fact there were people standing around doing nothing which was why I was so irritated. I had read the bad reviews and decided to dismiss them and try this place for myself, wouldn't recommend."

It was medium busy, most of the indoor tables were filled up and the bar had a few other people. We sat at bar seating and were helped right away. Being so close to the university, it's a college vibe.   I ordered a chai hot chocolate, it was amazing. Something about hot chocolate on a rainy day.....  We ordered loaded samosas (Vegetable samosas topped with chana masala, curry queso, cilantro walnut chutney and cucumber mint raita) and a sampler trio. We got spicy powder on the side.   Great flavors. We left full and happy. If we lived in the area this would be a regular spot for happy hour."

                "description": "I walked in and made myself \"home\" by taking a seat at a table and waiting 15 minutes to be served on. The two servers walk by my table and didn't make eye contact, as though they had never seen someone with so much melanin before. They continued to serve other seated and even folks coming in for the first time. It was embarrassing. It's 2022 and the last thing I want to assume is that it was because of race. Frustrated, I walked to the bar and asked for a manager. The bartender (Josh) informed me it was the dark hair gal and that is when I was acknowledged. Josh was very nice and served me and took my order.  Josh saved the day, but they need to work on their customer service.   I had their taco and the fries were absolutely delicious! The food blunted my frustration. I will come back because I believe in 2nd chances...and of course the food."

                "description": "We really wanted to like this place.  It has a great casual ambiance and we loved the place when we walked in.    We went on a Sunday, and it wasn't too busy.  There wasa couple with a great dane there, so it's dog friendly.  My bride ordered the samosas, and I ordered the curry trio with saag paneer, butter chicken, and chicken tikka masala.  We got north street fries as a appetizer.  So, the samosas came out nice and warm.  My wife thought the bread was overcooked, but she was hungry.  Perhaps it was old oil on a Sunday evening after a busy weekend.  The fries were warm-ish and a bit soggy.  The seasoning was very good, though, and the basket of fries was a good size for two.  The curry trio was disappointing.  The saffron rice was hard and warm-ish.  I don't know how else to describe it.  The Saag paneer was kind of tasteless.  I've eaten great saag paneer, and this ain't it.  The Chicken tikka masala was similarly underspiced.  The butter chicken as well, but I expect that from butter chicken.  I had ordered it as a counterpoint to what I had hoped would be some spicy dishes.  At this point, I'm wondering if it's us.  I've worked with Indian nationals that have taken me to some hole in the wall Indian places in Irvine, CA, and they absolutely knocked my socks off.  We go to many places in Texas that have a good yelp rating, and we get a lot of bland food.  We really like to patronize smaller places, and I hate to give poor ratings, but have to be honest.  We really liked the people and the place, so will give them a try again in the hopes the stars align for a better experience."

                "description": "I came here to meet a friend for drinks and a light lunch -- we both got appetizers since we were planning heavier dinners later that night -- and when it comes to the food and drinks, I was not disappointed.   I got the vegetable samosas, and the samosas were nearly perfect, with the potato and pea filling having just the right level of seasoning. They came with beautiful mango chutney whose chunks were visible and a lovely green chutney. Both were so delicious I was hard put to decide which I wanted to put on each of the three samosas.  For drinks I had two of the Wasatch Polygamy (a nitro porter), and it was fantastic. It had a hint of sweetness, but wasn't as overwhelming as a milk stout, but also the delicious flavor of a porter.  The patio dining was great, with plenty of shade.  The only reason I'm not giving five stars is that service was... slow, with respect to both drinks and food. Otherwise, the whole thing was outstanding."

                "description": "My mom and I were looking for a new place in San Marcos. We come here often from Kyle and tire of the places right on the interstate. The establishment is adorable - informal seating inside and out.   I first got some pappadum and a few chutneys-tamarind and mint. They were spicy! Caught me off guard but delicious for sure.    My mom ordered the Curry Trio with chicken curry, paneer tikka masala, and saag paneer. I ordered  a beef kabob curry taco. Every bite of every dish was delicious. While I loved my taco, I highly recommend the Curry Trio because you get a great choice.   When we first got there, I was like meh. Only a few tables were seated outside and the inside was empty. But right after we ordered, the place quickly filled up! Wow.   The service was superb. I couldn't have asked for a better server. I'll definitely be back!"

I was very pleased with the variety on the menu and how tasty everything was. My children loved the curry queso, saag paneer, and the paratha.  My husband and I enjoyed our paneer tikka masala tacos (I had chicken).  The Mango lassi was different as it is icy and minty, but we really enjoyed it, and so did my children.  I can't wait to go back! One thing that was also really surprising is that the coffee was super good! Please remember this is a fusion restaurant, so it is not your typical Indian. I noticed a lot of lesser star reviews complained about it not being Indian food. Yet, it is Indian Tacos. It is a fun twist and something different. I highly recommend."

We sat inside it's smaller but very cozy. They have a bar with many draft beers, wine and specialty drinks.  We started with the vegetable samosas and it came with side of mint sauce and mango chutney that was so tasty. Both complimented the samosas in a wonderful way. The flavors were amazing.  I ordered the tiki masala taco that was filled with so much flavor and very filling.       A must try!! And hubby had the trio which he choose tiki masala, curry chicken and butter chicken along with coconut rice. All three were fantastic.  Service was good and food was fantastic and very reasonably priced.  I'm excited to come back and try something new on the menu and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND North Street!! #supportsmallbusiness"

                "description": "Ok. Here comes another Indian restaurant review. But wait! Its TexMex Indian!  Went to lunch with coworkers on the first day of fall, so we got a table outdoors, never stepped foot inside. Service was slow, but it seemed it was only one waiter, so no points taken away for that.  Server was detailed in explaining what everything was and the level of spice and comfort. We had one vegan and one spice sensitive guest in our group, so he pointed out what would be best for the group to order. I ordered chicken nachos, and paneer tacos, wanting spice and meat. Other guests ordered samosas with mango chutney, vegan nachos, and spinach paneer. It was filling enough with a beautiful presentation! The jalapeno cream mixed with tamarind on the tacos mixed perfectly with the Indian spices.  The curry on the shredded chicken and tortilla chips (couldn't tell if they were made in house or store bought) had me trying not to lock the bowl. Will definitely go back to try more items on the menu!"

The building is absolutely adorable and beautifully decorated. Bathrooms are always spotless and the women's bathroom kindly offers hair ties, feminine products and occasionally mints. (It's the little things!!)  They only offer beer or wine cocktails but even the wine cocktails feel and taste pretty craft cocktail-y. The ginger lime spritz is my fave!  Being a self proclaimed queso connoisseur, I was hesitant on curry queso. Why fix what ain't broke? I was wrongly hesitant, North streets curry queso is liquid gold and oh so delicious.   I don't think there's a single bad thing on their menu.  The Katz brothers truly do no wrong"

But seriously, if you're not already in San Marcos, come here. And eat this. It's that good. If you think you're a foodie and haven't tried this, fix that. So incredibly good. And for $9 per taco that's basically a meal and a party in your mouth, it doesn't exactly set you back much. They have a great beer selection too and cool ambiance and attentive service. But the tacos are the draw. Come here. Eat the Indian style tacos. 5 stars."

I was able to get some lavender cider since it was pretty early in the day, but the porter and stout options were very tempting (some at over 12% alcohol).  The dogs were with us so we settled outside in their spacious yard that has a lot of shade and a fan blowing.  We ordered curry fries as an appetizer and they were wedged exactly like chic fil a fries seasoned in a curry mix powder.  These were good, but can do with a pinch of sugar and lots of extra spice.  I had the chicken Tikka masala plate and my husband got the chicken 65 taco.  The taco looked more like a wrap and wasn't as filling as what he expected, but tasted pretty good.  Fried chicken seasoned in sauce inside the taco had a good kick to it.  My chicken Tikka masala plate was delicious, but a little extra spice would help.  Also, I think the restaurant can do better by adding naan! Great concept to check out!"

Really nice place with both indoor and outdoor seating. Bench style seating.   I was able to order everything from my phone after scanning the QR code.   I ordered a chicken bacon ranch which is what I normally get when eating California style pizza. It was very good. Although, everyone else ordered the South Austin and it looked really good, they all loved it, but The salad on a pizza just ain't for me.   I am not from Austin so I don't know what to compare to, but I will definitely be back to try another pizza and definitely the Hazy IPA.   They also have dessert pizza which I brought home and it didn't last 20 minutes."

The beer selection is pretty good and the pizza was yummy (but not blow-your-mind level yummy). I will say my boyfriend's pizza, The Flying Garlic, was amazing and so flavorful  The service was the best part for sure; I felt comfortable and taken care of during my meal. I'll probably try to visit their Parmer Ln location in the future!"

                "description": "Aviator Pizza was solid, not amazing, but okay. We grabbed togo and picked it up on our way home from the gym so we could just collapse and eat some pizza. We got one white pie with arugula on top. It tasted like the greens weren't washed, and they were all wilted and slimy by the time the pizza got home 10 minutes later.   The other pizza was better with a variety of meats and veg on top. But overall the dough felt a little undercooked on both and generally was a bit chewy.   I'd be willing to try this spot again and likely sit down to eat it in person and hope that it's better right out of the oven, maybe it just doesn't travel well? But pizza is a notoriously delivered food item, so I would hope that's not the case.   All in all, i'm not that impressed but willing to give them another go."

                "description": "I thought I would give Aviator a try while in Austin for the weekend since I found good reviews and it was close to my airbnb. I am sad to say I was not impressed. We ordered the Caesar salad which was good. We also ordered a Hawaiian and Ground Control pizza. They were very disappointing. I have to assume that the cheese used on the pizzas is a blend and not just mozzarella since it had a funk to it. I assume provolone. The crust and sauce were not bad but there was way too much sauce. This will also sound like a strange thing to complain about but there were too many toppings. Something can be said about minimal toppings. I don't really care for a pile of toppings on my pizza that are so thick. Overall, I was disappointed in the pizzas given all the good reviews."

The quality has been consistnet and then it wasn't. This last visit, they came up a little short of the runway.  The dough was not cooked all the way and one of the  9 inch pizzas was 7 inches.  Emailed them about the short order about a week ago and have not heard back. I am disappointed and it just makes me wonder about quality control in general.  How could they not notice the pizza was almost 2 inches smaller than ordered or do they just not care? The lack of response indicates the later."

I think this means I should write about pimps and gangsters in purple Cadillacs.   No ... there were no purple Cadillacs here. Sorry! And I was the only one there. But I got me a pizza and a salad (no beer). Then went next door and dropped $300 in a cash game at Shuffle 512 because a Facebook friend/fan sat right next to me and we were having fun and gambling.   If I had gone in to Shuffle 512 first, I might have won. Therefore, theoretically, this was a $300 pizza and salad. I'd leave a woah emoji, but not sure if it will show up on Yelp. I mean, the emoji comes up but I have tried it before and it was just a weird space. And I don't want you to associate me with pimps, gangsters, and weird spaces (purple Cadillac okay).   As far as the pizza goes, traditional bar pizza. Good not great. Salad pretty solid. Atmosphere very good but I was there early so not 100% sure.   Overall, recommended as a feeler to see if it's for you."

I ordered Dem Berries beer and my honey ordered a mic ultra.  The pizza was a-m-a-z-i-n-g!!!!! The bread was out of this world.  The toppings were fresh and had delicious flavors.  The staff were nice however we asked for her to change the TV to the TX/OU game but she kept forgetting.  We asked her again and finally tried to locate it however the cable they had didn't allow the game so we had to watch it on our phone.  We wished they offered nicer plates and flatware; they gave us paper plates and plastic forks but we aren't fancy people so it was all good.  The place was super clean and relaxing.  I would definitely recommend this venue."

Their garlic pizza is one of my favorites, but the cheese burger and south Austin are also solid choice.   We always have to get their mozzarella bread because the cheese/garlic/butter/crust combination makes it one of the best things on the menu.   They have a huge rotating beer selection and plenty of seating if you're wanting to eat there. I've taken pizza to go a few times too and it transports well."

I saw the tip auto generated to $12, so I lowered it due to false information and frustration w the employees. Today my Aviator transaction is $50 for a 12in and 2beers Definitely felt ripped off."

First off the pizza is great and love the beer selection BUT after ordering I used the restroom and there was a crew member that used the restroom at the same time and didn't wash their hands. I brought this up in comments about how they were doing when I had my receipt emailed. It seems whoever answered back did a half ass apology by saying maybe they were washing their hands in a different sink or were intending to wear gloves. I'm sorry but I don't wanna eat at somewhere where a higher up thinks it's appropriate for a worker to use the restroom not wash their hands put on gloves and touch my food."

                "description": "Hahne Estates Winery Tasting Room is located in downtown Johnson City next to the Pecan Street Brewery.  The tasting room has been open for about four months, but owner and winemaker, Gary Hahne, has been making wine for a lifetime.  Gary is a Texas Hill Country Native and his family roots date back to his great grandparents who immigrated to the Stonewall area from Germany.  His parents were close friends to LBJ and Lady Bird. The Hahne surname in German translates to the English word rooster, which ties to the colorful rooster found on the winery's logo.  There is no tasting fee to sample the four dry wines, and one sweet Sangria style wine on the tasting menu.  Each bottle of wine tells a different story of the Hahne family and the surrounding hill country.  As you sip and savor the flavor of the well balanced, delicious, palatable wines. You can walk around the winery and enjoy the historic pictures of the Hahne family, and hear about the family and area history.  I had the great pleasure of being able to talk with Gary himself about his amazing family heritage.  I enjoyed all of the five wines.  My favorite was a bold; well balanced, red blend (Tempranillo, Cab Sauv, and Nero D'Avola) entitled Texas Tapestry.  I also loved the Texas styled Chianti appropriately named Texanti.  This was a softer red, fruit forward, but well balanced with lingering notes.  I also very much enjoyed the dry rose that is named after Gary's grandfather, Opa.  The Viognier blend was also surprisingly good, with interesting peach like notes.   My visit here was delightful, and I hope to return soon.  Gary is passionate about making quality wine to enjoy with us, and to pass down his story to be remembered for years to come."

                "description": "This was my very first winery to attend. I did not have a clue what to expect but whatever it was Mr. Hahne exceeded all my expectations. Mr. Hahne seemed a little rough around the edges until he started spilling out all the beautiful memories him and his family made through the years. We talked about cars, churches, presidents and of course, wine. I couldn't have been anymore impressed with the knowledge he has acquired. Mr. Hahne's winery was clean, filled with old music and had the perfect ambience of the Hill Country. Thank you so much for making my first experience one to remember!"

Owner shares historical tidbits about his family's service to LBJ and seems nostalgic for the \"good ole days\". The good thing is that there is no charge for a tasting, but we'd gladly pay for a better experience."

He welcomes you like family and we listened to all of his great stories. We wanted up staying for two hours and enjoying a bottle of the Texanti, it was difficult to decide which one we enjoyed the best. The wine tastings are at no charge and all five are the best we tasted in the area. We have never gone to a winery and enjoyed every tasting we had, but here we did. We would not only go back but, this would be the sole reason we would visit the area again. Thank you Gary for the wonderful wine and visit. We will definitely see be back soon."

                "description": "If you've never met owner Gary Hahne before, then you're in for a real treat. Besides his wine making history, he always has great stories to tell about the Hill Country and LBJ Ranch.  His family has good history to one of the states famous politicians, Lyndon B. Johnson.  Gary has many tall and true tales that makes a good story telling experience while sipping his wines. You can also view much of his family's history with the Johnsons as can be seen with some unique photographs that are displayed on the wall.  Besides the family history, he has a good selection of wine to try out.  Right now, he's getting his grapes from just about anywhere he can.  In Stonewall, he is planning on planting a vineyard starting with an acre of Nero d'Avola.  This is one of the hot and dry Italian varietals that has a potential to do well in the Hill County's climate.  There are currently five wines available in his new tasting room that opened up back in July.  For the whites, you'll start off with the Blanco.  It's a Viognier blend with nice intense favors.  The Blanco River artwork on the label is quite spectacular.  The Opa is a dry Rose` that is a blend of Riesling, Thurgaw, and Spatburgunder (aka Pinot Noir).  A very nice chilled Rose` to have for those extended summer fall months in Texas.  The label depiction is a pencil drawing version of Gary's grandfather on a horse.  The actually picture is on the wall.  Yes, his \"Opa\" actually did what you see on the label and, of course, there's a good story Gary will tell you about that one as well.  The Texanti is Gary's take on Chianti style wines - good fruit flavors for this Sangiovese blend.  Gary's take on a Bordeaux style wine is called Texas Tapestry.  It's a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Tempranillo, and Nero d'Avola.  It's quite bold, has good tannins, and well balanced.  The addition of Nero d'Avola is his unique take on this classic red blend.  He might be on to something here.  The last wine is Armadillo WH.  The WH stands for World Headquarters.  It's a sweet Cab, but with only 1% residual sugar - quite nice to have in the afternoon.  It's a real treat to have a true local making wine in the Texas Hill Country.  The great and interesting stories Gary tells just adds to that unique experience that you won't find elsewhere.  Stop by his shop along Johnson City's square on your next wine trek thru these parts. You'll have a pleasant time here sipping and chatting with Gary. Enjoy!"

Luckily, it also happens to be right next to this absolute gem of a winery! #winning   Travis, our wine journey guide, was the sweetest, most knowledgeable, and most approachable human being on earth, and we thoroughly enjoyed our Saturday afternoon stop! The bright and airy space, the pitch perfect music, the yummy wine (we had both the Work Horse Red Blend and the Violet Crown Tempranillo. Deliciously dry reds!), and Travis all collaborated to make this a most excellent pit stop!   Thanks, Austin Winery! Thanks, Travis!"

The atmosphere is lively with board games and great decor inside, and a food truck and lots of picnic tables outside for large groups.   However, my group ordered 2 different red wines and 1 sparkling white wine and felt that the wines were lacking in flavor and very watery. Maybe this is how Austin wine is, but if you're looking for deeper, richer flavored wine, I would go somewhere else."

I was not going to get any snacks, but their cheese and charcuterie board was calling my name.  We both got the tasting. Each of us got different wines. Our favs were the Tempranillo, Grenache and spaghetti western. You can get all your wines at once or one at a time. I suggest getting them all at once because staff can get busy.  The cheese and charcuterie board paired well with our wines and it was definitely the perfect snack. Loved the cheese selection. The bread sprinkled with olive oil made my day cause who doesn't love bread They have inside and outside seating available. Parking is onsite, but shared with other businesses."

The menu selection for cheese variations are subpar. We did try some octopus and squid, which was an interesting discussion over some glasses of wine. You can only imagine how these convos went lol! All in all, I highly recommend stopping in for an interesting glass or two. Cheers to more wine!"

The first time we came here, they had a private event going on so that was sad. The second time, we got here a few hours early so they hadn't opened - that's our fault. Finally, our third attempt was fruitful!  The service here is super chill and on top of things. We 2 flights so we got to taste a good variety of samples. Great pours. We ended up leaving w one of their best bottles and now we're saving it for a special occasion.   We got (ranked from 'pour me another' to meh): *Violet Crown *Tempranillo Nuevo *Vermentino *Red-Nat *Picpoul *Piquette - this seems to be a star here but we personally hated it - tasted a bit like dilute pickle juice  A bottle we had before coming to this place was their Hill Country Rosso and that's still my favorite.  As far as COVID safety goes, the tables are super spread out, the staff wears masks at all times, and everything seems clean.   This place is super cool and what seems to be a hidden gem."

The Yard is the location and they have several business including this winery, a distillery, a brewery, and a few other places. The wine was good and the cheese and charcuterie board was a good size. I'd like to give 5 stars, but we had to ask for napkins, no plates given either. It was also a bit messy inside. Not sure if they were re-organizing or what.

During the 'rona, it is recommended to ensure you can get a spot.   My hubby and I did a wine flight a piece. We tried all the reds, the rose, and white wine (Vermentino). We ended up buying a bottle of Malbec to take home which we both had enjoyed. Note, the staff was very knowledgeable and helpful.   I really like the atmosphere of the winery as it is inside a warehouse where they make their own wine and buy their grapes. The winery has a few things to eat or you can buy pizza from Lil Nonna's. The pizza takes awhile but you can always purchase online and set a date. If you are done at the winery you can also bar hope in the area for beer, cocktails, and whiskey."

                "description": "Star service and a non-judgmental space. I dig you, Austin Winery!  We decided on Austin Winery after we had plans to go to Spokesman next door for some beers. Unfortunately, Spokesman had an event going on that looked a little noisy and full for our study date, hence the change in venues. The winery was very spacious and lofty--I love that in an industrial winery! We asked if we could move a table (to plug in to their only one outlet--score!) and do some computer work with their wifi. The gal at the tasting room was fantastically wonderful. She gave us a large smile and told us to do whatever we wanted. Wonderful service alone will get me to come back. That's for sure.  We each got a flight of wine to try, and got down to it until they closed. They have a good selection of whites, rose's and reds, so fret not friends. All is provided. They also have some light bites like cheeses and charcuteries, so you can definitely go with that if you're hungry. The tastings were a little pricey compared to what you might get at a wine tasting out in the vineyards (I used to work in the industry), but you're paying for the convenience of being in South Austin and lots of space to hold conversations, play board games and just be with your groups. They have loads of seating and an upstairs area (that a Bachelorette party was using). Restrooms are clean and wifi is strong. We also walked home with some Brose (a hilarious take on rose especially because it was a women-lead winery effort). Clean, classy and airy space."

                "description": "Not sure why people are giving more stars than this place deserves. If you actually read the peoples' reviews, they really meant to give less stars.   Here's why:  The pizza is just bar pizza. It's nothing special and if I'm being honest, I would have been much happier just going to Costco for pizza   Imagine your pizza covered in melted plastic that has cheese flavor. That's what's the pizza is like; bar pizza. Pizza you'd love to eat when hammered. It tasted like Red Baron.   Let's talk about the cocktails. I can't speak over every cocktail in existence but if they're anything like the margaritas... lol... don't order a cocktail. The margarita here was so bad, I'm sure my husband could make one better with margarita mix and Jose Cuervo. Gross .   I wish I could tell you that our experience here was fluffed with great service... unfortunately, that isn't the case. I understand being understaffed because of the C word, but I watched my waitress, and she was so inefficient, I was very tempted to get up and serve myself. Also, they weren't understaffed. There were plenty of servers for the lack of people that were present. Be prepared to sit for awhile staring at your feet until you can order anything. Be prepared to stay thirsty while you eat. Ask for everything you need from the start, or be prepared to not need it by the time you receive help.   Last but not least, the bathrooms. Those things are important, are they not?  they are to me. I will say, they are definitely public bathrooms. Have you ever been to a really gross gas station bathroom? Ok, then you know what these bathrooms are like. I wonder, does anyone even clean them? Oh well, we will just blame it on the C word this time around. ‍"

This remains a favorite neighborhood hangout and I love the food, the beer and the staff and really love the place.  Pretty sparkling clean, nice patio and if they had some heaters a patio that would be great in December,  January and February too.    The formula here, as with all the bars in this ownership group, is simple and effective: great staff, nice place, decent food, good beer and inexpensive drinks.  No wonder they have outlasted the last 5 occupants of this building!"

                "description": "I've been passing up some awesome food and beers for years.  Don't make the same mistake I did.  I Yelper plead with you!  I also learned two things I've been missing in pizza, too.  I've passed this place dozens of times.  It sits on the fringe of a west Austin neighborhood and several apartments/condos between them and 183.  I believe it is affiliated with a restaurant that has a place in Fort Worth, too, but I might be wrong.  What I'm sure of my first visit there was killer!  I'm planning on going back when I can eat and drink a whole day away!  They have a great outdoor area with plenty of umbrellas and we chose a table.  The server acknowledged us right away.  We QR'd the menu and by the time we'd made a choice of food our beers were on the table and cold (good pour on the Guinness, btw).    We ordered a pizza of our own:  Sausage, mushroom, green peppers and spicy marinara sauce.  Okay, first... You know how some chain pizzas you have the ingredients all coming off together leaving you with less than even a cheese pizza?  Not here.  Every thing is chopped into small pieces and spread evenly over the entire pizza.  Every bite comes with a mouthful of exactly what you ordered.  Second, put some of that marinara on a piece of canvas and I'd eat it.  The spices brought everything together.  We got wings too.  Golden Buffalo.  Perfect heat! Crispy.  Meaty. Those wings were gone so fast I was looking at other tables to see if someone had snatch a couple off our plate LOL  We were licking the hot sauce off the plate.  I'M DOUBLING THE ORDER NEXT TIME!  Great service, cool vibe, good food!  Did I get lucky or find bar food Nirvana?  I dunno.  I'm going to rock a five star and adjust as I need to, but I'm not going to deprive myself of another visit here for sure!!"

                "description": "Fun Neighborhood joint.  This feels like a place where you'd walk in and they'd say, \"Norm!\"...if that were your name and you were on an episode of Cheers.  The beer was deliciously cold served in a thick glass to keep it that way. The pizza was generously embellished with toppings, and the crust was above average. The service was timely and courteous. I really liked the outdoor patio. Part of it is covered with fans, and part was uncovered with tables with umbrellas. The only drawback is there's a lot of road noise. We sat at a table as far away from the road as possible, and it was acceptable noise-wise. When our world health situation is better, I hope to see all the tables filled with large groups of friends enjoying pints and pizzas. For now, come check it out with your close friends and/or significant other."

It was way more laid back then I expected (place is always popping outside!!) which was great, I'm not for the \"pay twice what it's worth because we are fancy pants\".  Everything was very reasonably priced, and freaking delicious! We tried a few of the drinks (I tried a few of the beers) and it's safe to say I left tipsy and happy! Can't wait to visit this place again and try some new pizzas and beer!"

                "description": "My friends like this place, but I don't see the draw. The pizza is mediocre. Fortunately tonight I discovered their sandwiches are good. I got the Pourboy, with Fries. Everyone else in our group who wanted food ended up being in a sandwich mood, so the Chicken Parm sandwich got good reviews from two of the guys. The fries were well-seasoned and looked promising, but were a little cold and soft. Other times I liked the Fried Pickle Chips, but could only eat a few pieces before they got overpowering. It's not like we'd eat that many pickles out of the jar in one sitting! I think the server mixed up my friend's beer order. The final blow to this spot is that their outdoor chairs are wildly uncomfortable. I even brought my own seat cushion the last few times I came! This time it saved my butt, but my back still hurts. I'd give Pour House a 3.5 but I'm in a generous mood so I'm rounding up."

                "description": "At first glance, the interior of Pour House looked a little un-maintained. But, then of course, Austin. Where everything is underground. I was excited about the local beer list, though the stout selection was a bit thin. I went with Redhorn, a coffee stout that was a little short on stoutness for me. But, the flavor was good.  We ordered three 8\" pizzas to share: El Supremo, Hawaiian, and a Veggie pizza, providing plenty for two adults and two children. The pizza was quite good, as in Austin-good. I couldn't put my finger on it, but there was something unique about the flavor.    Our server was very good, personable and informative. We ate a late lunch, during which a growing number of what appeared to be regulars gathered mostly around the bar. The location is a bit secluded from the rest of Austin. But, it's near the technology district, where I was working for the day.  Parking was a little confusing because we approached the building from a side where the entrance wasn't visible. It's a private parking lot with plenty of space. Outdoor seating is available. Highly recommended!"

The environment was chill and not too busy during lunch time so that was a plus for us because we needed to be back for training within the hour.  Three of us ordered the Cubano and it was so tasty! I definitely enjoyed the pickles and pork amongst other fine ingredients they packed on that pizza! One of guys ordered the regular pepperoni pizza and he said he liked it a lot. The crust and dough of the pizza was cooked perfectly thoroughly.  There salads were delicious and portioned perfectly. When you arrive the parking is all in the back area pretty much, and you enter through the patio area. They have signs for you and that guide you to entrance."

(Perfect for pictures)  The bad: didn't have actual entrees only small sides tapa style. With that being said the food was beyond  flavorful and exquisite!  They may be small but did not lack in flavor! The shrimps were big and appetizing. The mushroom pasta with an egg yolk was mouthwatering delectable.  The ugly: due to COVID 19% gratuity is added to all tickets. I feel like this caused our main waitress to overlook our order. Luckily there was a a girl who brought the food who was extremely attentive which made up for it.   Would I still recommend? Absolutely yes, If you don't have a big appetite and are looking for a perfect drink, tasty appetizers and wonder ambience.... You must try P6!"

                "description": "I wish I would have been here for happy hour!  I probably would have tried more drinks/food if I was there during this window of time.  This place is definitely *a vibe*.   The staff were a little sassy though.  If you are in Austin for a girls trip, this place makes sense to add to your itinerary.  Fun fact: It's called P6 because it is an old parking garage.  I had to explain that to the people in my group, so apparently not everyone connects those dots.   Pro tip: Be sure to make your reservations well in advance. We were stuck with a 9pm seating time (on a random Wednesday night) and let me tell you it gets CHILLY up there on a March night."

                "description": "We got here on a Sunday afternoon, around 1:30pm.  We were quickly seated outside on a high table.  We would have prefered the lower ones, which looked way more comfortable but were told those were for larger groups, even though some were still open the entire time we were there.  We scanned the code to see the menu and waited and waited (we almost left) for our server to finally arrive to take our order.   The drinks came out looking pretty, nice presentation, but flavor wasn't great.  We looked at the menu again to see if there was something else we might like but debated having to wait again to be served.  Instead, we drank what we got, enjoyed the lake view, and people watching, and when our server finally came around again we asked for our check.  Cute \"rooftop\" but not on my list to go back to."

                "description": "GREAT ambiance, but food was incredibly mid.  P6 has great vibes and is a fun place to get drinks, however, it just didn't live up to the hype. The view itself isn't as great as advertised, as the balcony overlooks the roof of the LINE hotel and doesn't have the view of the downtown skyline. The drinks were just OK, and the food just didn't taste as good as it looked. The menu options are extremely limited as well.  If I came here again, I would come just to get drinks and get food elsewhere."

                "description": "P6 is an ideal place to take out of towners! It's got a sweeping view of ladybird lake and great for sunsets.  Happy hour is 3-6pm which features a couple of food items marked down $2-3. Glass of red wine is $6. Their regular dinner menu is tapas-style, but full entree prices! Specialty cocktails range $13-16. If you're looking to get full, expect to pay $40-60 per person. Food is average for what you pay for.   Parking- the hotel offers $10 for 3 hour valudation. You can chance street parking which runs $2 per hour. The Mexican American Cultural Center has a moderately sized lot and is a 10 min walk away.   Beware of an automatic 19% gratuity added on, no matter your party size."

                "description": "We came here as soon as the restaurant opened because we knew it would be packed. This place has such beautiful decor and is on the rooftop/patio, so there is a beautiful backdrop of Lady Bird Lake. You will definitely be taking tons of photos here.  We made reservations just in case, but we pretty much had the whole restaurant to ourselves for the first hour P6 was opened. Everything looked delicious, so we ordered quite a bit:  Vegetable Frittata: This was perfect for a light meal. Lots of veggies and the eggs and butter lettuce was perfect.  Shrimp and Grits: Soooo bomb. Every bit of this tasted great. Just wished they would have removed the shrimp tails as most other places do.  Patatas Bravas: The potatoes were great for a side/appetizer.  Sourdough Garlic Bread: I love a good garlic bread, and this totally delivered. And I like that fact that it was pull-apart bread.   Everything tasted amazing and we really enjoyed our time brunching here."

But we convinced our way out to the patio early in the night which was better (but a little chilly). Why would we want to come to a rooftop bar if we can't be outside, ya know?!  The servers were nice - we had multiple throughout the night. They occasionally came and checked on us. The place was packed on a Friday night.  We all had a lot of fun here and the drinks just kept coming! They were tasty and swanky.  There weren't many parking options other than valet that I saw but I can't remember how much that was. We had to walk through the hotel to get to the rooftop. The hotel looked very nice with mood lighting and modern decor touches.  Overall though, P6 was great - moody and fun!"

                "description": "Visited P6 for happy hour with a friend while visiting Austin and had a good time! We arrived when they were just opening, and luckily we had a reservation - it filled up really quickly after a bit. The space has a great vibe and a great view - even though it's not on the roof, the space offers a lovely view of the city and river and the open concept of the bar makes for a perfect environment to relax and enjoy some sunshine. The space is filled with countless plants and pink decor, which I truly appreciated - it felt quite posh and eclectic yet incredibly put together at the same time.   For drinks, I opted for the ladybird spritz, perfect for a refreshing afternoon cocktail. Featuring rhubarb, aperol, and cava, it was light yet flavorful, really being able to taste the rhubarb throughout the entire drink. Quite good! My friend went for the sundown cobbler, which she also really enjoyed. Since it was happy hour, we snagged some food too. We both split the pita bread with chimichurri and the hummus. We were given a bunch of pita bread, which was much appreciated! The pita was good, but not the best I've ever had (a little dense for my liking). The chimchurri was OK - the ratio of oil to spices was a bit off so it felt like it was swimming in oil. The hummus was quite nice and featured a nice touch of cashews and chili oil. I appreciated the inclusion of various veggies in addition to the pita for a change of pace! The hummus overall was good, but again, not the best I've ever had, but still filling and delicious and balanced our drinks well. While the prices of the cocktails were quite discounted from normal, they were still a bit steep, but to be expected when you consider the ambience of the place.   Overall, we enjoyed our HH at P6! I really enjoyed by spritz and the hummus / chimichurri was a nice balance. The prices are a bit elevated, but to be expected in relation to the space. If you're looking for a nice HH spot for visitors to Austin, I would definitely suggest P6!"

                "description": "Rating: 3.5 stars  My friend and I decided to stop here for brunch on Sunday. We didn't make a reservation ahead of time but were able to be seated right away indoors. (If you are interested in sitting outdoors - we were told reservations book out 1 week in advance so make sure to plan accordingly)  Even though the indoor space did not have the same ambience as outdoors it was still very nice and well decorated.   Service was very friendly and efficient.  For our brunch we decided to order:  --PATATAS BRAVAS: Well fried with a great flavor. Definitely a great brunch item to order! My only complaint would be they didn't really give us many potatoes since the portion covered less than half of the bowl it came in.   --FRITTATA: Ours was a veggie frittata that was filled with flavor and topped with a great tomato based purée. It did come with a giant handful of lightly coated romaine lettuce which seemed a bit mismatched. Additionally the portion of the frittata was slightly too small for the price.   --PICKLED PEARL ONION HUMMUS: Really good portion of food. The hummus is just bursting in flavor. There was also a ton of bread and veggies it comes with to dip into the hummus. Definitely a solid order!   All in all, a nice brunch option for the weekend if you are staying at The Line."

The cute, Instagrammy interior is only topped by the incredible backdrop of the balcony view over the river. We got a shady table by the edge and kicked back with a rosé and carpaccio. The plating of the carpaccio was gorgeous, and it had a beautiful mix of salty and fresh flavors. The pita chips that came with it were perfectly crispy too!  This was the best view we were able to get while in Austin, and can't wait to come back! But next time - we'll make it in time for their amazing happy hour deals."

                "description": "Really enjoyed brunch the other day here on their patio that overlooks Ladybird Lake. Had a reservation for 6 and the hostess was able to accommodate my request of sitting outside, which I really appreciated. The ambiance is very pretty and totally Instagram worthy with their pink overhangs and colorful couches/decor. They also had semi-large fans for each outdoor table which was much needed in this Texas heat.   The food was really delicious and not too overly priced. For brunch, most of the plates were pretty small so, if you're hungry I would recommend ordering 1-3 plates and sharing if you have the ability to do so. We tried the Greek Yogurt Parfait, Patatas Bravas and Hummus and it was all sooo good! Will definitely be returning here."

We came during happy hour, which is literally one hour, 4-5pm, and I ordered the Sundowncobbler and Homemade Pita bread. Im not a huge drinker, but I really enjoyed my drink and loved that there was fruit in it. The pita bread was incredible! I loved how soft and warm the pita was. It was perfect with the chimichurri.  Parking- You can park in the garage for the hotel, but they only validate for the first hour I believe, which is only $5. Luckily we found street parking next to the garage which isn't nearly as expensive.  Payment- I actually really loved that you paid online! It makes it very easy to split the check amongst friends without bothering the servers!"

                "description": "Views are excellent... IF you even get a table anywhere near them. This restaurant is poorly executed in my opinion. They have beautiful views of the river but there is no guarantee that you will even be able to see it from your table (even with reservations) and yet you're still paying \"fancy view prices\".   My experience: - Arrived at The Line Hotel (which is way cool btw) to find that there are no signs on how to get to P6.  - The elevator is super sketchy and in the back corner without any airflow at all (seemed like an afterthought or service elevator). - Originally was sat at a \"table\" (their seating are little vignettes of couches/patio furniture that is NOT comfortable AT ALL and really impractical to eat at) nowhere near the view. The tiny view that we did have was completely obstructed by a shade they rolled down. - We asked to be moved to a \"table\" with a view and were finally re-seated but still had a difficult time seeing the view as we were further back at a SUPER low to the ground vignette.  - The staff was friendly but the drinks and the menu items were overrated. - Stayed for an hour and a half, took some pictures, and went somewhere else to eat more food.  My order: - Sundown Cobbler cocktail - Yummy, but tasted mostly like sprite. - Paper Plane cocktail - Yummy, smooth, easy drinker. - Whipped ricotta - Way more food than we expected but the olives and the nuts were better than the ricotta. It lacked a lot of flavor and mostly just helped to fill me up.  Long story short - NOT worth the hype."

And I was a little \"hangey\" having to wait a half hour to be seated. But it was worth it. The waiter checked back with us every few minutes (mandatory for a good restaurant). And our order was delivered hot and fresh in a reasonable amount of time (a little slow because they were very busy - but in a reasonable amount of time).  We had chips and queso as an appetizer. The chips were the thick, homemade type. And the queso was their own recipe with ancho cili drizzle, crema, some sort of pico de gallo, etc. Really good - exceptional.  I had a chicken sandwich. It had a lot going on (in a good way). It was not just a run of the mill chicken sandwich. And the sidewinder fries are fresh and homemade.   My wife had the watermelon, which she also said was really good.  Overall, some creative foods that were well executed, and on point service  Definitely give this place a try."

She is amazing at referring a menu item or drink. All of the staff are pleasant and the vibe is definitely upbeat and happy. They are inclusive and go above and beyond to make sure each guest has a pleasant experience. I hade a Hell or High Water cocktail followed by a Pineapple Express. The drinks are fairly priced and worth the price. For food I had a Wrangler Patty Melt that knocked my socks off. I did substitute the Texas Toast for a regular toasted bun. The Jalapeño mousse gives me all of the feels and the carmelized onion gave the burger a sweet smokey taste. I'm not a french fry fan so I opted for the Mesquite-Sriracha Tater Tots. All I can say is ORDER THE TOTS! Even the side house salad was delicious. They toss the salad in a sweet and tangy dressing that's just enough. I love that this place is so close to home and does takeout. I will become a regular!"

I asked for a menu and a beer. The bar tender let me sample one of the beers on tap. I liked it so I ordered one to drink. I also ordered a patty melt with tater tots. The burger was think and made to order. I had to cut the burger because I did not want a big mess from trying to get a bite into my mouth. The burger was juicy since I ordered it medium and very tasty. I can say it filled me up. The beer was cold, nothing better than a cold beer, well almost nothing.  The atmosphere was as most sports bars are, a little noisy but people seems to know each other and they were friendly. The bartenders were busy but kept getting those drinks. The servers were also busy taking food and refilling cups of the patrons. There is outdoor seating but it was one of those HOT Days so I was glad I was inside. The parking is decent but they share with several other businesses. It was not too far away from the entrance so no need to wear the sneakers unless you want to.  Thank you Republic Kitchen + Bar for being a good neighbor and giving us another option to dine in Leander, Texas."

The Kids corn dog was tasty. The chicken steak dish was devoured, as was the watermelon salad.  All in all it was a good afternoon lunch."

The kids had chicken strips and mac n cheese. The beers were good and cold. I love how they bring the beer in icy glasses.   We chose to sit outside but soon discovered the flies were way too many to be able to eat in peace. We couldn't stop waving our hands or the flies would land on the food. I'll go back, but sit inside next time."

                "description": "Decided to try a new place tonight, and glad we did! I had the patty melt, it was good. The only complaint I have about it is that they put the bread on the grill to get grill marks, but all I tasted was burnt toast. They do the top if the burger bun the same but it's not as grill marked. So next time I will ask for them not to do that, I hate black charred burnt toast. My husbands burger was good as well and both the tots and fries were tasty and perfect portion. They have a big bar with a good variety. I had a Hell or High Water to drink, and will definitely order that again. Delish! And last but def not least the service was great! Our server Kelsey was attentive and very sweet. Definitely looking forward to the next visit...word is they have a good weekend brunch, so we'll be checking that out."

                "description": "The chicken fried steak needs seasoning. It was missing some salt and the sauce over it was so much it took off the breading. But the mash and veggies had great flavor and tasted good!  Texas Smash is good if you like a honey whiskey, I don't.  But the old fashion was just how I like it!  Overall good place to try, the service was good. They have tvs on but I'd recommend that they put subtitles on all of them so since we can't hear them we can at least read and know what is going on."

                "description": "Ordered the chicken sandwich and honestly it was great until I got to the bottom of the second piece of chicken and it was completely raw. I almost threw up because I was worried how much raw chicken I had eaten. I wish I would've take a picture but I got so grossed out I tossed it immediately. I understand sometimes cooks can be rushed and I'm sure this rarely ever happens. Everything else was great but I couldn't get over the meat being raw."

All of the drinks I've tried are solid and they have a great beer and wine selection. Republic is a great option for anyone in the Leander area looking for a nice, trendy restaurant without driving all the way in to Austin. They also have a solid kids menu. We'll definitely be back."

                "description": "The atmosphere here is great. Everything seemed good at the start. Then we went to order food. Out of steak. Out of salmon. Out of wings. Out of shrimp. Out of some Cabernets. They were out of everything we went to order. The server could not have been more kind and sweet. She said it was because they run out of a lot of things on Saturday nights so Sundays they're just out. Well, I did a quick review of the comments on this restaurant and this is apparently a running theme. 1. Shame on me for not checking the comments before we came, 2. Shame on them for not resolving this clearly on-going issue. I know times are tough, but just close on Sunday nights if you cannot have more product delivered. We finished our drinks and left without ordering dinner at all."

A brownie on top of graham cracker crumbs topped with a toasted marshmallow.

                "description": "I didn't love this place. I totally understand that with COVID, many restaurants have had to cut back their menus.   With that being said, it seemed like breakfast-y food definitely prevailed during our Sunday afternoon visit. Seeing that they do a Sunday brunch, I get it, but always pictured that included a few other options not focused around eggs or waffles.   My husband ended up ordering their burger (which isn't even obviously advertised as a burger), and said it wasn't anything to write home about. My mother-in-law had their chicken sandwich and seemed to be okay with it. Not much fanfare from my husband's stepfather or his girls.  I ended up ordering the chili and didn't have any major complaints. I would've loved to see more in the \"siesta\" part of the menu that wasn't a salad.   My other complaint was the noise. The music was so loud that we could barely hear each other across the table, which pretty much awkwardly split our party in half. At first, we tried to get past it by borderline yelling, but that got old.   In between waiting for condiments, I asked our waitress if there was any way to knock the volume down by a click or two. She mentioned that she would see what she could do, but that it wasn't guaranteed since \"people pay for it\". My brother in law ended up seeing the jukebox in the corner, and while that's fantastic, I don't think it's too much to ask to keep music at a reasonable level in a place where you'd expect your guests to socialize at their table."

Tasted said salad and immediately my mouth was on fire. Asked waitress to verify if it was ranch and she says... \"oh we don't have regular ranch, just a spicy one...\" that would've been nice to know. I CANT EAT SPICY FOOD!! She proceeded to suggest I use another dressing to bring down the heat. Word of advice to owner... put the dressing on the side. I was sick all day from this incident.   Partner got French toast and it was amazing. Sadly we won't be back.."

                "description": "This was one of the worst experiences we've had in a restaurant in a long time.  The server was rude, the manager condescending (strangely, I don't remember him being so rude at Texican) and the place was dirty.  The table was sticky, and they knew it, even said there was nothing they could do about it because it was \"resin\"...it wasn't.  We ordered four entrees, and they came out in stages. The first ones to hit the table were cold.  The third followed five minutes later, and mine didn't show up for another five minutes, at which time I told them to just keep it.  The \"hash\" was runny and not at all hash, the scrambled eggs cold, bacon underdone, and no condiments available; when we asked for them, they acted like it was an imposition.    $92 worth of bad food and crap service.  Very disappointing considering the executive chef was wearing a Fox Hole chef's coat, and Fox Hole is one of my favorite places in this area; I assumed from the get it would be extraordinary after seeing that...I guess not.  Oh, and word of caution, when the server handed my fiancé the mobile payment device, she selected the 20% tip option.  Make sure you watch out for that...there is no signage indicating there is an automatic gratuity so the servers have NO business choosing their own tip amount.  Update: while we were out of town, we discovered my fiancé's debit card had been hacked.  Oddly, the odd charges started AFTER using the mobile payment device, which was WiFi powered.  I cannot stress this enough...BEWARE!"

Beautiful interior and Japanese-style seating benches where you can take your shoes off too. I love how the inside is an experience and contributes to the calming atmosphere. Outside picnic tables and high top tables out in the sun. Busy place usually but quick service and everything tastes amazing. Great location in The Yard.

As soon as we walked in here, I was drawn to the huge mural and the Japanese-style seating. I love that they have flights to really give you a chance to try some different flavors. Ordering at the bar was easy, and the bartender explained things well and gave us good explanations. We even purchased some snacks to eat with our sake. Although I probably won't choose this place as a destination in itself, I hope to be back when I am over in this complex (which has so much to offer!)."

                "description": "This review is for 3.5 stars.   As far as a unique experience goes, Texas Sake Co hits the marks. Random Japanese centric spot in the middle of the Yard. Sumo on tv, umbrellas hanging from the ceiling, and sake galore. Nice outdoor seating area out front adds an Austin flare.   But the sake was just not good. Ordered the flight and only finished 1 of the 4 5oz pours. About $20 for high quantity, but there was so much oak and smokiness that it didn't resemble any type of sake I've had in my life. The cloudy unfiltered sake with yuzu on special for the day was edible but the rest were actually off. And on top of that, the booths are just impossible to get in and out of. Supposed to be the old school Asian variety but they're not built for people with long legs and there's zero room to scooch in.   Experience was fine and love the vibe of the Yard, but just couldn't get down with the drinks or seating."

                "description": "This place was cool and located in an area that seemed like it had lots of potential. I realized though that I do not like sake. My hubby and I shared a small flight and honestly couldn't finish them because we just did jot like the flavor. Also, it was quite warm in the space which made it a bit uncomfortable to stay for a long time. Basically given it 4 stars for the experience."

                "description": "Very relaxed setting with plenty of different sakes to pick from. The bartender was friendly and informative. He gave us great information about each sake and even talked about his fave. It was a bit warm inside, but it was tolerable. They had a front outside area with a few games to play and misters to keep cool. I can not forget to tell y'all they have snacks as well. Chocolate cookie pandas that were delicious and I took home some dried up edamame that I want to go back for more lol   They also sell their sake to take home any of your faves you tried and they are also very reasonably priced."

                "description": "A small batch sake distillery in Texas?!?!?  YES!  I really wanted to like this spot, but our visit was just OK. The staff didn't know where their rice was sourced and seemed disorganized.  Surprisingly, there are rice farmers in Texas along the lower Colorado river (https://stateimpact.npr.org/texas/tag/texas-rice-farming/).  They started farming rice in the 19th century.  Unfortunately, no one was knowledgeable enough to confirm or deny the rice's source.    The spot is hard to find. Just drive to the back of all the strip mall (behind Book Women), and you will finally get there.  There is plenty of parking available.  The tasting room is small, dingy, and dark.  You can peer into the production facility in the back of the tasting room.  There are only a couple of seats around the tasting room bar, and some standing tables.  Thankfully there was a makeshift outdoor seating area in the parking lot area with tents and picnic tables.  You can select from a tasting flight, Sake cocktails, or a shot glass size of their sake.  Bottle purchase are also possible.  We tried their clear, and milky white sake. It came with a bowl of pretzels. The clear sake was OK.  The milky white sake was unique, and actually better than the first.  But, both were subpar to other sakes that I have had.    We were supposed to take a tour. They offer tours at 7pm, 8pm, and 9pm on Friday and Saturday.  We showed up in time to attend the 7pm, but as it got closer to 8pm, we asked about the tour.  There is only so long you can nurse an OK glass of sake. They said it would happen in 3 minutes.  By the time 8:16m rolled around we peaced out.    The one thing that we learned was that the ownership had changed a couple of years before, and it was now being run by the same people who own StrangeLand Brewery.  Wonder how that changed the experience and quality.  Was surprised to see this place rated so highly."

                "description": "This place was awesome!  I'm an out of towner and I've never had too much sake aside from ordering a \"hot sake\" from sushi restaurants, which I've always enjoyed.  When I heard about this place, I couldn't wait to try.  We got there at dark, and it looked unassuming aside from some lights hanging overhead, a few picnic tables, and a cornhole set up, and even the inside isn't too different from what you'd expect from a basic distillery.  I ordered the sample flight of sake so I could try a bunch of different things and actually learn something about sake while I was there.  The staff that was working was super friendly and great about answering any questions we had.  When he brought out the flights, he explained what each one was like and what to expect from it.  Despite my five star review, I didn't like all of the sake on the flight, but the point was to try a bunch of different types!  The sample flight came with four different types of sake - Junmai, Nigori, Nama, and Oak.  My two favorites were the Junmai and the Nigori, with the Junmai being most similar to the basic \"hot sake\" I'd always had before and the Nigori being a really smooth sake.  The Nama, in my opinion, was really strong, so it wasn't really for my tastes.  The Oak also felt a bit strong, but it was tempered by the oak-y taste that came with it.  We were also offered a taste of their Blood Orange CBD infused sake, which had really intrigued me.  It didn't taste like I had expected any sake to taste like, but I really enjoyed it!  I would definitely love to come back the next time I'm in town and try the tour to learn even more!"

It is definitely a unique experience in Texas and worth the adventure.  We did the groupons but didn't get souvenir glasses. But then again, we didn't ask.  They did have some flavored ones- this one was coconut sake.  Bitter at first sip, nutty on the back."

                "description": "This was my first time coming here.  I was so excited as I've not heard of any sake places anywhere I have lived.  I approached the bar and the bartender came up to me.  I told him that it was my first time here and what should I do - order at the bar, sit at table, wait to be seated, etc....  His reply, \"Buy sake\".  That was rude to me.  I ordered a flight and sat down annoyed.  Then, the sake.  It was VERY watered down.  I did not taste well.  Great space but that's all it's got going for it."

                "description": "Brunch/breakfast at Better Half Coffee and Cocktails was fun!  It's a relaxed, family/dog friendly environment with counter service, with a huge patio that's connected to the brewery next door.    We arrived a little after 9am and only had to wait in line for about five minutes.  The food was great--here's what we tried: -Cauliflower tots: A fun, savory treat that's exactly what it sounds like.  It actually reminds me of cauliflower gnocchi from Trader Joes, but more fried.  Good appetizer -French toast: Delicious, and I'd say that it's more like bread pudding because it's super moist and is drenched (in a good way) with whatever sweet batter.   -Chicken biscuit: A perfect little breakfast entree, and I liked the salsa that came with the fried chicken and biscuit."

                "description": "Went there for an early morning brunch. Food was not great. Everything was brown: brown donut holes, brown french toast, brown crumbles, brown cauliflower tots. Nothing felt fresh or bright unless it was a salad. I mean, they could add strawberries or blueberries to those dishes I mentioned as they were overly rich. Everything was super sweet. Some fresh creme or custard to lighten up the sweetness would help. The dipping sauce for the donut holes was like dipping into caramel. It was not needed at all unless you have a 4 year old sugar freak with you. My friend was in the mood for a cheesecake and they were out of it along with other desserts on the menu except for (brown) cookies. I have no idea how this place is so popular. It does have a nice backyard and their brewery neighbor (Holdout) is a fun so you have that option if you're in the area. I would recommend getting their food. For people watching I'm not sure why there were some with travel bags. I wouldn't make the place the first or last stop if I was visiting Austin. There are plenty of options.  I understand the whole staffing issue and people there look glazed. I think management either needs to hire more people to help or give these people some sort of morale boost. They just were not friendly or give off positive vibes. They were just zombies running food to your table.  I don't write negative reviews to stop people from going but want management know they need to adjust some things to make it a better experience."

It's a danish stuffed with pork and cheese with shredded coconut on top. A yummy mouthful of savory sweet and saltiness. A must get if youre there in the morning!! I knocked a few stars off because of 2 things.  First the hit or miss service. The staff were either friendly or would act as if you were bothering them. The other is because I bought a tshirt which I saw on their website for $25. When I checked my receipt I was charged $30.  Granted I should have asked the price but didnt see any reason why it would cost more in person. Overall if in that  Austin neighborhood again I would go back ."

They said that the food would take 45 minutes to an hour, it came out in 5-10 minutes! Super fast. Good queso. Great breakfast sandwich - very messy to eat, expect to get your fingers dirty. Salad was okay, large portion size was good, sweet potato chunks were too large for a salad. Cold brew was not good, recommend getting a different coffee drink. I would definitely come back because it was a chill spot with good food and cheap prices.   Pros: good food, affordable   Cons: no tvs on patio, cold brew wasn't good"

                "description": "Wonderful, flavorful brunch spot. We went very early about 8:30am and it was perfect. We sat outside at a table as we visited last year. Very empty that early and everything still in stock! I enjoy that they have a more limited menu because they focus on every dish being a homerun. Quality food and drinks!  This place(and the brewery) get extremely busy so I recommend a reservation or going earlier instead of peak brunch times. Very pet and kid friendly. We didn't see our server much, but luckily we didn't need much and she was great when we did need her.   Softest cake donut I've ever had and a rich chocolate taste almost more of a dessert than brunch but that's right up my alley! Menu seems to change quite a bit by the season, so I can't wait to try more different plates. We'll definitely be back with friends and family visiting."

They had homemade syrups which I love- I think they taste less gummy and more natural. My mom and I both got the breakfast sandwich, the English muffin definitely tastes homemade too! And we got a salad- great quality and fresh ingredients. We also got their chocolate chip cookie- it was so chocolate and gooey  theres an inside and outdoor space plus a brewery next door. The. Chef does the better half for breakfast and lunch then hops over to do the brewery's food in the evening. Overall a cute, quality spot! Also pretty quick- so you can't beat that!"

Better Half has ample outdoor seating (and cute pink picnic tables!). I loved their lemonade and cauliflower tots - they were the star of the show. Otherwise, I didn't feel like the food justified the extremely long wait, I would say their menu is pretty on par with other brunch places in the area - it was nothing too special.   I did have a great time here am willing to give them another try at an off peak time! The indoor area was super trendy and ccozy"

The folks at Better Half had a nice and cozy building then a worldwide pandemic hit that required you to avoid that.exact.environment.  And they rolled with it.   On several occasions, we used their pickup and it was great. They were efficient, considerate (all the utensils and napkins) and the food was always good considering we would eat it while parked at Zilker.  Well, we finally decided to eat there this time. They have an awesome covered...tent or something, that fits up to 60 folks. They even had a heater blowing in that thing!!  And the food, whew. The grilled halloumi plate was so creative, we loved the mix of flavors. The spicy chicken sandwich was different than at other places, in a good way. I left trying to place all the flavors and can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu.  A cool bonus is the view from the parking lot. I was able to take a quick picture."

                "description": "We walked down to this restaurant recently because we were craving a burger, a beer, and a safe place to enjoy them during the pandemic. Better Half has added a ton of outdoor dining areas and some are even under a tent.   The burger? It was just okay. Kind of small. A bit overdone, a bit dry for me, but then I have high expectations. The fries were crispy and salty and hit the spot.  The Hold Out Brewing beer was lovely, too.   The surroundings? They were outside, so perhaps harder to maintain but the table was sticky and when I got home there were dirt marks on my pants from where I sat on the outside bench.  It was too bad because it is so convenient, but perhaps we will give it another try in a month or two. Maybe it is a better breakfast choice"

The portion was smaller than expected but the food was really good - the had browns were crispy and the Parmesan with the sunny side up egg paired really well with their gravy.

                "description": "This is truly one of the most enjoyable meals I've had in a while. We went on Labor Day so it was quite busy and took probably a good 40 minutes to get our food, but it was absolutely worth every minute of the wait.  The Pastrami Sandwich had the best, smokiest pastrami I've ever had and everything from the mushrooms to the bread to the berbere horseradish sauce was just so well executed and damn delicious.   The Big Springy salad was a nice healthier contrast that still tasted interested and decadent (okaay, we added fried chicken, that might not be the healthiest). It was a little light on the cojita-chimichurri dressing so we got some more, and I just wanted to jello shot that condiment cup straight into my mouth it was so good.  I started off with the chagacinno and while it was a tad sweet for my preference, it was still absolutely delicious as well."

Shout out to my guy, Dylan, the coffee program manager for my latte.  It was slammin, just like he used to make em in HOU.  For eats, I got a biscuit with avo and the cauli tots- like the cauliflower, not the beet ketchup, but I'm not a beet girl.  Great space.  Great color scape.  Plenty outdoor seating to spread out and catch up with ur folk.  I'll be back."

I absolutely love the backyard patio vibes - seems like a very chill spot to just hang out and chat.  I don't really recommend coming here to study or do work as this place can get quite rowdy. The same owners also opened a brewery right next doors called Hold Out Brewing, so you can slowly transition from productivity to drunken stupor if that's your thing."

Food was pretty good, even if you did have to order things a la carte (burgers/sandwiches had no sides). The cauliflower tots were delicious.

                "description": "Better Half Coffee and Cocktails belongs in the book of Austin AF restaurants. What does that even mean? Innovative menu using fresh ingredients with high prices.   Our table of 3 split the entrees and shared as easy apps to get the full experience of the brunch AND lunch menu. For brunch, we ordered the Waffle Iron Hashbrown, which was literally a plate of overcooked hashbrowns, topped with coffee and cream gravy, cotija cheese, an egg, pickled onions and scallions. Sadly, this was just basic to me (or as Gen Z calls it Cheugy). Nothing that I would die for...  For lunch, we ordered the Vermicelli Salad, the Chilled Ramen, and a side of the Cauliflower Tots. I could not get enough of the Vermicelli Salad and strangely the Cauliflower Tots! The Vermicelli Salad was refreshing and light, and I enjoyed the Pineapple \"Fish\" Sauce substitute they use to make this dish vegan friendly!! The Cauliflowers admittedly looked like burnt bite-sized toast when it arrived, but as soon as I dipped it in the beet ketchup, I couldn't put my fork down.   BEWARE! If you order any of the Frozen Sloppee Frozen Cocktails, this thing will mess you up (in the best form possible). I would advise ordering with caution! The Spicy Peach'arita was my poison of choice, and though delicious, if you add Texas heat, it will melt fast and have you only tasting tequila!"

This past time I went I got the Halibut - it was buttery, flakey, cooked to perfection. I could have gone without the tomato it came with and would have preferred different garnish. My boyfriend got the pasta dish that has lobster in it (I forget the name) but let me tell you...it's to die for! Best thing by far on the menu. My only complaint is that they only offer it limited times of the year. Perla's is so cute. Their patio is first come first serve. I made a reservation so we were seated inside. I wish if you had a reservation they gave you the option to sit outside. Definitely a great date night place. Be ready to spend some money, it isn't cheap, but the quality is 10/10.  Pros: food and atmosphere   Cons: expensive"

                "description": "Food was decent, but the parking situation ruined our experience and we likely won't return as a result.   There is a parking garage behind Perlas where they supposedly validate your parking. Apparently there is a new system in place in the parking garage that requires you to scan a QR code to pay for parking then somehow you get it validated at the restaurant. However, when you pull into the garage there is no QR code. So I walked to the restaurant to ask how to validate parking. They gave me the QR code but I had to have my license plate. So I had to walk back to my truck to get license plate. By the time I got back to my truck there was already a parking ticket on my truck!   I reached out to the manger of this parking garage, Travis, to explain the situation, but he refused to waive the parking ticket even though I showed him a copy of my receipt from Perlas which proves that my parking should have been free not to mention the confusing process."

We got there an hour before our appt and host was very accommodating and sat us early. Not to mention we had our 4 month old in a stroller. We took the option to sit outside because the weather was great and they have an awesome patio. The waiter was very nice and very knowledgeable on the whole food menu and drinks. We wanted get something light since we have been eating so heavy on our vaca.   We split 3 dishes a ceviche, the lobster bisque and the wedge salad. All the 3 were very light, tasty and delicious!! It was exactly what we were looking for.   I would absolutely recommend this place!"

We went for lunch and had the Ahi tuna tostada, calamari and grilled mahi sandwich. The best thing we ate hands down was the tostada. The tuna was like sashimi and it was packed with flavor from the aioli and topped with Serrano. Absolutely delicious! Our other two dishes were good, not great. The mahi sandwich was a bit of a disappointment, especially given it came highly recommended from our server. I felt like it lacked season and was very bland. Regardless I am intrigued and would like to return for dinner some time."

Jacob, my server, was incredible and every dish he recommended was beyond amazing! It was totally worth the flight. This is huge for me because customer service in my opinion, has declined drastically, so when I rave about an experience such as Perla's, it's #facts! This evening I enjoyed some glasses of Chenin Blanc, from South Africa, some delicious oysters (Jacob chose all of them), fried okra, crab cake and the famous potato crusted sea bass and a sea salt dessert! Thanks Perla's for the amazing experience! Thanks for the warm welcome from the staff outside and the lovely hostesses inside. I'll certainly be back and cannot wait! Be safe. Be blessed. Be kind and enjoy good food! Perla's"

                "description": "Been waiting a while to go here, and finally got to make it while it was still nice out; We thought there was supposed to be a happy hour, but it turns out/doesn't seem like there is one anymore unfortunately.  Naturally, we got a few appetizers, oyster shooters and oysters, plus the octopus that came with a savory sauce and potatoes. I'm not a fan of bloody mary's so the shooter wasn't my favorite since that's how they were prepared, and kind of spendy at that. The oysters were a small bit still good; again,  no happy hour pricing.  The octopus was my favorite, grilled perfectly, same as the potatoes, covered in herbs and a butter/mayo sauce that paired nicely.   We both got fish, mine had a bit of spice to it, and the ahi was very nice and fresh; Overall, pleasant meal, more expensive than we would've liked but glad to have tried it. Personally, I think it's better to just get some appetizers/drinks and save the entree for somewhere else; while it's definitely good, I think it's overpriced and could make something comparable for a fraction of the cost."

                "description": "Service was professional and prompt. The server, Donovan, was quite excellent at providing suggestions and information without need to go back and consult a chef or manager. What this says is that the restaurant (and chef) ensure the employees taste what they serve so they can provide info to diners. This is one mark of excellence.   The setting is beautiful. Since it was a pleasant autumn day, we opted for outdoor dining and enjoyed our decision. It's hard to write about the vibe but this is closer to a low-key fine dining. It isn't fancy but the food and service make it close.   We had grilled (or broiled) oysters and they were as good as the ones I had at Felix's in the French Quarter. We also had a sampler of oysters in the half-shell and we were guided by Donovan who knew the types of oysters and sources and showed us that by flipping the shell, the underside gives clues as to the waters they originated from.   Tuna Tartare was excellent (I've only had it as good in Aspen, Co for 3x the price).  Then smoked octopus and grilled red snapper. Both of those were outstanding too.   Price is reasonable for the quality but our bill was over $175 (we ate a ton and didn't care) this restaurant is right on price considering the quality on the plate and from the staff. We will definitely go again."

We split the calamari and it was among the best we've had in Texas. Top two, maybe top five ever. My wife had the redfish on the half shell and loved it. I ordered an oyster Po Boy but was disappointed in the size of the oysters and was very salty. The shoe string fries were fine by my tastes despite what some reviews state. Kind of high price for what we got for lunch but that's what you get now with the CA invasion of Austin. Seafood seemed fresh which is rare in Texas."

Our group was in town for a bachelorette and they were so accommodating. They provided several things to make our bride feel special. I would recommend Eberly's over and over again!"

                "description": "I really enjoyed Eberly for dinner. We had a group of 7, with a Saturday night reservation. Our server, Sofie, was great- attentive, knowledgeable and had great recommendations for food and drinks. I ordered the brussel sprouts as an appetizer, beef ragu for my main meal, the watchtower for my drink because I love blackberries, and the sticky toffee pudding as my dessert. All of these items were absolutely delicious!   Since we had dinner reservations, the atmosphere inside was intimate with lights lowered, and candles at the table. There is no dress code, but it is a place where you can dress up."

                "description": "The ambiance is fantastic. But just be aware that if you plan on being in the atrium, it'll get hot during the day (unless you get there in the morning).   The restaurant staff is friendly as well  However, the food could be much better, especially for the price. I'd do a hard pass on the smash burger; the meat was over cooked and chewy and the fries extremely basic. Definitely not worth anywhere near $18. That said, I did quite enjoy the brisket hash, brisket was very flavorful and tender, but also quite pricey."

                "description": "We were here on Tuesday night to celebrate our anniversary. Overall, it was a nice experience, but the only thing that really wow-ed us was the decor. One of us had been to the back bar area for drinks before, but we were in the main dining room this time around and the atmosphere is lovely. We didn't enjoy the massive circular booth that we were in but whatever. It was definitely quiet around 6:00 pm when we arrived, so we were happy to be leaving once it got busy.   Started with drinks, and Eberly is keeping the trend going of idiotic names for them. The mezcal in the \"Don't Look Back\" completely overpowered the rest of the drink, including the apricot puree which had sounded like a promising addition. The \"Nick the Lounge Singer\" (eye roll emoji here) and \"lonesome traveler\" were fine.  For food, we got the beet salad and the grilled octopus as starters. For the salad, the beets were cooked (what the hell was \"pickled\"?, um no) and ain't no way that was labne unless it came out of a plastic jar. It wasn't bad, per se, but it's annoying when dishes don't come out as advertised. Re. the octopus: it was sliced up, like into PIECES. What the actual F? Are you KIDDING? Why on god's green earth would you serve the octopus in slices unless you 1) precooked it and then are just heating it up or 2) are really trying to get away with such a measly amount. That dish was so creative and delicious (seriously), but the presentation just ruined it. For mains, the pasta ragu was light on the meat but tasted good; the short rib hit the spot--perfectly cooked and the flavors popped.  Dessert was nothing impressive: couple random ice cream flavors and a mediocre frangipane tart. Service was kinda fine. It took the guy a long time to come over initially (even though the place was dead) and he forgot to put in the house salad that we also ordered. But after that, he managed to get the job done.  Bottom line: good, not great, though we'd be willing to go again. 3.5 stars: one of us thinks it should be rounded down, but the other thinks it should be rounded up and he's going to win this time. 4 stars, but you can and should do better, Eberly."

                "description": "In short: definitely don't go to this place for special occasion, below average food and sucky service for higher price!!  We made a reservation for our anniversary brunch almost two weeks before, and mentioned in our reservation under special occasion, so when we checked in, saw there garden covered patio was not full, and asked if we can get a table there, and the girl who was checking in told, they have a reservation for that place at 12:45, we were there @ 11:30 and I asked we too made a reservation and there's no where you can pick a place while making reservation, then she thought for a minute and told, you can add it as a request  So you pick them for a special occasion and specify it in the reservations and request something, which they could've done, but they say no and give you a lame excuse??  Our host was okay, dint even bother to check even once if everything was okay.  Food is okay nothing special, we ordered milk rolls, hot chicken sandwich, French toast, El Paso( cocktail )  Milk rolls: it looked glossy, but it's just like Hawaiian rolls, warm on top and cold at the bottom, they haven't even warmed up thoroughly.  Cocktail was just okay   French toast: this was good, but single slice French toast   For$$$  Hot chicken sandwich: there was nothing hot in it, it's just dry hard chicken breast in between the bun, we dint taste any white cheddar or burnt onion aioli as they have described it.  So overall I don't recommend this place, and especially not for special occasion!!"

                "description": "Cool decor inside and good food, albeit priced higher than it should be for the level of service received. I can't knock anything for slow service given most places are short staffed, but it just felt like they weren't really present for a place with a nearly $100 aged ribeye.  That said, I would come back again just for the cocktails and dessert, including the sticky toffee pudding and the Dont look back Mezcal drink. The harissa chicken tasted great and was very juicy but only came with a couple pieces of asparagus and not enough vegetable."

                "description": "This is possibly the best cauliflower I've ever eaten. There was so much flavor and the perfect amount of cauliflower. There are some places I've gone to where they have some sort of expensive cauliflower dish and it'll only have 5 pieces of bland cauliflower. It kind of feels like you're getting robbed. Eberly does not do that! Their dish is an entire head of cauliflower that has so much flavor and detail. It's obvious in every bite that they put effort into creating it. One of my new favorite places!"

                "description": "We had a great experience here.  It was an anniversary weekend for us and we went to the Eberly to celebrate.  They gave us a nice card when we got there. Very kind.  Started with the Cold Fashioned which was very nicely made, though I have never had one of these, I enjoyed the flavors and tastes.  I will definitely try it again.  I went for the spicy chicken sandwich which was broiled not fried, I loved the flavors and the coleslaw and tangy spicy sauce. It comes with tons of fries.  Also tried the Avacado toast which was nice.  Our strawberry coffee cake came out last (not bad, just were expecting it earlier).  It was very nice, lots of flavors and textures.  Our server seemed to want us to leave though as she kept asking us if we wanted to wrap up the cake , if we wanted anything else or the bill.  We were only there for 45 min total.  That was strange.  Overall great place for breakfast."

                "description": "We came to Eberly on our son's request. There's not any parking and they have complimentary valet parking. The place is really non assuming but once you walk in wow. Very modern. Very dark but chic.   We started off with the Japanese milk rolls. They were pretty good. Very soft and good. Then had the mussels. Very good. Cooked just right and with the mussels they give you bread. Soak it in the mussels and it's really good. Then we had the potato leek croquettes. These were pretty good. Nice and soft inside but all of these were really good appetizers.   I had the short ribs and it was really good. Very tender. Very well cooked and so good. We also got the sides of crushed potatoes, Brussel Sprouts, and asparagus. All three were very good. Loved the potatoes. Little crispy but soft and good. Brussel Sprouts and asparagus and really good too. Spot on and really good.  My wife got the salmon and she was really happy with this. I got a bite and it was cooked perfectly. Very moist. So good.   Our server was pretty good. She kept our water glasses always filled even when they provide a bottle of water on the table.   So overall,  great food and loved everything about this meal from the appetizers, entree, and sides. Very filling for us. Very fresh food. Really good service and yet the ambiance was intimate but little loud. We had a really good meal and enjoyed it very much. I would have no problem visiting again cause the menu changes so you don't have to worry about same old same old. Enjoy. We did"

                "description": "Beautiful interior and friendly staff. Our food took a while to come out, but that was most likely due to the fact that my group consisted of 12 people and most of the food came out in batches so that nobody got their food alone.  The food was tasty, especially the French Toast and milk buns (both are must gets). The crispy potatoes can be skipped. They aren't that great.  The other items we ordered received good feedback overall though, so I would still recommend Eberly. The interior, service, ambiance, and food each have their own highlights, so all together they make this out to be a good brunch spot."

                "description": "Nice place near Zilker Park.   We thoroughly enjoyed our visit. They checked all the boxes.  Service was great. Everyone working there contributed to make sure we had what we needed.  Cocktails are a star attraction. Lots of interesting twists on classics.  The food was very interesting. I had the short ribs which were fantastic. My wife had the harissa chicken which she loved.  Topped it off with dessert and coffee. The apple tart was great. The only part of the evening that was a disappointment was the coffee. I'd definitely pass on this.  Can't wait to go back and try more options."

                "description": "Eberly is a gorgeous restaurant with solid food, drink, and service. 100% the kind of place I'd choose for a first date if I was in my mid 20s and wanted to impress. Hell, even in my mid 30s this place still hits. It's like suddenly living life through an Instagram filter.   My partner and I carbed up with Japanese milk rolls, mushroom mafaldini, and braised pork cheek ragu. All were delicious. Roasted banana crème brûlée and apple frangipane tart were even better. But I think my favorite items here were the cocktails. I highly recommend the Don't Look Back if you like mezcal. I never know what to do with mezcal other than drink it neat, so whenever a place nails a mezcal cocktail, I'm always impressed. Loved the Tristezza and Watchtower as well, but they all sounded great. Definitely need to return for the Anejo Manhattan.  Only thing holding me back from giving it 5 stars is the fact that I've only been here once, and we were seated at a bar high top. While the bar is super cool, and I want to try dining in The Study with some friends next time to get the full experience."

                "description": "Went here for NYE Galactic Rodeo event! It was super fun! The whole place is enormous. They had multiple seating areas and a bar when you step in with plenty of space to walk around. The whole restaurant is designed elegantly and has wood features on the bar. I am really curious to see what it's like functioning normally.  The event had a lot of food, they served us BBQ with a full spread. The brisket, Mac n cheese and potato salad were my favorites. I have no idea if it was catered or if the restaurant made it, but it was really good.  They had a DJ downstairs with awesome decor and lights. Upstairs is Cedar Tavern, which I think maybe partners with Eberly or is owned by the same people? It was a good drinking area, with games and a mechanical bull. They had Symply Courtney hosting the mechanical bull rides and he was very entertaining. We talked to him after the show and he was super nice as well.   There was also a guy doing lasso tricks with a rope! I did not catch his name but, he was very talented.   The rest of the staff was really awesome too.   Overall 10/10 event, would definitely do another NYE here and am super curious to try the restaurant on a normal basis."

After a long 15 months of not meeting in groups, my original core ATX friends decided we needed, nay, had to meet up.. Eberly was unanimously chosen out of 4 options.  I have always loved the interior of this location, yet to nab seats in the Atrium :(, one day it will happen.   Our evening was just perfect, from the Service, Meal - Starters to Dessert, Wine to Post dinner drinks at the bar.   The reason for 4 stars not 5, the vegetarian pasta entree didn't deliver, the menu description had potential, what I was served paled disappointingly in comparison to everything else that graced our table.   I just noticed that the menu has changed just like our season has. Dinner date anyone? :)"

In a haste, I chose my usual brunch fare, Eggs Benedict, without reading the ingredients and questioning what exactly was in my meal.  Prior to my going,  I did see many favorable reviews regarding the Eggs Benedict however, none mentioned Braised Collar Greens.  Yes!  Eggs Benedict with Collard Greens.  I'm a HUGE fan of vegetables but let's just say that after trying it at Eberly, I'm NOT a fan of Eggs Benedict with Collard Greens.    I'll be back, Eberly."

                "description": "My first visit to Eberly was the end of Jan of 2021 when I came down to visit a wonderful woman. We decided to frequent a few restaurants that evening so we limited our culinary adventure to appetizers. As for beverages I opted for the Piattelli Melbec which was a very well balanced wine, full of flavor but it didn't overpower the diverse plates we ordered.   We opted for the Kanpachi Crudo which was a very pleasant dish. The amberjack fish was delicate and had a nice light flavor. The jap/cucumber broth was very well conceived complimenting the fish, allowing it to take center stage, while just adding hints of heat and earthiness. The radish provided a nice crunch to enhance the flavor profile in terms of how it hit the pallet.  Now, I used to be a chef on the eastern shore, but I've never had octopus worth mentioning nor have I cooked it myself. However, and I'm not being hyperbolic, the octopus blew my mind. It was tender, flavorful, smoky, and had an ever so slight seafood brine to it. The romesco anchored the whole dish, pushing the natural flavors of the octopus to the forefront while enhancing the perfumed smoke juxtaposing it with the red peppers and slight tang of the sourdough, only uncovering it after several pleasurable chews. This dish was my favorite dish I've had so far in Austin.   I came back to Eberly in June of 2021. My date and I ordered three small dishes which never seemed to live up to my fond memory of a my previous visit. I opted to leave my wine comfort zone and ordered the Domaine Nais Rose wine. It was light and perfect for a hot July night with subtlety being the most distinguishing characteristic.    The first dish was the Tuna Poke which I liked but not loved. This had more to do with my anticipation of a higher sesame profile than the vision of the head chef. Aside from that, the tuna was fresh and sized right while the yuzo soy was divine offering, the perfect hint of fermentation.    Dish two were the steamed mussels. Typically I'm not a huge mussel fan (sorry Arnold Schwarzennegger) but these were outstanding. The mussels were cooked to perfection and all were opened (ie not dead before the cooking process) while being large and succulent. The white wine added a perfect spike of acidity while the 'nduja was flavorful complimenting the seafood. The corn added a nice sweet pop to the dish and the herbs were spot on.   As I previously stated, I had the octopus 6 months earlier. I considered telling the wonderful woman I had been courting I wanted the octopus again almost as much as I wanted to see her, however this was internal monolog of which it was never outwardly spoken. Joking aside perhaps the previous experience was a fairytale that I built from a hut into a castle in my mind. The octopus was once again was flawless. Being boiled for the absolute perfect amount of time then getting a kiss of smoke from the grill. However, my letdown came with the avocado-cilantro puree. The acidity didn't compliment the dish as my previous experience and the romesco. Rather it overpowered the fish, competing for the dominate flavor in my mouth. The olives and pine nuts were ok but the battle of sauce vs protein diverted my attention from enjoyment to befuddlement. My take away is, and this is paramount, Eberly knows how to provide a wonderful culinary experience and can cook Octopus! It is well worth your time and money to try this exhilarating experience. This restaurant is one of my favorites in town and the front of the house operations work flawlessly with in-depth knowledge of all customer centric aspects."

                "description": "In the latest wave of gentrification in this town, it seems like all I can find are hipster breweries that serve \"craft\" beer and overpriced food served on rectangular plates. If you like that kind of crap, go to aqua brew, you animal. If you want to go somewhere with cheap drinks and cool people (and if you live north of campus like this guy), look no further than Treff's. Some highlights.  You call it nights and you call it week:  Every Sunday, Treff's does $2.50 you call its, and $2.00 you call its on Tuesday. In addition to that, Treff's picks one week out of every month to be You call it week. That means $2 you call its all week. Going there, getting piss drunk, and stumbling back to my apartment, is among my fondest memories.   Atmosphere:  This place is dirty and divey in the best of ways. I used to go here with my friend from work all the time, and I always enjoyed seeing the bartenders and regulars. Really interesting people. Another upside is the patio, which allows filthy smokers like myself to smoke, drink, and have interesting conversations with other people. Another thing to mention, though, is that Treff's is much more of working people's bar. If you're a frat bro or sorority girl looking to blow mommy and daddy's money on a night of partying, you probably won't have a lot in common with the people here.  The glasses: This is just a little nitpick of mine, but I always hate going to the square and getting served drinks in a plastic cup. Treff's gets ridiculously busy some nights, and they still manage to serve all of their booze in glass, which is something I like. On another note, the bartenders here are absolute rock stars, and they don't take shit from anyone.   I haven't gone in a while since I don't have anyone to go with, but you can bet your ass the first place I'm taking my girlfriend when she turns 21 is gonna be Treff's."

Not for everyone but if you want a local crew and a few cold drinks and shots this is your place. I loved it and it will be even better when the upstairs is open. Not for children. Adults only in a drinking sense."

It was in existence way before he blew into San Marcos, and was known as the coolest, anti-frat bar in San Marcos.  That's why he bought it from Andy and Ben Linn, original owners.  He has expanded, added alot of TV s and updated the interior, but it will never be the place it was in the late 80's.  Keep blowing smoke, Patrick, - the Green Parrot is calling your name."

                "description": "Treffs is a nice casual spot to hangout, drink, play games and have a good time. It's a nice gem away from the square. They have $2 you call it week once a month! Can't beat it. Karaoke is also offered on Sundays, which is my favorite day to visit. Different events are hosted just about every day of the week. Although they don't serve food, they allow you to order at the restaurants near by and enjoy it there while washing it down with a cold alcoholic drink. Pretty awesome!"

I was willing to look pass this until I went in around 12am and had a few drink and was allowed to order a drink at 1:52am and they close at 2am. At 2:03 they bouncer was stand at our table demanding that two of my girlfriends and I chug our drinks and leave when we stated we'd like to not get drunk and drive the entire bar staff proceed to attack us and demand we finish our drinks, that we had just got and paid for, and leave or they'd take them. I felt very uncomfortable and attack so my friends and I just left. It was not a good way to end my night."

                "description": "My friends and I were here this past Friday with other work friends and we ordered a round of drinks. A few minutes later another friend met up with us and brought a round of shots. Within 10 minutes of being there a bouncer came up to us and told us we need to leave because we were \"too drunk\". I told him we weren't and we hadn't drank at all before we got there, we had all just been at a work function. He told us the bartender saw us walking to the bathroom \"looking drunk\". He wouldn't let us finish our drinks that we had just been served and only made the 4 people with shots out of my friend group leave. I think the staff there is racist just like other reviews are saying. Won't be coming back."

The bartender who is also manager and share-holder DID NOT MENTION TO US  that well vodka in the form of a pickle shot would be $6. As a longtime bartender being served by a long term bartender, when I'm told \"wells are $2\" I trusted that Chad would be honest with us. Instead, he took us to the cleaners. If I could give no stars I would. I have been in San Marcos for over 10 years. About 6 years ago I was man-handled by a door guy for no reason. I did not return to Treff's for almost 4 years. Since then, I have gone back a handful of times in hopes that it was just \"one bad apple\", but now I see that the employees at Treff's are out for nothing more than money. Even the door guy tonight was short and smile-less. I have received nothing less than awful service at this bar and I will not be returning."

This was my second visit to Treff's because the first time i had been there i did not have a great experience. However, I am a big fan a second chances because who knows what might had been going on that night.   The drink prices are very reasonable. Whiskey Sours only $3.50 and then they have some killer drink specials during the week I believe on Sundays and Tuesdays they have -You - Call -  Its- for only $2!!   The upstairs bar area has a bunch of darts to play and even a pac-man arcade game to entertain with.   As for this little dive, I would return."

A toss between \"dive\" and \"college bar\", this establishment has cheap drink specials and the students know it! Beer selection is moderate, but for a college hangout there's a few local and craftbeers in the mix of domestic \"moneymaker\" beers.  The bar gets super busy, especially during \"$2 Tuesdays\" when everything is $2 and I mean EVERYTHING! With other various specials during the week, this is a must if you're a student looking to have a good time and stretch you're student loan/ scholarship/ college fund/ or emergency credit card that mom gave you just a little more..."

Their selection of beers was so/so, although I had heard that they had more than what they actually had.  The parking lot was awful. Construction going on and one way in and out. Only about 10-13 cars could park and you can forget it if you're driving a truck, as the guy driving a f250 found out after hitting the parked Mercedes.  Not a great place for a huge group of people, but not bad for a San Marcos bar. When visiting just be wary of the parking lot and crazy drivers."

Well, as usual, we squished into a parking spot in the front of the tavern, walked in and sat at an open bar stool. I ordered an Ace pear cider and started chatting with friends while the jukebox was going with a vast array of music choices! Thats the beauty of a jukebox and I love the diversity!  Okay so I decided to check in (via Yelp) and saw that they had an offer for $2 drinks which really excited me because it wasn't a Tuesday and I still could get some $2 drinks? HELL YEAH!  WELLLLLLL.... it was more like a HELLLLLL NO because the bartender didn't allow me to redeem my deal. He even said he texted the owner and that the owner had no idea what kind of deal I was talking about? Well, the offer is still open on my Yelp app and I plan to find the owner next time I'm at the bar and ask him about it because that offer didn't magically come to be!!!  Anyway, yes Treff's is a super chill, casual and cool bar but they lost some points with not accepting my Yelp offer (I mean that's what the offers are there for hellloooooo)!! Guess I'll stick to only going in on Tuesdays..."

The salads came to the table after 10 minutes about 10 minutes apart. Then the sandwich came about 5 minutes after that. After another 20 min, and we finally flagged down an employee who implied that the server probably gave up because of where we're sitting (which is out back with everyone else). She came back to tell us that we weren't charged for it, and would bring it out anyway. She did, promptly, and it was delicious.  The Mandarin margaritas are rockin', though small."

Perfect for large groups and almost always packed, Loro creates their dishes with a bit of an East Asian inspired twist and Texan BBQ spirit! The rice bowls come with a fish sauce that's really delicious, and pair well with the small portions of meat.   The shrimp was flavorful and the smoked prime bavette was incredibly tender - you won't overeat here with the portion sizes, but it's a great experience to try out with a group or on a date! The boozy mango slush was also SO yummy and definitely boozy.  - Crispy Potatoes ($6.25) - Chicken Karaage ($10.50) - Texas Sweet Corn ($6) - Sesame Rice Noodles ($5.25) - Curry Marinated Shrimp Rice Bowl ($14.50) - Smoked Prime Bavette Rice Bowl ($14.50) - Mango Boozy Slush"

                "description": "What a clever idea to pair concepts from two of the more recognizable Austin eateries in Franklin Barbecue and Uchi. The result is an Asian fusion smokehouse serving unique takes on some classic items. We called in a fairly large to-go order and then drove over to the location in the South Lamar District to pick up the food. The place was half full for a Monday evening so it wasn't overly busy. There were a couple of outside patios with seating along with a spacious interior dining area that had booths, high-top tables, and picnic style tables along with a bar.  Bar Food, Snacks and Veggies, Meats, Sandwiches, Rice Bowls, and Sweets were the menu categories. Our picks were the following... * Crunchy Sweet Corn Fritters (served with sriracha aioli and cilantro) * Crunchy Cabbage Salad (served with cashew-ginger vinaigrette, cucumber, and lemon zest) * Coconut Scented Rice (seasoned with lime leaves and lemongrass) * Tomato and Cucumber Salad (served with cantaloupe, cilantro oil, lemon zest, and mint) * Sesame Rice Noodles (seasoned with chili vinaigrette, black sesame, and green onion) * Malaysian Chicken Bo Ssam (marinated with yellow-curry yuzu vinaigrette and Thai basil) * Char Siew Pork Belly (marinated with hoisin sauce and celery) * Smoked Turkey Breast (served with apricot chutney and chicken skin) * Smoked Beef Brisket (seasoned with chili gastrique and Thai herbs)  The standouts to me were the fritters, pork belly, and turkey breast. The sweetness of the fritters was contrasted with the spicy aioli. The pork belly was sliced into small square pieces and coated with the familiar flavor of hoisin. The fruitiness from the chutney and the crispiness of the chicken skin gave a citrus tone and texture, respectively, to enhance the smoked turkey.  I do think the meat servings were small for the charged prices. For example, there was maybe a half pound of smoked beef which cost nearly $20. The quality of the meats was good, but I think the brisket was not quite up to the Franklin standard. There had been a buzz about Loro when it first opened in 2018. It has been on my to-do list for Austin, and I was happy to be able to sample a variety of offerings."

                "description": "I love Loro! I've been to their location in Dallas before, but the OG Austin location probably has an even better setup with a larger partially-covered outdoor patio area.  I really enjoy casual counter-serve type places like Loro where you just order everything at the bar - easier for big parties like we had too. Loro's draft list and drink options are expansive and fantastic, and you can't stop by here without trying their boozy mango or coffee slushie (they sadly ran out of the coffee slushies when we went ).  The food at Loro is some of the best food pairing for casual weekend drinking that I've ever had. Szechuan spiced karaage - just get multiple orders of this for the table and thank me later. The brisket is smoked onsite under Aaron Franklin's supervision, and is absolutely fantastic in a fusion pairing with pickled onions, chili gastrique, and Thai herbs."

                "description": "A culinary delight pulled off without pretentiousness. Everything was just perfect. Tomato and Cucumber Salad (cantaloupe, cilantro oil, lemon zest, mint), Char Siew Pork Belly (house hoisin sauce, celery), Smoked Prime Bavette (shishito salsa verde, cilantro, pickled onion), Oak Smoked Salmon(cucumber-yuzu broth, parsley, lemon), Coconut Scented Rice (lime leaves, lemongrass), Oak Grilled Zucchini (cashew sambal, walnut bagna cauda, lemon), And Smoked Beef Brisket (chili gastrique, thai herbs).   It should be noted that the brisket id only available until 4pm! This brisket is amazing and worth the wait."

                "description": "Loro is a must if you live in or are visiting Austin! While they don't take reservations, waiting isn't too bad there. We got there around 6 on a Saturday night and were told it would be a 30 minute wait for 2 people. They have outdoor seating and a bar outside so you can hang out and have a drink while you wait. We ended up getting seated 15 minutes later (I think we just got lucky).  Once you get seated, you have to go to the front and order and then they bring it out. It gets pretty crowded at the front, so not quite ideal if you are planning on having multiple drinks or ordering more food, so it might be easiest to order all of them at once.  I ended up getting the Typhoon and frozen gin and tonic to drink and then shared the crispy potatoes, brisket, brisket rice bowl, and rice noodles. The food came out super quick, but unfortunately, the brisket was cold. All of the other food was great and even the brisket in the rice bowl was warm, it was just the brisket by itself.  Overall, I was really impressed by the uniqueness and flavor of all of the food and drinks! They also have a decent amount of meatless options too if you are vegetairan! I will definitely be back!"

Crispy potatoes, chicken karranga, grilled snap peas and the wonton chips and salsa were delicious. Very unique and interesting flavors that blend well together.   The pork belly and tofu bowls were well portioned and equally delicious.   Crispy chicken and brisket sandwiches were also hits at the table.   Service was prompt and friendly.   We will be back."

                "description": "Stop everything you are doing in Austin Texas.  If you are a fan of Franklin BBQ..... and ....., Uchi Japanese restaurant s.... Go to LORO!!!  It is the fusion of both of these fantastic restaurants!!!  I couldn't believe the great food and beverages we had here at LORO!  We started with the Heifenweis beer on tap which was very good.  We sat at the bar and the bartender suggested the flank steak Meat plate along with the pork belly rice bowl, snap peas and sesame noodles.  I don't know what made me agree to order this mess of food but when it came out I was sure happy I did!!   Our bartender's name was Huy and he sure knew his stuff!  The sesame noodles were fantastic!!  Kind of Pho like noodles but with Al dente texture served fried with sesame oil!  FAntastic!!!  Then the flank steak served with pickled radishes and cilantro!!  Really good!!  The snap peas with Kimchi sauce was super tasty but the pork belly rice bowl was the best of the lot.  If you come to LORO'a you should get this dish.  It's hard to explain but it's a fusion of thick bacon, rice, some sort of veggies and a  ginger soy sauce that would make you smack yourself in the head if you'd forgotten to mix it in.  It's simply magic.  It's ridiculous.  You gotta have it.    We paired it up with an Argentine wine \"Trento Negro\" which was again fantastic!!     We finished with a cookie that was kinda chocolate chip and kinda macadamia nut mix.... Served with a coffee slush that knocked our socks off!!!  Ambiance was Asian smokehouse cool vibes.  Staff was friendly and unbelievably helpful to midwesterners like  us.  Bathrooms were clean and prices were reasonable.    This is 5 star food served in a super cool atmosphere with great prices.  Do not go to Austin without trying this place.   It should be at the top of your list!!"

                "description": "To be very clear, I am a total snob about Asian food. I am like why ruin a good thing by fusing it with other things?? ITS GREAT THE WAY IT IS!   HOWEVER! Loro did a great job. I loved the corn fritters and I got the cabbage salad and added grilled shrimp. Everything tasted amazing! I love the atmosphere and I currently work close enough to walk there. Perfect outside seating for the weather when I went. I will have to go back for happy hour. Food came quickly but there were a TON of people so if you are still COVID paranoid, probably just try to take out! Good luck!"

                "description": "Loro is so very popular, but they make waiting fun with a cute waiting area.  They have an extended parking which makes it less stressful.  I love ordering at the counter, but you have to be pretty strategic.  Look at the menu while wait and send someone to order immediately so that you can get that food!  We usually order a lot so that we can try everything.  Below is what I remembered from my trip:  My partner loved the Brisket Sandwich especially the sauce that came with it.  The Turkey was good, but odd.  It comes with mandarin oranges so it's kinda like have cranberries on Turkey near during thanksgiving   Their version of karage was surprisingly great!  Char Siew Pork Belly - pieces were great.  They were sweet and soft and came with hoisin,  Coconut Rice  had perfect flavor  Corn Fritters were hyped for me.  It was more about the sauce that made them interesting and you have to eat them right away.  Letting them sit for more than 5 minutes ruins the texture.  Smoked Beef Brisket was soft and amazing   Wonton Chips were also a bit hyped for me and they are VERY oily.  Potatoes were basic, but parents enjoyed them.  Singapore noodles are a solid crowd pleasure.  It's definitely a unique space with a kitchen that tries to be innovative.  It's definitely worth a shot.  Not all dishes are winners, but if you order enough you'll find something you like!"

                "description": "Cultural Culinary   The quick review is the food was excellent, craft beer ambiance, and dog friendly with outdoor seating.  I have driven along South Lamar for a long time but never stopped by.  My impression was it was too Asian for my wife where she may not like the taste.  After talking to my niece who ate there said we would definitely love it, so in looking for a new place to try Loro was on top of the list.  Built under huge oak trees Loro provides many seating options from bar, indoor, patio, and outdoor seating. It was a bit chilly so decided to sit at the bar noticing some sat outside under large heaters.  First you find your place to sit and then order at the bar.  It seemed to work well and gives that country bbq feel.   Taps of local brews were in front of me with decorations along the wall perhaps from a garage sale adding to the ambiance of Austin coolness. The menu was on a peg wood wall with old school lettering or scan the QR code using your phone. I ordered the Oak Smoked Salmon with Coconut Scented Rice. The bartender noted to return on either Sunday or Monday to try the Smoked Baby Back Duroc Pork Ribs where you will sing about it they next day.   We dressed Austin casual so not need for business attire or bow ties, and there seems to be quite a bit of parking even though saw a few arrive on e-scooters. The average age here is 20-30s which made me feel young here.   Looks like it's a place where the food is brought to you when ready, not sitting under a heat lamp. A side bowl was placed in front of me with a delicious looking piece of salmon in a puddle of some juice.  The rice was in a white takeout box. The salmon was extremely good and went along fine with my Live Oak Hefeweizen draft beer.  I was so tuned into my fish I forgot about the rice. I opened the little box and tasted it where it was very good too with a buttery taste. Forgot to ask for chopsticks but again lost all consciousness on enjoying my salmon. As for my wife she enjoyed the Oak Smoked Beef Brisket Sandwich where said the best she had tasted in a long while perhaps on our Texas Monthly BBQ tour.  Definitely added a pin on this place to my restaurant regular rotation where there are a few other menu items I need to try."

                "description": "While the vibe of this place is really dope, I do think it's slightly overrated.   Yes the food is very high quality and is well sourced and prepared, however, I think that this restaurant has been so talked about and so highly regarded, I expected a lot more.  I got the smoked salmon rice bowl - the salmon didn't even taste like salmon, I felt like i was just eating smoked meat. The coconut rice is definitely a hit - I really like the nice sweetness to it. The rest of the bowl was a LOT of cilantro and pickled vegetables that didn't add much except take up space."

                "description": "The vibe of this place was great but we were really confused about the service/organization of things.   We came on a weekend evening and there were tons of people here. The parking situation was a bit confusing but we figured it out (there's WAY more parking than we thought there was). When we got to the line to check in, we got a buzzer so we could sit outside. We were told to not sit at any of the tables outside so we got some drinks at the bar outside and hung out outside on some chairs not near any of the tables. When our buzzer came, we went back inside only to be led outside to the tables and then told to order \"at the bar\". We were really confused if that meant the outdoor bar or the indoor bar and other people outside were confused as well. Turns out indoor bar was the right answer!  We ordered inside then came back out and awaited our food. We got everything except the corn fritters and had to remind the host about them. Overall, the food was good, but the chaos around the service didn't make the food worth it.   We liked the kale salad and the string beans. The corn fritters was a little too heavy for me (after all that waiting!)"

My friend and I ordered a couple of their plates from the HH menu to split and also two of their alcoholic slushee drinks.   What we got:  - corn fritters: in my opinion, the star of the show. They were so crispy on the outside and the inside was more chewy and had a nice bite.  - chicken burger: to be honest, I wasn't a fan of the seasoning on the chicken but my friend enjoyed it. - karage: these little fried chicken bites were crispy and yet still juicy. The cilantro topper helped provide a refreshing bite. - mango slushee: I believed this was mixed with sake but you really wouldn't be able to tell. Tasted like juice! - coffee slushee: this was the exact opposite of the mango one, the alcohol taste was strong but the coffee flavor was goo"

                "description": "TL;DR; Really quality food; cocktails are solid; service is nice with an interesting concept; cool vibes. Get the chicken karaage.  My husband and I came here for a date night on Saturday and had a great time. Seating was surprisingly easy (we got there around 6:30pm? We're seated at the bar within 5 minutes). We sat at the bar, which was nice because we didn't have to go up and order food/drinks (which is what you'd have to do if you are seated at a table). Bartender and service was nice and attentive, host was friendly but not annoying.   Originally, we came for drinks and try a few dishes to share, but everything sounded so go that we stuffed ourselves with too food to get to the drinks. I did try the Typhoon, which was pretty good. The frozen drinks looked good, but was too full of food to get one.  Would DEFINITELY come back for the food. We both got rice bowls (husband got the chopped smoked brisket and I got the char siew pork belly), the corn fritters, and chicken karaage. DO NOT SLEEP ON THE KARAAGE. So delicious--the sauce they drizzle on top is *chef's kiss*, the jalapeño aioli was a perfect pair, and it was super tender, juicy, and crisp all at the same time.  Corn fritters tasted great, only critique is that the sweet corn was SUPER sticky/gummy (stick to your teeth in every aspect)."

The chilaquiles ($11) are seriously amazing. Pork, salsa verde, tortilla chips, feta, sour cream, eggs, onions, arugula, radishes. Yum. I finished every bite on my plate and craved more hours later once my appetite returned. This is the best thing by far on the menu.   If you are looking for an appetizer (aka their snacks) the pimento cheese dip is wonderful. One of the best ones I have ever tasted. Also Texans LOVE pimento cheese.   During brunch they have $5 mimosas, $5 frose, and $5 bloody Mary's. Yum.   They occasionally host drag brunch, which I have also attended with my girlfriends. We booked a table a month in advance and had a wonderful experience. Super fun for a girls \"day\" out/birthday party/etc."

                "description": "My friends and I attended the Rhonda Jewels Drag Brunch on Sunday and it was such a blast!! I've never been to Irene's and it's such a cute Austin vibe. The brunch tickets get you a bottle of Frosé wine on the table upon sitting down, so yummy and perfect way to start the morning off for the show. The menu items all sound so great and I know I'll have to return to try a few other things I had my eye on. Our group did Cachapas, brunch grilled cheese, avocado toast, quesadilla, and big breakfast plate. The show was so lively and entertaining and it's a great brunch date! Parking can be pretty tricky down in that part of town so arrive at least 10 mins before you want to be there to find a good spot. If the Drag brunch isn't your vibe then definitely check out the inside, it's a much quieter cafe style feel, restrooms are located in the back behind the bar front area and if you don't have time to sit down then they also have a walk up cafe to go window. They've really hit the mark w this spot and it's a great place to check out!"

Great drink specials for brunch. Perfect spot to pull up diner seat and laptop or meet a group of friends to catch up in cool joint with good fare."

Not a lot of vegetarian/vegan options though.   I got the broccoli sandwich which was pretty tasty. Very buttery in my opinion, definitely not light if that's what you're looking for.   Friendly staff and eclectic vibes."

                "description": "Updating my review, because I loved it more the second time.   Excellent sliders: 1. Our favorite was the kimchi bacon slider. So excellent, beautiful texture and taste. Honestly a bit mind blowing  2. The Buffalo chicken is quite good, but perhaps should have eaten it faster because the bread got a bit soggy  3. The fried chicken slider was average -- a bit too dry and flavorless -- compared to the others.  Enjoyed my friends peach vodka drink, had a weird maitai wouldn't recommend.   The strawberry cake was just fine"

                "description": "So me and my best friend were just driving around downtown looking for a different spot for dinner that was cute and trendy...and we came across Irene's. The outside patio, and pink lit up letters caught our attention. We noticed it was pretty packed because they were having a Bachelor watch party lol.   When we walked up to the window, my eyes lit up looking at their desert display  but I knew I had to eat dinner first. We both ordered burgers, but mine were sliders.   I will say that the meat was cooked to the perfect medium well temperature on a lightly toasted buttered bun. Great flavor! I had it with a side of chips, and washed it down a delicious froźe.   The vibe was super chill, and it's a great patio to hang out at on a good weather day."

                "description": "My friends and I came here for our final brunch of bachelorette weekend. This place is really well known spot that I've been hearing about for years as a San Antonio native.  On weekends they usually don't take reservations, but bc we wanted to reserve for a bachelorette, they let us reserve in advance for $18 a person. The price includes popcorn, Jell-O shots, and a dessert as well.  Popcorn was a bit stale, and for the dessert they had bite sized rice krispy treats. I was expecting actual dessert or the option to choose a dessert, but that wasn't the case. They ran pretty short on the jello shots so they offered to cover a drink/coffee for the entire party. I didn't try the dessert or the jello shots so can't really review that, but I did get a latte and that was pretty basic. I liked that they had alternative milks to choose from!   For the actual eating portion, I decided on the French toast platter. It's supposed to come with berries on top and choice of eggs and protein/avo (I chose poached w/ avocado).   The platter was good, especially for the price ($12 for a well known brunch spot!). Instead of adding berries to it, they added peaches. Still good but it would be nice to be notified of the change. My Eggs and avocado looked a bit sad and small, which was unfortunate. I'm guessing they just skimp out on poached eggs because my friends had theirs scrambled and it filled up the plate. Food overall was pretty good tho aside from the minor drawbacks!   This was definitely a learning experience for me. I would love to come back again, but next time would avoid making a party reservation (to avoid an extra $18 fee) and get my eggs made differently!"

                "description": "Irene's is such a cute brunch spot!!! We came here on a Friday afternoon. They have a small parking lot right next door that you can text to pay- super easy but pricy.   Walking in, we went straight to the host and was seated immediately- they have indoor and outdoor dining. We chose to sit indoor because it was so hot today!  Our server greeted us quickly and we decided to order our drinks \"to-go\" but not really to go because of the cute capri-sun/koolaid pouch style drinks.  The drinks were great- nice and strong. I got buzzed off of one!!!   We decided to order light since we were going to eat somewhere else after.  The food: 1) Al Pastor Tacos: meat and tortilla were really dry. However the pineapple salsa was nice and refreshing. 2) Kimchi beef sliders: ordered as medium,  but came out as well done. But the flavors were great, I enjoyed it!!  Service was average. Checkout was quick. Would come back to try other food items."

                "description": "I was visiting Austin for the weekend with a few friends and we were looking for a good brunch spot and ended up at Irene's.   It was pretty busy as we went during prime brunch hours on a Saturday. We had the option of either putting our name down on a list and waiting for about an hour for a table or ordering through an outside checkout line and getting a table in the outside seating area (first come first serve). We chose the latter and it was pretty easy to get a table outside and the outside checkout line was pretty seamless!   I thought the food was basic (nothing great but also not bad) and the service was good - the food came out quickly despite it being very busy!  Overall, I would give Irene's an average rating."

                "description": "[covid review] Quick and helpful service! Just kinda pricey and portions were small, food was also pretty average/normal. Maybe come for the aesthetics?  Came at 11am on a Sunday morning with 5 others and was seated immediately. Their patio area is large and well spaced out with adequate ventilation. Pretty cute decor and vibes.  Now, onto the food. It wasn't bad by any means, but was below expectations. My order (baked eggs) was probably the best thing we had, and the mixture of grits, kimchi, and eggs was decently filling with a lot of different flavors (not for everyone imo). The bread it came with was really good! On the other hand, my friends got the brunch grilled cheese and chilaquiles, and both were small portions and looked like you could make them (better?) at home. Flavors and seasoning for the chilaquiles were not good according to my friend (I trust his judgments)."

                "description": "This place was great! Drove up from SA last weekend. My husband arrived early and sat at the bar from the minute it opened. When I arrived, he was already in pretty deep. He offered to order some food for me, but I doubted he would have ordered what I would've wanted considering his state.  Upon arrival there was a massive wait list already going. I sat next to my hub at the bar and ordered a pozole, confusing the bartender because she thought I was going to order a drink. She was super nice and the pozole was delicious. I was surprised at how filling it was. I'm used to crushing a huge vat of pozole, and here's this petite cast iron pot of it.   Our friends arrived an hour later. I was determined to have a slice or strawberry cake and since I'm so health conscious...some vegetables christened with slabs of friend chicken.  The cake came first. It was good. Fresh strawberries dotted the cake throughout. Jam separated each layer. The cream cheese frosting was sweet, but played nicely with the tartness of the berry and the cheese.  The salad was good, with butternut squash and apples. The fried chicken was so moist. It think it was chicken breast..but the moistest chicken breast I've ever had.  Se stayed seemingly til the end of service. The service was wonderful throughout. What a nice Sunday in Austin."

I stumbled upon the Austin Brewery Tours' website while searching on Yelp for ideas.   I had an awesome time exploring Austin's growing beer scene. I also had a great time meeting and making friends the other tourists on our tour.   I enjoyed all of the 3 breweries but the behind the scene tour at Independence Brewing Co. made it my favorite.   The price is very fair when you consider it includes your tastings and tips for your severs.   In a nutshell, a good alternative tour for those interested in the Austin craft beer scene."

                "description": "Apparently it's become a tradition that we do a brewery tour when we travel. One of the breweries I was told I MUST visit, while in Austin, was Jester King. Searched online for brewery tours that included this and finally decided on Austin Brewery Tours.  Almost daily tours, online booking was so easy, and we got a reminder, a couple of days earlier to our tour, via email.  Tour starts at noon.  Meetup time was 11:30am. At around 11:25am the van was there.  Out comes Shane, owner and tour guide. He immediately introduced himself, thanked us for being on time and proceeded to ask us our names and where we were from. Once the other people taking the tour arrived, we were all introduced and in the van we went.  During the time we were driving, he would ask us questions to get to know us better, and see the style of beers we liked. He also gave us an intro of each of the breweries we would visit. He made the time driving pass by fast and welcomed all questions we could have.  At each of the breweries, he explained the process and what we had included in the price of the tour. At Jester King, they even had a special release and he bought a sample of each (which was not included in the price but he gifted us with it) making sure we had the complete experience.    You can tell he enjoys doing these tours and meeting the people.   He even took us to Revolution - which was in front of one of the breweries we visited - to try locally made flavored gin.   So greateful he allowed us to do this quick stop - this was delicious, and gave me the opportunity to talk more with one of the ladies on the tour, exchanging ideas on recipes with the gin we had just tried.    Shane is grate at incorporating everyone in the tour and conversations.  He allows you plenty of time to enjoy each brewery and every beer you choose.   He is now friends with the staff at each of these breweries, which works on the advantage of everyone in the tour since we got excellent/ friendly service at each stop.  Best part of this all, is you meet new people, get to enjoy all the beer you can drink, and don't have to drive. Great way to spend a day in Austin.  If looking for a beer tour, look no further, this is it!"

No one In our group lived in Austin so it was good to get some info about the city and neighborhoods. The 3 breweries we stopped at were all unique from each other in size, atmosphere, and beers. At each stop you choose two beers to try which is great. We've been on other tours where you do not pick. We were given about an hour at each stop which was ample time.

Of all the awesome people we met and food we ate, our guide Shane as well as the guys at the Lotus Joint food truck were freakin awesome!  SXSW had Austin jammed with a lot to do but Shane made sure we got to see Austin and its beer community like the locals do. He was insanely knowledgeable not just about beer but also about Texas. When you've solo traveled the world like he has, you gain a perspective that makes you far more relatable too which made him an all around cool guy to hangout with.  Most important.. The beers were phenomenal! (Try the goat tacos at Lotus also!)  In town for a day, a week, or a life time - Hands down recommend this for anyone in Austin!"

                "description": "Austin Brewery Tours was awesome! This was a Christmas gift for my husband and we both had a great time. Brooke was a wonderful tour guide, and she made good beer recommendations (especially considering that I'm not much of a beer drinker).   We did the Hill Country Tour and visited Jester King, Last Stand, and Skull Mechanix. Each tour had a tasting option (one where we all tasted beers as a group and the others where we each got to pick our own beers to try). After selecting beer to taste, we got to explore each brewery on our own before moving onto the next location. We had enough time to eat (plan on eating at Jester King. The food is awesome and we spent the most time there) and to drink at every place, while still getting to individually wander and see all that these breweries had to offer. We also got to take the Jester King tour, which is really cool.   I'd highly recommend an afternoon with Austin Brewery Tours!! Thank you Brooke for a great day!"

We were on a bachelor party where everyone loved craft beer, and wanted to find out what Austin has to offer. The breweries we visited were perfect since they offered a wide variety of options, and Shane kept us on time without rushing us.  It was truly a fun and professional experience. I'll be recommending ABT to others who inquire about brewery tours in Austin."

                "description": "I was in town for a bachelor party and the Brew Tour was the concessions highlight of the weekend. Shane (the owner) made the planning process a breeze. He was extremely helpful and prompt in all of our communications. Also, the van we took was clean and very comfortable.   The tour itself was AMAZING and huge shout-out to our guide Brooke, you killed it! Tremendous job moving us from location to location while never making us feel rushed, so glad it wasn't on me to wrangle the guys when it was time to go :). Also, your beer recommendations were spot on! Same with your suggestions for things to do for the rest of the weekend.   I have been on similar tours in other cities and Austin Brewery Tours is the gold standard now. I have already recommended them to a few people planning trips to Austin and I know others in our group have as well.   Thanks Shane and Brooke!"

                "description": "October 2018. 5 out of 5. We decided to take a brewery tour while we visited Austin. This ended up being a great decision. The tour is structured well. We did three stops which gave us a good opportunity to try three different breweries without having to worry about driving, parking, or any of the attendant Logistics. The tour covers all expenses including tips which is a nice touch. You can tell that the tour is well organized and that the breweries appreciate the business. That means you end up getting much better service at all of the breweries than you sometimes get with such packages. The tour guide also is able to make excellent suggestions so if you don't have a lot of experience with craft beer this is a great way to learn. If you have any interest in a brewery tour while in Austin I highly recommend this tour."

He was great at mingling with all the different groups within our group (there were 6 groups!) and was a great tour guide in general. He mixes up which breweries he goes to which makes it exciting if you do this several times. It's definitely well worth the money to get a fun, convenient way to enjoy beers of Austin."

Shane was very easy to work with, and very responsive to all of my questions prior to getting this booked. We had 2 large vans for a group of 25 girls and it worked out perfectly. Shane picked out 3 wonderful breweries for our group with a wide variety of beers (and some with other options like ciders) - all locations had plenty of space for our large group, delicious beers, and food trucks available when the group got hungry. Overall, our group had a wonderful time. I highly recommend Austin Brewery Tours!"

                "description": "Idle Hands are the Devil's playthings!  This Rainey Street Bar is a cool place to lounge out, relax with some Cuban drinks, and enjoy some live music! They've got a small stage set up in the front, to entice people to join them on their elevated patio, which is covered in astroturf. I'm not sure that the place is handicapped accessible, since you have to climb stairs to get in.  The interior looks like some sort of coffee shop. There's a bar where they're pouring imaginative drinks. In the rear, there's an outdoor patio that's a bit more intimate than the front patio. The place is clean, and well lit.  It's a fun place to hang out under the shade of their big oak tree and relax in the sunlight. The vibe here is always relaxed and chill. They serve bar food here, but I didn't opt for any when I came. Think Cuban fare, with burgers and fries."

                "description": "We visited for the first time during SXSW week, due to the bands they had booked for their outdoor stage. Several of these were bands that draw a sizable crowd (think festivals or medium sized halls), and unfortunately Idle Hands isn't set up for that kind of crowd. Not even close. People were lined up waiting to get in and they were at capacity.   The open patio is out front, shaded by oaks, and covered with astroturf. It's not big, by any means. The stage is a small dugout box that instead of being raised, seems to be sunken down below patio level. So if there's a sizable crowd, you may be able to see the tops of the band members' heads onstage, unless you are 6'5\". Maybe. This might be okay for a sparse crowd, but these weren't sparse crowds, and I have a feeling that Rainey Street often draws crowds.  That particular day, there were giant costumed sports characters trying to make their way through the wall-to-wall crowd. They couldn't really see through their costumes, so they knocked over some things and bumped into people who were trying to watch the bands. It isn't a kid venue, so it wasn't clear why they were there. They may have been wondering the same thing.   The indoor area looks like a modern coffee shop cafe, and they have a full bar. We did not try the food. Our mixed drinks were well balanced and tasty. Some staff were friendly, others were just not, to the point that it left a fairly negative impression of the place.   This week at Idle Hands for us was a two star experience. Others have had a better time when visiting on less busy times and for reasons other than seeing live music shows that draw a crowd. So keep in mind that your mileage may vary, depending on the day and your goals for your visit.   Rainey Street has a lot to offer within a couple of blocks, much like the West 6th Street of old, before the live music scene moved east of I-35. So if you don't find what you want here, you might find it close by."

When we walked in, everything felt perfect so we booked it on the spot.    We had some random requests like being able to adjust the music volume, film in the space, have dedicated security, and have a custom drink and glass (photo attached).  Idle Hands was able to accommodate everything (thanks Matt!).  During the event, Gabriel from Idle Hands helped ensure all of our guests were well-attended to.  Everything went super smooth, if you're considering a private event, you're in good hands with Idle Hands :)"

And as a bonus they have live music almost every night!!    My faves: The Painkiller - it goes down way too easy.  The Lover Boy - a killer chorizo-infused burger that will make your mouth water.   Lots of great staff and be sure to save room for the dessert! Tyler is an amazing baker who makes all the desserts for this place. The cheesecake was incredible!!   A few words about Covid restrictions - I've seen most of the bars on Rainey - almost none of them are following the protocols. I feel like this place is the exception. No lines or large groups gathering on top of each other inside. Outside seating spaced well. Staff all have on masks. That plus the food, drinks and service mean I'll be back many more times. The menu evolves some too, always like a place willing to add and try new things while keeping some of the faves on the menu.  Thank you Idle Hands - finally something good out of 2020!"

                "description": "Nice joint on Rainey which punches above its weight in terms of drinks and food. Rainey in general is a bit of a mixed bag but this place was surprisingly good.   They have a Cuban food focus and use an interesting ticket system with every drink you get that you can redeem for food (probably to ensure enough food sales to stay open during Covid). I had about 4 Painkillers, a properly dangerous pineapple/coconut/orange and rum drink that was delicious. Summery is the best way to describe a lot of their cocktails.   Had some of the best fried plantain chips I've ever had with guacamole and ceviche. My only complaint was I wish they had comfier seating for hanging out and it ended up shortening our time we spent there (lots of high chairs and hard back seats). They dont have a decent back deck like a lot of Rainey places do so the seating was mainly up front where speakers were blasting, including the neighboring businesses music. So it ended up being a little chaotic.   Either way its a nice spot. Service, drinks and food were great so I think we'll drop by again."

Read all these reviews raving about it and thought it'd be better. I guess y'all were smashed from the fancy cocktails lol. It wasn't bad, just didn't really standout and for $12 for a burger and fries, I think there's better options in town. My fault for expecting culinary excellence from what I assume is a bar kitchen."

The manager Tyler is incompetent and does not care about the well being of his customers.   Never going back to this bar again and I suggest you don't either.   Been coming to this bar for years with no issues, ever and have spent SO much money here (I live on Rainey). The staff have always been great until...  Tonight I had a group of young girls create a conflict with my group of friends for no reason. They swarmed our table and harassed us - pulled my friends hair, STOLE MY FRIENDS PHONE and, on top of that, a man that was part of this group forcefully grabbed my arms. The bouncers did nothing to get our phone returned nor remove a girl who pulled my friends hair and was cursing me out and flipping me off. They made me sound crazy when I asked for help. My voice did not matter. I asked to see the cameras and conveniently there are no cameras located in the front (which is absurd given that this is where all the tables and chairs are). It is one thing that these mean girls tried to start conflict with me and my friends for no reason, but this man grabbed my wrists so hard that I could not move and I had to front kick him in the stomach to get away. This is not okay under any circumstance and the fact that the bouncer and manager turned a blind eye is disgusting.  I wish there were cameras because I would press charges. This is so incredibly degrading as a woman and I am still shook that appropriate action was not taken."

                "description": "This is a generous two star offering. Love the location, the great local talent playing on the porch and our drinks were very tasty.   Big however...  The food was pitiful. The black bean burger was an oversized sopping, crumbly mess with zero flavor and the fries were cold and uneventful. The ranch may as well been runny, salty mayo. My lady pal got the plantain chips with guacamole. They gave us tortilla chips with guacamole. My guy friend went in to ask for the plantain chips that they were supposed to come with. He took a photo with his phone of the chips and dip to show the bartender and he practically laughed in my buddies face and mocked his photo taking as a means to justify his request (he's in production and art, okay? Let the guy make art and an example of your crappy food).   The man brought us the plantain chips out a few moments later to go with the guacamole. Which was the worst guacamole I've had. Del Taco makes better guacamole. Salt? Lime? Heat? Maybe just try to make it flavorful...  Oh and the quinoa bowl-- that one veggie thing. What the heck even was that? It had no sauce; oil or spices to bind together what was basically a sad bowl of vegetables and bitter arugula.   Way off the mark with the food, guys. Good thing the music was kickin' and the mezcal ritas were nice n' zesty.   Get drinks and an earful or music and skip the food. All 3 of our dishes were very weak."

                "description": "This bar was the highlight of our night! We had a big group of people for my birthday and the bouncer made sure everything was set up for us, he even put our table right next to the live music!   The servers were all so kind and helpful! Someone at our table spilled a cocktail and they replaced it quickly and for free!  One cool thing about this bar is that they give you tickets every time you order a drink, and tickets add up to be free food items! Their fries and chips/queso were good. The cocktails were very strong too! Would definitely come here again!"

                "description": "Came here for my wife's birthday with some friends and we all agreed it was probably the best meal of our lives. The courses all featured spice in very well balanced dishes, and as a person who doesn't normally search out spicy food I had no regrets after this experience. The crab fingers were a fun and light way to start things off, just enough to whet the appetite without being heavy. I loved the curry sauce and the chili oil was enough to feel it but not enough to overwhelm the crab or curry. Next was a tuna tartare with more spice, this was really good but probably my least favorite of all the dishes. The biggest surprise for me was the charred cabbage. It was marinated lightly and then seared over flame, and the combination of those two steps made it extremely flavorful and easy to eat. I don't normally think of cabbage as something exciting, but combined with the spices and furikake mushroom curry sauce I'd go back just for this! Absolutely floored my whole party. The main course of pork three ways over dirty rice and greens was a hit, with a lightly tangy mustard sauce and simple, excellent flavors all around. Finally, dessert was a delicious cake with I believe a pumpkin sauce topped with a heavy cream and pumpkin seeds. I'd punch a child just to have that sauce alone, the rest was a bonus.   Most of my group did the wine course, allergies had me under the weather so I had only one glass and a few samples. Everyone agreed the wines paired really well, although feelings were mixed on the necessity of the dessert wine given the dessert was sweet enough. That being said, no one had complaints after the trip and we are eagerly planning our next outing.   The staff was amazing and we felt very well taken care of all night long. My compliments to Lenoir for a wonderful evening!"

                "description": "Recently went here with a friend for dinner as a visitor to Austin and while the food was good, probably  4/5, I cannot recommend this business as I lost my wallet in between this dinner and a direct drive back to where I was staying.   After retracing our steps and turning the place and car inside out, my wallet could not be found and two days later, none of my cards had been used. However, I did have $300 in cash and a $200 rewards debit card that was in there. Lenoir refused to pick up after multiple calls and messages, which they also refused to return. Once we finally got through, employees denied having it, despite there being only one logical place it could possibly be. So while I had a decent meal, I'm now out almost $800 with the added bonus of having to replace my REAL ID and cards"

We sat outside under a gorgeous tree, adorned with beautiful glass lanterns on a cool, moonlit night drinking bottles of wine and feasting on the chef's choice menu option, while trying not to fill up on one of the best bread plates you will ever experience. Each course was a bonafide gastronomical treat, coupled with unique and delicious wine pairings and curated by an exceptional staff with a level of fine dining service you are unlikely to ever experience in an environment as laid back as Lenoir.   And the desserts were incredible. We ordered them all.  Highly, highly recommend.   We loved it, think of it often and can not wait to return."

Service is always on point, knowledgeable servers on the wine, pretty solid wine list, limited glass selections tho, but I hate to say it but I recall when the food was equally as good... maybe it's the seasonal menu but it was a bit salty and generally underwhelming... I've had much better at Lenoir. Hoping to see a return of great food... quality of ingredients were on point I think it's the cooks... will still be back. Love y'all"

                "description": "Lenoir is a cozy outdoor space with delicious food. We came in with 14 people and they accommodated us in the back. We arrived on time and got seated promptly. We had a 5 course meal and only one wasn't to my liking. The char shui was moist and flavored well. I was a little skeptical at first glance but it turned out delicious.   My only gripe was that dinner took 2.5 hours. It cut into our other plans that we had that night. So, if you have a big party, plan accordingly.   PS - Because it's near a creek, please careful of water bugs... As I was cutting the char shui, one crawled across my lap napkin. Imagine a screaming woman frantically waving her knife around as her first initial reaction. Yep, that was me. *Raise hand* I almost stabbed my friend while trying to get it off me."

                "description": "As I drove up, I was unsure of parking and which building to go to! After I was pointed to the correct destination I found the ambiance to be quaint and inviting with a nice hint of sophistication. A semi-open kitchen with a trendy bar area invited me to relax and enjoy the evening on Lenoirs terms.    I'm a former chef, however when I order beverages, I prefer to tell the staff my interests and let them suggest my vino(s) of the night. My waiter proved to be worth his salt as my 'pearl snap' which was perfect. I'm not a fan of IPAs so this suited my palate. As for the wine, I opted for the matthieu barret from Rhone. I told the waiter I prefer French wines, especially being at a French restaurant and this beverage didn't disappoint. It was a light bodied wine with a great bouquet that kept me guessing what flavors were prominent. The Syrah/Shiraz seemed to have hints of oak and cherries while other flavors I couldn't pick out but in a fun way. Our evening started with the \"crab fingers\". The crab was cooked perfectly however I there wasn't much meat on them and picking at the claw proved tedious and the chili oil was a bit hot. That said the curry leafe leche was a true delight. We also opted for the tuna tartare which was fresh but the salsa macha again seemed to be aped up on heat. More on the heat aspects later.    As for dinner my date and I both opted for the oxtail tagliatelle. Again, heat was the star of the dish. I then asked the waiter why every dish had such a heat signature and they said it's fusion to the local vibe. To me I can't take heat so it brings the occasion down. That said, there's a true skill in the dish as the oxtail was cooked to perfection. Tender and flavorful while the kale provided a nice flavor contract being sharp to cut the fat from the oxtail. The pasta was al dente and married well with the sauce. Besides the heat, this dish was outstanding! The waiter suggested a desert wine of Malvasia-trebbiano. I wasn't a fan but my date loved it. Also it paired wonderfully with the coffee semifreddo. This desert was classy, filling, not to sweet and a wonderful capper to the evening.   All said, I really enjoyed my experience at Lenoirs and I suggest this establishment to anyone that wants to add flair to a first date while not being pretentious. The food is skillfully crafted, the wait staff knows their restaurant and the ambiance is romantic. An inviting experience not to be missed."

Go for the HH for 1/2 bottle robes and great mixed drinks the watermelon chiller was pretty and refreshing.  We got the cab franc bottle and was light and paired well with our meals. - HH bread with pimiento was interesting  -HH shrimp boil was different with fresh shrimp and okra and corn and something crunchy on top  - lamb vindaloo was not spicy but tasty and oddly accompanied very well with the sliced watermelon  - mp bass with Goan crab curry was delightful and complex flavors to create a light main entree  Service was so friendly and just stellar and we enjoyed our culinary experience for 2 hours on a Thursday night and in no way felt rushed  Romantic and fun place to be.  Highly recommended!"

                "description": "The best meal we've had in Austin. We ordered the tasting menu ($58) and 2 bottles of wine.   The tasting menu kept us excited and pleased the whole way through. The opening items (an Amuse bouche of falafel-like crisps with a lovely sauce and a sashimi with a tangy sauce) were so good. Blew us away.   Personally, the third item, gnocchi, was not my favorite. It is made from corn flour, not potato, which is slightly off putting. My friend described it as enchilada in bite form. I liked the spinach.   The steak was amazing. I liked the texture and the taste. It had a lovely chimichurri like sauce with leeks. The cucumber salad bopped too.   Finally, the dessert -- light and pleasing. Highly recommend trying the tasting menu if you come."

                "description": "While visiting Austin, I chose Lenoir for a romantic vibe with a setting that felt uniquely \"Austin.\" We went with the chef's tasting menu and didn't look back. We received a selection of 5 dishes that we mostly would not have ordered on our own, and we loved each one. Each dish was full of pleasantly surprising flavors and they were all beautifully presented. The tasting menu also left us happily full without being overstuffed.   To go with our meal, we chose a bottle of wine from their ample selection. They also offer a few cocktails, beers, and some wine by the glass, but getting a bottle seems to be the way to go.    Our server, Dustin, was fantastic. He was very willing to hear any and all dietary restrictions or quirks, and was happy to work with the the couple that I mentioned. He was clearly passionate about everything on the menu and his excitement for what we chose showed. He even gave us great tips on places to check out in Austin later that night.   Dining at Lenoir was a highlight during the few days we spent in Austin, the food was phenomenal and the atmosphere was wonderful."

                "description": "The tasting menu was really good-- a lovely birthday dinner evening in a beautiful space (located right by a creek, so lots of mosquitos unfortunately).   FOOD: Delicious and thoughtful menu. We did the tasting menu for a birthday, and it took about 2 hours (we're quick eaters, too). They asked very intentionally at the beginning if we had any allergies and dietary restrictions, which was really thoughtful. Slight side note that the plates and serving ware was quite cute, which is just an ancillary sort of plus.  SERVERS: Speedy and really quite nice. They had recommendations, provided bug spray, were knowledgeable about the beverages. No complaints.  AMBIENCE: Currently (Oct 2021) only outdoor seating. It was well-lit and covered overhead. Quite good dinner date spot.   BATHROOMS: Gender neutral bathrooms indoors. It's may be a 50-ft walk to the bathrooms? Two single-person bathrooms. Clean, stocked. No complaints.  PARKING: A few (Like 10ish?) parking spots in a lot, otherwise I think it's street parking."

                "description": "Noticed they were doing their Chef's Tasting menu (five courses) for only $29 during January so booked a table the last weekend of the special.  The wine patio was a perfect happy hour spot pre-COVID, and so it's no shock that with a few finishing touches like a tent and heaters, it would make for a wonderful dinner experience, too.  Anthony was our server and he was so on top of it all night long. In addition to taking care of the dietary restrictions of some of the group, he also was very generous with the wine pours!  I can thankfully eat everything, but just want to give a hats off to the kitchen for accommodating the two gluten-free diners. They even made a special dessert for a friend that is allergic to eggs!  The menu was pretty stacked with seafood options which made it light but satisfying. I am not a huge oyster fan, but Sweet Home Alabama were theirs tasty! The tuna pappardelle was interesting...someone's hot take was that it reminded them of a more sophisticated tuna casserole. Impressive there was no dairy in the dish but it had a creamy, cheesy texture. My favorite was the seafood stew-esque dish with the delightful bread for dipping.   The $40 wine pairing was a steal! Not only were the pours accompanying each dish full (not a sissy tasting pour), but Anthony would just magically top off our glasses like a vino ninja, so I felt as if I had prob consumed an entire bottle by the end. And, definitely not mad at that!  While the half off special may not be a thing any longer, I still recommend visiting Lenoir for a nice dinner out, with all the precautions in place/being observed."

                "description": "Wow. I wasn't expecting to love this place so much but it was a fantastic experience all around.  The outdoor gravel patio is like sitting in someone's backyard under huge oak trees. They have simple lanterns strung from the tree branches and umbrellas all around. I loved the ambiance.   We ordered the tasting menu and the wine flight. The wine pairings were one of the best I've ever had. I'm not a fan of white wine but the owner picked the best French wines that paired perfectly with each course.   The first course was a hamachi crudo- perfectly light with subtle flavor.  Second course was a green bean salad- this was my favorite of the night. The beans were lightly pickled then charred and served on a yogurt queso fresco sauce- HEAVENLY. I make a mean green bean but theirs was the best I've ever had.  Third course was shrimp and vegetables. This was my least favorite, and it was still amazing.  Fourth course was the char siu and watermelon. Perfectly cooked and the balance of flavors was delicious. I was so full at this point but I still soldiered on.  Last course was ice cream with almond crumble. I'm not a fan of ice cream but this was really good.  Our server Quentin made our experience an unforgettable one. We'll be back for sure."

                "description": "Partner and I went to Lenoir for a date night. It's been a long time since I've dined here and didn't realize they had this nice spacious beer garden! They are offering 50% off their chef's tasting which is a 5 course tasting. They serve things family style and had an upgrade to a fish dish for an additional $25. Overall the dishes were good, though the beginning dishes were a little spicy and acidic. I very much enjoyed the whole fish that they mostly deboned. Dessert was a flan and churro-esque cookie that was a light way to end the meal.   During COVID it felt safe dining as it was outside and it was well spaced. They do have a covered area which unfortunately we didn't get to sit under. There was some light rain during the meal which they provided umbrellas for, but awkwardly we had to hold it up ourselves. Most tables had an umbrella but ours didn't."

Nothing else....a 1/4 head of cabbage. The sauce with it was good but who wants to eat just cabbage for a dish? The wine was so bad - even on its own but none of it paired with the dishes. We're coming from SF so we're spoiled but at least match the wine with the flavors of the dishes. We were still hungry after the tasting menu and ordered the tagliatelle - which was amazing. All in all, it was a letdown and we will not be back."

                "description": "Service: 5 Atmosphere: 4 Food: 3.5  Came for the January chef's tasting menu ($29) outside. Been wanting to try this place for some time so there were definitely some expectations after having seen and heard about it. Overall it was a good experience, but the food was not as great as expected.   Started with an oyster on the half shell - how can you go wrong with that? They did it perfectly.   Next up was a winter salad, which had beets, roasted butternut squash, some tomatoes, and beer infused peanuts; the peanuts were delicious, and the squash was nice; I didn't care too much for the texture but the flavor overall was decent and fresh.   A cooked \"salad\" was next with roasted broccoli, mushrooms, walnuts, and grapefruit, with melted taleggio cheese on the bottom. Interesting mix of flavors and textures, saltiness of the cheese and bitterness of the grapefruit were different, but the broccoli were very large pieces. Nice to try but probably not something I'd eat often.   The main dish was a baked fish with shrimp, arugula, and sliced radish in a tomato soup. TBH it was kind of underwhelming for the main dish and a bit too bitter and salty for my taste. The shrimp and fish were nicely cooked but not my favorite on flavor.   For dessert was a coconut cake, and a rice pudding. I didn't try the cake, and I know that rice pudding should be al dente, but this was a bit undercooked. It was nice of them to whip it up since I couldn't have the cake due to gluten, but it just wasn't that great unfortunately."

                "description": "This is a nice place with date vibes. The food was great , me and my partner decided to do chefs menu, pescatarian version. Started with hush puppies, strawberry aguachile, avocado tostada, large crab stuffed fish and citron cake.   One thing I'm confused about still is if we got one order of each or was it two servings as everything came in 1 plate for 2 people to share.   We additionally had Pullman bread and peach, strawberry cocktails. Everything was great.   Advice: ask if you opt for chef menu do you get 1 or 2 serving of the item when 2 people are eating. I believe we got only 1 per item to share in which case you are better off ordering from menu yourself rather than chefs choice."

I realize they can't remove patrons! But, we didn't have to wait that long and they seated us in a little area while we waited and gave us a pitcher of water (and two glasses!).  We opted for the the chef's menu and wine pairing. We really, really enjoyed it. the ambiance was specular, outside under the Live Oak trees and lanterns. The servers were excellent. We will be back to try other items on the menu. Honestly, we felt like we were on vacation."

                "description": "Went here on a whim. Overall i would recommend this place.   I'll start with the food.   We had the fried pickles and the wings (naked). The pickles were very good and the wings were a bit bland. For entrees we have the slider trio and the tacos (mahi and chicken). The slider trio was very very good. The BBQ was delicious, though the brisket was a little fatty. But the turkey and pulled pork with the bread combo were delicious. The tacos were also very good. The mahi was a little more spicy than expected but still good. We also had a few beers off the draft. Wish they had a little bigger selection here, but what they had was ok.   Staff.   They were very friendly. We sat at the bar as it was seat yourself anywhere in the place. Overall it was ok service. Would not say it was the best. Clearly they need more staff but i know how hard staffing is these days due to covid so i will not hold it against them. Though it did make getting food/drinks kind of slow but we were not in a hurry.   Cleanliness.   This is where i take a star. It was ok but the bathrooms men and women were gross and clearly ignored. The overall establishment just felt like it needed a good cleaning. While we were sitting at the bar a couple silver fish ended up crawling on me. Luckily this was at the end of my meal otherwise i have no idea what i might have done during. Cleanliness is important and an indicator of whether i would go back or not. I'll have to put some thought into it."

                "description": "Never heard of A TX Twinkie before so I had to give it a try; it's basically just a jalapeno popper. I was hoping it was a bit more cooked. I think it was underdone and too hard so it was a bit tough to eat.  The 2 plate bbq dish was good though, especially the brisket (how can you go wrong with brisket?). The \"coleslaw\" wasn't the best and could have used more seasoning and either a better vinegar or mayo base to give it a better texture.  The drinks are pretty good and their atmosphere is overall nice; would definitely go again and check out their HH menu."

                "description": "They no longer do bottomless mimosas! I came for that exact reason and was pretty disappointed when I found out they discontinued it. We instead ordered the mimosa carafe for $12. Presentation could have been better. They were just served in normal water glasses which made the mimosas go flat pretty quickly.  We ordered the Whiskey-infused Banana Bread French toast and the Eastside Benedict. Banana bread is on the crunchier side as opposed to fluffy (which I don't mind). My friend liked her benedict and thought the brisket was cooked well!  I was not blown away by any means, but I may come back another time to try out their dinner menu."

                "description": "I hate that this is one of the last remaining bottomless mimosa spots in Austin because I would give it lower than one star if I could. The food sucks, and the service is even worse. I came once during July 4thweekend, and it started pouring. Waiters would still bring food on trays that had an inch of water in it, and I was one of those unlucky ones who received food after it started raining. I asked the waiter if it was possible to return my food because it was drenched in rainwater, and he said it was too late because I had already ordered it. Excuse me?? I was genuinely shocked. I went downstairs to ask a manager if I could get a refund, and he said I would have to dispute it with the online ordering system company. Absolutely ridiculous. I couldn't say enough negative things about this establishment. Please, anybody else, do bottomless mimosas because I'm tired of having only this one crappy place be the go-to despite how terrible the service and food is."

There's a small parking lot where I was able to snag a spot so we are off to a good start! Music is good and service was nice and friendly.  Got the smoked wings for an appetizer and bottomless mimosas to start. The wings were good and the homemade bbq sauce was sweet tangy and a hint of spice, *chef kiss.

We asked for an umbrella, the server said she'll go check and when she came back she said they had broke? Then we asked if we could be switched tables and there was a big confusion between the servers. We were blamed for the confusion and on top of that the manager handled the situation really bad! She asked us to pay and box our food and leave, the way she talked to us was very unprofessional. Then the server confronted us and asked who was the one that got her in trouble and lied to the manager that we had cursed her out. LIES LIES LIES. Like really????  Overall POOR MANAGEMENT and HORRIBLE SERVICE.  On top of that the food was nasty!"

                "description": "Went today during brunch to celebrate my birthday and my experience was probably the worst I've ever had at any restaurant.  I asked the hostess to place us on the waitlist for a table inside and she tells me it'll be about 30 min wait. In the meantime, my party and I decided to sit outside and order a drink while we wait. We never got a text letting us know that a table was ready.   We stayed outside and ordered food. 3 of us ordered the chicken sandwich, one of us ordered the brunch burger, and another friend ordered the Brussel sprouts. Well, everyone got their food except me. I waited a little over an hour, asked 3 different waiters, until I finally got my food. My entire party was already done eating.   I had also ordered the bottomless mimosas, but I never received that either. Everyone at my table kept getting their drinks, while I was still waiting for mine. I got up, went downstairs, and asked the hostess if she could remove the mimosa from my tab since I never received it.   Food is ok, but service is TERRIBLE. Still can't believe how bad of an experience I had."

Anyway, we showed up to this place and we almost left because it was sooooo packed! It was during their famous brunch time, and so we had to get the mimosa carafe. We ended up changing seats when the bar opened up, so we'd have a view of the game. Loved all the ladies working there. They were nice, friendly, funny, and it made it such a fun day! We ate some loaded fries but added their brisket- omg so good! Also had some fried pickles, but forgot to take a photo."

It turns out that they do not do bottomless mimosas they just sell the bottle or glass by their price. So they should really take off their advertisement of $14 bottomless mimosas because we would have went elsewhere. When we were there, the app that they have went down, so everything was chaotic and no organization was there. My friends and I ordered food and drinks, my friends food came out but mine did not and it was a whole ordeal to get my food. I ended up having them box it up because my friends already finished their food because I didn't want them to wait for mine and have their food get cold. I spoke to the manager on shift and she basically was just trying to make excuses for all their mistakes rather than just own up to them and apologize for all the miscommunication going on that day. Katie, the server, who wasn't even our server, was AMAZING. She was the only one who truly cared about our problems going on and she will literally be the only reason we would ever come back to this place. She should be placed in management. If you do visit here, ask for Katie to be your server because then you will have a great experience for sure!"

You have to order and pay through an application which removed the ability to receive our meal in courses. We got appetizers and meal all at once. It took over 45minutes to get our food which was subpar. The cornbread was completely burned. The BLT sandwich literally had one slice of bacon and the queso was lukewarm. This is a foodie town and today's experience was below quality considering citywide options."

This review reflects the nonsensical reservation system that requires one to email (not call... email) 24 hours in advance. I emailed a bit over 24 hours ahead and they said that my requested time wasn't available, which makes no sense if reservations are indeed only taken 24 hours in advance. We were seated outside in the baking sun with no umbrella because they are a \"liability.\" We were told that outside seating with shade was completely reserved which again makes no sense because we again emailed over 24 hours ahead of time. We were also told that there was no inside seating and that they \"can't control the weather.\" It's Texas in April, you need to provide people with some kind of shade. Disappointing as this used to be a favorite bottomless brunch spot. No bottomless, no logical reservation system. Go somewhere else."

                "description": "I've been to Corner 3 times now. If you need a place where you can get a table fast especially for a large party this is an easy choice. Service is great too. They serve you fast. As far as food, it is sub-par. I got the oven roasted chicken this time. Chicken was very dry. Didn't pair well with the quinoa which is also very dry. I wouldn't get again. I got a glass of Sauvignon Blanc. Our table shared the chips and dip trio for an appetizer. It was good. Good size for price. Probably won't be back until they update their menu or improve food.   Pros: great service and fast seating for large parties  Cons: food is bland and boring"

                "description": "The warm chocolate cake is chocolate lava cake, unfortunately by the time they top it with salted caramel and whipped cream and powder sugar it's too sweet and I couldn't finish it. We were given the chips and corn dip for checking in on Yelp that was quite good, the chips are thin and crispy, good chips.  My favorite thing was the spicy deviled eggs, the sauce it comes on is delicious and there is a thin sliced of fried jalapeño on top and it provides a nice little crunchy bite.  I ordered an americano with my dessert and was very disappointed , it tasted so acidic and gross. Nit good coffee.  The service is good hear though.  I forgot to take a photo but I had the Caroline salad with salmon on top, not a great salad, just a bunch of mixed greens salad with a few blueberries and cheese . Thought it tasted boring and not super fresh. Quite disappointed."

                "description": "Though it's a hotel restaurant, it's actually pretty good.  Well crafted cocktails and lots of delicious bites to share.  An outside table is especially nice for people watching.  House-Made Zucchini Cornbread: Comes in a cast iron skillet with a nice crispy top.  Underneath is a warm moist grainy cornbread that goes excellent with the butter on the side.  There were green bits in there, but you won't even notice it's zucchini thankfully.  Burnt Ends: An often overlooked meat that is so good!  Came in cubes that were well cooked and nice and tender.  Seemed more wet than typical BBQ, so maybe it was braised?  Either way, it tasted so rich and so delicious against those little dinner rolls.  Three Dips and Chips: I got this for the queso.  And the queso kinda tasted like the traditional Velveeta variety.  It hit the spot for sure, but wasn't anything original/innovative.  Beef Barbacoa Tacos: A huge amount of meat.  Especially loved the crispy shallots on top to give it a nice crunch.  The herbal chimichurri was a great pairing too.  Pork Carnitas Tacos: Very porky and very meaty.  Didn't quite have that fried (after braising) texture that some some carnitas does.  But was still delicious.  Shrimp and Grits: The grits were smooth and creamy.  The shrimp was big and plump, but kinda bland / unseasoned.  Though the tomato sauce on the edges of the grits helped liven it up.  Warm Pecan Brownie: Wow, this was delicious!  It managed to have a lot of delicious crispy edges but also warm gooey center.  And the fresh Texas pecans, way better than when brownies use bitter walnuts.  Really great with ice cream.  Tres Leches: Came in a little mason jar with a smear of dulce de leche on top.  The cake seemed firmer and less soaked than other tres leches I've had before that is just swimming in cream.  But it was moist enough.  And the bites with dulce de leche tasted great."

                "description": "Although this place looked good online, eating here was the by far worst restaurant/bar experience I have had in Austin. My friend and I are visiting from out of town, we sat at the inside bar. We were never greeted by an employee. A bartender handed us menus without saying a word 15 minutes after we sat. Taking our order and getting waters took 30 minutes (the bar was not busy). The food was really sub par, we had to wait for the manager to bring us silverware because the bartender never returned to check on us. With all of the great food and hospitality we've experienced here in Austin we were really disappointed with how the staff here operated. Don't go here!"

Beer selection was great! I ordered the Shishito Peppers two ways, they were the best I've ever had. I regret not ordering the seven layer salad after seeing a few pass by while I was sitting at the bar. I got the barbacoa style tacos and they were loaded with meat. Besides the overload of tender beef-no real other flavor enhancers involved. My boyfriend ordered the egg white omelette. The dish was just ok. Great ambiance and the hotel connected is gorgeous."

The vibe and atmosphere is really warm and cozy and both the drinks and the appetizers (we ordered the nachos and cornbread) were very delicious so it made for a good outing with friends. The server was also polite and efficient. However, the main entrees left much to be desired. The salmon, chicken sandwich and shrimp and grits were all only OK and definitely not worth the prices they were charging. Overall, this is a great spot if you just want to chill with a group of friends and just do some drinks and appetizers."

                "description": "Been here on several occasions and never disappoints. My plus one almost always goes w the chipotle honey glazed salmon dish and I usually hop around the menu to try new dishes. We always get the trio chips and dip that comes w queso, salsa, and guacamole. We also did try the winter cocktails this time around with the spiced winter old fashioned, very aromatic and delicious. This particular visit I tried the braised wagyu beef tips w a mashed purée and mushrooms. It was very soft, tender, and rich in flavors. I loved that the mash soaked up all the juice and flavors. The roasted vegetables had a rustic approach and although flavorful I wouldn't have missed them on the dish. If you do try the restaurant also be aware you can go into the hotel lobby for a nice lounge feel and casual seating post dinner."

                "description": "I really want to enjoy this place. The first few times I came here it was top notch, but it was also weekday lunches for work. I came recently for lunch on a Friday and they had a limited menu. Came two days later for dinner and AGAIN they have a limited menu. Annoying but nothing one can do about it, apparently they do this any time the hotel is over sold. However, they did serve me 100% raw salmon the last time I ordered it here. It took 20 minutes to get another, and it was the worst meal I've had here unfortunately. My frequenting this establishment will now be limited to booze, apps, or the grouper only (when they have it on the menu...?)  Service is good and drinks are great, people watching is superior. Go for drinks."

The Chicken Sandwhich  gets a rating of 3.5/5 the chicken was cooked well, veggies were fresh, and the fries were meh (average).   The zucchini gets a rating of 2.5/5 with the use of the butter  without the butter it's a 2/5. The zucchini makes it unique but the cornbread itself was a little bland.

I definitely appreciate the flavor pairings... there was good flavor there and it was on a good bun. The issue is I received cold chicken that seemed like it was sitting there awhile. Who wants cold and old crispy chicken? My sandwich wasn't warm at all. My to go box had a pickle in it that was sitting on my fries so that caused the bottom part of my bun to be soggy and some of the fries. They placed the burger on top of the pickle... seems a bit careless."

So my friend and I walked down the street and found Corner! A blessing in disguise. They seated us right away! The wait staff was a little on the slower end but it looked like our waitress was the only one covering the outdoor section, so I understand! No problem there.   I am bumping off one star because the food was pricey pricey as well as the drinks. I ordered the Jalapeño Honey Mustard Grouper which was very good but didn't knock my socks off. The cocktails were crafted well and tasty but also pretty expensive compared to other places."

If it's late, you're hungry, and you can only sit inside? Keep walking down the street and find somewhere else. Food was average at best, but with an upscale price tag and the service was friendly, but sooooo s-l-o-w. We got to the point where we debated throwing in the towel and hitting up Whataburger and when we finished our meal we wished that is what we had done.

The food was surprisingly good and our service was awesome. We ordered the nachos (huge portions and our favorite!), burnt ends, and vegetarian tacos. Everything was pretty tasty and came out quickly. The restaurant seems to be pretty large and has a cool indoor/outdoor patio setup too. I'd recommend checking this place out if you're wandering around downtown and looking for a decent spot for food and drinks."

Finally got someone's attention and they told us not the entrance! Turns out we had to walk length of building to go to hostess stand. It is a hotel bar in jw Marriott. Since our interaction outside was less then stellar we chose to eat inside. (Btw several empty tables outside!) inside had large bar and both booths and tables  Good choice. Attentive waiter. (CA guy new to Austin) Nice atmosphere. Tried crunchy fish and pork carnitas. Heavy on pork meat( if you like meat) and fish had bite to it. Both very good I tried bees knees drink very tasty  I would go back!"

The burnt ends were not as crispy as I liked and a little to fatty for my taste. The Brussels sprouts were good but didn't have enough little pieces of pancetta. The staff was overall friendly for the most part. We had to find a place at the bar top since all the tables were full. It was the end of the night and we stayed till last call."

My mom and I discovered this place when we were looking for restaurants with gluten free options and I'm so glad we gave it a try.  To start off, I got the Pinthouse chop salad. This has to be the best darn chopped salad I've ever had. All of the ingredients were adequately chopped up and had just the right amount of dressing. I daydream about how good this salad is.  I also ordered the honey pear pizza on gluten free crust and WOW- what a genius combination! The sweet pears complement the prosciutto, balsamic, and basil so well. It was like a symphony in my mouth.   I love the patio area- just the right amount of sun hits it.   This is an Austin staple for me and I'll keep bringing friends and family here. Next time I'll have to try a beer on tap while watching a sports game and chowing down on amazing pizza."

They offer pretty unique pizza flavors, and this time I tried out the Honey Pear (8.5/10) and Shroomin' Goat (7/10). The Honey Pear was a nice contrast of savory and sweet, without being overly sweet. I'm a huge fan of honey on pizza, so this was definitely a good choice! The Shroomin' Goat has crumbles of goat cheese, with lots of greens and mushrooms. I liked this pizza, but it was a bit too salty for me, and I wish it had more balanced out flavors.   I ordered a medium pizza (~$20) with half of each topping, and I'm glad I got to try out both combinations! The medium pizza, by the way, is huge and more than enough for one person. I was pretty full after three pieces but am happy to take home leftovers. The place also has a nice bar area that has pretty well-priced beers and ciders. There's a blood orange cider that I tried, which was really good. Overall, definitely recommend Pinthouse for anyone who wants a chill, fun pizza and beer night!"

                "description": "Between the 2 of us, we got 2 smalls, and it was plenty to share! Thin crust, very crispy, very fresh! Pretty cheap for great pizza! You can get 2 different kinds on a pizza, even a small!  Small 10\" - $8-8.50 Medium 14\" - $16-17 Large 16\" - $19.50-20.50  In order of favorite pizza: Cannonball and The Works (tied), then The Hoe Down and all a'sprout it (bf doesnt care for goat cheese though).  **CANNONBALL (like a meat lover's)- Red sauce, house cheese blend, pepperoni, bacon, local crumbled sausage, Canadian bacon. Very good. Very crispy.   **THE WORKS (like a Supreme)- Red sauce, house cheese blend, pepperoni, Canadian bacon, local crumbled sausage, green peppers, garlic, mushrooms, red onions.  Good, basic supreme pizza  THE HOE DOWN- Red sauce, house cheese blend, roasted red peppers, roasted CAULIFLOWER, roasted GARLIC, RICOTTA, pepita PESTO. Kind of expected more out of this bc I love roasted cauliflower and ricotta. It was good but probably pass next time.   ALL A'SPROUT IT (monthly pizza) - roasted BRUSSELS SPROUTS, caramelized onions, savory BACON, GOAT CHEESE, BALSAMIC reduction. Love goat cheese and roasted Brussels sprouts. However, this was good but passable.   **My bro's favorite is HONEY PEAR-  Extra virgin olive oil, house cheese blend, sliced pear, caramelized onions, blue cheese, prosciutto, basil, local honey. I will try this next time even though I'm not a big fan of blue cheese."

For starters; MAKE A RESERVATION/JOIN THE WAITLIST ONLINE when you're on the way so you don't have to stand outside and wait in texas' jank weather.  They have a beautiful variety of locally brewed beers that are solid and also go on sale during happy hour!  Interior is a ton of long tables which are perfect for groups.   Great innovative flavor combinations across the menu for pizzas. Would recommend."

My husband and I stopped in for a drink since we had dined earlier next door and didn't want to overpay for another drink. In retrospect we should of dined here instead because the prices were way better and it smelled amazing.  Anyway, the bar area was nice and plenty of places to stand and or sit in the dining area. The food smelled so good and would love to grab a slice and a drink next time while here. They have gluten free options to include side and pizzas."

                "description": "We ordered ahead on their website right when it opened at 11 AM. We got a medium honey pear ($17) and a medium banh mi ($16).   Banh mi: the pickled red onions were the star of the show for me. The flavors of the toppings do remind me of banh mi. I would eat this one again for sure. The sriracha on it was a nice touch. It had a good balance of acid, spice, and freshness.  Honey pear: this flavor surprised me in a good way. I just gave this place 4 stars since I thought the toppings on this pizza was lacking a bit as I felt that there was a bit too much crust at the edges, especially compared to the banh mi pizza. I feel like the topping placement could have been more even - some slices didn't have much else besides caramelized onions.  We ordered ahead, and then just picked up our pizza from them and sat down in the store. This place has no waiter, you just order from a counter. The seating is very homey since it's a lot of big tables and bench seats."

Their innovative twists on a classic dish was truly incredible from the first bite when the diversity of flavors exploded on my tastebuds. Also, the price was phenomenal for the amount you get. One small pizza was MORE than enough to fill me up and leave me beyond satisfied. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying all their specialty pizzas. If you're looking for something incredible and affordable, this restaurant is an absolute MUST. Innovative, fresh, affordable, and delicious; it can't get any better."

They really enjoyed the music, loved the food, and liked the variety of draft beer. The people at the bar were really nice and offered assistance with picking different beers for our flight. The lady taking our food order was in a bad mood, but that shouldn't take away from the restaurant's review.  Will definitely be back."

The chips and salsa could have bought at the convenience store across the street as there was no creativity for $6.  The pretzel and pizzas were top notch.  We tried several of the beers over the course of two visits in two days.  All were really good and I would have the. Again if I ever go back.  The beer bases are awesome as well.

Their crust sets them apart from other 'za joints and they craft brews are right up their with any of the big guys (if you know, you know!).   During Covid quarantine, I have been taking advantage of their online beer release ordering and curbside pickup. Yay! Really hope this \"new\" process doesn't change. I also discussed they sell their dough to go, so I've been getting more creative in my own kitchen making pretzels and other yummies.   What else can I say? Nothing really, except go...just go! If you haven't yet, you're sadly missing out on this Austin institution.   Congrats on all the expansion and continues success Pinthouse! Cheers!"

Pictured is The Works and it wasn't anything special in my opinion. But I will always go back!! For Honey Pear  Note: Happy hour is M-F from 4-6pm and its $2 off pints of PHP beer as well as $2 off beer mates (cheesy garlic bread). Only complaint is I drink beer too slowly so maybe next time I'll order 2 before happy hour ends ;)"

For example, my friend convinced me to try the honey pear pizza (I was suspicious but got it anyways), the tanginess of the pear with the sweetness of the honey and caramelized onion, with the saltiness of the prosciutto made it one of my all time favorites! Of course, they have \"regular\" pizzas as well, which were also quite delicious. PHP is also a brewery. I won't claim to be a beer connoisseur (it was good beer, that's all I can say), but the combination of beer and pizza here is amazing! Great laid back atmosphere with excellent pies."

Last time I was there, they let me know that my pizza wasn't to their standards because the dough had bubbled up a bit too much and caused some of the cheese to pool in places. I would've eaten it happily anyways, but they promised to bring me another, better pie after a while. They did bring one, but it still wasn't quite right to them, so they brought it to me in a to-go box, and promised to get the next one right. A little later, they brought out the \"perfect honey pear\" alongside a $20 gift card for my patience. I've never had a staff go so above and beyond for me! Always feel taken care of here, and always leave feeling wonderful.  Thanks, Pinthouse!!"

It looks chaotic at first but if you take the time to look, you'll see it's actually quite interesting and there's a lot to see.  Spokesman - Highland is neatly tucked away in an industrial cul de sac that is next to a milk factory (yes, you read that right), but more importantly a brewery! There's a few parking spots right in front so I was able to snag one and walk up the few steps to get here. Their menu is immediately to your right and you can walk up to the counter to order.  I love how high the ceilings were and the back glass windows give you a sneak into the rock climbing gym business. Take the time to walk upstairs and grab a seat for a more intimate feel. Just be aware there weren't many outlets on the second floor, so plan accordingly!  Now for those of us that need a bite, they do have breakfast tacos and a few other items to munch. My beverage of choice was their cold brew black and damnnnn was this a clean roast. It wasn't watered down whatsoever and genuinely enjoyed both glasses.  It was nice to see minimalism yet artistic industrial feel to this coffee shop. I'll definitely be back."

I got myself an oat latte and I was really disappointed since the barista had made such a nice leaf design. My coffee came out tasting sour so it was definitely under extracted and the oat milk itself tasted watery. The latte reminded me of the coffee I get in hotel rooms from a Keurig machine.

                "description": "Entertainment value - Five Stars  Coffee - Two Stars  Long Term Place to Work - Two Stars  Keep Austin Weird - Six Stars  **********  Spokesman Coffee is for all intents and purposes an appendage of the Crux Climbing Center next door.   This is one of those artificial rock wall centers   Where people learn how to climb mountains   Being able to fall on to a mat rather than off of a cliff.  The second floor has huge wrap around windows where you can see the climbers in action.  Watching the climbers is like watching blooper out-takes from American Ninja.  People are just learning how to climb the rock walls.  Climbing rock walls is hard.  There are a lot of shenanigans trying to get up to the next nub.  There are a lot of shenanigans trying to stay on the old nub.  People go down a lot.  They go down a lot in harmless but entertaining ways.  For artistic contrast, there are also the buff ballet dancers of the indoor climbing world.  They are elegant, athletic, and can do all sorts of suave sophisticated moves.  They look even more elegant and athletic because Zeppo and Mimi,   Both Rank 1 Amateurs,   Are doing Three Stooges stuff trying to get up to the third nub.  * * *  If you are not here to watch the Brave Buffoons Falling Off the Wall Show,  then the stock of Spokesman goes way down.  The coffee is terrible.  I had an almost tasteless espresso. The taste that was there was less than wonderful.  My wife did not finish her cafe au lait.  She didn't like the coffee itself.  She didn't like the sweetened alt-milk that had been put in it.  Breakfast tacos were acceptable, but not worth leaving the house for.  As a work place, the tables are very very small.  You will work hard to fit your coffee, your food and your laptop all on the same postage stamp.  Worse - most seating stations have no backs.  This is by probably by design.  They don't have many seats.  They want to encourage you to move along   So someone else can buy some coffee and pay the rent.  There are also some people who can work on backless stools for hours.  I am not one of them.  My lower back gives out over time.  My back gives out over time because of the unusually weighty thoughts I have while I write.  These require extra furniture support.   If you don't like the previous explanation,   You can go with Samuel C. being old and washed up.  He needs a chair so he doesn't fall over while drooling.  Either way, if I am going to get work done, I am going to need better furniture.  Internet provision is very good though.  Give Spokesman credit for that.  The spray paint job on the walls?  All the more reason to watch the climbers.  If you look at the walls, you could hurt your eyes.  * * *  Overall, there are more negatives than positives at Spokesman.  But watching the climbers IS a riot.  If you are working on your grand masterpiece on \"THE DECLINE AND FALL\"  You might be able to do that here.  You can write about the climbers falling off the rock face.  You can write about yourself falling off your stool.  You can write about your espresso cup falling off your microtable.  You can write about how standards in coffee making have fallen off.  If you are there to study for your chemistry exam at ACC,   Your grades may end up falling off too."

The spray paint decor really works and the space is cozy but a good place to work in if you need a place to study or work remote.   The drinks at the Spokesman are excellent. I ordered a caramel iced latte and it was very good. The milk options are on the lower end (whole, almond, oat), but the coffee is clean and flavorful and the caramel sweet enough but not overpowering. That said, prices are on the high side for a drink, especially for the size of the drink. It's definitely treat or entertainment coffee and not an everyday affair. Still, when those times roll around, more than happy to get my pick me up at the Spokesman."

My hubby said his americano was the good stuff too. The space is edgy modern cool. Small stools are not comfy. Tables super small. Fun to watch the climbing gym. Close to Blue genie if you are out shopping over their next few weeks holiday bazaar."

                "description": "My friend and I came in today, and we were so impressed with their coffee! It's not frequent that we take a sip of our drinks and comment in amazement, but that was exactly what we did when we picked up our coffee. My iced matcha latte was definitely on the expensive side (~$6) and came in a pretty tiny cup, but it was one of the best matcha lattes I've ordered in Austin. My friend ordered a drip coffee, and he said the acidity and balance was perfect.   The inside of Spokesman is really unique! It seems like a great place to study, and they're open later than many other Austin coffee shops. I would definitely come back again."

                "description": "Great coffee spot sandwiched between Crux, the Brewtorium, and then Blue Genie off to the side. Parking is a plenty, outside seating is kind of not. It's just a couple picnic benches. Inside you can sit upstairs and overlook Crux. The decor is pretty interesting, it's basically a bunch of graffiti but only in black spray paint.  Coffee is pretty solid. I picked up a bag of their Ethiopian beans. It's good but the notes aren't as strong as I hoped. They open relatively late and close early compared to other places. But that's ok because once they close you can move it next door to the Brewtorium!"

                "description": "One of my new favorite places to get coffee. They brought samples into my work and I've started going since then. Im not sure what roast the cold brew is I feel like it's a lighter one but it gives it a nice flavor while black. It's pretty smooth compared to a few places I've been. They serve vegan tacos which is great and delicious, on the flip side their vegan coffee cake isn't that good. Maybe it needs to be warmed up? I'm not sure. The option to choose your espresso for lattes is amazing and one of my favorite things about this place. You can tell the beans here are quality just from opening and smelling inside the coffee bag if you buy one. I'll be coming more often."

                "description": "Visited their new location today and was greeted by two very sweet and welcoming baristas!   I got an iced pumpkin spice latte (the gourdon ramsay) because it was such a warm day but I recommend trying it hot for the best experience, especially if you appreciate milk texture and want an enhanced flavor of the spices! (Can't go wrong though!)   Same amazing art and vibes as the Elmo location. This space feels a little smaller, but they have an upstairs area. Tables are nice and spaced out, and there's hand sanitizer near the front. :)   Stop by if you're in the area! Might be a little difficult to find at first, but if you're on airport, turn on denson dr and then onto Dillard Cir. There's plenty of parking on the street facing the store."

                "description": "Stopped in this afternoon for the first time. This location is great, across from ACC and next to Blue Genie and a climbing gym and brewery.   I had an iced mocha, I usually get it with skim milk but they didn't have that so it was extra creamy than I usually get, super delicious. If you stay in for your visit they have glassware to serve drinks In.   Nice patio out front, and seating on 2 levels inside. Plenty of room to spread out. Free WiFi. Bike racks in front of the shop and I saw plenty of parking but I bet it's tight on the weekend. Inside had music playing but not too loud. You could have a private conversation with no problem.   Covid safety: all employees were masked up, customers need to a mask inside except when eating or drinking.   I like this place and it's close to home, I will be back for sure."

                "description": "My wife and I have been on a question to try as many coffee shops as we can in Austin. Since moving here from Chicago during the summer, we've made our way through our list at a pretty good clip. I'm not sure how Spokesman wasn't on our radar until this week, but boy am I glad we found it. We took advantage of the baby's nap time to walk with her and make the 1.5-mile trek over to their new location off Highland.  What we found was an awesome environment, delicious coffee, and two super friendly baristas.  Kudos to both of them for the engaging conversation on snow, Houston, and peppermint mochas -- and most importantly, for the delicious coffee. If mgmt is reading this, it was the two baristas whoring on the morning of 1/18. One of them was subbing in from another one of your locations.  I can't wait to go back."

I used to manage a place like this and can tell you that for certain my experience would've been more enjoyable if she would've suggested something. Nonetheless she was super friendly!"

                "description": "Been here a few times. I must say that the waiters and waitresses here are phenomenal. During my most recent experience our waitress was Karisha.  Late 30s early 40s generation like me will LOVE the music selection here - I felt like they were playing my old playlists from high school or something!   (And they actually have a barcode to listen to their playlist on Spotify which I thought was cool)  I ordered the 20 oz ribeye. (I had a very paltry breakfast and had recently worked out so my body was lusting for some bovine carnage)  My better half ordered truffle fries and the Gardein Buffalo chicken - which she absolutely loved - and trust me that's a rare sight - so Thank You Yard House!  Meanwhile, this steak had everything I hoped for - it was bone-in, juicy and cooked to perfection. The server even asked me to cut into it to ensure it was to my liking - I had to ask her to repeat herself because I've never had someone ask me before.. how thoughtful! And cut into it I did, again and again until all that was left was the bone.   The Parmesan mashed potatoes were also scrumptious! Just the right texture and not too cheesy at all, the right touch of Parmesan.   Oh and there was also the healthy baby broccoli. The heads were very good, the stem was a little tough for me to chew but that's probably because they are grilled (as opposed to steamed) but that's fine because I usually only eat the heads anyways.   I don't usually drink but they are supposed to have a large selection on tap as well as bottled beers. I had the Heineken 0 (0% alcohol) and for those who used to drink Heineken I recommend it because it tastes exactly like the real thing! I was amazed they had it, so I guess there's something for everyone here.  I think this place is a keeper and I will return to see what other delicious adventures are lurking inside that menu. I've had the steak bowl before and it always hits the spot! The burgers are also delicious - though sadly I'm watching my carb intake recently.   In the end, you can't go wrong with this place! It can get pretty busy but all you have to do is give your name and number and they text you when your table is ready! Just go walk to Restoration Hardware and look at extremely expensive furniture you'll never buy in the meantime or stroll on over to Amazon books and play with their toys :) the possibilities are endless"

                "description": "I have always seen this place but never really made it in until recently. I will add the disclaimer that we did go during SXSW as well as Spring break. On top of understanding most places are dealing with coming out of covid restrictions and labor storages.  We went while walking around the Domain. It was busy, but not packed. We were sat with no wait, but then sat for almost 15 min before someone came to greet us and get our drink order. We had already decided on trying several of the apps and then maybe splitting a pizza. So we ordered our apps with our drinks. We got the pretzel, edamame, cheese curds, and calamari. Another 10 min go by and our drinks (literally a coke, water, and tea) are finally brought and the food about 15 min later. We didn't see our server again. Calamari was very rubbery and cold and bland. The pretzel was ok on it's own but the beer cheese they made with it was really beer forward and couldn't taste much else. The cheese curds were a little over cooked but not horrible. And the edamame was almost inedible. A different server came after about 45 min and asked if we wanted refills, our glasses being empty for more than 30 min. We decided to not order the pizza and just pay and leave.  I gave them 3 stars because like I said I totally understand the staff shortages and it being SXSW and all that. But really not great food or service. Their bar menu looked very detailed for those who drink, and we might give them a shot later down the road to see if things are better without a big event going on. But not any time soon."

                "description": "We've come here almost every week, sometimes multiple times a week since we moved to Austin 3 months ago. The hours are great and the food has always been good, you get a full menu and happy hour specials. I'm not sure if we've been here any other Sunday but this past Sunday the food was absolutely awful. I'm not sure if the head chef, kitchen manager, etc. is off or what but both our meals and appetizer tasted like they were microwaved leftovers.   We got the ahi tuna and it was very strange this time, so strange I didn't want to really eat it but the portion was so small this time we just ate it. I guess that kind of shows we're really not picky so when I say something was terrible it's really-really bad. I know anyone reading this will say that's your fault for getting ahi tuna from a sports bar but we've got it dozens of times and it was always surprisingly good. The tuna sandwich and poke nachos are great as well, but we didn't get them this time. We did get the fish and chips and the hot chicken sandwich. The fish was 100% microwaved, it was rubbery and had no crisp to the breading so they're dead giveaways. Also, the coleslaw was brown so that was nice. The chicken sandwich tasted nothing like the chicken sandwiches we've had from there before, and the taste of this one was not pleasant. We still ate most of our food so I wasn't going to complain that it was terrible unless our waitress asked and to my surprise she never did. lol. I think she knew so she avoided that question.   The cocktails and beer selection is great from here and they make great drinks for a sports bar. During happy hour they have small discounts on drinks and larger discounts on food. I don't remember what they all are but I know the cocktails are 2 dollars off, nothing crazy but hey I'll take it. I ordered my first cocktail during happy hour and about 30-40 minutes later another. The waitress took my order for the drink and came back later maybe 10-15 minutes and asked if I still want the drink I ordered. I was confused and said yeah so another 10 minutes or so I got my drink. My girlfriend was on her phone and noticed she came back to ask right after 11 PM when happy hour is done. So I was charged 2 dollars extra for one drink, I could care less. But it was really weird for her to do that.   I don't think we'll stop coming here because of our bad experience. I figured I would take my time to at least let the establishment know of our experience. So they can improve - if they want to. I know a lot of restaurants have staffing issues and there is a massive amount of competition in Austin. A bad meal isn't the end of the world by any means."

I got the KBBQ Cheesesteak sandwich, which had decent flavors and nice presentation. I would personally have preferred a stronger tasting gochujang sauce, but it was still tasty as is. My friend got the whiskey salmon, which had great sauce! The sweetness and whisky flavors mixed very well. I had a pretty good experience overall and was really happy with the atmosphere and waiters! Tim and Noah, you guys were cool!  I also had Yard House in the past once at maybe 1am and ordered their pepperoni mushroom pizza and Margherita pizza, both which tasted great! Definitely a great meal after being out with friends. Would recommend as a fun, laidback place to eat and drink!"

But if it's outside the HH time, I this it's bit pricey.  Chicken nachos: skimpy on the chicken and too much of sour cream.  Korean chicken wings: it was pretty good, it had a nice hint with a hint of sweetness and our kiddo loved it.  Onion rings: I mostly don't like onion rings because it's greasy and feels heavy, but at the YH, it's light, crispy and non greasy.  Chicken strips: chicken strips comes with the small basket of fries, chicken stripes itself doesn't have much flavors or seasoning, but it's good if you dip it in some sauce.  They don't have online reservations, so that sucks. Ordering and paying is with the tablet they have on the table and that's not convenient either, we had to try atleast 4-5 times for payment to go through and it's so confusing, otherwise everything else is good."

To our left.. a couple to our right and a blind date across the way. I feeds everyone's needs.

Jez I wish I can remember the name... any who, he's gave himself a sample and that was the end of that.  Also, we ordered shots and I ordered a dirty martini.  EVERY.  SINGLE.  DRINK.  Was delicious haha. But also, he was  good company and made sure we're taken care of.   Pros: EVERYTHING!!!! FOOD IS ON ANOTHER LEVEL.  CHEERS TO THE KITCHEN  Cons: nothing. And I always find something that can be"

In case you didn't know, during happy hour all their apps are half off.! Unfortunately I only took pictures of the calamari and nachos, however some of my appetizer favorites are the ahi sashimi, poke nachos, fried calamari, and the chicken lettuce wraps. I also like the chicken nachos, classic sliders, and have heard great things about the cheese curds. Often times, I come here for the happy hour and don't even end up ordering an entre just get a few half priced apps!"

The waitress that assisted me was attentive, knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. My order came out in a timely manner. I ordered blackened shrimp tacos that came with rice and beans. The sauce that is on the tacos is spicy. For my drink I ordered a Sangria. The food and drink were great!   I sat outside on the patio because it was a nice day outside. The patio is a nice size that has a lot of tables. The restrooms were clean and they are unisex. It's a parking garage across from Yard House which is convenient."

The drinks were pretty and tasty cocktails, the poke nachos are always delicious and we went w our usual favorites there, mine was the carnivore pizza and his was the spicy jambalaya. Overall a nice chill vibe and atmosphere and nice little stop in the domain."

Finally, last night I had dinner at the Yard, and was so pleased.  First, Miguel, our  young wonderful Server who was just the BESTEST-helpful, kind and patient.  You couldn't ask for more.  Second, the food, the appetizers, buffalo wings and Sushi Nachos were so impressive, fresh and tasty.  The bacon cheese burger were amazing.  Good beef, and delicious fries.  Of course the Beer was good too, and cold.  All in all I am already planning my return until I sampled everything on the menu that appeals to me."

                "description": "SHAKE IT TILL YOU MAKE IT!   After dinner last night we decided on going bar hopping. I really don't know the places to go so I trusted my brother and his girlfriend's opinions here. They wanted to show me the places where they have gone on dates and enjoyed.   Whiskers was one of the first stops we made after dinner. My brother told me that this bar had plenty of different rooms that you could go into. So we first walked around and went into each of the rooms before ordering some drinks.   Me being the smart 25 year old that I am decided for the evening since I had already had vodka at dinner I was going to only drink white liquor for the evening because I did not want to screw myself and be really hungry over when my parents got here the next day. (HAHA)!   I looked over the seasonal menu and decided on the Sage Advice drink! It had citrus juices in it as well as vodka. And it was spectacular. All of the flavors in this beverage complimented each other very well. It is definitely one of those drinks I would classify as dangerous. If you had a few of those you might be on the floor. It honestly tastes like juice. So one too many might lead to you not being able to walk. So just be warned.   The inside of the bar was decorated for christmas. They went all out. There were chandeliers at the bars and lights everywhere and even one big christmas tree all decorated in white lights.   It is definitely one of those bars that you need to check out next time you are in Austin. I have only seen it with the holiday decor, but I am sure they decorate it all out for other holidays as well!   The staff and service was great! Very quick and easy. It is a busy bar so you might have to wait a few minutes to get a bartenders attention. But it it all worth it at the end of the night!"

                "description": "An East Austin staple with an eclectic and quirky décor.  If you are looking for a quiet, stuffy cocktail bar, this place is not what you're looking for (at least on the weekends). I would characterize it as sort of a slightly dressed up dive bar with some very unique vibes. The interior has the feeling of an old wild west sort of saloon, crossed with an old cathedral, crossed with an old hunting lodge. Past patrons have written messages on the walls and it is interesting reading some of their musings while sipping on an old fashioned. The exterior bar is fairly standard, although there is a random bath tub located in the middle of the backyard area, which is another interesting quirk.  Generally, the cocktails here are quite good; sometimes they pre-make the cocktails in a larger batch, cutting down on the wait time a bit. My experience has generally been positive with the pre-made cocktails.  One downside here is that it is very popular and is therefore quite crowded much of the time. During the busiest hours on weekend nights, you can expect to encounter a line to get in and another line to get drinks. That said, if you're with the right company, a few minutes wait for cocktails is pretty tolerable.  If you are visiting Austin, this is one good spot to check out to experience the \"charm\" of the area. Additionally, being on 6th, this place is very walkable to other bars and makes for a great place to start or end the night."

There is plenty of space downstairs, but if you really enjoy Mezcal head upstairs to the tasting room where an expert will line you up with a tasting based on your preference. A must visit in Austin."

Came here on a Saturday afternoon and had the best time getting some drinks while sitting on the patio. The bartenders are awesome and extremely helpful when ordering.   We ordered a few drinks, and we loved each one of them! They even offer happy hour 2-5 daily which includes an old fashioned, a gin lavender drink, mule, and many more. As we were leaving the lines for the bar were getting pretty long, however the bartenders move pretty quickly so the wait was not too bad. Love this spot, especially if you are looking for some unique cocktails."

The bar upstairs is a mezcal tasting room which has yet to disappoint me. The bartender will tailor your tasting to what you and your guests are interested in trying and also ensure that the space isn't too overrun by other guests. Push through the crowd and add this bar to your itinerary when visiting Austin and I can assure you won't be disappointed with the experience."

It was a hot afternoon, and it got a bit uncomfortable inside (no a/c), but it would be an awesome place on a cool fall day (the four we have in Austin!). I tried the old fashioned first, having heard it was \"signature.\" It did not disappoint! My second drink was not as good (something to do with ambition in the name?), so I will stick to the old fashioned next time.   Also, I feel it's worth mentioning that I didn't feel any sort of discrimination. Having read some of the other reviews, I was a little nervous to visit as older than 30,  but I found no problems at all. I had no issues getting drinks. Only once did an employee act like a jerk because the inside bar was closed, but that wasn't readily apparent, and he got snippy that I was waiting there. He did it with others, too, though. I think everyone's experiences are valid, but my experience was not that this bar only caters to picture perfect 20-somethings."

Definitely recommend going after dark because the setting of the inside of the bar is part spooky/part western-y/part old-timey and kinda makes you feel like you could meet a vampire in the corner... but in a cool way! I have had many different drinks from their set menu but admittedly their bartenders know high quality cocktails on and off the menu so order your heart's wishes.   My most recent order: - Twisted Nerve - Fancy, not-too-sweet, and so refreshing on a warm day! - Whisler's Old Fashioned - Smooth and will put some hair on your chest.  Give this bar a shot! Or take a shot... No judgement here."

                "description": "Last night my wife and I made the mistake of going to another cocktail bar that wasn't Whislers. Big mistake. ~$30 and 45 unimpressive minutes later, we hightailed it over to East 6th.   First thing I noticed is that they nixed their dinky parking situation to make room for even more patio tables. Perfect. It's not like Whisler's really needed the space, but with the interior bar unmanned and COVID in the air, it's a welcome addition.  I'm always surprised when people say the cocktails here are unimpressive. I don't know where else they are drinking (in ATX at least), but I'd appreciate a clue-in. Whisler's does a damn fine job; we always drink too much here because we can't stop sipping on inventive and tasty cocktails.   Last night's outing had two standouts I'd like to highlight. First, the Drab Majesty. With rum, cachaça (a fermented sugarcane liquer), beet, raspberry and lime, the drink struck a sweet spot between sweet and savory, with some carribean flair to boot. Next, the Feel Good Hit of the Summer, mint julep-inspired with an attitude. Couching the bourbon inside a fruity melangerie of cantaloupe, apricot, lemon and lemongrass made for a supremely sippable summer drink - a sublime libation if I ever had one.   Last note; I love coming to Whisler's and walking out having tried multiple types of alcohol I never knew existed. It's always fun to learn a thing or two!"

                "description": "I had heard really great things about Whistlers. My expectations were that I would have a great drink and prepare to wait for it.   To my surprise, I got a great drink without the waiting part. I had a twisted nerve which was fantastic. Not sweet, not dry, just really smooth. The other patron in my party had an old fashioned and said it was perfect!  The prices are great for how strong the drinks are. The music and energy were reminiscent of the speakeasies. I definitely recommend and will be visiting this establishment again to try some of the other drinks on the menu."

                "description": "When staying at arrive hotel in Austin I was thrilled to see that whisler's was directly across the street from our hotel. This place is bustling at night. I am not sure if there was an upstairs as we hang out on the lower level. Downstairs there's was two bars one inside and another outside in a tented area. The vibe here is very romantic and relaxed. It has almost a speak easy feeling about it. We ordered several drinks off the menu and loved all of them. The bartenders were all pleasant and kept up with the amount of people. I would not recommend if you are someone who gets claustrophobic though as it can get really packed. Whisper's is super loud and open very late."

It took over an hour to get our order. The brewery was having trivia night so maybe they were swamped with orders? Regardless, while the food tasted great, the portions (pizza and pizza rolls) were pricey for what we got. Paid over $50 for dinner (one salad, one small pizza, 3 very small pizza rolls and one dessert.)"

                "description": "Terrific pizza, but painful service.  BackDraft Pizza is wonderful pizza.  But, ordering it, customizing it, and paying for it is a pure pain in the ass.   I've gotten their pizza on at least three or four times over the past year.  And each time, the ordering process is a bad joke.    For example, last night, with a windchill of about 20 degrees, I stood in the ordering window for roughly 10 minutes, because the ordering app would not work.   After entering my debit card info including cell number and email address, there was no \"submit\" button on the app.  I handed my phone to the clerk and asked him to show me where to click it.    After getting my phone, he squinted at the screen, stating he didn't have his glasses, and couldn't read it.   We fumble with the app for another five minutes, with no success.  Meanwhile, I'm freezing my ass off.   Finally, after almost 15 minutes, the guy grabs the iPad, takes my card and enters the order manually, and then has to re-insert my debit card. Once they finally get the order, I ask how long it will be.  \"About 20 minutes\" he answers.  I look at my watch and it's 7:15.   At 7:40, 25 minutes later, I had not gotten a text yet.  Since I had waited more than 25 minutes, I went out to check on it.    I figured they'd have it ready by then.   Oh no!  It'd be another 5 minutes.  This was like the Seinfeld episode at the Chinese Restaurant.  \"Another 5 minutes.\"  I had to duck around the corner, to get out of the wind.  I had left my coat inside, as they had led me to expect the pie to be ready.   These as**holes  kept me waiting another 15 minutes, before they finally delivered the pizza, about 40 minutes after I first ordered it.  I thought I would freeze to death before they handed over the pizza.   It was terrific, as usual, but I won't be subjecting myself this type of suffering, because the Company can't get its app to work--and then subjects the customer to a consistent routine of misery, just to order one of their pizzas.  It's great pizza, but definitely NOT worth the labor required to simply ORDER ONE ONLINE.  The pandemic's nearly over. Perhaps it's time to junk the app, and TRAIN THEIR STAFF HOW ACCEPT ORDERS MANUALLY."

                "description": "BackDraft keeps switching up their home on us, but we will follow them all over Metric. Our favorites are the Shrooms to the Moon (Mushrooms, Caramelized Onions, Sausage) and the Backdraft (Sausage, Pepperoni, Jalapeños) pizzas.   They are the perfect accompaniment to a pint of draft beer from whichever brewery is housing them at the moment. But if you're looking to just bring their pizza home, you can also order online ahead of time to skip that 20 min wait on site."

                "description": "Ordered a few pizzas over the weekend, and thoroughly enjoyed them!  If you like pizzas that are lighter and refreshing, then this is a place to try. My favorites were the Twisted Rita and Sweet Sow. The Shrooms to the Moon had some good umami to it -- it's the most flavorful, but a bit heavier than the first two. Also -- if you like pizza rolls, then I would definitely try the Rollin' Ronies.  I will definitely be ordering these again in the near future.  Note about ordering: I ordered online and picked up the food. I will say, however, that the order was not ready by the estimated time. Instead, you can wait for a text notification to pick up the order. I didn't know that, but now I do!"

                "description": "Looking at recent Yelp reviews, I was nervous about how this place would turn out. BackDraft did NOT disappoint.   First off, where is it? There is conflicting info on Yelp and their website. I called ahead because going to the wrong pickup spot would turn me into a hangry rage. They did not answer the phone but the host breweries did. CONFIRMED: They are currently located at Celis brewery.   We ordered 2 pizzas for pickup on Grubhub on a Friday night. BackDraft and pepperoni. They were ready in about 30 minutes. CONFIRMED: The pizzas were AMAZING. Like... hands down some of the best pizza I've ever had. Their homemade sausage and humongous thin pepperoni slices were phenomenal.  I can't speak for anyone else's experiences recently. It sounds like delivery may be questionable? But as of April 2021, if you can drive to pick up a pie, this is the place you need to go."

                "description": "Oh man.  The pizza here is fire.    It's located right in front of 4th Tap Brewing Co-Op  which is a perfect pair.  We ordered their signature pizza, The Backdraft.  It's topped with House Made Spicy Sausage, Pepperoni, Fresh Jalapeños, but we also added mushrooms on ours.  It's a thin crust style pizza that is PACKED with flavor.  Our buddy ordered the Kale Yeah Caesar salad which he was very pleased with.  The guys that run this truck are really cool and definitely dedicated to their craft.  Backdraft Pizzeria is definitely up there on the short list of Austin's best pizza.  I'd be surprised if they didn't branch out and open up another location in the near future, especially in the downtown Austin area.  I would highly recommend giving them a visit and try their food.  How can you say no to a fantastic pizza and a frothy craft beer to go with it?"

We quickly ordered the Backdraft pizza, a pepperoni pizza, and wings. The order was delivered contactless and on time, hot and ready to eat. We've lived in Austin for almost 2 years and I've been disappointed by all the Austin favorite pizza spots but my days of yearning for good pizza are DONE.

                "description": "TLDR: BackDraft is back, and they're better than ev-VAH!  I'm a longtime fan of BackDraft, even once calling it 'the best pizza you can get off a truck'.  That's damning with faint praise, as this is some of the best pizza in all of Austin.    Back when I first tried them, the food truck was parked down on 360 near Bee Cave.  But now that both I and they have moved to the north quadrant of Austin, and they're attached to an excellent brewery to boot!  By far, my favorite is a slightly altered 'Shrooms to the Moon', which is a triple-whammy combo of homemade spicy sausage, mushrooms, and carmelized onion. If you look at the picture, you'll see that the crust has the  right amount of 'char' or 'leoparding' as some call it.   Whoever's doing the pizza-slinging at BackDraft knows their stuff. Get down here when they're open, grab a brewski, and you're in for one of the best lunch combos that Austin can serve up!  Some Tips:  1) I said 'best lunch', but be sure to check their hours before you come. I'm pretty sure they just do lunch Friday and Saturday.  Otherwise, they follow brewery peak hours and just do evenings.  2) Try the Shrooms to the Moon but ask them to hold the caramelized onions.  Without the onions, you get a spicier, hotter pizza which goes perfectly with a pale ale beer to wash it down.  You'll end up with a pizza-nirvana feeling of a warm glow in your tummy.  This place scores a 5 out of 5 on the 'CTJ Scale', as noted below.  5 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Jesus good. Would be OK passing away after finishing a plate here. 4 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Mary good. Would be OK being seen eating here by Mother Mary. 3 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Joseph good. Would be OK having a beer here with Jesus' Dad. 2 out of 5 stars: Come-to-the-Apostles good. Meh. Wouldn't have my last supper here. 1 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Nobody good. I wouldn't have my penultimate supper here, either."

The crust was very thin and had a good crunch to it. The sauce for the wings had a slight sweetness and wasn't too hot. I also appreciate that they put the buffalo sauce for my wings on the side, so that they wouldn't get soggy before I got home."

                "description": "My wife and I love slab, but we were extremely upset that the Burnet location decided to close 15 minutes early on a Saturday. Closing at 8pm is already a bit early for a weekend night, but shutting off the open sign at least 15 minutes early is crazy. It could have been longer, but it was off when we got there, so who knows when they did shut it down.   The new phone and order system also sucks. You can't talk to anyone, it just sent us to voicemail. Even the online now shuts off early due to toast tab not taking pickup orders when we tried to put one in on our way there.   You are not the only place in town that sells great bbq, guys. If you keep making it difficult to buy yours, people will just go elsewhere."

The first turn off for me the secret shopper was that the cashier stated he could not change $100 bill for a $55 order! Wow.  Second, as you can see in my pictures my sliced beef sandwich was drrrrry! So d@'-dry I got beef stuck In my throat from trying to wash that dry ass beef down and that was without the bread!! I felt some foul vibes when we approached the counter but I just thought I was tripping. I truly believe the meat cutter knew he sold us that dry ass sandwich as well, so 1 star jerk!"

                "description": "Great BBQ for an even greater price! I was really impressed with everything we tried, and for it all being just under $50, it was worth it. It's not your \"traditional\" BBQ stop - the menu is really fun and there are some pretty creative treats to try, from Texas-sized sandwiches to habanero strawberry glazed ribs. The meats were tender as could be, the flavor was incredible, and the sauces were amazing. Will definitely be visiting again!   Service: 5/5 Food: 5/5  Individual food ratings: - Habanero Strawberry Glazed ribs (5/5): sweet and spicy (but more sweet), these ribs were perfectly tender and had really great flavor! You can get them without the glaze, or get the glaze on the side. - Smoked Gouda Mac'n'cheese (4/5): pretty tasty mac, very cheesy and creamy, would be great with hot sauce or meat. - BBQ nachos w/brisket (5/5): super loaded, huge shareable portion, and great flavors! Add extra sauces on top to get saucy. - El Jefe sammie (5/5): brisket, onions, peppers, and Fritos for some crunch, this was a great sandwich and super filling! - Twice baked potato casserole (3/5): needed a kick or maybe some more salt/pepper, but was good overall with the dank white sauce on top."

                "description": "First time at Slab BBQ and it's already our go to bbq in the area. First, all meats are gluten free! Yay!!!! Second, their meats are delicious! I had the chicken and the brisket and both were really good , seasoned well and very moist - cooked to perfection. I couldn't finish my salad and took maybe half of it home. So, portion wise, this is also a win. My daughter had the 1/2 ribs and we were all taken by surprise on the flavor. Seriously, TRY their RIBS!!!  They have a selection of different sauces, including a strawberry one that came with the ribs. I was very skeptical at first, but it worked pretty well. However, their mustard based one is my favorite.  We can't wait to be back!"

Also the baked beans was the business. Oh, yeah the nortorious BIG was delicious! It's topped with Cole slaw and piled with brisket very tender meat!

We only made it here because people say it is worth trying after having brunch at somewhere else. Their ribs were awesome!!

We thoroughly enjoyed our meal! Our party of three started with the double meat bbq brisket nachos, then we shared 1/2 # of ribs, a Texas Tornado wrap with double brisket (absolutely LOVE their brisket) then added an extra large order of the smoked Gouda Mac and cheese, green bean casserole and finished up with a banana pudding .  Gotta say I haven't eaten such great bbq for years AND took home enough for another meal.  This is my new go-to for Austin BBQ! They have a nice selection of regular and craft beers as well.  Definitely a repeater!!"

                "description": "I've now been here 3 times and if it wasn't for my last visit, it would probably be a 5 star but the last trip was definitely not ideal. The first two times I came here, I ordered the nachos and walked out so satisfied. It is a massive portion that includes all the toppings you could ever want.  They are truly some of my favorite nachos in all of Austin.   This most recent time, I decided to switch it up and went for the trio slider.  My buddy ordered the same thing and both of us walked out of there, not sure if we would come back.  The bread was hard, and the meat was room temp at best. We came in around 12:30 on a Saturday which I would have assumed is a pretty popular time with some of the freshest food but I was definitely wrong. It almost seemed like they were trying to get rid of food from the day before.  I will probably be back at some point but I don't think I would ever order the sliders again (which is such a bummer for a place 100% known for their sandwiches)  All that being said, the first two trips made a great impression and the workers there are all fantastic so I'm still happy to support this place."

                "description": "There were brisket nachos involved too but I only got a photo of the ribs as the nachos were halfway gone by then  they were excellent and a generous portion. The St. Louis ribs are some of the most tender I've had.  I wasn't a huge fan of the bbq sauce that came with the ribs but it's on the side and they have other sauces available as well- the one it came with was a little sweet for me. Planning on bringing my small rib aficionado this weekend after the pumpkin patch.  One complaint... the kids meal ribs says it comes with two.. TWO. Mine will be asking where the rest are if I ordered him a kids meal  they do have a great amount of meat on them but I have a 3 year old that eats like a teenager when he has ribs in front of him so these kids meals won't work for us  we will be getting a whole rack and I'll be lucky if *I* get to have two."

The line was long, but luckily I was able to head to the to-go desk and place my order fairly quickly...Brisket Nachos packaged with all the ingredients separated so as not to get soggy. They easily survived the drive home to Cedar Park and were super delicious and unique! Like a chopped brisket sandwich on tortilla chips with queso. Um, yes, please.  This barbecue place has a vibe like no other. The walls and music combine hip hop with classic Texas in a way I would not have dreamed possible, but it works. Pretty trendy spot. I really appreciated the clear partitions separating tables as a covid precaution."

I would go back for sure, pretty cool atmosphere as well.  When I went I had done research and everything. There are other places to go to but, this was the best for a Sunday. I arrived just a bit before happy hour and enjoyed myself.  I had the Jackalope burger and it was plenary to eat. With the toppings I didn't even need anything else. I usually get honey mustard and mayo, I didn't need it but, I did put mayo on it. There were plenty of pickles and the burger meat was tasty.   I had a frozen margarita, the frozen was out after that and I switched to a hibiscus margarita. I know your thinking hibiscus flower, yea it was even pretty like the flower. I also had the huge Heldarado as well. Man let me tell you now have a few people would help you finish but it was good.   It was just great company we had fun there I met a couple cool people there and it was rememberable. It's kind of what we are looking for when we go out to eat or something. The server was good even when they switched out for shifts, the only thing I will get you don't want us they could use a few more extra service. Great experience I definitely go back."

He gave us a few suggestions, and we ordered drinks and a round of shots. They were all good and mid-priced. The only downfall was they didn't shake the pineapple chaser, so it was lukewarm.   Overall, a solid and memorable bar experience!"

The menu is limited now, but still good. I love the atmosphere and who you meet here. You never know, you might just find a life long friend. Staff is fun, personable and friendly. Always a regular stop for us when we can! Stop in if you haven't."

                "description": "Food was good when it came out correctly but had to send back what was put in the computer versus what I asked for.    Tonight October 30, 2021. I put a food order in for honey jalapeño wings, an order of waffle fries and a dos xx draft. Total came to 22 and was given order number 80 around 8:00 Pm. Order came out as a burger and side of fries which after checking your menu, should've only been 14$ plus what ever the beer was which I'm sure isn't 8$ for a draft beer in a plastic cup.   I informed the food runner it should've been wings and he showed me where the food was rung in as a burger instead, no harm no foul a simple misunderstanding or so I thought. The bartender who rang it in informed me I ordered a burger when I \"shouted\" my order at him and said I like that with fries. By my calculations, if I did intact order the burger with a side of fries it should've been 11.5 for burger plus 2.5 for fries. Not almost 16 I'm assuming plus 6$ for a dosxx.   I get it it's Halloween weekend. But if you can't fully hear the order then just make sure with customer before finalizing and putting order in and over charge them if in fact you thought I ordered a burger. But also don't give attitude when customer asks for the wings and believes the wings only come with 8 like you PDF menu states. Not from Austin but will not be back anytime soon. Unfortunately I paid in cash or I would ask for a refund for the difference because I'm entitled to that I believe. I understand customer isn't always right. But food costs can't be that high that you need to argue about the wrong button being pressed on your end.   And yes this is the exact same review I sent to the contact us for on the website, I'm sure nothing will change with how orders are put in on busy nights, but just make sure you get your itemized at this establishment so that you know before you walk away from bar."

                "description": "We came from San Antonio to try this place out due to great food reviews.  There are no servers that come to your table, if you want food you have to order at the bar. The staff wasn't very friendly at all and of course didn't have good customer service quality's.  The lighting inside was very dim and dark - more like a bar setting but the variety of appetizers was great. The D.J. was playing some good tunes and when our food came out - They had the best wings and Cheese Waffle fries. We had a couple of drinks and ordered a couple more appetizers but then we saw the WORST - A RAT ran above us on the beams and then my husband and cousin saw another RAT in front of him running along the opposite end!!!  And we all know if there is 1/2 rats their are more to follow. Obviously this is an issue that they are aware of. Needless to say we grabbed our stuff and left! I felt so disgusted and nauseous!!!  Coming out the restaurant we met a couple (locals) outside and they told us they have heard as well about infestation of rats. So if your looking for a good restaurant- Don't come here!!!"

                "description": "IF I COULD GIVE THIS PLACE ZERO STARS - I WOULD.   DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU ARE TRYING TO HAVE A GOOD TIME.   We came here during a BACHELORETTE.  I understand circumstances are weird due to COVID-19.  I get that. We ALL get that. We are in Austin visiting for our best friends bachelorette and on our second night here we decided to take the advice from our waiter at Caroline's and go to The Jackalope.  We went there at 9pm just to check it out and our bartender, Bart, gave us complimentary drinks. We were so thankful, we paid for the giant mixed drink and went next door for a few hours and then went back to The Jackalope because the bride requested it. We sat down for 20 minutes even ordered some drinks (which they never brought) and they were playing the jams -- so naturally we started dancing around our table.   Even the other bartender, Dimitrius, was hitting on one of our bridesmaids HEAVILY and hanging around with us while we were dancing - not even one whole song went by before Dimitrius told us we couldn't be dancing and that we needed to be in our seats. We said okay, that sucks but sure. So we sat down and made sure our butts where planted -- next thing you know some random came up to us and started twerking at our table then on jumped on the couch and started twerking and spreading her legs in the air. Again - SHE WAS NOT WITH US. None of us even knew who she was. Immediately, some angry bartender (that clearly needs to get laid) with a ponytail ran over to us being loud and demanding that WE get out meanwhile Twerker conveniently slinks on back to her table    I can understand if we were the ones doing THAT and you wanted to kick us out - FINE.  But that was not the case. No one wanted to even hear us out, one of our bridesmaids does not drink and she was very civil in trying to explain to Ponytail Bartender but he literally was non-stop raising his voice to us. He even yells at Bart to come over - and this fool just straight up decides to \"go with his boys on this one\" and preceded to gesture us to get out  Ponytail could not WAIT to kick us out, let me tell you. Like there's some underlying issues there  He yelled at us saying \"You're not even ordering drinks! You're not even ordering food!!!\" NOPE. Wrong again, Ponytail.   We DID order food and drinks but your stubborn hating ass didn't accommodate us  Meanwhile Twerker (aka THE PROBLEM) is still running rampant inside the bar   Also, the pink haired lady was GOD AWFUL. Not helpful whatsoever.  Bart you were the biggest disappointment, and Ponytail -- you just suck. Thank you for ending our night horribly and giving us a HORRIBLE first trip experience.   I do not recommend this place whatsoever for anyone who is looking to actually have a good time."

I just love everything about this place. It's on Sixth and sure it gets the tourists in but it's definitely a hang out for regulars. Because we have family in Austin, we're here often. If it were in Pittsburgh it would definitely be one of my locals.  The beer selection is fabulous and so are the prices. The crowd is cool and fun.  The Mac and Cheese Burger is so freaking good and yummy and big! Definitely shared it with the boyfriend.  My favorite cocktail is The Jezebel. It's tasty and refreshing.   Dive bar personified!"

                "description": "It's different from other board game cafes I've been to; first the whole inside ambiance is very rustic with dim lighting giving it a very nice cozy feeling. Next each table has a little bell you can call a server which is nice especially if you are in the middle of a game and you don't want to be distracted trying to flag down a server.  When you book a reservation they need the number of guests because they have a special menu for games that cater to a certain number of players which I think is an amazing and smart idea. They also have a game master available if you have any questions, but the servers were also very knowledgable with gameplay. The games all have a wooden box container to make give it a fine wine kind of vibe which I thought was cute and quirky.  The reason I had to knock off a star is due to the food ordering. So they have a deal of ordering 3 dishes and you get $3 off. You think simple right? No, there is no writing on the menu or explanation from the staff that you MUST tell the server that you are doing this deal which I think is silly needing to DECLARE it and the next is you have to order to the multiples of 3 dishes all in one go. Besides that annoyance, I think overall the food was inexpensive and delicious. I like that it comes in smaller portions so you try a little bit of everything. I had the mushroom kingdom burger, fries, pretzel bites, and cookies (remember to order at least 20 minutes before leaving since it takes time to bake). All the drinks were good like the boozy milkshakes and fyi if you want a cute instagram photo get the rainbow road."

The workers there were incredibly helpful in recommending and explaining games. I was so impressed by their knowledge and how well they were able to go over game rules so we all knew how to play. We ended up playing Secret Hitler and Red Flags (which is similar to Cards Against Humanity but focused on dating). You can play as many games as you want here, all for the charge of $5.   There are also a bunch of food and drink options you can order! Currently, because of Covid, they only seat outdoors which is unfortunate because there are really only three tables. Make sure you place a reservation at least four hours in advance! The tables had heating poles next to them so at least it wasn't too cold. I had a wonderful experience and would highly recommend this place for an outing with friends or family!"

The room really made our night special with the insanely detailed decor, Bluetooth speaker to customize the gaming vibe, and remote controlled fan for comfort.

It's got everything you could want for a nice fun evening.  Ordering system is pretty simple - just tell your server what game you want and they go fetch it. Once you're done, flag someone and pick another game.  Food is pretty simple and if you order three things all at once, it's a little cheaper. I wasn't particularly hungry the couple of times I went but the pretzel bites are decent with queso. The sandwiches and milkshakes also don't look bad though I can't vouch for it. They got a lot of drinks on tap too.  Sit back, kick back and relax!"

And for a minute, I thought: the competition is getting tough... There are cheaper ways to go out and play board games now, and there's always tons of places to eat in Austin   But honestly, Vigilante still deserves five full stars because they provide a unique experience you can't get anywhere else. The service is EXCELLENT. The wait staff is always extremely friendly and makes you excited to be there. The game masters are truly that, and can teach you a game as fast as possible. The food is also much improved and truly enjoyable. While also staying out of the way of the real focus: playing games with friends!  By always innovating and keeping the experience top notch, Vigilante will always have a spot in my rotation."

We got the dumplings, pretzels, gyro , burger and cookies. They have so many games to choose from and have \"game masters\" to help you pick a good one. We stayed for 2 hours. It's been a long time since I've laughed so much. No one was on their phone, no one even wanted to leave the table to go to the bathroom. Oh Drinks were great too."

The drinks and service were top notch and the game masters helped address any questions. Fun for experienced and new gamers alike!"

                "description": "This is such an amazing concept and we had a blast!  Our group of 4 came here for an adult game night and were not disappointed.  They have a huge variety of board games to choose from.  These game range from easy to hard, long play to short play.  We ordered several different appetizers to share as a table and we each had a burger.  The appetizers were decent and the burgers were very small but pretty good.  This place is definitely not about the food but about the games.  It is good for the snackable items, but I wouldn't plan your dinner here.  The drinks are good and very reasonably priced.  We had a reservation for two hours, but we ended up staying there for about 3 and a half hours and we were not kicked out or asked to leave.  The staff was all super friendly and helpful.  This is definitely a spot that we will be back to."

The food options are super cheap and they are all SO good! You can choose from 60+ board games on the app too- we played Clue and Bad Medicine. Overall it was a great experience and I highly recommend if a group is looking for something to do at night time!"

                "description": "I've been here many weekends since moving into the Crestview neighborhood. It is easily the best bar in walking distance. Cocktails are amazing. Bar food is delicious and perfectly snackable. You can never have just one plate. The staff is always friendly.   By far the most unique and best part is the extensive bored game library. This makes it the perfect gathering place for parties small and large to get together for some wholesome and competitive fun. The thought put into this aspect is also plain to see. The design of the tables, the food choice, and the atmosphere makes this the perfect place for the next role of the dice or grand strategic victory. For large parties and special events, ask about the hidden rooms."

                "description": "Super fun board game bar! All boardgame boxes have been replaced by custom wooden boxes.  You can check out one box at a time. They do split the check individually since it's a handheld POS system that they use.  Majority of your party must be there in order to be seated, otherwise you can just wait at the bar. If you choose not to play board games, you can hangout at the bar and they'll give you switch controllers so you can play smash on their projector screen.  I saw that there was 1 hidden room, behind the bookcase, which I can only assume people can rent out for private parties. There is free parking out front in the garage.  -1 star because service was painfully slow."

                "description": "Man what a gem this spot is! If you haven't been, you mos def need to go. From groups of 2 to about 8, you're gonna have a great time from their lengthy list of board games, small and easy plates, plus brewskies or cocktails! Came here with three friends on MLK night and it was busy! But we were able to get our gaming in. FYI, at night it's a bit tough to see the store sign, but it's right at the corner/entrance of the apartment complex it's near!  Inside - 5/5 The left side of the spot has long benched tables with booths lining the wall/corner. If you sit in this at area, the staff give you a cool plasma-esque lantern so that you can call them over for food, libations, and games. The back of the left side is a bar with a projector in the behind. But what really sets the inside are the four person tables on the right side that are outfitted for perfect board and card games. Each side of the table has compartments where you can put your personal items, a cup for rolling dice, and a slider for cards. There are swinging sections at each corner to put your drinks or other items. Lastly, each side has a button that turns on a light right above the table to let the staff know you need something! P legit.  Food - 4/5 There are two pretty cool three plate deals you can order for $12 as you partake in the games. So far I've had the tacos, fries, and rolls and they weren't that bad. Nothing to write home to, but would be nice with larger portions. If ya don't do the deal, the  plates a la carte are of course a bit more expensive. Also, they can gluten-free most, if not all options! The beer and cocktail selection is pretty nice. Again, nothing out of this world, but cool you can really spend hours here.  Games - 5/5 The best part of Vigilante is of course the games. As several of the menu photos depict, they have a full menu of categorized games (e.g. adventure, party, cards, board). They also break it down by how difficult the games are to learn, set-up, and play. They of course have your staples - Settlers of Catan, Cards Against Humanity, Exploding Kittens - but there are plenty of more games that you can try with your friends! For example, we tried Sushi Go (a quick card dealing game to get the most points) and it has now become one of our go to games! The fun part is that the games are placed in a protective wooden box, which makes you feel like you're accessing a side quest of some sort.  Tips! Like a night club, it's $5 per person to sit at a table and play! And it's unlimited games all night. Your group can only one game at a time. Sit at the 4 person tables I described above! You won't regret it! You can order per person - the staff have mobile card readers  Overall - 4.5/5 I don't think any place is perfect as I believe it's always fun to continue building and making something better. Nevertheless Vigilante is a must go place for a date, a \"night in\", or what have you among other game loving fellows. It has everything you need and you're not risking yourself in the crazy scary world out there. Don't do yourself a disservice and go go go (Power Rangers)!"

Clearly, an architect was involved in the design with ample seating in dining areas, bar and outside. The staff is young and enthusiastic. Our server whose name is pm b (Kinda funny name) was particularly nice and accommodating . My wife ordered the Ruben and I got the pimento burger and both were quite satisfying. Being a former restaurant owner/operator, I appreciated our server's knowledge of the menu. They use a team system here which I love so when your food is ready, it is delivered immediately.  I have only two suggestions that could make for a better experience: 1. people working the bar; Don't throw the empty liquor bottles in the trash. The loud crash is unsetteling. 2. Management, dont let your modern attractive facility get seedy. Our seat cushions in the bar area should have been repaired long ago. This isn't a big expense. and look for other signs of wear around the interior.  Clearly, this is a popular place and we will be back."

I live in the area and I do want this place to thrive. We are lacking in places like this. I'd like to chalk it up to staffing but I have been to dozens of restaurants in the past two years that have surely have had staffing issues and this is the first one I've written about on this medium.   The food is great, the drinks are great but I really got turned off on the service here. I just sat at the bar for a couple drinks and a small meal. The bartender was horrible. Not with the efficiency, but wow, it was all about her. I heard her say the following things to other staffers: \"welcome to hell\". \"If he's not here, I'll walk out\". Constantly criticizing the bar setup from a previous shift (which I'm sure was a result of similar staffing issues she was facing).   I asked her name and I think she said \"heather\" but she just mumbled that and walked away. So quickly that I knew she was just pissed at the world. While she was so obviously busy by the account of her commentary, she definitely had time to shake drinks in a mixer so loudly around the entire bar in a rhythmic fashion to get everyone to look at her. It was the \"heather\" show.   Couldn't handle it."

Food is what knocks this down a bit. I got the biscuits and gravy which was wayyyy to much biscuit for the amount of gravy given. Getting the chicken added is a must.   The carnitas poutine was super salty. I get that both things are meant to be like that, but this was just too much. I wish there was more pickled onions and jalapeños to balance it out.   The happy hour menu and times looked pretty good, so I'd definitely return to try that out."

                "description": "Superior food in a convenient location. The innovated recipes served at this beautiful restaurant, are thoughtful and rooted in just damn good flavors. Ousthouse is consistent and you will never have a bad time. Recently had their Shepards Pie. Rarely have I... fantasized... about a dish; reminisced about their unique take on a classic. My wife, who lives abroad for a time, even stated that it was made better here than by our friends across the pond. We are excited to see this business grow and adapt their dishes more. As we are a multicultural household, we would love to see more Persian Cuisine take center stage on the menu. My only critique is that the cocktails could us a refresh."

                "description": "Wife and I decided to try this place out for late afternoon brunch on the patio. We had the Bacon Beignets, Reuben, and Pimento Burger. We had a little difficulty finding good selections on the menu. Citrus pancakes sounded good, but they were out of them. The Bacon Beignets were the highlight, warm, freshly made and tasty. Reuben was good, with nicely salted corned beef and delicious German slaw. Pimento burger was too rich for my taste. Service was good. Overall experience was good. Would be 5 stars, but menu was not great for us. If you find things you like on the menu, then you should try it out."

                "description": "Went to brunch here with some friends. This was a great atmosphere for brunch. I have been for Dinner which is lovely as well. However, it's laid back, chill atmosphere, and modern feel makes it a great spot for almost any occasion.  The food was pretty good. I did get something i could make at home. However everything was cooked nicely apart from the bacon. It was a little bit too charred for my taste. Potatoes were tasty, eggs standard, and the rye bread tasted more like a sour dough. But still good.   Mimosas were a good deal as well!   Overall we had a great time and most likely will return again!"

We came here because we found some good reviews on Yelp, but have to say I was a bit apprehensive about how long it's been since the last review posted for this place.   This restaurant seems to be a family go to place where people just eat and never care to leave a review.   This place a gem! We came in for an early dinner and were surprised by how good their food and drinks are.   I wasn't really found of the butternut squash soup but we were in the mood for trying so we did it.   I do recommend this place for anyone.  Specially if you are looking for food away from Downtown like us.   Enjoy!"

                "description": "The meal was much more attractive than it was delicious. Everything was fresh but lacked flair in the flavor department. This is the kind of place I would come to for dinner but I wouldn't bring anyone here to impress them or to treat them. I only say that because the impression of this place I got from the ambiance and the menu was that I would be in for a stellar meal. I ordered the Brie Burger believing the brie and the flavor profile would offer pizzaz but I was not razzle dazzled. It was just the feel of eating a better than average burger.  The carnitas poutine got me a little eager to taste more flavors as I had that to start.  It could have rivaled a couple of poutine offerings that I've had in Montréal aka the poutine capital of the world (sorry Quebec City).  I am happy that all the greens were fresh to round out the meals well.  I felt like portions and servings were well balanced.  If I lived in the area, I'd dine here again."

                "description": "Came here for brunch after church on Sunday. I must shout out Henry because his service was awesome. He was personable, friendly and efficient. His service gets 5 stars (and we made sure his tip showed it). We started with the bacon beignets which were not really like beignets. They were crispy on the outside and more like cake donuts on the inside. Only got like two pieces of bacon in the whole serving.  The food came to the table very room temperature. My father had to send his biscuits and gravy back to reheat (no one wants congealed gravy). My mom and I got the boring breakfast plate. I asked for my eggs over medium and they definitely came fried hard. Also the house cured bacon was bland and extremely dry. My Aunt's chicken cacciatore pasta tasted good and we liked the strawberry pancake we ordered for the table a lot.  Overall, service was the highlight but the brunch options are not worth a second visit."

We were searching for some dog friendly spots and came across this gem! We sat on the front patio but when we left, we saw there was also a back patio that was a bit more lively! I also took a stroll around the inside and it has a super cool looking bar, great lighting and lots of seating. We loved our cocktails, apps and entrees. We had a Manhattan, Old Fashioned, and Pom of Your Hand and they were all delicious! We also had the shishito peppers as an app and I had their seasonal soup which was served in a nice cast iron bowl. My husband had the Shepard's Pie and was super impressed! I had the falafel burger and fries and it was super tasty and filling! Our server was very friendly and attentive and my husband thought it was great that she said \"awesome blossom\" since he said that's only the second person he has ever heard say that aside from me (where has he been?). Anyway, we want to come back soon and check out some more of the menu options and drinks! We highly recommend this spot that is dog, family, and happy people friendly!!!"

We were in no hurry so we had another beer and looked over the menu.  It was obvious that Oast was short staffed and everyone was doing double duty. Thank the pandemic!  Nevertheless, tHe staff was very friendly and the service was adequate.  However our burgers were not very hot and my pretzel bun was stale. The fries were very good. In better times, this will probably be a very nice dinner option."

                "description": "First, this place is perfectly nice and probably worth going to again if I am back in the area but would easily be convinced to try something else.  My evening began with the Ancho Margarita.   Unlike some places this chili inspired drink isn't like drinking hot pepper juice and is delicious.    The fried cheese curds with ranch dressing were tasty but nothing particularly gourmet as a novice home cook could prepare this with the same results.     The disappointment came with the main meal.  The French fries were cold.   From our vantage point we could watch the kitchen workers.  They kept a big bowl of French fries that the kitchen leader would use to place portions on out going plates.   They rarely sitting it under a heat lamp, so they were cold and unmemorable.   This is probably the easiest and cheapest thing on the menu to prepare well.  The rest of the meal was perfectly ok, but noting that stuck out as particularly special.    The ambiance is nice, but extremely loud when there's a full house so you have to raise your voice to be heard across the table."

The service was really good (and timely/efficient) and we enjoyed the covered seating outside. They had a great beer/cocktail/wine selection and had several drafts i had never seen before. The chicken and waffles were really strong, and the chicken was almost like hot chicken which was a pleasant surprise and carried the dish but no complaints there. The carnitas poutine and the Cubano were certainly enjoyed as well"

The train had plenty of free snacks and we had our open table to play cards on the way up and back.  The Crew Chief even stopped by to give us some history on the different train cars which we really enjoyed.  It was a cold, rainy day but we still enjoyed the views on the way up and back and had a ton of fun exploring Burnet. We stopped by the Warehouse BBQ for lunch and also grabbed a coffee in town as well!  Well worth the trip and an overall fun experience!"

                "description": "So I have very mixed feelings when it comes to our mini trip on this train.  I booked that groupon for the North Flyer as my kids are in love with trains so this would be a nice treat for them.  They enjoyed Santa and the hot chocolate, I didn't mind the scenery as it was pretty.  Santa, Mrs. Claus, and the story telling was only for a few minutes of the 2 hour ride.    The biggest issue is, I really thought the ride will be in motion for the most part.  I know there are stops but it really felt like we moved for 30 minutes and sat still for the rest o the trip.  It was really annoying and boring to just be sitting for most of the two hours on the train.  In fact, I believe you don't even leave the small town of where the train first left.    They should consider playing Christmas music (I saw speakers on the train) to keep people entertained if we are going to be sitting for 90% of the time.  Overall this trip didn't feel worth it for the price we paid.  2 stars~"

                "description": "My family rode the North Pole Flyer, not so much for the Santa stuff since we have no children under 10, it was more for family fun. And it was a fantastic experience. The train was actually pretty cool, I've never been in a proper train before, I mean, it was old fashioned but still just a really really cool experience. We paid for the private suite and it was worth it, we also walked throughout the train which was a bit old west feeling. My favorite part was walking between cars to see the view unencumbered by windows.   We walked through all the cars (like most people on the train did) to see what the other cars were like. The giftshop car was the nicestest with big windows and plenty of room to walk around while balancing yourself on a rocking and rolling moving train.   Some of the private rooms give you an idea of what is was really like to ride a train across country with a sleeper car, teeny tiny shower, and narrow hallways. It was such a great experience.   Not sure why people complain about the views because mine were fantastic! I mean, c'mon. We live in Texas not Denver. I know what the hill country looks like. There's no mountains but where the hills meet the sky is expansive. It was beautiful."

You pick up tickets on a building near by (about 25 meters). You just give your name and how many in your party and you'll get your tickets. Once you get your tickets, you'll walk to where the train is located, show your tickets and they will direct you to your cart. Once you find your seat/section...relax and enjoy the ride! The view to Borne is very relaxing and enjoyable. The train does provide drinks and snacks and some alcohol. Mask as of Jan 22, 2022 is required during the train ride. Bathrooms are located throughout various train carts."

                "description": "Full disclosure - I love trains, so I may be a bit biased around this experience. Having taken lots of scenic trains in Colorado/the West, I can see where some would be disappointed by the views provided on this ride - the route follows a state highway and what was probably pastures 20+ years ago is now developed as Austin sprawls outwards. The main selling point on this train is just getting to enjoy the most fun mode of transportation out there - a train! We don't often find ourselves in situations where we get to relax and enjoy a train ride, so any opportunity to do so is a winner in my book. However, there are some small improvements that could be made to the train cars/experience that I think would help overall: clean the windows both inside and out, re-upholster the seats, and add in PA voice-over announcements to give some brief history of the train line/cars instead of the volunteer attendant trying to yell it at a busy car. The time in Burnet is fine, we packed a picnic and enjoyed it at a park nearby the town square. Overall, I am glad to have done the Hill Country Flyer experience from Cedar Park to Burnet, but would say to manage expectations in terms of scenery."

                "description": "I liked my visit! I paid for the Cedar Park to Burnett ride. It's about 6.5 hours including a 2 hour stop in Burnett. I paid $60 per person for one of the more expensive carts the Rippling Stream one of the Adults Only lounges. And I'm glad I did. My cart had a lot of complimentary refreshments to choose from. And since we only had 10 people in my cart we pretty much had as many drinks as we wanted. I will admit we were the youngest people in our cart. So our fellow ride goers had higher expectations and were pretty disappointed with the look and feel of the train. But my boyfriend and I haven't experienced something like this before so we were excited and happy for the ride. So everything was new and great. I feel we're prepared for longer, faster train rides now. I really liked being in a cart with less people. We got to know almost everyone and we had great conversations. Daniel was absolutely amazing. His love for trains showed. And he was great to have conversations with. Great guy who answered everyone's questions and concerns.  We toured the entire train and it's nice seeing the other carts. There are definitely way more seats in the others. And they're nice too. My picture below was taken in one of the carts I toured in. (I only have videos of the one I was actually in). I will admit the city of Burnett didn't have much to see or do. I purposely brought my own food. After researching some menus I gave up on vegan options. Which is normal in small towns. It's a VERY small town. The best part was the little show the city of Burnett put on for us. The actors were great, friendly, and funny. A really great crew and was happy to watch their show. We were very tired by the time we had to get back on the train. We board at 8:15 and start the ride at 9. Because of waking up early and walking around the small town we pretty much fell asleep when the excitement died down. If you've been on a train before you might have high expectations. But if not and love new experiences and trying new things I think you'll really like this trip. I really enjoyed it. Thank you to all the volunteers for making this trip absolutely amazing."

We loved all the fun facts the volunteers had to share about the train cars and lifestyles of some of the riders back 100+ years. The sunset was magical and the night portion of the ride was really neat, having the moonlight illuminate the tracks in front of us. One of the cars is a dedicated gift shop/concession stand with a variety of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages to choose from. Everyone we came in contact with was so kind and made the experience that much more memorable. Overall such a great time - we would definitely book this experience again!"

                "description": "We had a great time on the Beer Train last night that was advertised as a sunset tour that was 2.5 hours long.  Note that you have about 45 mins moving time, then 40 mins stopped for the engine to be brought from the back to the front and then 45 mins back again. You don't really see much of the sunset, and you aren't moving for 2.5 hours. They also assign seats ahead of time, some of the cars were nicer and louder than others, so just depends what you're looking for. The association was responsive on social media when I had questions, staff and crew on board were all very friendly. They dont really follow any of their own posted rules about masks, no personal coolers, etc. so just something to be aware of- but I think this also varied by car. Overall we had a great time and would go again!"

Dirty cars, dirty seats, dirty windows with bleak scenery outside and Santa who gives a broken whistle. That is all for 2 hours trip. Even an obsessed with trains 4 years old was bored.

Fortunately for me the plague was in top form. Was in the area looking for sustenance and 'Steam Train Association' showed on the map so I figured to pop in for a quick viddy before lunch. pulled up on a nearly empty lot, a shackled gate, and a locked door, the sign had the now common 'Closed for Plague' message which softened the blow of discovering \"...that the train and rail yard are not open for public tours or photography\" which meant the entirety of the museum was contained in the double-wide corner space in the strip. There's nothing inherently wrong with scenic train rides on vintage rolling stock, I've done it before and it's OK but that's just not my cup of meat. I was here for a bit of museuming but there was no museum to be had - nor postcarding nor touchable cars nor engines :-( sad face"

                "description": "My husband and I went on the Hill Country Flyer for our anniversary weekend and we were in the \"Rippling Stream\" train car. The Train itself is quite impressive and was my first time on a real train not subway. The First Class Coach option was really nice and the seats were spread out along with social distancing, we felt really comfortable. My only complaint was it was VERY cold outside and though they are climate controlled, it was really cold the first half of the ride - coming back was much more comfortable. I also wished the lay over time perhaps had been 3 hours to provide a little more browsing time in Burnet. It would be cute to do music in each train car from the era the train was made. Ours was built in the late 30's so it would be a nice little touch that's simple to do! They had complimentary snacks and drinks which was a plus. Can't wait to do it again in a private suite!"

                "description": "This was an excellent experience. We took the train from Bertram to Burnet for one of the special events (Wedding Oaks wine trip). The staff was friendly and seemed very knowledgeable about the history of each train car. If you have a chance to walk to the very last car and look out the back, I definitely recommend taking in that view. I would have loved to take a longer trip and will look for other chances to ride.  The website is a little hard to use. We would have really liked a private cabin for our trip but didn't see how to book that on the website.   I wish the volunteer in our car would have been a little less Chatty Cathy when we weren't talking about the ride. It was a bit of a distraction from our enjoyment of the ride. Also, riding during COVID was a bit out of our comfort zone already so we were sad to see at least two volunteers wearing their masks covering only their mouth, not their mouth and nose. The website goes into great detail about precautions and that is a basic one not being taken. (That being said, they did a great job with social distancing and I felt like the train was very clean.)"

                "description": "Enjoyed my first ASTA experience today.  Here's my recap:  - Purchased a First Class Lounge ticket so I had my own room in Rippling Stream  - Train left the station on time, arrived at Burnet on time, and left for Cedar Park on time.   We were only an hour late reaching Cedar Park because a car thought it could outrun the train, but it could not.  Once the accident reporting was complete the train resumed.   - Personal note:  I am a train nerd and love riding trains, so my threshold of being annoyed on a train is higher than most.  This will affect my review below.    THE GOOD:  - clean cars, fun to walk in between them, and if you're without children, the adults only first class cars are a must - Rippling Stream and Nambe.   Otherwise with kids, I would recommend the Maurice Beckham or Eagle Cliff.    - the trip itself is smooth and the volunteers are friendly and helpful.  You can tell they enjoy being there, informing and helping others.     - Burnet has an abundance of antique shops if that's you're thing.  Also the soups at the downtown coffee shop are wonderful.     - The shootout show in Burnet, while not having a worry about winning any acting awards, is fun for the kids and has a good ending.  They could trim some of the fat from it, and make it a more concise / engaging story - there were a few too many awkward pauses.  But I applaud the folks who are likely doing this for free.  And the kids loved it.     THE NOT SO GOOD  - The scenic ride - if you're from the area this should not come as a shocker - is not that scenic.  There's a great bridge over the San Gab river but otherwise it's unremarkable trees, backyards, roads, and strip malls.    But again, none of this bothers me that much because I'm on a train relaxing.    - Burnet:  This is a sleepy, very conservative town.  One sign to deter thieves in a store said, \"We got an alarm.  We got video.  We got guns.  DON'T BE DUMB.\"    While the downtown is a short walk from the train station, 2.5 hours here is way too much time unless you love antiques.   There isn't much else.   And as far as lunch goes, I highly recommend walking a bit farther past the first couple restaurants or else you'll have long wait times.   I went to a deli just a couple blocks away and it had no line.      - Announcements:  there are few.  Nothing along the way to alert you to landmarks or scenic opportunities (there is really just one, the bridge over the river).   But it would be nice to hear more than the pre recorded departure / arrival ones.    - The warm soft drinks:  no one wants green tea or apple juice at room temp.  There was literally an ice bucket next to these (but for scoping ice).  A second one to put these beverages on ice would go a long way.    - Lack of variety in snacks:  for a first class experience, at least more than the mini lemon cakes and mini cinnamon rolls would be nice.  Some savory, perhaps?   - chairs in the RS lounge car are what you'd find at your local dentist's waiting room.  I expected something that would at least remain comfy for 1.5 hours at a time.      OVERALL. - for the price I paid, it's 4/5 stars.  I knew the scenery wasn't going to awe, so most of my ranking is based on the train experience inside.  The quibbles above are all minor; chill the drinks, add some pretzels, get someone to donate an old leather chair or 2, and be a bit more chatty with us.    Those who really ranked their train ride low usually fall into the following categories, so please take them with a grain of salt:  - a/c sucked because it was Austin in the summer (hopefully fixable but not all that surprising) - solution is to go when it's not hot, the 60 days out of the year it's under 99 degrees.  I also think they have ironed out most of the a/c issues by now.    - Burnet was terrible, Burnet food was terrible, etc.  It's Burnet.  There's a reason it's not as well known as Fredericksburg.  You walk a bit father to get away from the crowds, you cross check their list of lunch spots they give you when you board  with a quick glance of Yelp reviews and you roll the dice.    - scenery sucked, super ghetto, etc.   Maybe because I grew up in St Louis, but using the word ghetto here is laughable at best.  It's junky, yes.  Unkempt, sure.   And truly, if you live in the region, you should know better than to expect breathtaking views.  You've driven on 183 east of 35?.  Same views.   If you're from out of town I could see valid point here since the website pushes it hard that it's scenic - but us locals know how much lipstick you can put on this pig.   So go check it out!  But go First Class if possible.  And be flexible about being home on time; like with any train, delays can happen."

                "description": "We rode the Hill Country Flyer which departs from the Cedar Park station and goes to Burnet, Texas,  where there is a two-hour layover so that passengers can disembark, do some shopping or grab some lunch or both.   Before leaving, the Burnet Gunfighters put on a show which is free to passengers, although they do accept donations.   The scenery leaves a lot to be desired, however that is not something that the Steam Train Foundation can control, they have a designated track and can not control who builds subdivisions or places gravel pits along the route.   If you are looking for a beautiful scenic ride, this probably isn't for you.  However, if you want to experience riding on a passenger train, and learning about the history of the railroads, it is a great experience.     They are very careful with social distancing and we felt completely safe riding the train.  I spoke with a couple of families that had young children and they loved it!   All in all, I would recommend it as a very enjoyable way to spend the day."

                "description": "I rode the Sunset Express on 5-29-21 with my family, while on a trip to visit Austin. I'm from Southern California (this is important later). The scenery was certainly nice in some spots, but not enough. The sunset was awesome, but the experience wasn't that great. We paid for first class and rode aboard Eagle Cliff. Some basic drinks and snacks were provided, but the train was understaffed. No attendant for our car. One very sweet elderly volunteer was doing her best to handle two cars at once. I decided to offer to help, which she was very appreciative of. She said it was great that I wanted to help and so I did. I helped stock drinks and snacks as well as stocked ice to keep the drinks cold. Later on, a female volunteer who looked to be in her 40s came up to the counter said \"Sir, you cannot be back there, what do you need?\" I explained the situation, and she kind of had an attitude. I was informed in a rude tone that I had to be a member to help, and was given no thank you. Being that I live in Southern California, there's no way I could really be a member. While all this was happening, the AC in the car was doing a very poor job at keeping the car cold. It was unbearably hot in there, and everyone in the car was complaining. The excuse given was that the car is vintage and has a lot of runtime. The car was very original, and you could tell. That roughly translates to \"we don't have the money or people to keep this car in tip top shape, and we don't have the money to upgrade it\".  Eventually, my family was re-seated to the Rippling Stream. That was much better, but it didn't change the overall experience. Cherry on top was we were over an hour late returning to the Cedar Park station.   Not worth the money."

                "description": "We also did the Xmas Polar Express train ride. Tickets were about $50 each. We also went with a friend and their kids too.   I'll give this train ride 4 stars. The kids were excited to see Santa and the ride was slow at times.   To start, one of the first things was a balloon guy. Ours was awesome. He was funny and overall entertaining. He had me laughing my @ss off.   Next came hot chocolate... it's hot chocolate.   After that was, singing Christmas Carols. They had 2 girls from McNeil high school. I felt sorry for them. They were nice, but they couldn't just get our car interested in singing.  A few of us sang, but overall it was a failure. I'm sure adult beverages if allowed/served would help the spirit. Great job to them but our car was mostly interested. It probably didn't help that they gave us a cookie just before they arrived so everyone was stuffing their face.   After that was story time, the lady reading the Story was animated and funny. Kudos to her.   She visited just before Santa.   Then Santa came. We were in one of the last cars so his visit was a bit rushed. He was nice and gave everyone a wooden train whistle.   ***********The entire operation is run by volunteers. So I'd like to thank all of them for their time!*******  This was he first time my son was not afraid of Santa:-)"

                "description": "This was a great little adventure from Cedar Park to Burnet Texas. Super We stayed in the Turquoise Room, which consisted of 2 tables, 8 chairs and two smaller windows. Staff was super friendly and knowledgeable...Once the train started the conductor came in to room to announce that there we several open seats in the main car...everyone got up and left leaving the wife and I in peace...Not that we are anti social, but it was peaceful to say the least...Good to catch up with each other, as we both work different hours...Truly not much to see on the way up...but it was a great ride....AC did work, not great but tolerable...I see in other reviews there were issues...You have freedom to roam Car to Car once the train gets rolling...and the train does turn around in Burnet...hard to explain, but it does...and we were able to see the other side of the tracks on the way home...Plenty to see and eat in Burnet...Our Car/cabin also came with free snacks and drinks...which is a great perk..as the snacks in the concession stand were quit expensive...The trip was worth it for us and will do it again next year with the granddaughter.."

                "description": "This review is based on my customer service experience with Zena, not the train ride itself (although I may come back and give an update!)  Zena is a lifesaver. Not literally, but she has made my train experience 2x as good. I bought a Groupon because I didn't even realize there was a train experience in Austin. After the headache of scheduling, our trip got canceled. Zena came in to save the day. She mailed me another gift certificate that expired in a year (vs the next week per my Groupon) AND she gifted us a little extra!  Sounds great, right? Unfortunately, the GC could not be redeemed online. After multiple tries of calling in (and getting a forever ring - no pick up), I was getting irritated.   I emailed Zena back asking for her advice. She wrote back in 24 hours and apologized for their phone service. She even offered to reserve me herself. After a few back-and-forth emails, she answered all my questions and got us all squared away.  Our train ride happens this weekend and I can only hope that the experience is similar to Zena's customer service."

                "description": "There's a popular saying among locals to \"keep Austin weird\" which is fine and all, but where does one experience weird? What defines it? Well, I have been on a crusade since moving here in June 2021 to experience Austin with a fervor of exploration akin to that of a high school boy on prom night. I've been to several places and some are close to capturing it but I think I've found the very essence of the phrase! Radio Coffee and Beer on a Monday or \"blue grass\" music night was a treat. This was the most eclectic group of individuals in one place which filled in my thought bubble with \"a modern melting pot of Americana\".  First parking sucks, I drove around several times until I found a space which I debated if I would be towed or not, but I decided to throw caution to the Texas wind. Walking up, I can't recall what hit me first, the low-key façade of brick, tents and wood for the establishment, the plethora of individuals sitting at picnic tables or standing in food/beer lines or the amalgamation of smells from different foods. Oh I did love the big trees in the courtyard, not only does it bring shade but an element of heightened nature in the middle of town.   Generally I'm flying solo or with a date for the night, but this was a bit different, I was meeting a group of likeminded individuals I hooked up with on the meetup app so I was a bit apprehensive about mine own company. However my group was a microcosm, running parallel, to the overall assembly. Different groups of individuals juxtaposed each other with perfect harmony. Young hippies next to older business patrons, elderly in flip flops hanging out with body builders, artistically and free minded laughing with middle class families and their kids down to strollers. Oh and dogs, lots of nice, well-mannered cute dogs of all sizes. It all worked in a \"keep Austin weird way\" of which I think I'm starting to understand.   As for the food and drinks, the lines are brutal.  I saw one lady in the burger line as I came back with a nice, cold pint of Hefeweizen. I had to work Tues so I nursed my beer however when I got up to get another, I noticed the poor young lady was still in line, teased by the tantalizing smell and hope she'd soon be served. Inside was rather barren, other than the long line for coffee and drinks. One can order ahead via an app, but regardless it takes a while. My suggestion is get two or more rounds while in line, trust me.  Normally I'd pontificate about food since I have a culinary background but alas, I wasn't about to spend my night in food lines. So, please read other reviews on that, but it smelled great!   The music was down home, toe tapping, relaxing and allowing people to forget their troubles, creating a perfect ambiance to talk to stranger or get lost in the vibe. The 4 person blue grass band really fit the spirit of the venue or vice versa, either way a match made in Austin. I found myself intrigued by my group and their various backgrounds while chatting with others whom I just met. Oh there was the typical dancing and I was disappointed as I didn't see any devil or fire stix get broken out, but perhaps I'll try that next time.    I'm a people person I love to watch, observe and meet people and hear their story. Radio Coffee and Beer is a great place to accomplish this in a safe, friendly setting. The music is wonderful and maintains the vibe so diligently created by the owners and patrons alike. Rustic yet trendy, grounded yet edgy this is a great place to hang out minus the lines. If they could put a few food trucks up and an outside bar this might solve that issue. However, if you plan ahead, problem solved. So, if you're like me and want to experience Austin, give this place a shot and enjoy a well-crafted atmosphere and/or beer!"

This indoor-outdoor and covered and tented patio venue offers a lot, including parking, so if nothing on this list appeals to you, errr, try Starbucks?   My GF and I dropped in with two dogs, and we ordered up a carajillo (they put cinnamon on theirs) and an espresso martini. Both great. The only downside of that particular experience was the QR code ordering from your table was down, so we had to order at the counter. Not heartbreaking, just a minor inconvenience with pets in tow.   Check out their calendar of events."

I went in to grab a quick coffee on my way to work and know I'll be going back for drinks at some point. I got a lavender vanilla oat milk latte and it was really good but I'd probably try some of their other menu items in the future.

                "description": "I absolutely adore this place and try to visit when I am in town. The whole establishment just screams Austin.   I love that it is in its own section with food trucks outside in case you are hungry. I was lucky enough to have came about an hour before sunset so I was able to enjoy the Austin heat, Sunset, and then nightlife of Radio Coffee and Beer. And just as you would imagine, you can get coffee and Beer. I know that sounds like a stomach ache but I was absolutely fatigued and got a thai tea upon arriving. We didnt plan to stay long and I needed a caffein boost. As I finished my drink, a band was getting ready to set up and the sun was setting and at that point I had all the energy I needed to get a cocktail.   Their beverages and atmosphere is great for an after work happy hour."

                "description": "I think this place is vastly overrated. Every time I've ever been here parking has been a nightmare. Whether that's out front or in the back. It's all just awkward and almost always full.   The drip coffees I've had here are just mediocre. I hear their lattes are good but I've never tried them. But, to me, a real coffee shop first needs to have a great drip coffee on point just as a standard foundation. Then lattes and all the rest.   The place is always loud every time I've been. I've had trouble conversating without straining to hear or feeling like you need to yell. Bring noise-canceling headphones if you want to study.  Because it's one of a tiny number of coffeeshops serving south Austin, it's a nightmare for introverts. I've never had that \"cozy, comfortable, quiet enough, relaxing\" ambiance you long for in a great coffee shop. As this place seems to bring in all of south Austin south of Ben White and just north of it.  I see it as more of a hangout spot where south Austin converges to commiserate but not a great coffee shop in its purest sense.   I do like the rustic decor inside and out though. They got that going for them."

                "description": "TLDR: some really awesome vibes and a great tap wall.  Came here with some friends for the weekly trivia night. The back patio area was really nice. we got to enjoy it both before and after the event. it's really well spaced and has good lighting for an outdoor area. I didn't get to try any of the coffee, So I can't testify to that. however, they do have a great tap wall, mostly local, with a lot of variety. I also got to try a couple of the cocktails, and they did a pretty solid job with them.   all in all, a great place for a low key couple of drinks. 4.25/5."

                "description": "So I love this spot, as does the rest of Austin. My only gripe is the confusing happy hour policies that are now in place. I *think* it is from 3-6, the rest is unclear. Apparently what beer is on happy hour changes based on what is available (?). And you have to ask, which makes you \"that\" person. Considering beers are $7-$9, I feel it would be a better policy to have a consistent happy hour that does not waste the bartender's (and my) time."

                "description": "First and foremost, don't let the parking situation scare you. There's two other lots around the property--don't ask me how to get to them--and on Sunday you can park in front of Tire Man (cool guys, btw).   As soon as you walk onto the premises you realize it's about twice as big as it looks from the street. The coffee aspect was simple but efficient and the food truck selection was perfect for a Sunday morning, biscuits and tacos, what else do you want!  The people watching was great and the everyone I ran into was nice and friendly."

                "description": "I like the vibe, it's quintessential \"Austin\" vibes. Quirky, good coffee, dogs everywhere, sunshine as you work from your computer, staff is friendly.   What I love about Austin coffee shops like this is that you go both for the goal of getting work done (or hanging out, or whatever it is), but the ambience adds a layer of \"THIS IS SOOOO AUSTIN!!!\" which is always fun.   Check it out, if you're like me and work from your computer, you probably have made the rounds to many coffee shops in Austin. Make sure you don't miss this one, too.   CONS: Very difficult to find parking during some phases of the day."

                "description": "I love to meet up with friends here for breakfast and a coffee. They are packed on weekends, but don't let the tiny front parking lot fool you. They have a back parking lot with the entrance located just north of Radio Coffee, past the small house.    Once inside of their large indoor coffee bar, their baristas will whip up anything within their power, using their house RCB Roasters coffee. From experience, they make a mean macchiato and iced espresso.   Radio Coffee is not just for coffeetotalers, they also serve libations. For weekend mornings - that means mimosas! They will mix up one of their signature Cocktails, with local spirits like a Sotol Silver 'Rita featuring Desert Door and a Paris, TX mixed up with Still Austin Gin. More into wine? They have a small selection of respectable wines that will satisfy an array of palates (2 reds, 2 whites, 1 rose, 1 sparkling-Stella di Notte Prosecco, and 1 Sake). If beer or cider is your jam, you will be pleased with the 14 they have on tap, including appearances from 512, St. Elmo, and Austin Beerworks.   If sitting indoors is not your style, grab your beverage of choice and an outdoor table in their massive kid- and dog-friendly outdoor courtyard with plenty of options for sun or shade and large or small tables.   Hungry? They have three food trucks surrounding their outdoor courtyard including Vera Cruz All Natural and Briscuits. Vera Cruz is always busy. Pro-tip, get there before 9 AM on a weekend, and order your food first to avoid a hangry long wait.   Radio Coffee is that perfect slice of Austin showcasing the best of Austin's relaxed quirkiness, coolness, and eclectic local vibe. So grab an outdoor table and relax while enjoying the Austin ambiance only Radio Coffee can provide."

                "description": "Went here for breakfast and coffee. Really awesome vibes! There was a lot of outdoor seating and they provide water bowls for dogs, so super pet friendly. There were two food trucks open at the time - Briscuit and Veracruz All Natural, but we got Briscuit. As for drinks, my partner got their kombucha on tap and I got a cold brew. Here are our thoughts:  Briscuit - brisket sandwich -- my partner really enjoyed this flavor combination of a buttery biscuit that sandwiches brisket and peach jam. He said it wasn't too greasy and was refreshingly unique take.  Briscuit - tomato, egg and cheese biscuit sandwich  -- I thought the sandwich was very good, but what makes it is the great soft egg scramble and the smoked strawberry jam I ordered on the side. Great option for vegetarians!  Kombucha on tap - my partner says it was refreshing and not as sour as other kombuchas he has had, and recommends it!  Cold brew, black - I thought it wasn't anything special. Definitely had better cold brews in the past that tasted good and had stronger caffeine effects. It tasted kinda watered down.  Ambiance - looks like a great place to just hangout, study and work. Again, love the vibes!"

Purchased tic through Eventbrite, pre-ordered some tacos from the Veracruz taco truck (bummed the Cajun and Thai trucks weren't open that evening), and got drinks from the bar.   We checked in, told to find a socially-distanced-table with the number of chairs we needed, then sat back and enjoyed. The music and ambiance were fantastic. Will be back!  Parking was a little crazy, but I think some of the shops next door allow you to park in their lots after hours."

Another lady come and stands right next to me and we are like door is closed and she waits next to us, another guy goes there and he is like don't they open at 7 am? And we are like yeah, and then two dudes also come and just stand and wait. 10 min later home girl comes with a super rude attitude opens the door and just yells I just want you to know that today we probably will be opening 10:30 ish.....We've been there 10 min, like why?, she just close the door and don't even look at us.   I'm not a Karen, I actually tip 25% and I'm never rude. Is just that that's not the way to treat someone at 7 am in the cold without the first cup of coffee.   I probably will be back, not in the morning tho."

                "description": "This was my second time at Radio Coffee and it was even better than the last time! The owners have truly built something special; I love their outside area with the seemingly unlimited amount of seating, fairy lights strung above and just the overall vibe that I get here. The staff are super cool which is always the first thing I take note of, I appreciate when someone has great people skills.   Parking isn't too bad, they have space out front, as well as behind the building. However, on really busy nights, prepare to find street parking.   The drinks? 10/10. I'm really picky when it comes to mixed drinks and the bartenders and Radio Coffee definitely understood the assignment; every drink I've had here tasted amazing and was 100% on point.  It was in the high 90's when we went but luckily there are tons of fans spraying mist everywhere, it was AMAZING.   Honey Made played for a couple of hours on the stage outside and it really tied the experience together nicely for me. Radio Coffee is definitely somewhere I'm excited to visit again."

Yes, this place gets busy, especially on weekends. The parking, the wait times, the lines--you should expect it. But I don't see it as a lack of service, it's just because this place is so good! They have tons of space and staff, it's just always full of customers. So prepare yourself for that ahead of time to have a better experience.   Anyway, I love this place. There is tons of outdoor seating with gorgeous trees for shade, a tented area, a covered area, and inside seating as well. There are three different food trucks to choose from, Veracruz being the biggest and most popular. The coffee bar itself is great with lots of drink options, both coffee and alcoholic. They also have some baked goodies!   I've had spotty customer service in the past, but it seems to be a thing of the past! Everyone working the register and bar were super friendly and helpful. Like so kind and made a killer mimosa and dirty chai. So glad to report that!   They got gf/df options, the ambience is great, and the service is sweet--what more can you want for your saturday morning?!"

They also have the indoor option, but limited space and only small group tables.  I tried their coffee and it was good! I didn't try anything at the bar, but it was very busy on a Friday afternoon, lots of people in line for both bar and coffee.  I was a little disappointed that only Veracruz taco truck was open, but I presume that's not radio coffee's decision. I was looking forward to a variety of options from the other 2 food trucks.  I think overall radio coffee and beer is a good vibe for any occasion, such as social, business, study. The parking is limited so just pray that a spot opens up when you arrive!"

                "description": "I hate being this person that leaves bad reviews, but I just can't help but share my experience at Black Sheep Lodge in hopes it can help in the future.  I recently went to BSL to watch a football game and have some fun on a Saturday night. The atmosphere upon arriving seemed... overwhelming but rather cheery. It's a hole in the wall sports bar and I was hopping for a fun night.  Beware, if this is your first time to BSL, like it was for me, just know that NOBODY will help you. I had to ask other customers about seating and how to grab the attention of waiters. To start off, once my friends and I snatched a table, we waited 30 minutes and bothered 3 waiters on ordering drinks... all answering that they would let another waiter know. I finally got fed up and went to the bar to get myself the drinks and then was told, they would send a waiter over to the table to get our drink orders. It seemed to be a losing battle. We finally just asked for the drinks at the bar again and by the time we FINALLY got our waiters attention, we were hoping the service would get better.  After ordering and getting chips and dip, we were all done with our first drinks and trying to get the attention of our waiter for the second round. I kid you not, after 30 minutes of not getting our drinks, I went back up the bar and saw our order of drinks waiting to be picked up and just grabbed them instead of waiting any longer. After grabbing our drinks, the waiter came over asking if we needed anything else and we simply requested 1 water and 1 coke. You would think that would be simple and be done quickly... well you are sorely mistaken. We never received the drinks after reminding the waiter THREE TIMES. THREE DIFFERENT TIMES FOR ONE SIMPLE WATER AND ONE SIMPLE COKE. You couldn't even get drunk if you tried at this place.  I ordered the boneless wings in Buffalo garlic sauce and I thought the vinegar was going to create a hole in my stomach that the water I ordered three times could help.  Granted, they were busy and I feel bad if they were stretched thin. But it didn't help that one of the waiters that we requested help from would pause at the table next to us and sit with the group of people, acting like he wasn't working?  I hate to say that this sports bar is one I'll never care to go to again in my life, even if they paid me too. Which is sad because they have soooo many classic bar games that I wanted to play but never got to because of the fear of our table being stolen (meaning it was pure chaos on how nobody cared about seating).  I wish I could give the entirety of the experience in a shorter version but this is the shortest I can make it for the sake of making a point."

I was a huge fan when they first opened. Music. Community. Meeting new friends! It was great!  I have to say, I'm not a sports fan. And I really don't think we need another sports bar. But I know I'm a minority in this.  Playing important games here and there sure!  But when the TVs came, the Music died so much! The table sharing was less.  But you know what? I still feel like I'm \"home\" when I come here. And you can NOT beat the cheese curds!  So stuff your face, play some darts, and enjoy the locals! Because here we are!  Only gripe....

It felt like a place locals come to drink, and not eat perhaps. We were seated and then ignored for about thirty-five or forty minutes in total. Two of our party went inside after the initial 15-20 min of sitting and waiting to see if we could order but we're told someone would see us shortly. In the next fifteen min we watched three parties seated after us get attended to and receive drinks (those waiters ignored us trying to wave them down) and then decided thirty minutes was too long to wait to be greeted. We left and went across the street in search of acknowledgment and food!"

                "description": "Everyday Black Sheep Lodge has a special on drinks which is always appreciated for a gal like me who loves to throw them beers back whether it be daytime or nighttime. I really like their Trashcan Tuesdays (all Texas canned beers are $3!) to pair with my very own basket of cheese curds, a plate of burger sliders, and some crispy sweet potato fries! Sorry but I don't share my cheese curds when I come here.  Parking can be a thing but do know that there are about a dozen spots reserved for just BSL in the back behind Cindy's (go around back around the corner). There are also a few spots directly in front by the patio area. Otherwise I would suggest ridesharing to BSL if you got a group of folks who you plan on meeting up with.  This is a place where you can bring large groups for sure as there is plenty of space in the game room area AND inside area. I love the bar area too but it can be get crowded with regulars - which isn't a bad thing but something to note.  Service is fast and quick here every time I come even during peak or major game watching. I have never had an issue with being there to meet friends, having my own separate tab, lack of service etc. Only positive experiences here for me which is what keeps me coming back!"

                "description": "I was surprised to see some 1-star reviews. I've been going to BSL on and off for about 12 years. Honestly, I forget about it from time to time. I was thrilled to find on my last visit they still have great food, a great vibe, and above all excellent service. The bartenders, my server, the droppers, essentially the entire staff were incredibly helpful... on a bustling Saturday night no less. However, there were a few rude customers. So if you're the type of person who respects people in the service industry you should definitely come by. I highly recommend it."

                "description": "Black Sheep? I feel a better name might be Counting Sheep. You see you will have plenty of time from when you place your order until you receive it for a nice long nap. It wasn't crowded and we certainly did not have a complicated order. We ordered two Chicago dogs and one Chili dog. There were no other tables outside and i counted 12 people inside, all at different stages of eating. I guess it's a global pandemic and the water was shut off in Austin so I guess there is a reason....but the hotdogs aren't boiled (I hope)--well I don't think I'm being very helpful unless you'd like to review the restaurant operations... And i really don't want to know all the details of how the sausage, errr hotdogs are made. I just want to eat them. It was kind of a Chicago dog. The mustard was served in a tiny package on the side and that seemed strange. The bun didn't have poppy seeds and it was kind of dry. Other than that it was tasty. I took a bite of the chili cheese dog and that was fine too. I guess if you're in the hood and you have the time (plan on extra time) it's worth a stop. At least one time. Then you can decide for yourself if you will return. I will not!"

The wings are quickly becoming our favorite, and the mimosas are really really well balanced! Honestly that's hard to find for me... there's always too much juice or the bubbles are flat... not here! I like the spring salad w chicken.. not too unhealthy and V-tasty!! Also bringing the pups are an option on the outside patio!!"

We ordered food, 4 pitchers and got kicked out. 3 people, 3 hours , 4 pitchers and were actually forced to leave. While ordering the food and drinks we were given poor service but who cares at a sports bar. But after they got the orders we were kicked out for tabc. If you look up tabc rules on our tab we were in line, even if we were close it's a sports bar grow up. Games over and we want to watch the last 1.5 minute of a nba game, and we were actually forced to leave. I get following rules, but when you follow rules you don't know anything about, then you're just out of line"

This is not your run of the mill bar food; the tenders and wings are some of the best I've ever eaten, no joke. The fried pickles and cheese curds are delicious. The onion rings are absolutely perfect -- hot and crispy, not greasy-- and it's always worth it to get the full basket. The Chicago Dog is one of my favorites too. I haven't tried the burgers yet, but I can't imagine I'd be disappointed in the least. Very highly recommended!"

                "description": "Not a bad location if you're trying to just go watch a game, chill with friends, or just kick back and let the Austin traffic die down. Lots of TVs so during football season I'm sure it's a full house. The drink choices and food are good, but there are a few minor complaints I have.  There are daily specials on select Texas drafts, cocktails, and other drinks. However, I wish there would be more choices of drafts because it didn't seem like they have any. But I really like the choices I tried, and they even have some others from different breweries. They also have select drinks in cans and bottles.  The food is good, but it wasn't really what I expected. I just had 8 wings to watch a basketball game. The Buffalo medium sauce was excellent, but the lemon pepper dry rub had a little too much of the powder on it, decreasing the integrity of the taste. But I must say the Buffalo sauce and the taste of the chicken wings were pretty good. Maybe a burger or something next time.  I think I'll be back during football for some games, or another time whenever I want to bring a friend. Go try it out and maybe you'll like it. Parking is available in the back by Cindie's, but get there early as spaces run out quick."

I plan to visit more and scroll through the list of options again.  There's also a number of daily food and drink specials and I believe there is a happy hour offered as well.  I typically come to here to watch [European] football  (soccer) with a cold beer and standard American bar fare.  My one gripe is that they have a pretty good burger that they just don't know how to cook at medium temperature. I've ordered it twice and reiterated that I'd like it medium and it comes out well done each time.  That's mad annoying but I'm still holding out faith that they'll get it right one day. The fries are pretty top notch.  Again, you can't loose coming here just on the strength of the beer selection alone.  I'll be back for a better burger experience soon."

Definitely like any other bar, but drink specials are unbeatable and, as I stated above, they have amazing food for a bar but it will make you say \"diet starts tomorrow\" every bite.  Dog friendly outside, but only downsides are the tables can fill up quickly and parking isn't ideal."

Not sure if this is the standard but when we got there about half the tables were reserved for people who come to trivia each week. I get honoring loyalty, but this was a big turnoff for newcomers or people visiting Austin.   The biggest perk of this place is the ability to order off the Alamo full food menu for the chocolate chip cookies or bottomless popcorn. Otherwise, it's nothing you couldn't miss for another nearby bar. Perhaps I just hit people on an off night, but that's my opinion."

We had to figure out whether to seat ourselves or wait, by asking.  No eye contact from either waiter/waitress.  Annoyed the waitress told us to sit anywhere and someone will be with us. We sat at a dirty table didn't see a better option.  After 5 minutes we were approached but after a hufff and a puff the fat winded waiter walked off without saying a word then came back with a towel and aggressively began to wipe the table.  Mid-wipe I told the waiter we are just going to go somewhere else and he condescendingly responded \"Oh! Perfect! Thank you ladies!\" Then he quickly turned around  and threw the menus on the wait stand near by.  Friday evening shift 08/02/19 8:50PM"

We've been Alamo Drafthouse fans for 20+ years so I really want to love and appreciate this location -- but the food is awful and the service at 400 Rabbits is unpredictable. It hasn't always been that way. But the last year or so, I've met friends on several occasions for drinks and snacks. Chewy nuts, flat drinks. My last visit was the final straw: I couldn't even get a glass of water and the two dishes we ordered were terrible. Chili fries and pumpkin dip. Overly complicated food ideas and poorly executed. The pumpkin dip was bland and unappetizing. The fries were almost inedible but it came with a dip that made them bearable.  Please managers, fix this place. We love having an Alamo in 78739. We don't want some chain to come in and sweep us off our feet. But it wouldn't take much."

There is outdoor seating with patio furniture and fancy cocktails inside. Kyle helped us, and was very helpful when we were choosing beverages. The prices are a little high, but we also got the specialty cocktails and not my usual beer."

                "description": "This bar is connected to the Slaughter Lane Alamo Drafthouse, making it a nice way to kill time while waiting for your movie to start. We had about half an hour to spare and lucky for us, got to partake in the happy hour specials. Happy hour is Monday-Friday 4-7 and all day on Sunday's.  They have a Mexican inspired menu so there are a lot of tequila drinks (they even do flights) as well as dishes like queso con chorizo and grilled elotes which are corn on the cob with mayo, queso cotija, lime, and chili.   We had tickets to what they call a 'feast', where dinner is included with the movie, so we only wanted drinks. They have a lot of fun ones here and one called the Love Bug caught my eye which I think was made with sparkling wine, strawberry, lemon, and honey? I can't remember but I do know it was like $9. Gut punch!  I instead went with the more pocket friendly option of the happy hour Austin Eastciders Original Cider for $5. I'd never tried it before and it was really good!  My husband got a Karbach Sympathy for the lager for $3 which he also enjoyed.   The inside is small but there are both sit down and stand at tables, as well as bar seating. They also have games you can borrow and play while you are there which I think is awesome. And bonus! If you haven't finished your drink by the time your theater opens, they are cool with you taking it in there."

                "description": "I've been a big fan and frequent customer of Alamo for pretty much my entire life, but my experience tonight at 400 Rabbits was absolutely horrible. I assume they are managed and operated by Alamo given that they share a menu.  We came here for the Geeks Who Drink trivia, which was pretty much the only part of the experience that went as expected (though a tad slow).   We arrived at around 7:45 and ordered some drinks (a cocktail, a soda, and a water). The water was dropped off about 10 minutes later and the cocktail and soda a good 10-20 after that. The moscow mule was very watery and had no noticeable alcohol. It just tasted like very watered down ginger beer.   The waitress was friendly enough, but seemed extremely over burdened and scatter brained. I think she was the only waitress for the entire bar which was crowded due to trivia.   We ordered our food around 8:20 and I don't think we got it until 9:20 or so. We got a burger, chicken strips, and a chicken quinoa salad. Doesn't seem too complicated. The chicken quinoa salad looked like it'd already been half eaten and had no noticeable chicken in it. They did give us a side of chicken quickly after my fiancé showed it to them.  Alamo's food is never particularly amazing, but it was definitely lower quality tonight. The waitress was definitely aware of the bad service but didn't offer any sort of remedy.    TMI, but my fiancé is currently in the bathroom dealing with the repercussions of subpar food.   Extremely disappointed in this place and the Slaughter Alamo as a whole. A lot of reviews recommend it just as a bar, but I can't recommend it for that either as I don't think I was actually given alcohol."

                "description": "Really a 3 plus...400 Rabbits is not just a place to grab a drink while waiting for your movie to begin, it's a destination bar for us.  It also happens to be in our hood, which makes it very convenient indeed.  We have frequented the bar a few times now without so much as wanting to see a movie.    What we like?  We love the decor and retro feel of the bar itself.  We like sitting in the middle of the bar so we can watch the black and white silent movies on the screen in the lobby of Alamo.  We like a certain blonde, bubbly waitress who always seems to be happier than my Suzie, which is quite a feat in itself.  The Grilled Elotes are really yummy, but incredibly messy.  They need to have a couple of corn stabby handle things so you don't have to cover your fingers with butter/mayo and spice.  Having just said that, what the hell is wrong with having butter/mayo/spice hands?  At least give us an option please.    What is average?  Service can be a challenge at times.  If our blondie is not working, you can sit around for awhile with an empty drink in front of you.. even at the bar.  If you are there for Happy Hour, it would be really refreshing if they would come by the table and ask if you would like another drink before HH ends.  When movies are cycling in and out, you can be left a little abandoned while the hustle of getting new drinks out to folks ensues.  I am not totally convinced that the Bartenders really know a great deal about all the Tequilas they serve, which as a Tequila Themed bar, they really should know how one differs from the other.  We enjoy 400 Rabbits and can see how it could be really awesome destination for drinks and munchies for the neighborhood.  A little more attention to awesome service, hell just clone blondie, and that would be a great start."

They have multitude of whiskeys and beers to pick from.  Plus the outdoor seating and dog friendly atmosphere make this a chill spot for mingling with friends or soaking in the awesomeness of the state capital of Texas.  They also sell awesome shirts.  Sadly the Excite Bike shirt I saw the bartender rocking wasn't available so I settled for the blue shirt.  Please get more of those in!  The Wheel, keep on spinning!"

Came today to have a celebratory vaccine cocktail. It looks like they used to have a $4 whisky of the day... well, it's now $5 but the winning bet is to make it as a cocktail for $8. An $8 old fashioned? Can't say I'm mad about that. Jenny behind the bar was super friendly and I gotta say it's nice to sit at an actual bar again."

The bartenders are cool folks with lots of great knowledge. The music isn't too loud - a good volume for talking but still bumping :-)  Unfortunately though... its quite expensive, and the staff isn't super transparent about the pricing. For instance, the whiskey of the day is supposed to be $5. I got it with ice, and was charged an extra dollar. This might be trivial, but it sucks getting charged without warning, especially for something that shouldn't get an upcharge (even if the on-the-rocks pour is slightly more liquid)... kinda like getting charged for napkins. And in general, everything's pretty pricey for a neighborhood bar.  I guess I'm a little too old school for all the new hotness in Austin. But I don't see any reason to visit The Wheel when you have so many other places that are both inexpensive and cool."

No TV, limited beer selection that runs out quickly (both IPA kegs tapped out on a random Tuesday night), and no food.  You come here to let the night get away from you and order some strong cocktails.  Lots of outdoor space is cool and bring your own food is actually a plus in my book.  Beer selection 8 on draft, but good prices at $7/ish per big pour.  Everyone is nice and vibe seems 20s-30s clientele. I liked the Wheel for what it is, a good starting point nearby my apartment to begin a drinking night."

The bartenders are extremely friendly and seemed genuinely interested in conversation beyond just your tip.   They definitely specialize in cocktails so I would probably look elsewhere if you are looking for a nice draft or bottle of Shiner. I had 2 different specialty cocktails, both of which were good but definitely on the pricier side ($10-$15 each).

Ok, so this place is just super adorbs in a very approachable, contempo-rustic, \"shhhh, don't tell anyone or else the ubiquitous \"they\" will ruin it for the rest of us\" kinda way.   The barkeeps know their stuffs, their cocktails are legend (wait for it) dary without the arrogance or pretension you might expect from a place of this caliber; I think the lack of self-importance this place and the staff exude is one of my favorite things about it!  If you are looking for a low-key place to drink handcrafted, amazing cocktails (the Madison, I'm just saying) in front of a draught-tap water fountain amidst a menagerie of interesting EastSide Austin folk, then come here and enjoy (you can even have ADP delivered!). Just please remember...mum's the word, the password changes daily, and if fratty bros or hipsters catch wind of this place...I will look for you, I will find you, and I will give you the spiciest side-eye of your life!"

It is located off Martin Luther King right next to the Austin daily Press.  The inside bar are is small and quaint.  I love the side patio and this is where I spent a beautiful evening sipping on some cocktails and enjoying a sandwich which was delivered from next door.  I had the Molly and the Layla cocktails and both were excellent, refreshing and went down nice and smooth.  The patio has a gorgeous fountain with tons of beer taps spouting out water ... it was cool and creative feature to the atmosphere.    The bartenders here are super nice and professional!

I truly enjoyed every minute of the experience, and my tasty Old Fashioned which was a perfect choice to compliment the atmosphere. The bar tenders are super friendly and the place is eclectic, dark and decorated in a vintage style. They also have the best t-shirts I have ever seen at a bar.

                "description": "The Wheel was really well decorated, which set the evening off to a good start. The indoor area is intimate, dimly lit, and has a sort of prohibition-era bar feel with its tin ceiling, newspaper clipping wallpaper, and red lighting. Outside, you'll find a large patio with lots tables, and a great fountain made from beer taps. The drinks... well, my beer was way too expensive for what it was (a fairly generic IPA), and their selection for beers was limited (on draft: 8 taps, 1 IPA). HOWEVER, I know that's mainly due to the fact that The Wheel's specialty is whiskey. If whiskey's your drink of choice, I'm sure you'll love it here. They have $4 daily specials, and a number of specialty cocktails.  I'm glad I gave it a shot, and I'll definitely recommend it to my whiskey drinking friends, but if you're looking for anything besides whiskey (or maybe a nice cocktail) I'd steer you elsewhere."

Equal amounts of indoor and outdoor seating, including a picnic table area under some large oak trees. Pup friendly outdoors.   While it's not a place I'd drive across town to visit, I will definitely be back again when in the area."

                "description": "Let me just say, food is consistently good and they have kept the same recipes and menu since they opened, even when they changed owners yay! Place is clean and does not smell, the ice is the best and for some reason the water there is so crisp! But unfortunately, the service has gone downhill. Especially when the guy behind the bar sees you waiting to be seated and can't even say from a few feet away, \"hello we will be right with you.\" Or even a hello period. I mention this because it's been like this for the last few times we've been there. Usually there are two other servers helping the seated tables and he's just there all bothered looking. I have wanted to politely get his attention by asking him to come seat us. Mind you, it's usually not too busy when we go. I suppose it's frustrating when you know the person chooses to ignore you. Even though it says wait to be seated... it's nice to be acknowledged anywhere you go. Especially if you are fortunate to enjoy an evening out. Other than that, food is good. Service sadly, not so good. Side note- can you please change the 90s-2000 playlist that has been playing for the last 6-7 years lol. Same songs, same playlist. It's cool once in a while but some variety would be nice. I can tell the chef is the same and we thank you for that. It is the only reason we continue to show up!   *This review is to provide feedback in hopes that your business will benefit from an honest customer presenting this information."

The Zilker Love pizza had become its own food group in our home, and there are many vegetarian delights to delight, as well as craft beer and a fabulous brunch! The staff is thoughtful and diners tend to be very pleasant as well!  If you see Miss Sophia while visiting, please drop by and say hello!"

                "description": "With new management comes change  and reviews can change too, so the old sign that seemed a little pisdy towards dogs is gone.  I forgot pics, bit there's a dedicated dog area, not just at the seating just outside the front door but also across the parking lot with lots of shade, picnic tables, and a water station.  Our server, Luis, made our experience the best as he was willing to serve us across the way under the trees since things were slow.  His recommendation for salad dressing was cool too as we mixed 2 on our Southwest salad and that was awesome (cilantro and chipotle I think).  All in all, the pizza was good, and there is a dedicated brunch menu, which was unexpected as well.  We'll be back another time to try more things beyond pizza and to take pics."

Plenty of unique pizzas and burgers, Austin Terrier focuses on new American taste, mixed with the old.   Vegans rejoice, as there is a pizza and burger for you. The Greenbelt Pizza (sub for vegan cheese) and the Impossible Burger are going to be your go-tos. What makes the Greenbelt Pizza great is the truffle oil, the fresh and plentiful arugula, topped with red onions and mushrooms.  Add the Trio of Fries (sub the truffle parm fries), and you have a perfect meal for two."

I had a pretty delicious sandwich with Brie and apples, and my boyfriend had a pizza.  The crust on the pizza was perfect and probably one of the best crusts I've had on a pizza in a long time.  My sandwich was just okay....I definitely ordered wrong.  I would love to go back and try some of their other menu items and enjoy a beverage from their extensive menu."

Our go to's are the Diablo burger (spicy) and green belt pizza (delicious) ... swap the cheese for goat and request both to be gluten free. PLUS they were quick to accommodate for my child's allergies. The server went to the back and snapped a photo of what goes into their crust/bun so that we didn't expose her to any tree nuts.

Went last night with my doggo to meet a friend with her doggo, and we had the funnest and best waiter named Chad! I got the chipotle chicken sandwich and it was phenomenal. We also got a platter of 3 diff kinds of fries that were accidentally ordered for us and he told us to keep them lol. Then he covered our drinks for us because of a long wait time that wasn't even a long wait time! The dogs all played and got treats and tons of love from the staff. My enormous Bulldog couldn't get back into my car at the end because he was tired and my fiancé wasn't there to help me so Chad helped me lift him into my car lol. Anyways this place is awesome! 5/5 recommend!"

Lots of beer, the TVs aren't loud, and cute Terrier art is on the walls. Dogs are welcome in the outside seating area.  There are a few vegetarian options, and I'm pretty sure they can be made vegan.  After coming here several times, I have to suggest ordering the Trio of Fries. Three different seasonings and three sauces let's you try a variety of flavors and fill up on carbs. That's absolutely my jam. It's great for sharing with 2-3 more people and gotta really well with a sandwich. The Toro is pretty good. It tastes fresh and is really satisfying."

I'm not sure what the building used to be but I just think it's so cool.   The inside is dark and cool, but I love it. The food is amazing, the drinks are cheap, and the ambiance is cool asf. I came back here this weekend and not a single thing changed.   We got to sit outside this time and everything was perfect. Yellow Jacket Social Club is a diamond in the rough."

In total, we had two drinks apiece and slightly more experience compared to other places in the area. I have been here once before and had some fries. They had been pretty decent. Overall, I would recommend and will be back in the future."

                "description": "We came here on a Saturday night for the open patio seating and the grungy vibe. We got lemon drop shots, Vegas bombs, and Modelo's... Props to the bartenders for making legitimate lemon drops instead of hating us for ordering them.  They had bar service, and line was never longer than 3 people or crowded. We didn't have to wait for a table at all when we arrived. We sat in a table nestled in the trees and although I saw reviews that complained about the birds, the trees were a nice back rest, and the social distancing was comforting! It's definitely not a fancy or experience-based spot, but it has a time and place!   Pro tip: If you get stuck on the wrong side of the really long fence in the street, one of the panels to the right of the entrance is unattached and you can step through!!"

I walked it and was completely ignored. It felt like if I wasn't into indie music or dresses like a local I wasn't look at. I had a coworker who loves this place and raves about it. She was a very rude person so I shouldn't have know she would love this place. Like minded people, like minded spaces. I tried to give you a shot Yellow Jacket, but you weren't batting an eye. So I left and found other bars who didn't judge me in my appearance."

                "description": "We visited Yellow Jacket Social Club for an after work cocktail and they did not disappoint. From the guy at the door to the bartender, everyone was super kind and helpful. We ended up ordering the watermelon frozen margaritas - I could be wrong but I think they change up their frozen cocktails quite often. If you come across it on your visit, I would definitely recommend it. They had a variety of beer options and even though I didn't order any food, their menu looked appetizing.  They have a cool vibe with an expansive patio setup. If you get the choice between small/large cocktail, get the large. The price comparison is $7/10 and the large seemed like a way better deal. The birds above can be a little bit of a nuisance so try and sit somewhere with less tree above. They were also very Covid safe and instead of having everyone order in the bar, they had a makeshift bar setup outside where you would place your order. I recommend grabbing a patio seat here on a beautiful day!"

                "description": "I came here for happy hour, based on a local's recommendations. There really weren't any deals but the drinks were considerably priced. Bartender was alright but the staff overall and vibe of the place were not as hospitable as other places nearby. The inside is small with a five bar feel, which I'm fine with, the outside area is probably nice on days where it isn't raining but I sat out there during cloud cover and it was just alright. The parking lot gets flooded after rain so take that into consideration, The bright spot of this place was their potato wedges. Not even kidding. They aren't your typical wedges and I was delighted at how good they were. I'd return just for the those, to be honest. If you want no frills and to keep entirely to yourself, this is probably your place. Social butterflied would be best served somewhere else."

This a smaller establishment thats easy to miss but you should definitely pay attention and stop by if you're in the area. The decor and coziness makes you feel like you're in a classic pub. I had the port of havana to drink and it was delicious. Lighter on the alcohol(as intended) but it still tasted like a real drink and had an assortment of flavors that I haven't had before but I loved them. For food I tried the burger which was really solid. Cooked well, tasted fresh and the flavor from the caramelized onions made sure it was far from bland. Overall I really enjoyed this place and think its perfect to grab a drink or quick bite after work."

We wanted to sit outside and have table service and were told by the tall male host-  no, sorry - those are reservation only and our reservations are full today. So we opted for a table in the parking lot and ran to the bar to order. It was cold and we were the only ones out there - no offer to turn on a heater.  We sat outside from 5:30-9 and zero ZERO people showed up for all their \"reservations\".   I get that you may have to plan staffing around your booked reservations or maybe you didn't have someone to wait on tables but just be upfront about it.   I'm hoping this is an anomaly because usually the team is stellar there."

                "description": "We ate here for Valentine's Day2022. After being seated and our initial order taken, our server didn't return for 50 minutes. I asked the person that delivered our dinner if I could place a drink order with them, to which they replied \"I'll get your server\". The server never came. When our server finally checked in and we communicated we hadn't received any service for a very long time, the reply was \"do you want to order dessert\".  We ate our main course with nothing to drink.  This is my girlfriends favorite restaurant, and she was very upset that my experience was so terrible.  I called the next day to discuss with a manager. None were available, so I left my name and number. I never received a call back, so at least they are consistent. This may be a labor shortage issue, to which a little communication would have gone a long way."

                "description": "We went back here on Monday night for the first time since 2017 and had a better experience than our last visit--but not by much. (Oh, heyyyyy Jennie BTW....)  The space is still as cute as we remember it and the cocktails are great. We split the scotch egg, salade Rachel, and the moules frites. The scotch egg was a unique take and while one of us enjoyed it, the other one said it wasn't sitting well afterwards. The salad was phenomenal but it was too heavily dressed--loved the poached celery though. The artichoke seemed fresh too. Moules frites: flavor of the sauce was wonderful but the whole dish was kinda odd. Like, is the intention to have all the fries at the bottom of the bowl get soggy with the sauce?? Why not just include one slice of something toasted to sop that up? The garlic sauce on top was delish and the mussels themselves were great. Also literally EVERYTHING needed more salt. (Our friend wanted us to include that her mushroom-leek tart hardly had any leek in it :) Dessert was chocolate mousse and creme brûlée: nothing special but both were well-executed.  Service was mostly efficient but definitely snooty. He didn't check up with us about the food until we were almost half way done and there were several missed opportunities for asking us about another round of drinks. Clearing was also haphazard and sloppy.   So, overall, a sliiiightly better experience than last time. The food was pretty good, though, and we were happy to be in a cute little space with our friends, so we're willing to round up to four stars. We think you just need to come in here with the right mindset by not expecting them to excel at anything and for you to pay more than you should. But it's better than most of the restaurant crap out there in Austin--we will say that."

                "description": "Make reservations for dinner. Midday, you usually do not need a reservation, unless you are visiting during a holiday/peak busy time.   Indoor and outdoor seating available. Super casual outdoor setup--plain, wooden, picnic tables and benches, under umbrellas, which do nothing to shield you in hoooot weather. Better sit inside, and enjoy the classy, French province style ambiance. Really enjoyed both times I visited this place and dined indoors. Great for a date, a family gathering, or a casual friends get together.  For lunch, you order and pay at the bar, and then wait for your food and take it to a table of your choice. For dinner, a waiter serves you, providing a complete dinning experience. Staff are friendly and accommodating.  Loooved the pascal burger $16. It hit the spot the first time I tried it. When warm, the soft Camembert cheese melts into the cornichons, caramelized onions, and grain mustard, creating a perfect medley with the juicy patty. The meat was flavorful and well-seasoned, bursting with flavor. Definitely, one of the best burgers I've ever tried. Try this. Eat it while it's hot. When it cools down, it looses its ooomph. When I ordered this during my second visit, I waited until it was cool, and I did not get the same kick out of it.  Fries were perfect--well seasoned, crispy, and delicious.   Duck confit with polenta $27 was a small portion, but every element was executed perfectly. The duck was delicate and bursting with flavor, thanks to the bright, citrusy orange sauce. Polenta was crunchy and fun to eat, fried in a form of thick sticks.  Would return anytime I'm back in Austin!"

                "description": "First visit, so my assessment change over time. My initial sense is that while the food is good, the service needs some work.   No complaints about the food, which was quite good, such as the Heirloom Tomato Tarte and the Salade Niçoise.  The ratatouille could've used a bit more bread, and I thought the toffee flavor of the mango gelato-bread pudding dessert we got to be overpowering.  Drinks were varied and interesting, with French component takes on standard cocktails (e.g. \"The Vielle Fashioned\") that worked for some (their variation of the French 75) and  less so for others (I believe the Frontera Sidecar).  What definitely fell short was the service. I don't need overly attentive service, but it's not reasonable to be out of water for half an hour, unsuccessfully trying to flag down a waiter time after time.  This is particularly a problem given the small size of their water glasses and the lack of a water bottle for the table. Fixing this relatively small problem would be huge."

Everyone I was with really enjoyed what we got -- we tried the French toast with berry jam and toasted coconut, croissant breakfast sandwich, avocado tartine with a fried egg, eggs benedict, and grapefruit mimosas. Great service, chill ambience (especially for brunch at 11am on a Saturday!)--just great all around.

                "description": "We had our first visit to Hopfields tonight and I definitely think we'll be back. Its one of the most interesting places we've been in a long time. This restaurant had low key MeowWolf vibes. Every room a little different and the menu was full of surprises. Don't come here expecting a classic version of what you see on the menu!  We had the escargot dumplings, ratatouille, and moules- all presented quite differently than what we imagined. The food is good, not great, but very fun to experience. I wished we could have tried a few more things just to see what they would bring. Dress for the possibility that you might spill red sauce on yourself, because you will. Overall, it was a great little night out and definitely something new and different. If you're expecting traditional French food, you will probably be disappointed. If you're open to surprises, I think you'll enjoy it here."

                "description": "February should be the peak of PEI mussel season.  We came for the mussels.  Unfortunately I don't think the cook particularly likes them.  I had the overwhelming feeling that the cook never tasted the dish as it cooked. There was no sauce, the mussels appeared to be steamed okay and then a ton of chili powder or paprika was dumped on them and that was how they were served.   The powder made for kind of a paste because there was no, or very little, other liquid such as wine or vinegar or tomatoes or much of anything else.  I love to scoop up a tasty broth in the mussel shells and sip it while gulping the seafood,  but this was very dry.  The dryness and high chili content made it very hard to taste the mussels. The fries on top soaked up what little moisture that had been present.    The french onion soup, however,  was excellent."

                "description": "We got here on a Sunday evening and were told there was a want of 30 mins to sit indoor when there were empty tables but we were okay and sat in the back lot where they had outdoor chairs and picnic tables. If you're outside you have to get your food and drinks by going back inside by the bar to put your order. To our surprise, the cocktails didn't have actual liquor which was strange. The boards they brought out after a good hour after ordering along with the fries were a bit lackluster. The indoor dining was very cute however overall experience and food taste wasn't great to come back to"

                "description": "We ended up finding Hopfields thru Eaters List of best Burgers in Austin! Hopfields was #5! #5 guys and not to be snooty but I didn't even look at anything past P Terry's which was around #15! Hehehe P Terry's is good (it's a local chain, made to order) but it's a drive thru and I was looking for more of an \"elevated\" experience tonight! No shade to my P Terry lovers!! So the Paschal Burger is $16 Medium rare, and slathered in ooey gooey camembert cheese and mustard! I enjoyed it! I regularly lean toward a sweet burger with carmelized onion (which were included), BBQ sauce, bacon jam and other ingredients like these. This burger is just savory not too bold and a textural delight! See the video for the \"unboxing\"! I would give it a solid 7/10."

                "description": "This place has hands-down one of the best burgers in Austin. It's a casual little bar with craft beer and amazing French food. Their burger, covered in camembert or brie, carmelized onions and whole grain mustard is so delicious!! Pair it with crispy Pomme frites and homemade aioli...it's a mic drop moment. The staff is kind and helpful, their craft beer choices and a small but wonderful wine list just rounded out the afternoon. All they have left to do is claim their yelp listing! LOL  But seriously, if you are a foodie, this should definitely be on your list of places to frequent. I'm sure they have many other amazing things to eat there, but their burger is so good that we've never ordered anything else!"

                "description": "It has a very classy vibe to it, the choices for food and drink reflect it. I wish they had more variety in their menu, with cheaper options. I suppose you pay extra for the upscale vibe of the place.  This is not saying that the food is bad, in fact it is very good. The wine and beer options are the best in the area, now that Vino Vino is closed. The great thing is that you can go there for drinks, without ordering food, and have a great time sitting indoors or outside. The staff are very professional, welcoming, and they use their knowledge about the different wines to make suggestions."

                "description": "Came for dinner, without reservations, on  Friday. It was pretty empty and easy to get a table, so we sat in the middle room of the place, which was somewhat of a makeshift library/lounge with old foreign decor.  We got olives and almonds to start, with escargot, which came with small lettuce leaves and was in a red sauce (not your typical garlic butter). It was really good, different and interesting to try it in a different preparation. For the main, we split the steak and frites. It was probably the smallest portion of steak I've ever seen and if I had eaten it myself I probably still would have been hungry. But, it was really nicely cooked and seasoned, as well as the fries. So despite the size it was super good.  Don't know if I'd come again, also because they only had some special cocktails and not a full bar, but it was interesting to try the place."

The vibes here are so uncomfortable since they hired an incredibly rude bartender/manager who barks at customers like they are her subordinates in the army.  I've noticed she has been on staff during each of my visits since the pandemic began. It's hard for me to imagine how someone with such poor social skills has been placed in a customer-facing role. I will however continue supporting Techo, the mezcal bar upstairs, with super friendly staff and lovely atmosphere."

Otherwise, expect to pay minimum $14 for your main course. I love that their menu, decor and the restaurant reminds me of an elementary school.   Service was wonderful and food came out about 15 mins on a slow day. It's also conveniently located between a couple of taco restaurants if you need a quick snack!   Patio is Bob and dog friendly! There's water bowls for your thirsty pup on the side of the restaurant if you choose to bring your furry companion!   Bartender made me a cute mimosa to enjoy before heading back to the airport. Definitely coming back to visit when I'm in town again!"

Everything was fine; just nothing that makes me want to return again any time soon.  I love the indoor seating with its broody, dark interiors and the plentiful outdoor seating on park benches (hard to get in and out of if you're wearing a skirt/dress!) and when the sunset is that beautiful magenta/hot Texas orange color, this venue is perfectly situated to stare longingly at it. I also like that you order from the counter instead of traditional table service because sometimes it's nice not to be interrupted (make sure you have everything you need before you sit down, though, because if the line is long, it makes it difficult to track someone down for something).  A solid place for a drink if you're a sunset chaser."

A mess. Drinks are basic and uninteresting.

The best feature is the patio, Manor road is a cool neighborhood and its fun to people watch. The inside feels a little cramped for a group and it can be pretty loud. The neighborhood in general is nice. If your in the area you should stop by.  They also have some good happy hour deals. 6 dollar fish and chips and 5 dollars off bottles of wine. Each day of the week has a different deal and they're all pretty good.  In terms of drinks, they have a decent selection of beers on tap. Theyre selection extends beyond the basic austin starter pack too which is nice.  In terms of food,  Its a step up from bar food, but i definitely wouldn't call this a gastro pub. The fish and chips are good but definitely greasy and the portions are inconsistent.    The burger is pretty good. The patty is pretty thick and they put a jam on top thats sweet which stole the show. I think the jam was made of onions. I only wish they put more jam on top. It has a similar effect as ketchup. be warned, the saten burger is a little tough."

The only parking available is street parking behind the bar in the neighborhood, but you don't have to walk too far. (Less than 5 min)  This bar has a throwback school vibe with chalkboards on the walls and mini composition notebooks for your receipt. They have a good craft beer selection and their food is delicious and higher quality than your average bar food. We ordered the wings and pretzels. The pretzels are a bit more oily, however it being bar food, filled my greasy food craving. The mustard seed it came with was a great pair (although i highly recommend adding a queso dip!). The wings were delicious as well and were mild spicy. There is patio seating out back and picnic tables out front, as well, so there is plenty of space for a group."

                "description": "I had been meaning to check this place out as it is literally down the street from a friend's apt on Manor and having investigated almost every other place on the block, my FOMO was kicking in when I would see this place packed to the hilt every time we drove by. Luckily, I came on a quiet weekday evening and barely made it for their HH (the bartender was nice enough to honor it since it was but a minute over).   I like the vibe here, it is very trendy eastside but w/o the pretension or self-importance of other places nearby.   I had my sights set on the Montreal fries as I am a poutine enthusiast (and purist, to be truthful) , so I will establish right now these are not traditional poutine, but a conceptualization. First off, the serving was massive and I probably reached my sodium quota for the week by finishing every last bite, but I'm not a quitter and setting this heap of short ribs, gravy, cheese curds, and fries in front of me was instantly \"Challenge: Accepted!\". It took me almost an hour and a half whittling away one bite at a time and having to take literal breathers in between, but it was ::MISSION ACCOMPLISHED:: (in the unironic non-Bush sense) and I had 0 regrets.  In the 90mins of unleashing my hardcore Fatty for all to see, I got to interact w/the staff and other patrons and I have to say, there were no judgements (aamof, I got several nods and eyebrow raises of approval at my endeavor). I'll admit, everyone I encountered was a very Austin-y version of splendid! We laughed, I cried (when I finally finished the Montreal Fries), and even rebuked the very handsome bartender's insinuation I would even think about a to-go box!   All in all, I enjoyed my visit here and can see myself coming back on an off/quiet night. The seating inside is pretty cozy and the patio is smallish as well, so I can only imagine how chummy you have to get with your fellow \"students\" when the Friday bell sounds and weekend recess is in effect!"

Think it was worth it.   While small the space was great and the food and drinks on point. Loved the smokey blood Mary. Got the potato hash vegan style and it was tasty.   Only thing that was a miss was the way they handled the crowd. Couldn't order food and drink until after a time past open which isn't their fault but there wasn't enough staff to handle the crowd. Food went to wrong people and no one to check on diners.  They did the best they could but poor planning.   Will give them another go on a normal day and think things will be five star worthy."

                "description": "What a great little spot! Stopped in during HH on a Thursday and posted up at the bar. Super friendly bartenders and just a great vibe overall. Went ahead and sampled some beers, grabbed a Dogfish Punkin Ale - they guy even threw some sugar and freshly ground cinnamon on the rim! This is the only way you should be drinking a pumpkin beer!   Ordered the fish and chips - $5 bucks on HH! These things came with some serious garlic fries.. I want you to take what you think is a lot of garlic, then multiply it by 83874... Somehow still delicious, the tarter sauce on the side deserves an award.. It was like a tarter/greek tzatziki sauce hybrid! I should have asked for some to-go. No idea why they give you ketchup as well.. Doesn't really fit the plate because of the fry seasonings and garlic. The fish was tender and crispy... perfect balance.   If you haven't had a chance to check this spot out, throw it on your list!  One last thing - if you do order the fish and chips.. Don't go get your game on for the night without brushing and gargling a gallon of mouthwash, throw some gum in for good measure! Be responsible, people!"

Walk inside and you're surrounded by an industrial space with high ceilings and murals on literally every wall. It's quirky and beautiful!   Walk up the the barista and order a coffee from a full coffee menu. They roast their beans and sell it across the country. Next to the coffee bar is an actual bar with beers on tap from ales to cider and even a fruit punch and pickle sour type drink.  I ordered a vanilla latte for over just $6, tapped into their wifi and found open seating in the back patio. Only 3-5 tables are near outlets inside, but the back patio has a few outlets. However, the wifi isn't as strong outside."

The aesthetic in the place is really light and fun, and they have a lot of outdoor seating area. There were a lot of people doing work/homework of some kind, it is definitely a place where you can come and chill for a while. There was a large selection of drinks, including some seasonal options. I decided to get an iced Americano which I thought had a good flavor. Drinks were to us pretty quickly, and there was a water station four easy water access. The cream and sugar area also had almond milk, which I thought was a nice addition. Most places usually only have half and half, so a non-dairy alternative was nice to see. They sell beer, however I didn't look at the beer selection so I'm no help on that! Worth checking out, I plan to go back soon!"

This is an excellent example of a business making an effort to seamlessly live in its environment-- in other words, this coffee shop found a way to complement its outside surroundings near the Tesla factory, and almost gives off a steam punk vibe. I'm a pretty sunny person, but even I can't resist. Also, the drinks are actually good. Very glad that they were able to have an aesthetic look and comfy vibe without sacrificing the quality and taste of their drinks. I got the matcha latte with oat, vanilla, and turmeric !"

On the one hand that's great for business, on the other I want to keep them all for myself.   A lot of coffee shops can be snooty and pretentious, but this ain't that. Everyone there truly loves coffee and people. They just want everyone to be caffeinated and happy. What better a mission than that?  They roast their own beans which means you're getting a truly unique cup when you go there. All of their espresso pulls are doubles to start. That's why I love getting the 1:1 when I go to sit down. You get a single shot of espresso and a baby latte with the other single shot inside. You also get a glass of sparkling water and a Hershey kiss. Total perfection. This lets you explore and taste the espresso on its own and then see it in a drink with the milk. It's an awesome way to discover what you might like or not like about a particular roast.   Then on your way out if you liked it you can buy a bag of those beans to take home for your coffee there for the week. It's the best."

They've got compostable take away cups and utensils, which is so rare. Their tea comes loose leaf in a steal strainer, and all their food is severed on reusable plates and in mugs.  I got the Turkish tea, flavorful and now one of my favorites. I'm not sure if this is a house mix, but the tea tasted unique and strong. Unlimited hot water refills, just go up to the bar area and ask! With tea I got the tasty morning bun, kind of like a cinnamon roll but with different nuts and really big. Flakey croissant exterior with a goo-y interior, this was a really nice cafe treat!  I think tourists and locals both enjoy the distinctive graffiti art on the walls of this cafe. It's located in a shipping container area that has a nice outdoor seating place too."

Granted, I thought the navigation was taking me somewhere very odd as Spokesman is a bit off the beaten path and was a bit harder to find in the dark. But it's worth it. I was greeted by a friendly staff and an interesting menu. The beer was fantastic and I got a cold brew coffee to go for the next morning.    For food, I'd suggest the chicken salad sandwich. It was delicious! However, the bread is toasted a bit too much--so crunchy it hurt my mouth a bit. But overall, crisp and fresh flavors that left me wanting more. I'd order it again, just asking that the bread not be so hard."

                "description": "Techo Mezcaleria and Agave Bar is a great speakeasy on Manor Rd. If you are a fan of mezcal and/or tequila, this is the place for you. Small bar with a patio too (with a heater). Ian is a great bartender and took care of us. You should definitely try the \"stuff in a cup\" (Ian's favorite mezcal cocktail with passion fruit). The spicy mango mezcal margarita was also enjoyable or you can sip one too. Great spot to to ring in the new year."

                "description": "This place is very confusing on how to actually fine. I thought it was connected to meet Madrid. But it is not. Actually go next-door and then to their backyard and then go up and you are at the spot. It's very small it's almost gives you a speakeasy feel. The bartenders were super cool and we really enjoyed our time there. It was a group of seven of us and we took up most of the bar. Drinks are very good as well. If you're not a tequila fan this is not for you but you should still try to experience it at least once. They have frozen on the rocks and other delicious cocktails."

                "description": "LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! I have been driving by Techo everyday for years, and we frequent the area for the other restaurants and bars, but for some dumb reason beyond comprehension, we never gave them a try. We are completely hooked now! The space is cozy, intimate, and inviting. The drinks are just out of this world, and SO strong! The flavors are unique, and even if you aren't a mezcal fan, some of the drinks completely cover up what's even in it! They had a cool nook tucked away next to the bar that we are hoping to sit in once things open back some more, and we would love to hang out inside and enjoy their cool vibe inside! The patio is tucked away upstairs, and even though it's in a busy area right along the street, you don't even notice! They have TONS of misting fans outside that made the 102 degree heat totally tolerable for once!   They had dog bowls out, so I would venture to say they are dog friendly, which we plan to take advantage of very soon!"

                "description": "I hesitate to write this review because I love that Techo currently feels like a secret, locals only Mezcal bar. But they have my favorite margarita in town, incredible ambiance and authentic tasting experiences - that you just have to KNOW about it. This is the first bar I bring visitors too - usually right when they open, so we can snag seats at the bar and get guided Mezcal tastings from Techo's very knowledgeable and easygoing staff. I never leave without ordering at least one of their Frozen Guava Agave Margaritas with the chili salt rim (do NOT pass on the home-made chili salt, it is the perfect pair for this sweet/tart drink).  Every one of my girlfriends love that drink! My boyfriend also loves that he can get a strong mezcal centered cocktail from their list (which has 10-12 house cocktails that are great). Their Micheladas are also a crowd fave.   When you start to get hungry - walk to Salty Sow for happy hour apps or down to Patrizi's to share some crazy good home-made Italian food from a food truck! You'll have a line at Patrizi's - but it's a great option for your visiting friends, who have probably never had an Italian food truck experience."

                "description": "Techo Mezcaleria reminds me of why I still love Austin: the unusual, hidden gems that are tucked away all around the city.  Most other folks already hit the highlights. It's tiny, seats maybe 10, and you enter through the Schoolhouse Pub gate, despite Techo actually being on the second story of Mi Madres. Word of caution: Mezcal ranges from \"lightly smoky\" to \"I'm drinking liquid smoke.\" Personally it's not something I can have a lot of, we had three sample sized shots and that was plenty between the two of us. Just be forewarned.   Our bartender Ian was awesome, we had a nice, rambling forty minute conversation about mezcal versus tequila versus whisky. Unfortunately, we went on a Saturday when there wasn't a happy hour, so we didn't get a chance to sample the margaritas, but that gives us a great excuse to go back."

They have a good sized drink menu and also offer frozen drinks, which is always a fun addition.   They have a fantastic selection of Mezcal and Tequila and it's a fantastic spot for a date because they have a few nooks inside great for a few to sit. The ambience is also very romantic-very dim inside with lots and lots of candles everywhere. The place itself is upstairs of SchoolHouse (there are stairs outside to the right of the restaurant). It is pretty small, only seating maybe 20 inside and about the same outside.   However, worst case scenario if you arrive and they're packed you can head downstairs to SchoolHouse for a drink!  This is a must visit and will impress others when you introduce them to a what-feels-like hidden gem."

Great draft selection, in fact an OUTSTANDING draft selection.  They even have some bottled selection too. I really like that they don't carry the Milwaukee or St Louis brands and are all craft.  My only criticism would be that beer shouldn't be served in a small (almost) wine glass at $9/beer. That's just too rich that it limits me to one.  If it were a pint the value would be better.

                "description": "Straight outta Belgium! I love it!  I popped by this place for a beer and found it interesting that I previously and unknowingly walked right past when meeting friends at the TexMex joint next door.  Service here was great during the day - when I stopped in. I presume the guy running the bar was the owner but didn't get into a convo about that. He appeared to have moved from San Francisco a few years back from what I gathered and he was very beer knowledgeable which made for my sour selection.  We spoke of some other sours in the area and such. He was a genuine guy having a genuine conversation. That small chatter right there made me feel like I could call this a regular watering hole in a town usually piled high with trendy pop-ups.  He celebrated 3 yrs just recently and I can see why he's still here. It reminds me of a small establishment I visited in Brussels last year right adjacent to Mannekin Pils (the famous peeing baby statue for those unaware). It had a sense of community and Mort Subite also has that. Maybe it's a Belgium thing but I felt like I was right back there when I sat here.  I really enjoyed myself here and although I had but one drink (i was doing my own beer exploration day), I will be back."

Like all bars, the bartenders set the standard and, hence, the five star review. Anthony and Piper are a great team and are professional, warm and inviting with customers. The draft beer selection is exceptional and you'd be hard pressed to find an equal rival in the city. Directly across the street from Elephant Room on Congress and 3rd, you get a great mix of residents and tourists, alike. There's outdoor seating both in the front and back (including a solid American fare trailer in the back -- good philly cheesesteak). But I digress, it's all about the ambiance, beer and good people at Mort's."

                "description": "If you like Belgian beer, or if you just want to try Belgian beer, Mort Subite is the place you should go.  This cozy bar features about 30 Belgian beers on draft, and has many more in bottles.  Of course, every beer is served in the brewery's unique glass.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  They also have an Indian food truck behind their outdoor beer garden.  Delicious food that goes surprisingly well with the Belgian beer."

                "description": "Very cool Belgian ale bar right in the heart of downtown. Can't believe I haven't seen this place while walking around dt.. a real hidden gem if you're looking for Belgian beers.  They have a nice selection of Belgian ales on tap, most I had never heard of which was nice to be able to try all new things. They also have some higher % beers in the frig which appear to be some of their fancier ones, eager to have a go at these next time.   Real cool spot, good for going in and trying some new Belgians to get an idea for this particular subset of beers, right in the heart of Austin."

                "description": "The only thing good about this place was the variety of Belgian Beer, which is what they're known for. They had 2 of our favorites, 1 of which is incredibly hard to find in Austin, La Trappe. I do appreciate the beers in the proper glass. The front patio gives nice European vibes. However, the service is horrible. I wish I had gotten her name, tall thin woman, medium length blonde hair. Very rude and short with our group, the birthday boy with us had questions and she wasn't happy to help. She told him to stop talking in the middle of their conversation. Then when we went to close our tab the bill was $135 for 4 beers. Four beers, by the glass. Now some of the beers are pricier than others since they're imported but we were aware of that as the prices are listed on the chalk board behind the bar. We also don't mind paying good money for quality beer. We questioned the tab and the person behind the bar investigated and said the tall thin woman, who was short with us earlier, charged us for the two large bottles of some vintage or specialty bottle, which is not what we ordered nor what she served. She eventually fixed the tab but it was a very sketchy 'mistake' and the entire experience was memorable in a terrible way. We will not be back and are disappointed since we went in very excited to try it out. I don't recommend this bar."

                "description": "I love all beers Belgian so I have been wanting to come here for a while now.  Came in on a cold Wed January evening and my friend and I, save for whom I can only assume was a regular, were the only ones in the bar.  The bartender was very friendly and appreciated that we concurred on beer suggestions for my friend.   I really loved that they serve the beers in their correct respective glassware (especially the Kwak, which is worth ordering for the glass apparatus alone!).  The prices per serving are a bit on the higher-end of the Belgian Beer spectrum from other bars I have had the same beers at, but honestly,  I liken this sitch to the line from \"The Prince and Me\"...\"you can really taste the extra 10 cents\".   For a place that's French for 'Sudden Death', it isn't nearly all that intesnse, but when I had my first pour of their Gulden Draak 9000 Quad, I did kinda feel like I'd died and gone to Belgian Beer heaven!"

Yes its on the pricier end but the quality of the beer here is worth its weight.  I wish they could pour the beer a bit better. Most of my beers come out with more than half as foam."

                "description": "This place gets two-stars because of their selection. Being from Belgium, I enjoy looking up places in America and Mort Subite might be the only Belgian place in Austin.  To my big disappointment, besides the selection they have, there's not much attraction for a native to come here, unless you want a badly poured beer and rude service.  The first time I came to Mort Subite I can no longer remember, probably because it was underwhelming but after a lot of people told me to go there as a Belgian, I figured to give it another chance as I was pretty excited to have a La Chouffe on draft. When I noticed that the bartender was pouring this high ABV beer wrong, I asked him if I could give him some advice on how to pour it better. His answer was simply \"no\" and walked away while he handed my my check. Completely mesmerized, I still tipped him, and walked away. When I explained to my friend what happened, he said I needed to have given context.  So I went back in, ordered another La Chouffe and as soon as he placed the glass under the tap, not holding or tilting it, I apologized for earlier and asked him again if I could give some advice as a Belgian who has had many years experience working in bars. He immediately stopped the pour and  looked at me. When I explained him to hold the glass, tilt it and pour the beer on the spot where your finger is, and how that technique is very common and necessary to pour high ABV beer, he just stared me dead in the eye and continue to pour as he started, wasting a lot of beer and giving me a shitty poured beer.  I send management an email since I thought that they would love to be aware about this before I put anything online but after almost a two weeks of no response, I feel obligated to share this experience."

                "description": "Gave Mort Subite another shot as Belgian beer is the one true god of beers and can't stand not going to one of the truly Belgian bars in the country.  Again, takes a long time to get served as each pour is perfect and looks delicate.  Menu doesn't change often on draft and was 90% the same.  However, this is some of the freshest draft Belgians I've ever had, and have some rare varieties that you mainly only see in bottles.  Prices are very high and 150% of any other bar in town, but this is the quality stuff and high abv.  Now that they have a food truck out back with some good looking Indian, Mort Subite might be worth adding to my list of usuals when in that Belgian mood.  You should expect a long wait at the bar, high bill, but overall a great beer pour."

Our bartender Anthony was very friendly and did not hesitate to explain each beer. And he steered to one that we loved. They have a food truck in the back, Indian food, if you are hungry. We did not eat, but I am glad it is there if needed. I will be a regular here. I love Belgian beer, and hate having to hunt for it at local bars, restaurants, or trying to get it delivered online is hard and expensive. THIS IS THE PLACE FOR GREAT BELGIAN BEER!"

We Ordered:  Mai Thais - Sweet and strong Lychee Lowdown - Tasty and a great price for their all day (?) happy hour Charred Spicy Edamame - The char has good flavor but the seasoning wasn't spicy and left it a little greasy. Would just get it salted next time. Queso Loco - Not bad, had good flavor.  JFP Popcorn Chicken: Kung Pao - Really delicious, I could have eaten just this.  Nam Nom Noodle Salad - Also really tasty and would definitely get again. Bonus: it came already split so we didn't have to fight for the last bites. Hilo Hawaiian Sandwich - Was too full to really give this a good enough try but what I could manage to eat was great.  Hong Kong Waffle - Best dessert I've had in a long time. I'm a sucker for treats that make you feel like a kid and this absolutely nailed it.   Our server didn't seem like they wanted to be there but it seems like the crowd can get pretty rowdy so I don't totally blame them. With a few swaps in food, though, I'd definitely still come back."

Surprisingly tasty!  Other stuff was good too though not as much of a standout to me personally.  Lots of fried college food stuff (it is Rainey Street) and the saucy dishes kind of start tasting similar if you order enough of them..

We ordered the honey sesame version that was sooooo tasty!!  The sweet potato waffle fries were a hit too, and so was the chips and guac.   We also had espresso martinis that were surprisingly without coffee beans but still tasted good!  Overall, we LOVED our experience here.

The service was amazing. We had several different people waiting on our table so I'm not super sure how that worked out but it did.  It worked very well.  10/10 recommend.  Great place.

If you allow your imagination to suspend disbelief, Anthem could be a tiki lounge on one of the islands of Hawaii...without the airfare to get there. The decor of longboards, hula girl jiggle figurines, and tiki torches can transport you for an hour or two to a tropical paradise.  The service was perfect! I unfortunately did not get the bartender's name, but he was prompt in greeting me, and offering to get me a drink to start my evening. My guy was parking the car so I ordered appetizers and drinks before HH ended. We had blood orange frozen margaritas which were delicious. We tried the fried cauliflower and some guacamole. Both had good sized portions and were tasty.  Another bartender checked on us as she walked by, which was great. I love when everyone works together to provide excellent service. There were two hosts at the door to greet people- they were both professional, warm, friendly, and prompt as well. Good job, Anthem in choosing excellent staff.  The decor was spot on. It felt upscale without the upscale prices. We sat at the bar, and the stools were comfortable enough to have a full meal if you were to choose to do so. Overall, the place was clean and spacious as well. Go check it out and let me know what you think. Aloha!"

A group of 9 of us came here for dinner and we were all so impressed with the food. The appetizers are where it's at . The yummy fries blew some of us away - WOW. The brisket rangoon was outstanding. And the miso mac daddy....c'mon.   I would say the appetizers were more star players than the entrees. Don't get me wrong, the entrees were delicious too but I can't get over the apps.  The service was good. Our waitress was attentive and checked on us frequently. However, she did tell us there was a 2 hour service limit....  The decor was very cool and the whole restaurant had mood lighting. We had reservations at 6:30 and it was pretty dead at that time but really picked up 30 minutes later. Once it was a full house the atmosphere became louder and more vibrant. Right on S. Congress, where the bars are, I didn't see many parking options.  Overall, I want to come back here. I want a texasian restaurant in my city immediately! For now, i will just have to recreate their menu on my own."

                "description": "LOVE LOVE LOVEEEEEE this cute gem! I can't believe it's tucked away on Rainey street. Street parking is hard to find unless you come on a weekend day. They have weekday happy hour which is basically only good for the drinks. Not many shareable food items on it. I'm so glad to have found this spot. The drinks were so great! These two drinks gave me the perfect buzzz. If you like fruity drinks try the Splash and EXSW (East by Southwest) hate the name but love the drink. We ordered the furikake fries which is the perfect comfort food and filling definitely big enough to share between 3-5 people! We also ordered the popcorn chicken, I personally did not like whatever coating/breading. Service was fast. I would definitely dine in again for weekend brunch or an early dinner."

It is a savvy mix of Asian and Latin cuisine with a fun spin, and it's affordable. Don't sleep on the miso Mac daddy -- it's a combination of like Mac and cheese balls and sushi. Truly amazing. The fried tofu app was delicious as well. For entrees, my partner had the noodle salad (yum), and I had the vegan curry dog (comes on a pretzel bun), and you can't go wrong with either. Really, it seemed like you can't go wrong with anything you choose here. Staff are all young, welcoming, and friendly. Added bonus: GREAT happy hour and cocktail menu in general. I'd eat here weekly if we were local."

I would recommend you order their fried shrimp and French fries. They have a bit of spice and come with cole slaw and dipping sauces! You get about 10-12 pieces and a ton of fries. It's enough for 2 people."

On an average sweltering Austin day/night I can imagine Whip In being the essential local spot for a quick beer or 5. With a great selection of beers on tap, along with extensive coolers for carry out, this place seems just great.  Apparently they have food too? Whip In should be the norm for corner stores/bars everywhere. Kudos fellas"

No food or even an acknowledgement really of something gone wrong.  I think it's a management issue - just a waitress and cook were there to shrug and say maybe someone else took it.  Mistakes happen, but the lack of reaction leaves me baffled i.e. offer empathy or refund or comp...  Sorry, but y'all lost a neighborhood regular!"

                "description": "I ordered a to-go meal tonight via Postmates, and when I went to pick it up, I was met with extremely rude and disrespectful behavior by one of the bartenders. Upon arrival, I asked where I needed to pick up my food, and I was pointed to a shelf. The bag had my first and middle initial, but not my last name and was labeled UberEats. I asked them to find my order. With some back and forth, it was determined that my order had been mislabeled. Mistakes happen, and I understand that. As I'm trying to sort this out with a female bartender and a cook, the other bartender, a tall burly man with a beard, a Marlboro hat and a camouflage shirt rudely shoved the bag of food at me, cutting me off, and said, \"this is yours\" and turned around and walked off.   I supported this business at the beginning of COVID by shopping in their makeshift grocery store, and even buying t-shirts. I only recently acquired a taste for Indian food, so I was excited to try it tonight. I will never be back. I was also told they don't have a manager around, nobody is in charge, and as I searched online for a way to contact anybody running this place, I came up empty."

                "description": "This is a unique locally grown spot that is worth a visit in South Austin. Prior to the pandemic a popular spot to catch bands on the outdoor stage, not too sure about the music situation right now. The Whip In is a corner beverage depot with a quality selection of craft wine and beer. If I may add, a very quality selection of wine and beer. If you want to expand your palette and try  a new craft beer or wine, def stop in. Very large selection of chilled rose, which I found impressive. The selection of beers by the glass is also impressive. This is a very cool spot to come in and meet friends, and grab a pint. The Whip In is also an Indian restaurant. The quality of the food is not a 5, but a 4. If you are looking for great Indian food there are better options, but the overall experience here and what it offers is above average and worth a visit."

                "description": "Really disappointing tonight at the Whip In. I think it was an off night? First off, the draught board which is usually full up to 70+ was very scarce, so not sure what was going on there.  We ordered the chicken vindaloo and chicken shawarma. I was confused when our food came out for 2 reasons: 1) I wasn't expecting a wrap and fries for the shawarma- just was expecting rice since the menu didn't describe it as a wrap, but whatever - my bad 2) it came in takeout containers with only one set of silverware (plastic)  I went back inside to ask for another set and also asked if why (out of curiosity) the presentation had changed to takeout containers. I was told \"it's a covid thing\". I tried to explain nicely that I understood - but have only been in Austin since covid and have come every week or so since January, always with plates etc. She repeated, seeming annoyed with the question, that it was a covid thing, shoved me two mini plates and some silverware and walked away. Ok, cool!   I'm only giving a 3 because I have been here 6-7 times, always with a great experience. Tonight was a 1 star for service, but honestly food was below par as well. Leaving a sad customer :("

I have come to the Whip In for years (I still remember playing a show here when I was a kid in my father's band and having one of best and most interesting Indian fusion chicken fried steaks of my life) and always appreciated (and still do) what they're doing. But the prices are just getting too damn high.        As of the past week, every single beer on tap has risen by a price of roughly $3 on average; essentially the base price for any beer on tap STARTS at $8, and without a doubt that's the highest I've seen at any establisbment in Austin, and I have been to an uncountable number. I also had their $12.99 Kurma (also known as Korma in some resturaunts) and it was good, but more like a $8.99 Korma at Tejis as fas as quantity and depth of flavor goes.        Make no mistake, this is an indesputed historic establishment that's likely also struggling with COVID and I'll still support it, but seeing these changes is just disheartening and it's getting harder and harder for me to justify still stopping in on the weekend."

Constant staff turnover, and the menu and beer selection has shrunk to basically half of what it was.   The food in particular is a shadow of what it used to be. Tonight, after finding out they didn't have any of the specials on the board, we ordered chips and queso and after bringing us one order, they brought us a second mistakenly? Both had stale chips and the queso was burnt. I asked for no cilantro in my dish due to an allergy and it was absolutely lousy with it. Tried to drown my sorrows with a beer and was served the wrong one.   Honestly, not sure what changed but this place isn't what it used to be. Hopefully it's just an off night, but I've thought that several times in the past few months and it's only become worse."

I'll definitely come back again to relax with friends and my doggo in the future. I thought the fridges in the back full of beer was pretty cool.  TLDR - decent food and draft beer selection - bunch of freezers with lots of beers and shelves of wines - cool music - had one TV inside from what I could see"

The beer selection for purchase might be my favorite in town that I have found so far. They carry my two favorite breweries which aren't found many places and then have a multitude of beers on tap, too! I love the tarot card feel at each of the booths and then the perfect little patio outside.  Dog friendly, live music when the world is allowed to sing again, and Indian food? You would never know.... we brought some friends here recently and quite honestly... this might be my new little \"let me take you to a local spot we love.....\" for our guests. Go. Have a beer.

                "description": "Went here on St. Patrick's Day to grab a Reuben with my girlfriend.  The pub is dark and divey, but it also has a nice outdoor patio area, that is dog friendly. There was plenty of parking when we showed up which was nice - it can be a challenge in their area.  The sandwich itself was fantastic. Rye bread, warm corned beef, melted Swiss, sauerkraut, and the cherry peppers I added were all perfectly complimented by the orgy sauce the sandwich was smothered in.  Honestly, the only thing disappointing was the chips. They were ice cold, unsalted, and relatively flavorless. I put on some Yellowbird Serrano to give it some flavor and used them to scoop up what had fallen out of my sandwich. I just can't help but think how much better they would have been fresh!"

                "description": "On a recent trip to Austin upon arriving around lunch time we checked into our AirBnB and were in need of some lunch quickly!  Our AirBnB host recommended Gourmands as a good local spot.  We headed over and found there was plenty of parking and it was very quiet on a random weekday around lunchtime.  I like their system of scanning the menu and just ordering from the table, however it was sort of odd to not interact with anyone upon entering.  The only real greeting we received was from someone poking their head out of kitchen to let us know we could sit anywhere and order with the QR code. I imagine that would be a but different when the restaurant is more crowded though. We ordered some soup in a bread bowl and a couple sandwiches.  The food was promptly brought to us.  The bread bowl was awesome, along with the chili.  The sandwiches were also good, high quality bread and everything on the sandwich tasted very fresh!  Gourmands was a solid place to get some fresh food quickly without having to wrestle with parking and lines in some of the more populated areas of Austin. Good lunch spot!"

                "description": "Gourmands is one of my favorite takeout places in Austin. I usually get the Second Deadly Sin with fresh avocados. The salads can be weird, and I'm not a fan of the soup+bread bowls, but conceptually they are interesting.   Eating in at Gourmands is more fun if you go alone. The atmosphere is very traditional pub, so if you're seated at the bar having a meal and your drink, you'll almost always find good conversation. It's less fun to go with someone for a sit down meal, as it really is more of a bar than a restaurant, even though the food is pretty good. Quirky's not exactly the right word. It's idiosyncratic, and kind of addicting?   After Thoughts for Advanced Listeners: I want to be at a place in my journey where I can eat a Cleopatra and not feel I'm missing out on meat."

But when it was delivered to our table it was just in a regular bowl. When I asked they said well yea they were out of the bread.  I understand being out and that is cool but if they would of told me that when we ordered we would of ordered something else.  Our server asked if we wanted anything else. But never mind.  Bummer."

I got the Po-Po. This was basically a BLT but they put an amazing garlic mayo spread on it. I think the best combination is to have it on wheat bread. It was so stellar that as I finished and looked up, my bf and two friends were only halfway done eating! Definitely going back to this place!  Street parking, outside patio, bar inside with seating as well."

                "description": "I really wish I loved this place more because I was so excited to bread bowls, but it fell really short of my expectations. My friend and I sat in the outdoor patio area, and there were so many empty tables with eaten food left on the tables that hadn't been cleared yet. Summer is coming, so there were a ton of flies that were attracted to the food that eventually came to bother us when our food arrived.   My friend and I ordered spinach and artichoke dip to share, and I had the clam chowder and Deadly Sin sandwich combo. Firstly, the spinach and artichoke dip had so much cream cheese in it that it didn't taste like artichoke or spinach. It was really thick and gloppy, and I felt heavy just eating it. My clam chowder was really lacking in the clam flavor, and it also wasn't that good. The sandwich was okay. Nothing special about it.   I am pretty sad that I didn't love this place because prices aren't terrible, and the concept of soup in bread bowls is awesome. Not many places in Austin serve that. However, they seem really understaffed and the food itself isn't good enough to warrant a second trip."

As a non-drinker my tastebuds didn't compute this right on the first try. The soup and bread bowls are delicious but of course they leave you feeling extremely full! I'd been craving a chicken salad sandwich, so the Foghorn Leghorn hit the spot."

Their delivery system is a bit cumbersome and has glitches but they're aware and make it right when it messes up. In person, this place has awesome ping pong table set up as well as a great outdoor space. It's a great hangout. Chill and has great food - the two best things you want in a gastro-pub."

The sandwiches are beyond incredible and can't come recommended enough! Right now, you seat yourself and order from your phone at your table via a QR code.   We got the Second Deadly Sin and Chili, and both came out delicious and served with house made pickles and chips. The Black Bean soups is in incredible vegan option I've had multiple times.

                "description": "A combo lunch that doesn't skimp on portions for only $10?!? Hot dog! Well, more like hot soup and sandwich or salad (no hot dogs on the menu).   The soup is served in a bread bowl (French bread, not sourdough!) and they have four or five options. I went with the broccoli and cheese which was more like queso with a few chunks of broccoli in it, but heck, maybe Gourmands knows me better than I know myself, as that's probably what I really wanted anyhow! I scarfed it down and had to stop myself from eating the entire bowl of bread. The chicken salad sandwich was lovely, but because I went full hungry girl on the soup (and homemade chips), I didn't eat it until the next day for lunch. Again, a lot of combo for your buck!  The place definitely blends in with the neighborhood, it's dive-y looking on the inside with a bunch of cheerful regulars at the bar (also the type of establishment you'd see a baby on a hip and a beer in hand), a TON of tables and booths for groups, and ping pong and skee-ball in the back. They've got a small parking lot, too."

THEN on top of that i ordered the royal and they gave me mushrooms instead of meat (which I didn't order). I did tell the waiter and all he said was sorry(didn't offer to fix it).

I can see this place being an awesome, standard spot to grab a drink with regulars on any given day or night, but what we came in for was their highly-rated bread bowl soups and dang - they don't disappoint. The bread was soft and the perfect consistency - sturdy yet edible, which I feel is hard to come by with bread bowls. They offer a lot of great lunch options, like a soup and salad, sandwich and salad, or salad and soup. I went with the cobb salad and their black bean soup. To be fair, the server did warn me the soup was spicy, but I was definitely sweating a bit while sipping this delicious soup. The bread was a wonderful compliment to the spice and really soaked it up so I could keep going back for more!  On the way out, we noticed a room in the back with skee ball. Yep, we will be back for sure."

                "description": "This place is a go-to local sports bar hidden in Sunset Valley. It's tricky to find as it's in the corner and maps or Waze doesn't pinpoint it exactly. Don't get discouraged if it's your first time trying to find it. You can do it! We went to watch some NCAA hoops and luckily found a great table outside in front of a huge TV. Dogs are welcome and they have disposable water bowls for dogs and you fill them up yourself.  The beer on tap is great. They even have Pinthouse Pizza's ELECTRIC JELLYFISH on tap!  I have been here a lot and the food is decent. It comes out hot and the portions are typically a good size. I was underwhelmed by the Buffalo chicken sliders today and here's why... The taste was great. The bun was fresh. We got real blue cheese on the side and fresh lettuce. The size of the chicken on the bun was disappointing. It seemed more like a chicken nugget than a slider. The bun to chicken ratio was way off. Put more chicken on the bun and this would be a fantastic little slider.  The place closed at 11 and they didn't kick us out even though we were the last ones there and they were cleaning around us. The game was tied and there was two minutes left. We couldn't leave yet! March Madness Baby!  Grab your friends, your dog, and your appetite. This place is great.  Side-note: there is a great playground and lots of room for the kiddos. So bring them along too. You can send them off to play while you kick back with friends and enjoy the patio."

Great happy hour. Slightly better than average bar food. Not outrageously priced. Plenty of parking. Indoor and outdoor seating. TVs play sports. Playscape for the 2 legged crumb snatchers. 4 legged crumb snatchers welcome on the patio."

                "description": "What can I say that hasn't already been said about this place? If you want a clear-cut verdict from me, this may be it: If they didn't have a playground we would never go.  But they do, so you have to work with what's available.  The food was somewhat subpar, and it has been, consistently, over the years. The fries were the best part of my Buffalo chicken sandwich. The kiddo got chicken strips that were especially dry.   Then why the three stars?  The beer was flowing, the environment happy, with TVs showing the college football games and the kids were happy playing on the aforementioned playground.  So...it's a decent option for young families. And that's worth it on a midday Saturday meal."

We switch spots, 15 minutes goes by and finally a rude server comes up to us to tell us that this section is closed, he closed it 10 minutes ago. So he closed it, while I was sitting there. Didn't say a word to me about it. The best part is I actually asked a server if I could sit there, he said yes and that it was his section.  Totally rude and incompetent staff, we literally didn't even have waters ever brought to the table. We will never come back here."

                "description": "So glad we stumbled upon Doc's while Christmas shopping. We were able to enjoy their awesome happy hour. $4 Texas drafts and $6 appetizers, small boneless wings, or sliders. We decided to share three items. The blackened shrimp nachos were super tasty. I probably enjoyed these the most. The boneless wings with Buffalo sauce had just the right amount of sauce. The pulled pork sliders were a little short on the amount of pork, but still good. We ordered Eastcider drafts for $4 each. Our server was super nice and attentive. Everything came out fairly quickly too. Would definitely recommend their happy hour!"

We sat out in the patio under one of the misting fans, it was so nice! There are also multiple TVs and a large playground out back for the kids to enjoy. This is a great spot for anyone and everyone to hang out, they are even dog friendly!   The staff of course is what made this experience amazing and we plan to come back very often for happy hour."

The environment is warm and inviting, we came on a Sunday around noon and most tables outside were taken so we waited for one to become available. It's a family friendly atmosphere and they allow dogs as well! We got some draft beer and ordered the cheese fries, which were SO good! I had the shrimp tacos, which had great flavor and came with rice and black beans. My boyfriend got the Applewood BBQ bacon burger, which he said was pretty good. Overall we were happy with our visit and would come again!"

                "description": "Tried Doc's for the first time on our weekly date night adventure, and it did not disappoint. It was a little confusing and chaotic upon arrival, as it was not clear if there was a host or hostess to seat us, or if it was open seating. And then once we were seated, there was some slight scrambling on who would be waiting our table. But other than that, it was smooth sailing and we really enjoyed our experience! I enjoy the fact that they offer happy hour even on a Friday, and their HH specials really can't be beat. My boyfriend gave high regards to the traditional wings, and my HH shrimp quesadilla was quite tasty too. Our waitress was pleasant and attentive, and the manager also went above and beyond for us to honor a special request. Much appreciated! We will be back for sure!"

On Mondays, you can bet everyone is here for the margs.. At around 10PM, she told us that they ran out of margs...They seemed very understaffed. As for food, it wasn't great - Nachos were cold.

HEY!!!!\" But honestly I had no clue they were yelling at me... so I kept walking just trying to mind my own business... but when I stepped into the bathroom and started doing my \"business\" some guy opened the door and started screaming to me about my dog (mid-piss) that I can't have my dog in the restaurant... ummm okay I guess I get it, I'll just leave to the patio as fast as I can.  WELLLL.... I left the bathroom... I was literally 3 steps away from the back door as possible.... and the SAME GUY literally screamed at me to go to the front, 30 feet to the front door (just to go to where my table was right next to the door where I was sitting with my gf along with another couple.)  He then tried forcing us to leave and said they were going to call the cops? I let this man know that we already paid out and were about to leave  and she was finishing her drink as this man GRABBED the drink from my girlfriends hand (half full) and pushed us out. Never felt so disrespected. Wont be returning."

We ordered some appetizers including the fish sliders and regular doc's sliders, boneless wings and fried pickles. The fish sliders (blackened kind) were way too salty. The Doc's sliders were bland, and the wings did not have enough sauce on them, not to mention the meat was tough and did not seem fresh. The fried pickles were not good; not really much flavor. The best food item we ordered was the fajita quesadilla. As far as alcohol, the beers were really good and next time will probably skip the food here altogether and just have some drinks. We had the 40 acres cocktail, el Hibisco beer and Redbud beer, all very good.  I did like the atmosphere and the large outdoor area that is close to a playground for kids. It was a fun experience except for the food quality."

My husband and I went for lunch - skipped drinks (I almost tried the special margaritas. They were only $2 and highly recommended by our cute, excellent server, Gracia.) We did lap up the piping hot chili con queso (topped with fresh tomatoes and red peppers), salsa and chips. I chose chicken fajita tacos - excellent! My husband devoured his blackened shrimp tacos dinner. They were beautifully presented and topped with fresh avocado (including black beans and rice).  We love this restaurant. Everyone is quite friendly. It is clean and provides spectacular patio dining under gorgeous trees and colorful umbrellas."

I couldn't taste any mango as it was all masked by the strong tequila. I'm not sure if all margs are like this, but it could have been because the ratio of tequila to everything else was off. My friends and I all agreed that the taste of alcohol was a bit too strong for a drink like a margarita.   I did like the ease of ordering drinks. We were eating at Patrizis and I liked how you could order and pay off your phone and they'd bring it straight to your table within 5min."

                "description": "Came here for the first time about a month ago. It's definitely an \"East Austin\" vibe, like a crazy backyard with statues and lights and mismatched patio tables.   I like that they do have a hostess at the front gate to seat you, so you don't have to do that awkward wandering around the yard looking for a table and feeling like everyone is staring at you. They also check IDs and take your temperature at the front.   Currently, all the ordering is done via your cell phone. Scan the QVC code, and then view the menu and place your order to your table number and they carry out your drinks. Note that when ordering liquor, it requires you to order food with it, so they have a menu of $2 bar snacks. After the first round, we notated that we had already ordered snacks, and were not required to buy more with every drink purchase. But they did check for the snacks when the drinks were brought out.  I've only tried the margarita and a dirty vodka martini, $9 and $10 respectively. DAMN. Those margaritas are GOOD and STRONG. I had 2 and i was....feeling no pain. My martini was also PERFECT. Worth the money, and if you get there during happy hour, the margs are only $5! I did also enjoy the little $2 package of trail mix with MandMs.   One thing I noticed was that the cup size seemed to change, one time i went and they were served in these short plastic cups and another time these taller plastic cups. I was a little concerned that there are inconsistent portions but I can't be sure.  Will definitely be back, those drinks are FIRE and i want to try the food truck. Also plenty of non street parking which i appreciate!"

                "description": "A magical circus of a place.  Never mind they have a real circus wagon out on the side, out of which they serve Italian food.  Never mind the strings of colored lights that make the back yard look like a carnival midway.  Never mind that the Vortex theater is right inside.  So if you are a paying customer, just beyond the velvet door curtain of the Vortex, there really ARE sword swallowers, lesbian ring masters, dancing dryads in water pools, and mega-gods of universal destruction.   Actually what is behind the velvet door curtain changes every few weeks.   When you go it may be nuclear rainbow unicorns, cybernetic tap dancers and the Flaming King of the Empire of the Ashes.  There will always be something interesting behind the Vortex velvet door for sure.  However, it is just as magical out in the bar.  The bar magic goes on all night rather than ending at the one hour and forty minute mark.  Of course, part of the magic is EtOH.  EtOH produces far more intoxicating illusions than anything that goes on in the main hall of the Vortex.  (EtOH is chemical-ese for ethyl alcohol, otherwise known as booze.)  The Butterfly Bar serves first rate EtOH.  Most of the house drinks are girly cocktails of classical or recent provenance. These are fine for what they are.  However, they do one wicked little number called the Whippoorwill which is fine bourbon, cold brew coffee, New Orleans style chicory and foam with secret flavor ingredients.  The Ghost of Sherlock Holmes appears and takes you down all the secret passages of the house.  The magic is generally enhanced by broadcasts of best-of scenes from past Vortex productions, projected on one wall.  There are projections of obscure documentaries on another wall. These have no sound, and I can promise you, you have never heard of any of them.  There is a vending machine on the wall that will sell you thirty dollar forks, knives and spoons that will save the world.  (I am not making that last detail up. Check it out for yourself.)  There are cats who run the establishment and have more authority than the bartenders.  One particular kingly and somnolent feline decided he was going to take his nightly nap at my table on the bench.  He claimed his space where I otherwise would have preferred to sit, and owned half of my table for the rest of the night.  He occasionally roused himself for twenty seconds just to make sure no service dogs had entered the establishment. After that, he returned to his regal slumbers.  The most magical parts of the establishment however, are not the food truck, the colored lights, the video loops, the drinks or the cats,   The most magical parts of the Butterfly bar are the patrons.  This is one of the most fantastical people watching spots in Austin.  It is a world of twenty nine different genders. It is a world of eighty nine different art forms. It is a world of magical costumes to die for. It is a world of back stories that makes your Ghost of Sherlock Holmes seem relatively tame.  The imaginary characters on the Vortex Stage have nothing on the real-life characters that populate the Butterfly Bar  So come to the Butterfly Bar and watch all of the limits of your plain-jane everyday reality dissolve.  Bring your magic hat even if it is just an old Chicago White Sox cap you got as a kid at a ballgame.  After half an hour, you will be able to reach inside that baseball cap and pull out a talking marmoset."

                "description": "Relaxing outdoor Nature scenery, great for happy hour. It's quite a hidden gem. I had a margarita they were delicious, strong and not too sweet or sour. The staff was friendly and they do an awesome job of following CDC guideline to keep their patrons safe with temperature checks and 6ft rule. Did not get to try the food because they were so busy that my food would be taking an hour to get, so don't go starving."

Butterfly bar was super accommodating and easy to work with in getting this order done in less than a weeks notice. We got disposable cups, garnishes, mix, and vodka in very organized boxes. We had to order a snack cause of the covid law in dealing with to go drinks. We messaged the bar directly for this service. Thanks so much!!! These are sure to be a hit for our mindhunter book club social hour!"

                "description": "I arrived there the Wednesday before Thanksgiving.  Before riding there on my bike from 4 miles away,  i mapped out the route on Google Maps beforehand and Google said it was closed. the phone recording on the bar's answering machine said they were open for business. Still wanting to confirm,  i tried ordering some food/drink over the website and again it let me order food/drink.  So i arrive to the bar and there is a piece of paper stuck on door that said \"closed.\" About 4-5 others were standing around also surprised that it was closed. Butterfly Bar management lacked a modicum of courtesy to its potential customers by omitting  to mention on its website/ answering machine/ FB  that it was indeed closed on a non-holiday. Surprise!Customers are going to rely on that answering machine msg and actually take an Uber or ride their bikes several miles to get there. It would make sense to at least turn off the answering machine completely if you are not going to bother to change the outgoing message. I doubt i will venture out to Butterfly Bar again. Luckily, the very professionally-run Salty Sow nearby gave us excellent refreshments and earned the $100+ we spent that night."

                "description": "A fun, hippie, outdoorsy spot to grab a quality drink.  Kind of hidden from the main road, the Butterfly Bar has one sign and a gate that you follow to an outdoor garden full of twinkle lights and laughing people. There's a stage where there's often performances and a little indoor cabin part where you order drinks. It's almost pitch black outside at night, but makes for a fun date and casual atmosphere.   I ordered a mojito and it was delicious and strong. I would 100% recommend going here if you're in the area! So fun and unique."

                "description": "My friend and I came here on a blind double date for the first time on 9/17 at around 7:30 p.m. and thought the vibe was great until our waitress came up and introduced herself, but unfortunately I have forgotten her name( server: inside B) . She asked for a card for the tab and we asked if we could do two separate tabs to which she basically told us that we could be on one tab and figure out the rest on our own. Then as I offered up my card with a bit of hesitation she made a comment about how some of us in the group didn't know what it was like to go out prior to Covid and open a tab. Her facetious comment was directed at me being that I recently turned 21 and was the youngest. Next we received our drinks, I understand that some drinks are made bigger than others, but when my friends were brought their drinks they were all filled to the top, weheres mine was filled 3/4. I let it go and asked if we could get some more water and our waitress said ok and never came back until it was last call and my friend asked again, then she brought the water. Let me mention that we were not belligerent, we were in a space by ourselves and we had each ordered a single drink and had food. When we asked for our check, my friend asked our waitress how her night had been, thinking that if it had been busy then maybe she was just a bit frustrated and we should be understanding of that, instead she said it had been an easy night, then why rudeness directed at me? All people  in my party (with 2 being practically strangers) noticed the difference in attitude towards me compared to them. Overall it was very upsetting as a POC to get this clear difference in treatment from another POC at an establishment that loudly advocates for POC. I still tipped her, because we are in a pandemic it's the right thing to do, but I felt so strongly about this that it made me write my first yelp review."

                "description": "Divey but really good service.  Expect cans and full pours here for $5-7 for beer and cocktails $8.  Great service that is quick and active, not the typical where you're standing there trying to make eye contact for 10 minutes.  Patrizi's out back so you got great food with good drink; not best selection of beer but local Texas.  Got a projector on the wall for special showings, but expect a hangout on most nights and not a get-some-work-done type of venue.  Overall a good spot and easy to find parking out back."

                "description": "I love this place! I have only passed by this when driving on Manor like 1,000,000 times! It is truly a hidden gem and super divey! Getting into the parking lot kind of sucks if you are coming from Manor because it is such a small little entrance, if you have a bigger SUV, it might be tight for you. Otherwise, this place is amazing! There are a lot of different picnic tables outside and some w/umbrellas and some without. Also, some of them have heating lamps for when it is cold. They have a food truck here apparently that is supposed to be amazing, we didn't try it because we had already had dinner but the line to the food truck was literally out the fence. The butterfly bar also has indoor seating but the outside seating is more lively and fun! I had a sangria and it was super tasty! It had OJ and brown sugar in it made w/red wine! I love this place. They have a couple cats walkin around too, don't pet them, they don't like it. Cheers!"

We were STUFFED by the end of the movie, but we couldn't help but try as much as we could.  I love that they have tables with the seats - so much nicer if you're actually having dinner. We started with popcorn (actually some of the BEST movie theater popcorn I've ever had) and chips and queso. The queso was AMAZING!! Similar to Torchy's cult classic queso. Then we got some soda and beer, a pepperoni pizza (excellent) and a burger.  We were so full that we didn't get to try the shakes, but we will next time.  The movie theatre itself was great, staff was helpful, place was clean and wait staff had their masks on so I felt very safe, and the movie itself was awesome. Can't say enough good things about this place!"

In addition, the reach to get to my food is awkward.  And not being a super foodie, I prefer a slightly simpler menu. I just stick with unbuttered popcorn.   I apologize for being a Debbie Downer. But new options are opening up for an evening at the movies and I'm shifting more toward those."

I'm not a fan of the food and service (The servers literally interrupt you during the climax of the movie to say \"last call\"!).   I wish they shook up the menu and did more creative things. As I mentioned, I go frequently, and it's just the same stuff and it's honestly not that great.   I wish they had the the truffle parmesan popcorn or churro popcorn on the menu like the Alamo in SF.  This location is always dead. I'm so used to seeing Alamo bustling and energetic. You walk in...and nothing is happening.  Highball is always closed.   The Shining photo op set-up is getting quite old and wish they did more fun stuff with the space."

A great movie theater taken to the next level with gourmet food and drink that is brought to you while you enjoy your movie. It's everything that you would want!   They have burgers, pizza, salads, chicken fingers, great appetizers including cauliflower wings, mozzarella sticks, great popcorn and much more. My personal recommendation is to try the milkshakes (adult versions too) makes for a perfect combo while you watch your film.   The staff and service is incredible. They are prompt, kind and super friendly.   This is a great venue and makes for a great overall atmosphere for your movie day or night!"

I purchased online in advance (they sell out), picked my seats and showed up early for the previews. We watched the new Wes Anderson movie set in France, so all of the previews were in French and of old French films. Quirky. Our waiter was friendly and attentive, and the popcorn was good. The only things I didn't like were that the volume was really loud in the theater (a plus for some!), and the seats were fairly uncomfortable. Although it seems like a fun place to take a date, it probably isn't. They have a strict no talking policy  and promised to kick out anyone talking during the film."

                "description": "If you have food allergies - beware! The menu looks friendly, but the kitchen and staff are not.   I wrote down my order for a gluten-free pizza - cauliflower crust - and the server took it. Well, she vanished. The second server said he would followup on it. When the pizza arrived, we had our doubts so we asked the runner whether it was gluten-free.   The runner swore that the kitchen confirmed it was gluten-free. Well, here I am throwing up my guts because of my allergy - so, no, it was not gluten-free.   The first server was nowhere to be found. The second server tried to convince me I never mentioned gluten-free - well thank goodness I had my order in writing. I can't believe he tried to put their mistakes on me. Especially when I was the one suffering from the allergic reaction.   The manager said we should have received a square plate for a gluten-free pizza, not round. And basically, that there's nothing he can do about it.   Places that don't try to cater to food allergies - I get it. They're ignorant and need educating.   It's much worse when a place pretends it knows what it's doing but screws it up and has no system to fix it.   Here's a first step -- train the employees on food allergies? And please, if you make a mistake, apologize. Don't call your customer a liar? And don't just make it catering to vegan or gluten-free a \"marketing gimmick\" -- follow through in action."

They truly take silence seriously so it's always enjoyable to watch a movie here.  The parking garage is a bit tight to navigate, so it helps to drive slowly especially around turns. It's free though so that's great. I wish they had more plant-based menu options but it seems they're slowly starting to add some which is greatly appreciated.

                "description": "I recently rented out the theater for a private event, my 30th birthday party.  To say my party was an absolute success is an understatement. I was able to curate my own video dance party and because of the Drafthouse, this event was everything I was hoping it would be.  From the staff being so helpful and accommodating (for ex. every time someone bought me a shot, if I wasn't at my seat, they made their way to find me and deliver it :p), to the help from the event manager David with all the fine details. The Studio 54 themed party I had envisioned came to full fruition that evening and the incredible people at the Alamo Drafthouse really made the night so special.   All my friends and family were just in awe of how well put together the party was and again, I have the Drafthouse to thank for that.  I could go on and on because I'm still on such a high due to the full success of the party.  10/10 would recommend. THE BEST THEATER CHAIN THERE IS. PERIOD."

                "description": "The Alamo Drafthouse Cinema is one unique movie theater. I came here last week for its \"terror Tuesday\" event with some friends and since I'm not from Austin, was quite surprised with the movie theater. Upon entering you are welcomed by a giant carpet and screen from the shining and can even take a picture in the tricycle (which is very, very cool). The theater itself is well decorated and gives you the feeling of a real old school cinema that takes movies very seriously. Upon entering the theater you are handed some water which is quite possibly the most thoughtful thing a movie theater can do instead of forcing you to pay $6 for a pop of bottled water. The theater itself is pretty standard minus the ledge in front of the seat. The seats themselves are by no means nice or comfortable, think old school stadium style seats but for what this theater is going for I actually get it.   If you are lucky enough to live near a movie theater that does all these special movie nights and plays old movies, you absolutely need to come and check it out. I really enjoyed seeing \"Let the right one in\" on the big screen and hope everyone keeps enjoying terror Tuesday's!"

Next time someone came by was much later and it was to drop off the check...by that time pizza was cold and no longer appealing so just left it...Alamo has a clever way of saving money with their \"bottomless\" beverage policy. Row 4 seats 6and7 on August 27th that server needs training possibly."

                "description": "I've been here enough it's tIme I post a review.  :)  It's an Alamo Drafthouse.  Food, drink, movies.  Comfy seats, great digital projectors.  Unique movies and events alongside first-run hits.  Coke, popcorn with REAL BUTTER, and a few hours of entertainment.  What more could you ask for?  Oh, yeah, that south Austin vibe!  I live north and often find myself at Village or Lakeline.  It's like being in a different city, though, as the eclectic and \"Austin flair\" mixes well with the everyday folks coming to the movies.  We just don't get that at much up north and it's good to remember how pleasantly diverse this city is in taste and style from restaurants to neighborhoods to people.  Will I be back?  Tomorrow night - already have my ticket (go go Season Pass!!!)!"

                "description": "When Chief was here bar service was stellar. I have been coming here since it opened. Now bar service is lackadaisical, inattentive, distracted and sub standard.   I like this place. The food is good the beer selection is passable and I can watch any sporting event live or read a book or both. But these two are killing the place for me. Ordered a beer and sat for 20 minutes with no one asking me if I might like to order food. Had to literally flag someone down to order a meal. That is not how this business works.   Wearing a mask under your chin until you walk up to a customer is not how this works either. And the tall one did that all night long. Now looking for a different place to spend an evening eating a meal and enjoying a beer."

Person who had seated me brought me a drink then nothing. Though a minimum of 5 different servers were standing right next to my booth.  I understand a restaurant may be short staffed but limit your seating if you cannot handle it.  I've had the similar experience here multiple times.  Last time I patron any of the restaurants in this local chain.  And \"the remedy\" after speaking to a manager when I asked for the check for my half drank coke...oh no need to pay for the coke.  FAIL ALL AROUND!"

Apparently you get service that way.   Literally just walked in and got sat, was busy due to a UT game no problem. And then we just sit and wait and wait and wait. The supposed waiter for our area literally helped everyone around us and kept skipping us. Idk if it was because we didn't have UT gear on or I was basically the only black person there at the time but ppl that just walked in the door got greeted before we did.   We just got up and left. There's no way the dude in the area didn't know we had not been helped as he purposely kept ignoring the table and was serving EVERYONE around us.   Terrible service."

We fancied burgers and thought that a sports bar would serve delicious burgers! What a mistaken idea!! We started with a cup of onion soup: it was edible, not delicious, a little strong on the acid side, but ok. Then came the burgers: a 3mm leather sole burnt to death!! Awful! Horrible!! My husband had to leave the restaurant and was sick in the car park!! The fries were smothered in fat... yak! The waiter on the other hand was a sweetheart!! VERY professional! When I mentioned it wasn't good, he immediately offered to comp them, which he did! I am tempted to say that he had been through a similar situation before, maybe several times!!! He didn't hesitate and didn't offer an alternative: he KNEW the food was bad! Shame on management to allow this to happen! It's a Burger after all, and we are in Texas!! Land of Beef!!

                "description": "Cover 2 off research always hits the spot it's got the best shoe string fries I can't seem to find anywhere else in Austin . Even though they may just be French fries and not a main course there is something so satisfying about them . My favorite dish is the buffalo chicken sliders , I personally get the blue cheese on the side with ranch to dip . These are amazing and have the perfect thin not to thick cut of chicken that's battered nice and crispy but stays juicy tossed in tangy but not spicy buffalo sauce. The bread doesn't take over the sandwich so that's not all you get full on and is super soft . They also have a buffalo chicken salad that has a good amount of chicken if your not wanting a sandwich but need to cure that buffalo craving . I've only had the burgers other than that and they are equally delicious again especially with those shoe string fries that are always crispy .  This place is relaxed and a good place to have a beer while you cool off after a long day or just dining with the family.  The staff is pleasant and the deserts are huge . Well at least the brownie is . If you like bars and burgers are in the area and don't know what to eat stop in and try the buffalo sandwich it's my go to and recommendation for cover 2 . If not that than at least grab a beer and some shoe string fries and relax a minute ."

They have rotating specials, soups and flatbreads. The servers and staff are all very friendly and hard workers. I also bring friends here and they have all loved it as well! They have great deals on their happy hour and a good variety of beers and wine that are not crazy overpriced. I have loved everything I have ordered and they have great portion sizes! We usually come for lunch or dinner, but we recently had brunch which was also fabulous. I had the chilaquiles and they were amazing! The portions are also super generous so I've left with leftovers multiple times. If you're a sports person, they have a ton of really nice TVs and always have games on. I am honestly so happy this place is close by and will continue giving them my business! I would also like to add that like many places these days, they have also experienced shortages with staff and when that happens, we have seen the managers out on the floor helping out and also working their butte off! This restaurant has amazing food, service and is such a great place to have a nice dinner, go hang with friends or just pop by for a drink! Thanks for rocking it Cover 2! Oh and the Round Rock location is also awesome as I went their with a group of work friends once they also had excellent service and the food was equally as delicious!!!"

                "description": "So today was my first day in Austin. I searched Yelp. I drove by a number of joints. I even walked through Whole Foods. Alas nothing struck my fancy. Heading back, I swung into Cover2. I'm glad I did.  The greeting, Silvana as server, and the whole support staff weekend terrific.  I started with a cup of French onion soup. It was just a tad too sweet for my taste. I'm also a purist in looking for a single crouton under the  hood (of cheese).   The fries and prime rib sandwich were a pleasant surprise. I will typically keg wrestle you to keep the horseradish sauce off the plate. The sauce here actually was mellowed very nicely and didn't fight the meat. The fries were great! Nothing more need be said.   This was a terrific first meal in a new town. This might become my extended kitchen it was that solid of aa performance!"

Staff here was nice and friendly. food was hot and fresh, I had the franks red hot chicken sliders that they had as a special and was good.

                "description": "I wanted to highlight that the hospitality of the General Manager, Jack Beckett, was outstanding on my visit and really made the experience.  The restaurant made a mistake on a dietary restriction, and while the server was defensive and tried to minimize the issue, Jack stepped in and offered an incredibly humble apology and took care of us.  Mistakes happen at even the nicest restaurants, but what stands out to me is how the restaurant handles it, and in this case Jack saved our experience and ensured we would return.  The food is fantastic - the biscuits are to die for, the grits are delicious and somehow they cook their brussels sprouts to melt in your mouth.  Highly recommend Fixe!"

Both of our signature cocktails were a bit sweet for my taste (but I find most mixed drinks to be too sweet, so that's probably a me thing!) and the server immediately helped me with a lovely glass of wine instead.   We will absolutely come back."

I'm from Georgia and these are still the best biscuits I've ever had. They take about 10 minutes to make so order them right when you sit down.   Other than biscuits everything else was good too. The fried chicken was probably the highlight though.   The biscuits alone are worth a visit though. Yum!"

We went for brunch. The best part of brunch was the menu's pricing. Very affordable for downtown Austin which you don't see very often. I got the burger, it was good. But a little dry and lacking in flavor. Fries and French toast were good. If I was to go back I would try their biscuit breakfast sandwich. The party I was with said their biscuits were delicious. We will definitely be back to try dinner next time.  Pros: price, service, cleanliness, and ambiance   Cons: improve on flavor in dishes"

                "description": "Highly recommend! It's my birthday week and the girls and I motored up to Austin for wine tasting and fun! We ALWAYS do Sunday brunch so we had to do it in Austin. This place is great for large parties and it's beautifully decorated.  I had the CIDE-car, their apple cider version of a side car... Very tasty and STRONG! Biscuits were big, fluffy and flaky like they came from biscuit heaven and your great grandmomma was the one making them. The deviled eggs were DELICIOUS and I'd like to think of myself as a deviled egg connoisseur. Cinnamon roll. Better than ANY cinnamon roll you've ever had the pleasure of stuffing in your mouth. ABSOLUTELY DIVINE!!! And the chicken fried ribeye with white gravy and collards..... All I can say is babyyyyyyyyyy this was definitely the definition of Southern cooking and hospitality. Our server Katie was ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!  Here is what the others in my party had to say:  To start I had a Cide Car to drink, deviled eggs, and a mouthwatering buttermilk biscuit. My entree was the Chicken Fried Ribeye, served with a side of braised collard greens! I finished my meal off with a hot and fresh cinnamon roll! Everything was delicious! I cleared my entire plate! The service was amazing! Katie went above and beyond to build a strong connection! I definitely give everything a solid 5!  It was an amazing experience from the front door to the table. The manager came by to make sure everything was good. Katie (Server) she was so on point and made the dining experience pleasant. If you ever get a chance to go please ask for her. She took pics of us and made sure the table was happ. For me this place was a solid 5 and I will be back soon!"

I even asked to surprise me with any drink (with a few notes) and all my drinks were also well balanced and delicious.  Food - impressive.  Get the biscuits! Made fresh, so soft and fluffy. Comes with butter and honey. We also ordered the beets, and brussel sprouts. Both were great but the beets were delicious snd had more creative flavors. My man got the pork chop. He took a bite, closed his eyes, and leaned back. I've never seen him do this. Are you ok? Apparently the pork chop is really good. Melts in your mouth. I got the red fish which was tender, perfectly cooked and not dry. Also I don't like \"fishy\" tasting fish and this one was gentle in flavor. The risotto was flavorful and creamy too.  Parking - they have valet but it's slow. The guy was overwhelmed because he was working Alone in a saturday night downtown. Not his fault at all but def piles up.  Def a special date night spot"

                "description": "This brunch was one of my favorites in the city! A group of us decided to try it for Galentine's Day and let me tell you, it didn't disappoint. We started with a round of drinks. I ordered the Cold Brew Martini. If you like a strong drink, this is perfect for you. My friends also ordered mimosas and spicy Bloody Marys, which they were very happy with.  For entrees we ordered: - Fried catfish with French fries and hush puppies - Pulled pork sandwich - Fried chicken biscuit sandwich with two eggs  - fried chicken sandwich with fries  With a side of: - duck fat roasted potatoes - French fries - Boudin country gravy  - Fresh biscuits  We had no complaints about our food at all. The potatoes and fries were cooked to perfection and the gravy was so creamy and delicious. Collectively, we all agreed these were the best biscuits we'd ever consumed. They bake them in house right after you order them, making them hot, flakey, and melt in your mouth. 10/10 would recommend.  My only complaint would be it was a bit pricey for brunch and almost all the sides were al a carte"

We started off with a cinnamon roll, which the server explained was made from biscuit dough. It was outstanding! We then ordered some biscuits for the table, and those blew us away. Hot, fresh, buttery biscuits served with butter, honey, and jam. Those might be the best biscuits I've ever had. For the entrée I ordered the Pollo Frito Loco Biscuit, chicken topped with slaw and honey. That was friggin great, super crispy chicken on a butter biscuit. Our server was great as well, he was the bartender, who made some mean mimosas for us. 10/10 would recommend."

If you're wanting another southern app, the hush puppies are also just as good. The entrees don't come with sides, but are good portions anyways. I really enjoyed my fried chicken entree with a side of salt and pepper fries. The breading on the chicken was perfectly crispy and not over cooked.  The food for our table came out pretty quickly for a busy Saturday night."

We ordered the brussel sprout appetizer, beat salad, biscuits, fried chicken and a couple of lovely drinks!  I loved everything food and drink wise but I felt the chicken was beautifully done in the middle and burnt (slightly not bad at all) on the breading.  The salad that goes with the chicken, the Brussel sprouts the beet salad drinks and biscuits are rave worthy!  We LOVED them! We also LOVED our server/ bartender and all the attention to detail for a very fantastic upscale and super comfortable restaurant!  We left with full bellies and full hearts!  Thank you!"

We were seated promptly and our waiter was nice and attentive! The atmosphere was great, However, the brunch menu is very limited in variety and is overpriced for the portion and quality in my opinion. The pollo frito loco was dry and the duck fat potatoes were very bland and slightly uncooked too. They are extremely limited on gluten free options for their brunch menu as well."

The food was pretty good but the biscuits were hands down freaking amazing. I highly recommend!  Also got the Brussel sprouts and pork chop. No complaints with either, but not craving a second order of these either. Biscuits were definitely my favorite item out of the experience.   Nice place for date night or dinner with the parents.  Parking PSA: Fixe only offers valet parking but there's plenty of street parking/lot parking nearby. I recommend looking around versus spending even more on valet."

                "description": "So this is my third time at Fixe. Each time has been great. The first time was the night i got engaged and its been a special place for us since. We had some St Louis friends in town and they were game so six of us headed over there. First i have to mention the wait staff. It is glaring when you get great service now that when you do, it is really special. Wyn was alternately flirty and fun (with six big gay bears) but most importantly she was excellent at her job. I'd go back even if the food was bad for such good service.   The food is not bad. It is great. We started with the deviled eggs. They're so good. And the biscuits. Omg that is how a biscuit is supposed to be made. Flakey and perfectly cooked. I had the pork chop and sampled everything. The pork chop was prefectly cooked and smokey in a good way. They had really tasty carolina gold rice grits. Its nice to see restaurants supporting bringing back heirloom grains that actually taste like food. The peach cobbler wasnt as good as my mom's but it was purty good. I wouldnt go for the desserts but they were fine at the end of a great meal. Food is an A and the service is an A+.  Definitely worth your hard earned money if you're looking for upscale southern dining."

                "description": "It seems like Fixe Southern House has had its moment already - the empty tables both inside and outside at 7pm were both a blessing and a bit nerve-wracking. I called ahead of time to ask if they were dog friendly on their patio, and they are! I saw no reviews of being dog friendly on Google, Yelp, or on their website, so that was a nice surprise. They even brought a bowl of water for my pup. FYI, you can find street parking nearby quite easily.  The food was pretty great overall - our table shared multiple dishes. I enjoyed the homemade biscuits with seasonal apple butter and the pimento cheese and focaccia dish. The beet salad was so sweet and savory at the same time - delicious! I enjoyed the lobster and crawfish pot pie but wish I had eaten it faster when it was piping hot. The fried chicken was a bit burnt some places but did have a great crisp. The deviled eggs were deviled eggs and nothing to rave about, and the broccolini was a bit salty. I still really enjoyed my time there.  We didn't try any drinks but we did get dessert! The pecan pie was very sweet and heavy, I only had a bite. I did enjoy the blackberry cobbler and ice cream. How delightful.  Overall, a solid service and food selection make this a great stop for southern food. Perhaps an even better place to stop than some other spots in Austin for southern food due to ease of actually getting a table and nice/upscale (although not super modern) ambiance."

However the brunch menu had mostly glorified breakfast biscuits that were dry and overpriced. The Pollo Frito Loco was an attempt at a fancy honey butter chicken biscuit.

                "description": "Such a great addition to the neighborhood! Perfect place for family night. Who doesn't love pizza. There is great outdoor seating and has a playscape for the kids. The pizza is good as well, there is a combination for someone. There is plenty of seating inside too. The lunch deals are such a good deal. The staff is friendly, we like to do the curbside orders on nights when we are too lazy to cook. It's fast and easy, plus there is so many options you don't feel like you are eating the same thing over and over even if you come here weekly.   The new COVID ordering is nice though you don't have to leave your table and you can split the check among who orders what. It is annoying for those who haven't had it set up on their phones already but otherwise it's super easy after the initial set up."

                "description": "My fiancé and I have been here 3 times now, and we enjoy our visit every time. The pizza is good, the selection of beers and ciders on tap is pretty phenomenal, the soda selection is great as well, and the vibe of the place (Parmer Lane location) is family-friendly and fun!  This time, we ordered The Lazy Goat and the Buffalo Chicken pizzas. The Lazy Goat gets a 5/5 - it was perfectly balanced, and I loved the artichokes and goat cheese with red sauce. The Buffalo Chicken was just okay, I'd give it a 3/5 - it was as expected but left you wanting something more.  In the past, we've tried the Chicken Bacon Ranch (3/5), Ground Control (4/5), and The South Austin (4/5). The focaccia bread sticks are also good!   Overall, it's a nice place to drop in after work or to get Friday night pizzas from. When the weather is nice, it's fun to sit outside - though I can't recommend the high top table chairs, as they are quite uncomfortable. We will definitely be visiting again!"

I especially like the unique and earthy flavor of the cheese.  The bonus was they delivered a growler which I'll check out later...(it's later and yummy Pilsner) Will I order it again!?! Probably not. But it was a solid meal nonetheless."

                "description": "I met up with a group and was definitely impressed with the spot. I loved the outdoor seating area and the playground. My little one was occupied the entire time and barely took time to eat because she didn't want to stop playing! The pizza was delicious. We shared a simple pepperoni pizza and cheese focaccia bread. I liked that the crust held up well. It wasn't too think or thin - just right! My kid finally up ate 3 pieces when she sat down from playing. If you are a parent and looking to have a cold beer and relax then this is definitely the spot for you. They have tons of beers on tap! Beer, playground and pizza - how can you not be a fan of that?!"

I ordered the major tom, pepperoni was very crispy but the veggies were a little undercooked would've preffered them a bit more cooked.  The meat almighty was better, pepperoni was crispy and the cooked ham was very tasty (i dont usually like ham that much!) The dough was doughy, and floppy."

                "description": "This is the worst experience I have had in awhile with management. To begin, with follow my pics.. I ordered a major tom (supreme pizza) with EXTRA sauce thru door dash. At 7:55 within a few min I received notification it was being picked up.  I call store to inquire how is that possible if it was freshly made. The store hung up on me. So, I worked w door dash who asked me to wait for delivery to see if there is a quality issue. I did just that, only to receive a pizza that was warm but based on the cheese amount, semi chilled veggies I knew I wasn't too off base when I had my reservations about it to begin with.  I call store - ask for manager, even though I know door dash will ultimately handle. However, I just wanted to know how you can make a pizza in 5 min and say its fresh. Manager says sorry for the hang up like she's singing to a tune of a tiny violin; then tells me they don't have base pizzas sitting around (kind of like Villa in the mall that adds toppings when u order). I ask why is there so much cheese then and no sauce. Clearly cheese is added and is already rubbered up. Short answer and ultimate answer from her was another unbelivable sorry and to work with door dash.   What's sad here..Villa Pizza (mall pizza) is better than this any day. And I'm kicking myself for not going with Salvation pizza instead. Aviator down south was awesome but this Parmer Lane site is lacking customer skills and good pizza."

                "description": "2nd favorite pizza in Austin!  I love pizza. If I were choosing my last meal it would be a toss up between pizza and beer or filet mignon and merlot (or Shiraz). I digress...pizza...it must have a great crust-never EVER soggy, a well-balanced sauce, and just the right amount of cheese. Lastly, the maker must not skimp on the chosen toppings.  Well done, Aviator! My friend and I shared the \"pizza of the day\", and it was fabulous (though I don't remember the name of it). The crust had that initial crunch followed by the perfect chewiness. We each had a light beer with hints of blueberry-um...yummy!  Aviator is new to this location, and still getting established, so it was dead inside. I suspect this will be a popular lunch place for nearby companies such as Apple, Oracle, etc. There is a huge outside play area for those of you who have kiddos-great for birthday parties.  I prefer quieter places, so it misses the mark for me regarding atmosphere. You can see the pizza makers through a glass window, and the kitchen appeared clean. There are ample choices of beer and lots of great food options too. I've been twice and suspect it will be a fav of mine. Give it a try. Let me know what you think."

                "description": "First time I ordered from here was through Door Dash and we enjoyed very bite of our order. Second visit we decided to dine in. It was crazy packed on a Friday evening but they had plenty of seating indoors and outdoors!  We ordered the Foccacio cheese sticks (basil, mozzarella and goat cheese) - a hit for us when we ordered to go previously. We also tried something different which was the Monty. We also ordered a Caesar salad- pricey for a salad in my opinion but this is a good option if you feel like you need that balanced meal!  The Monty was the least of my favorite. We have stuck to ordering the Flying Garlic Pizza after our first visit and it never disappoints. It has become a must order for us and will continue to stay that way!"

                "description": "As another reviewer said, they should change the order to list Drafthouse in front of Pizza.  This place has an AMAZING tap selection, even better than Pinthouse.  They also have a great outdoor area and sometimes they have live music.  The pizza looks amazing and the ingredients are fresh but the dough has no taste.  Pinthouse on the other hand has an amazing crust and severely limited outdoor seating.    I really hope the crust changes because the outdoor area and taps would keep me coming back.  However I can't see going here over Pinthouse.    If they nailed the dough I would absolutely chose this place"

                "description": "Today, I ordered a to-go order for pick-up so I could do yet ANOTHER lunch and learn... how much learning do I really need to do?????? I ordered two items: the caprese salad and the black olive and caprese pesto grinder.   Caprese-  Caprese salad is a simple Italian salad, made of sliced fresh  mozzarella, tomatoes, and sweet basil, seasoned with salt, olive oil, or  balsamic vinaigrette. This is a menu item that really can't be 'messed up'. It is simple and to the point. This caprese was accompanied by a side of vinaigrette.  Black Olive and caprese pesto grinder-  This item was unexpectedly good. This meatless Monday treat contained black olives, mozzarella, red onions, baby spinach, and a Roma tomato pesto base. This sandwich provided a balanced mixture of sweet (from the tomatoes and red onions) slightly sour (from the mozzarella) and earthy (from the pesto) bites. Although hearty in its contents, this sandwich was actually very light on the palate.   #supportlocal"

The 1st time I wrote off because I thought it was a fluke. Also, I know the staff is busy on a Saturday night and it's tough to find staffing these days during COVID. Maybe I'll try eating in store next time.   But cmon now, my wife is pissed off because I convinced her to get Aviator over another pizza shop.

So many options but I'm not sure if this will be high in my rotation of pizza places.   I do like the restaurant space. The outdoor area is nice and kid friendly with the playground. Aviator has a wide selection of beers (at least from what I could tell). I think the pizza is good but unfortunately I think there are better places for pizza. Weirdly, I think their normal pies (with red sauce) are kind of lackluster. I did enjoy their non-traditional pies. The chicken bacon ranch and the taco pizza were pretty great!"

                "description": "On this deliciously lazy Sunday, the darling husband and I knew that pizza was just the only thing that would do. Jersey Giant Pizza, he suggested? Quick, easy, cheap, and reliably tasty. Closed on Sundays, I lamented. DeSano's, I countered? His eyes lit up, but then I remembered that, although we adore DeSano Pizzeria Napoletana to bloody distraction, we should probably try something brand-new for a little variety...and for me to review! Why not? Enter Aviator Pizza and Drafthouse!  Local? Check! Solid reviews? Check. Hubby's a helicopter pilot and trying out this place is, therefore, too hard to resist? Check. Cute pizza names? Check. Yummy pictures? Check. Let's do this!   (Note: all three are takeout 9-inch pies with no mods, except for hubby's deletion of the green peppers on his Ground Control.)  The Greek: this one was my flavor profile to an ABSOLUTE T! It reminded me a bit of Joe's Pizza at Star Pizza in Houston, but better! A riotous feta, pesto, artichoke, basil, mushroom, and kalamata olive party on a crust! Hugely flavorful! This goes on the culinary Rolodex post-haste!    The Flying Garlic: very garlicky! Shocker, right? Lol! Well, we are garlic people, so we endorse this pie whole-heartedly! The buttery crust, the garlic cloves, and the feta were just unctuous!   Ground Control (minus green peppers): Hubby liked this, but he didn't super-love it. He kept snagging pieces of the Greek and the Flying Garlic. I asked him what his least favorite part was, and he said that it really wasn't fair to judge it on such a small pie. He wants to give it one more shot with a larger pizza! His theory is that small pizzas make the fillings hard to shine. Makes sense!   As I write this, though, he's literally humming Ground Control to Major Tom as he kicks back on the couch playing Call of Duty: Cold War with a warm and happy belly, so I consider this a solid win. We'll definitely be back soon to dine in! Thanks, Aviator!"

                "description": "I've passed by Aviator several times and finally decided to try it with a friend.  We came at 8pm and the place was fairly busy. Unfortunately, the ordering process itself was very confusing. You can either follow a bunch of arrows to the counter and order (with few menus available), or you can seat yourself and order through a QR code and have someone bring your food to you.  We chose to go to the counter and ordered two Bear King beers that had great flavor- we were allowed to sample before ordering which was a plus. There were 50+ beers/wines to choose from so endless options... you can opt for a flight too. We also ordered two small pizzas (BBQ Chicken and Spinach and Artichoke) that came out in ~10 minutes. The pizzas had a thicker crust and were DELICIOUS! I'd definitely order again.   There were plenty of picnic style tables inside and out, and the outdoor patio had beautiful string lights, a playground, umbrellas, and lots of open space. Parking is easy in and easy out, and the staff were friendly.  Overall, I'd recommend Aviator. Great quality pizza in North Austin."

Really good atmosphere, great drinks, and friendly bartender. Em. was an absolute joy. She made such wonderful suggestions and was just the best. As a woman drinking alone, I felt like I was in a safe space. I would go back all the time and recommend it to anyone, especially if you are wanting something low key and chill. Will go back. Make sure you tip the bartenders! They works so hard and do an amazing job!"

We got the Moscow Mules and a growler of lager, both of which were excellent.   The big surprise was their special offering due to COVID, their GRILLED CHEESE sandwich!! And what terrific sandwich it was - super crispy, firm, delicious sourdough, and melty, tasty cheese and---no greasy fingers! Pickles were satisfyingly crunchy too!   Thank you Tigress Pub for a delightfully delicious experience tonight. Looking forward to our next visit!"

                "description": "3.5 stars for the cons, given that other, less refined establishments in town lack these issues entirely.  Pros: Cozy ambiance, intimate atmosphere inside, quaint almost romantic patio in the back that still feels as such even with multiple parties outside. Fit that in with some personable bartenders, and you've got the makings for a really nice date night! The Bartender who hosted us personally was wonderful company for conversation with the rest of my party, and she took the BEST care of us during our visit that she could.  Cons: An arguably limited selection of liquor for a place that seems to focus its pride on craft cocktails. It's understandable that the pandemic had severely limited business as of late to give any benefit of doubt, but combine that with a lack of providing customers with a preference of liquor for classic standard cocktails exacerbates this. The coups de Grace in dissatisfaction came when I was informed that the bar had absolutely no cherries to compliment a cocktail that is typically garnished with one. Other regulars who overheard me went out of their way to mention that it's a decision from the ownership down. If it's a matter of affordability for something as trivial yet pertinent as a jar of Luxardo cherries, then bigger core issues exist elsewhere; if it's a matter of personal opinion as to what constitutes tradition in a drink, that's even worse when any reasonable bartender or connoisseur should know that the \"best way\" to serve a drink is however the person consuming it wants it dressed."

                "description": "The Tigress is the  OG of classic cocktail culture in Austin. They opened their doors well before the craft cocktail madness took over the local blogosphere. There are no codewords, no hidden doors, and no over the top marketing gimmicks used to try to make them stand out from the pack. They don't need to. They just offer highly skilled staff serving up classic cocktails the way they were meant to be.   I'm a cocktail enthusiast and admitted \"drink snob\" with very high expectations of any place that claims to be a \"cocktail bar\". The Tigress is like a \"small batch heaven\" located off the beaten path. The rotating menu is carefully curated and the liquor selection, though small, is a blend of unique, local, and masterfully crafted offerings. You won't find mass produced, highly generic, overly commercialized well spirits here. Though the seasonal menus are small, the bartenders are highly skilled and can handle almost any classic cocktail request. In fact, they've even introduced me to a few that I'd not heard of previously, but are now part of my \"at home\" offerings (The Trinidad Sour is a favorite I didn't know I had previously). From the perfectly selected glassware to the outstanding skill of the folks behind the bar, this place is a must visit for every cocktail conisouer looking for that one special place where you stop in for a drink and leave having had a memorable experience.    Despite having all the right things to lend itself to being a high-end elegant cocktail bar, The Tigress has a casual, local, friendly feel. If you don't fancy yourself a cocktail person, have no fear.The drinks are very reasonably priced and the bartenders are highly skilled at asking about your flavor profile preferences and making the perfect recommendations for both the experienced drinker as well as the cocktail novices of the world. Don't be afraid to ask their advice. I take friends and visitors from out of town here regularly and they've never steered us wrong.   Cheers!"

They have outdoor seating which can probably seat around 10 ppl - very small tables surrounded by a few chairs.   For drinks we ordered the boys of summer, paper tiger, leash-less and native tongue.  The drinks were very okay, hit or a miss . I liked the boys of summer, wasn't the best drink I've ever had but certainly better than the others.   Our hostess was a little moody for some reason. She asked   Overall- can surely try it out for a drink if you are in the neighborhood."

A biker smashed into my side view mirror as I walked outside and he was screaming obscenities along with \"who parks here?\" To which I realized that I was parked (along with many other cars) in an extra wide and poorly marked bike lane."

                "description": "Where the fuck is the 3.5.  This is a strange haunt, bigger than it used to be by opening into the antechamber.  The staff remains like clockwork.  If this were a Western saloon, there'd be a piano player, mopping his damn brow and waiting for higher spirits before smashing out a tune.  (you can even smoke outdoors, and if it's cold enough, no one will come out for a solid hour, guaranteed)  If you are not the type to make friends with every moron at the bar, this is a good place to seek some quiet and forgetfulness on off-hours, which are pretty much all hours not the weekend.  TCM is always on, subbed; Ida Lupino, Fred Macmurray, the Bogart, etc, become regulars to you, and inevitably some doofus pipes out, sure as God, \"You know, I think Empire Strikes Back is one of the top ten films on the planet.\"  Sit long enough, still, like a walking stick; in comes a Bumble date once or twice a week: a leather daddy with a face pitted by acne that got the best of him years ago is making up big time by going to absolute town on some mixed girls, reciting the old lines, sure as Old Faithful, pat and safe and just this shy of rote PUA material; a young guy is meeting a blonde with a bob, discussing schadenfreude, saudade, acentrism, kicking canes out from mobility-disadvantaged Nazis, and everyone works at IBM or Dell.  There is always a gang of strangers who know each other over drinks, stinking of the day; every time you come in, they're here, swigging down Claire's Knees and Plump Perfections.  Some of them probably even had a cookout or two before life got in the way.    Every year they do Tiki Week.  Someone's written them up recently.  One of the top cocktail holes in this wreck of a town.   There is something disgusting in being known. Thank the Lord if you are the type who is able to weave little shrouds and stitches of obscurance around your neck wattle and your denimed shanks.  This is a place to hide, to commiserate with your immoralities."

I was told that cocktails were their specialty so I just wanted to keep it simple and asked for a rum and diet coke.  The bartender immediately replied \"we don't carry anything with aspertame in it!!\"  Yet I could see regular coke in their cooler, so I think high fructose corn syrup is that much better?  There was no need to make that comment, simply state you don't have DIET. A little attitude, so so drinks.  No wonder at prime time there were only 4 or 5 people in the place."

Dim lighting and wood booths line the place. Funny to say, but they have he most comfortable bar stools I've ever sat on!   The bartender was very friendly, talkative and great at recommending drinks.   First, I had The Green Drink! She said you can only get it 1-2 times a year! Unique and tasty! Never had a drink with cilantro in it. Good balance of fresh herbs, pineapple and citrus.   Second drink, she made a custom cocktail for me. I was in the mood for gin but my favorite drinks are mojitos and vodka presses. She didn't bat an eyelash and whipped up something exactly to what I asked for.   Prices are average for a craft cocktail ($9-10). The green drink was $12 but not crazy for the specialty and freshness."

                "description": "I came to this place with no expectations, just meeting a few friends for some live music and a couple drinks. I showed up before my friends and chose to sit at the bar rail and order an old fashioned. The bartender who I believe to have been the manager was wearing a Clemson University quarter zip. Idk if this guy was just having a bad day or what but boy did he make it obvious.   This guy was rude from the jump. Extremely short mannered, made the worst old fashioned just dumping simple syrup all over the outside of the glass and just tasted bad and left me with sticky hands. I asked what wines were available and was told they had mini bottles (2 glasses each) for $40+ no thank you.   In my opinion a bartender or waitstaff should make you feel welcome, make you feel appreciated for your service especially with Bars having been shutdown for almost 2 years with a hundred other options in a 4 block radius. I felt like I was doing him a disservice by showing up with a few friends and ordering drinks. The bar had maybe 10 people in it at the time so staffing was not the issue.   My advice, get out of the industry. Go find a job sitting behind a computer. Wouldn't recommend if it was the only bar open in town."

                "description": "This bar is located on the popular Rainey Street. My visit here was to check out Bar Ilegal, a small mezcal based bar that is located in a small shed-like building in the back.  Both bars were popular as there were a good amount of people hanging out in the area. I ordered a Mexucan Mule and it was great. I liked the bite that it had in the drink. The bartender was super friendly and also suggested a couple of other bars that I should check out."

                "description": "Clive bar is nice, but it's really a front for Bar Illegal, which is a private bar for bikers and vampires.   About midnight,  the queen of the damned will come out and dance with a python and if you are lucky she will allow you to drink mezcal off her.  Backroom access requires one must know the secret knock before the peephole opens and challenge  password ensues.  Dont even try without the invitation, but fortune favors the bold.  Should you go crossing the silvery brook, it's best to leap before you look."

Their bar itself is not one of the biggest bars there is but the overall atmosphere seems to be a mix of chill and lively without being too much at times. Located just a stone's throw away is the elusive Bar Ilegal, which used to be a really subtle and unnoticed mezcal bar before Rainey became what it is today. Overall Clive Bar is a great place to warmup for a night out on Rainey, esp with Container Bar just across the street."

                "description": "Oh Rainey Street what can I say about you.......  To be honest, I was wandering down Rainey Street on a Saturday night, with certain bars with lines wrapping the block. Clive Bar though, seemed chill with no line and a decent amount of people where I could still have my own personal space.   Quickly got in and into the bar, bartenders were easily accessible which is a big bonus. 2 specialty cocktails for $20, I'm not complaining. Both drinks were made with love and a little heavy hand but you'll never hear me complain about it.   Another bonus, I was able to snag a table for our group and we were set for the evening. They had an awesome DJ playing 90s + 00s hip hop and RandB. Super dope bar with a cool outside space (Cornhole available) with a mezcal speakeasy as well.   For all the lines and drunk people, I'd come back here for a chill, lowkey night."

                "description": "I have some mixed emotions about this place. I went at 2pm on a Sunday afternoon and had a great time drinking and watching the game on the patio with my friend. Well if I'm honest, she was watching the game, I was people watching!  The location is great. It's on a corner and has a good view of the street below. The rustic vibes and good music made for a nice time. The bartenders were all very kind and worked quickly. The drinks were made very very well. I had their signature Mule and my friend had a Strawberry Fizz. They were $10 each and I felt worth every penny. Now by 4:00 a younger rowdy crowd came in and the relaxed vibe changed. They stood in front of the tv and those of us watching the game quickly decided to leave. I am not taking away any stars for this because  I had a really good time and the bar itself cannot be held responsible for the how people act. Just go early"

                "description": "Clive Bar holds a special place in my heart and is probably my favorite bar on Rainey Street.  When my husband and I started dating in 2011 it was where we would go often.  It was a different Rainey Street all together back then.  There were only like 3 bars in the area at the time.   Clive Bar used to have the frozen peach teas that were amazing!  I still think back to those and wish they still had them.  I usually ask every summer if they will bring them back - I really really wish they would.  All the bartenders here are amazing and super nice!  I love their drink menu and they have a nice selection of beer on tap as well.  They have some infused liquors too that change out every now and then.  Honestly if you don't know what you want just ask the bartenders what they recommend and tell them the flavors you like and they might be able to whip something up for you.    I also love the openness and atmosphere at Clive.  No matter the season it is always good.  They also have a Mezcal bar that is open on the weekends in the back.  If you have never experienced this I would highly recommend trying a flight to taste.    So if you are on Rainey Street - don't skip Clive Bar - it is a must stop for sure!"

                "description": "Came here a couple of times recently and definitely enjoyed myself.  First, the bar has both an inside and outside area - the outside area is reasonably large, so that's where we spent most of our time. One point I want to make is that the bartenders were really nice throughout our visits there. They were friendly, remembered my name, and just did a great job in general.  One fun thing about this bar is that they have cornhole outside. Of course, it's only one set of boards, and you'll have plenty of other people wanting to play, so you can pretty much play a few games max. But a few games of cornhole is better than no games at all! One small negative about the place is that they had some pretty subpar BBQ restaurant serving food there (on a Thursday). Granted, it's not like the bar itself is serving the food, but I would have preferred they allowed a better restaurant to take up real estate.  Overall, I definitely recommend people come here and have a drink. And if you don't like it, you can go to one of the other many bars on Rainey St. :)"

                "description": "My review will focus on Bar Illegal. My friends and I were on the hunt to find speakeasies in Austin, and Bar Illegal is one of the easier ones to get to. It is visible from outside Clive Bar, but to get to Bar Illegal, you must walk through Clive Bar's outside area and into the small building that is roughly the size of a shed. The small structure seemed to be made of stones, and it had many cultural items representing Mexico that were spread around: religious paintings, prayer candles, skulls, and other decorations. There were only four other people not including the bartender and my group of three. I would approximate the 'comfortable limit' would be 10 people. The bartender was well educated on the topic mezcal! He got a sense of what we individually liked to drink, and he selected a different type of mezcal for each of us. I drank my mezcal as a shot since it's a little too strong for me, but the bartender suggested drinking it slowly. The prices of the mezcal were all under $10 for shot glass sized servings. The bartender was also awesome enough to suggest other speakeasies and tell us 'passwords' for one."

                "description": "I'm a huge fan of mezcal, so when I heard a bar had a speakeasy-ish room in the back that specialized in it, clearly I had to pop in and check it out. I do feel like it would make more sense for it to be its own yelp page, as while it is owned jointly and running under the same liquor license, the purpose (tasting high quality mezcal) and menu (just a long list of mezcals) are totally different from the main bar. I didn't visit the main bar, just Bar Ilegal.   Anyway, unsurprisingly, it's tiny (could fit maybe a dozen people before it'd start to get uncomfortable), but when we were there, around 9 PM on a Saturday, it only had about 6 people in it - I suppose a bar for just tasting mezcal is pretty niche (they do have 4 mezcal cocktails as well, but they honestly didn't look like anything particularly spectacular). The bartender clearly knew his mezcal very well, and prices are actually surprisingly reasonable for a spirit-focused bar. I asked to try the smokiest reasonably-priced mezcal he had, and got one - Del Maguey's San Luis del Rio - that I absolutely loved, a half-pour for $6.50 (I also love that they do half-pours, for if your primary motivation is \"sample new mezcals\" rather than \"get crunk\"). Based on previous experience with places like this, I assumed it was a truly ludicrous markup and that I had just found my new favorite affordable mezcal, but nope! It's a 70 dollar mezcal. So, happy that I got to try a 70 dollar mezcal (it was delicious), but also a little sad because now I'm still looking for my \"can always keep a bottle at home\" affordable type mezcal. Oh well.   But anyway, yeah, if you like mezcal, you have to check out Bar Ilegal. Really wish my favorite mezcal bar locally would do mezcal samplings like this one does."

                "description": "During our first night in Austin last week, we ate at Emmer and Rye and then walked up Rainey looking to get the full experience so we tried out a handful of places. Clive really stood out to me as having the full package.   The inside space is cozy and lodge-y. Coming from MKE, we felt right at home. The outside deck and patio space is huge. Plenty of room for everyone to spread out and still keep a game of Bag Toss going.   Later in the week, we were with a bunch of our KW coworkers and one of our party members thought it would be a good idea to try out Container Bar. Wrong. It was a like an undergrad frat house in there. SO loud, SO sweaty, SO many college kids. No offense if that's your thing. Clive Bar SAVED THE DAY.   Get the Matthew Pecan-aughey."

Jarrod, the bartender, and Sam, the waitress made us feel at home and I made what was it looking like a pretty bleak Christmas Eve into a wonderful party night.

We finally decided on a random Tuesday to pop in after work and we're kicking ourselves for waiting so long! This place was so great! They have QR code menus on each table for both food, and beer, and they were so user-friendly, and easy to navigate. The tables are spaced out, and there's seating on the front deck, under the cover on the patio, and some inside as well. The staff was seriously THE friendliest we have encountered in Austin, especially during COVID times. They checked on us regularly, and basically made it so we never had to go in and order anything, because they were SO on it! They are amazingly, over the top, dog friendly!!! It's one of the few spots we can sit under cover with our dog, they have tons of water bowls, free snacks, and they even brought him out a very special snack from the kitchen! They gave him lots of love, and were happy to have him there.  We ordered cheeseburger baskets with fries and they were so delicious! The portions were huge, but the burgers weren't so fat you couldn't handle them semi-gracefully. They were loaded with melting cheese, and the smoked bacon was amazing. There was an abundance of toppings, and a huge pile of perfectly crisped fries. The beer selection and HH is just awesome, we have zero complaints at all! We'll definitely become more regular patrons here, and I highly recommend going out of your way, giving them a chance, and checking out this perfect neighborhood bar!"

My fiancé is that obnoxious person who walks into a room and immediately tells everyone we're from out of town. Maybe that attributed to the friendliness but I won't complain.  We were trying to see as much of Austin as we could in one day, but if we had more time we would have stayed for a few more beers. Great patio too.  I can imagine this place being a complete cluster during football season. My alma mater plays Texas in 2025 and we may need to be here to find out :)"

While it's not the same as hanging out on the patio, it's still a great experience."

                "description": "Looking for a slice of \"old Austin\"? A large selection of craft beers? Affordable and tasty food menu? Great atmosphere?  Look no further than the Crown and Anchor pub.   If you're looking for an expansive beer menu, they have it. Just about any craft beer you can think of is available.   If you're looking for great atmosphere, they own it. The owner Derven has been operating the place for 25 year and is a true Austinite. He has played gigs with many of the areas legendary musicians back the 80s. You can find him at the register most days haggling regulars and slinging beers.   Food? The food menu has the essentials and is affordable and tasty. It has enough options to satisfy just about anybody including a vegetarian or vegan and the food is always great and reasonably priced.   What else? Pool tables. Check. Darts. Check. Plenty of sitting area? Plenty of parking? Check and check.   Overall Crown and Anchor is a mellow and great dive to try a new beer, eat good burger or to clank glasses and cheers with beers at.   The old show Cheers comes to mind. It's a must stop for the neighborhood."

                "description": "The second member of the grad school holy trinity (the other 2 being spiderhouse and taco joint).  Its basically the perfect neighborhood bar. Basic wooden tables, a nice porch, 3 dart boards and 2 pool tables. You dont have to pay for darts, but you need collateral. They always have a great selection of beer, also they always have a nice deal on some type of beer they're trying to get rid of. Your dollar will go far at this place, especially during happy hour.  In terms of atmosphere, its no frills. Its great for big groups and small groups and hanging out. The porch is enclosed with screens but it is a little hot in the summer. Its great in the fall and spring though.  In terms of food, nothing is really stand out. But, it isnt bad either. Their burger is like the perfect backyard barbecue dad burger. Their fries are pretty good too but there jot artisanal. The cheese fries have a healthy amount of cheese. The nachos are fine too. The prices are a little high compared to the drinks. But, they're not unreasonable.  A lot of researchers at the university have happy hours here, so it gets busy on fridays especially during the semester. People from the neighborhood come too so theres always a crowd. That being said, youll usually be able to get a dart board or a pool table if you want it."

It's a locals spot right next to the UT campus, so of course it attracts a small college crowd, but it also attracts this amazing group of locals who are super friendly and welcoming.   The people that work here are so nice and they are the reason I went back.  They also have a great beer selection and the bartenders are very knowledgeable about all of the beers.

There are some really awesome staff here (only one pill to occasionally deal with) but overall pretty good odds. Good atmosphere, really affordable, extremely crave-able food in my opinion. Only thing missing is dessert! The first time I came here I ended up going at least once a week since, until sadly I had to quarantine out of state. When I get back though, it's ONNN! I'll be there twice a week probably! I miss it ALL THE TIME!"

I encouraged the customer next to me to go ahead and order because I didn't know what I wanted and the bartender was SO rude and rolled his eyes and said we were instagramming. I left immediately and I'll never return. I don't need some angry hipster rolling his eyes at me when I'm about to tip him. There's a lovely bar just a half a block away (walking distance) called Posse East with better service and more seating space. Don't waste your time on the pretentious staff here who judges their patrons. Horrible."

The price varies depending on the type of beer and whether it is happy hour or not.  I got a pint of 512 pecan porter for $4 during happy hour.  They also have pitchers available.    This place is not upscale, but it is a chill place to grab a beer and hang out, watch the game (NBA playoffs and baseball were on while I was there) and there is indoor and outdoor seating and two pool tables.  I was there on Sunday night and pool was FREE!  I suck at pool and don't particularly like pool, but I was up for a few games to help kill the time, so that was an added bonus, especially if you like pool.  There were probably 20 or more beers on tap, lots of bottle and can options, so I'm sure you will find 2 or 5 things that you like.  Parking was free on Sunday.  Pro tip, go on SUNDAY!  I didn't get any food, but it looked like everyone was ordering nachos."

I ended up getting the Salmon w/artichoke and spaghetti in garlic cream because my waiter said the Squid ink pasta wasn't the greatest and I wish I had just gotten that anyway because the salmon dish was pretty bland. I wish they had opted for another side as well because artichoke really is only good with spinach in a dip. I also felt like we were there for ages and our waiter didn't come by as often as I would've liked but my biggest issue with the restaurant was that the manager was buzzing around the entire night and both my friend and I noticed he seemed to check on every table but ours which after sitting there for so long definitely started to rub me the wrong way. We did get lucky and were able to get a table on a Friday night with no wait and without a reservation but I wouldn't come back here or recommend coming to anyone else because I'm sure there are better, if not just plain better lit, restaurants."

I am going to give it four stars because I really liked the ambience, the cocktails (Cosmopolitan, aperol spritz, Hendrix Martini and a Tito's dirty martini). The calamari was good but not as crispy as I prefer. My friend and I each had the ink squid with muscles, clams and shrimp. My other friend had fettuccine with shrimp and my husband had the risotto with zucchini. The four of us split the flourless chocolate torte (magnificent). In general I like the restaurant but probably would not return. Their yelp review said two dollar signs and let me just say that is not the case. I don't think the ink squid had enough flavor but in their defense I asked it not to be too spicy. There are several other Italian restaurants that I would go back to but not this one. By the way my husband would probably give it three stars."

I have to say - before I arrived I already had high expectations since they informed us there would be a fee if we canceled our reservations 2 hours prior to arrival and that we had to call if we were going to be 5 minutes late. Now I get why. So many people are involved in ensuring you have a great experience and a last minute cancellation could take away from someone else having that same great experience.  When we arrived they promptly took us to our table which was prepared as we requested. Won't lie, we had a lot of very specific requests since some of the attendees had major gluten allergies or had particular food preferences. Altogether this restaurant delivered! The food tasted great, our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and seamlessly answered all our question.   We will definitely be back again!"

The bolognese and arrabiata are good and the cocktails are strong, but the menu seems overpriced. The burrata is served ice cold and not as creamy as I've had it in other mid-priced restaurants in Austin. I highly doubt they make the rigatoni in house, but who knows! The service is good and the patio has fans in the summer and heaters in the winter."

My husband and I  were in the mood for some really good pasta and drinks, so we decided to come here and try it out. Let's just say it was the best decision ever.  Place wasn't hard to find at all and parking was extremely close and not crowded at all. The place opened at five, we got there a few minutes early and we were allowed to still go in. We waited to be seated and took in how beautiful the place looked. We were greeted wonderfully by everyone in the restaurant and were directed to our seat. Our waiter introduced himself to us, asked us how our day was going, let us know what the special of the day was and kindly gave us time throughout the ordering process to order our beverages, appetizers, entrees, and dessert. Our waiter was amazing, very patient and gave us enough time to decide on what we wanted and checked on us frequently to make sure that we were enjoying our food and refill our wine glasses with our glass bottled, still water that we ordered. Every item that we ordered was beyond delicious, portion size was perfect, the tiramisu (spectacular) and my alcoholic beverage was divine, especially the house made maraschino cherry. The pasta and the calamari was so fresh and flavorful. The sauce for everything was amazing. The husband and I love this place so much already and we are definitely coming back. Thank you for making our experience here an amazing one."

                "description": "I always love going to It's Italian Cucina. There isn't a bad thing on the menu. Serving Northern Italian cuisine is their specialty and they have choices to suit every palate all the way from drinks to dessert. The service is excellent. Everyone is so gracious and welcoming, especially the owner, Al. Walking around with his ever-present glass of vino (sommelier!), ready to say hello, offer a recommendation from their unmatched wine selection, or crack a joke. I take a new guest with me almost every time I go because I feel it's my duty to introduce people to the amazing food that delights from its tucked away spot on South Lamar. Try it once and you'll become a regular too."

                "description": "Cucina had been on our date night list, so we were excited to try it. I'm writing this review a little later (we visited August 7th). For what we paid (Our bill was around $200+), the food was less than worth it. Our wine choice  - Lopez de Haro Crianza Tempranillo 2017 Rioja, which was a $44 bottle on their wine list. We use the Vivino app for reviewing wine, and making purchase decisions. This bottle sits at a 3.6 rating and sells for an average of $11.99 (eye roll). We love tempranillos but this was not good.  For appetizers we tried the Foccacia Bread, and the Arancini: Risotto balls. The risotto balls - SUPER dry and the breading was overcooked and practically charred. The saving grace for those was the marinara sauce to dip them in so we could add some flavor and soften them up. I can not believe these were $16. Moving on to the main dishes. We chose Gnocchi Diavolo - Fried potato pasta w/spicy Diavolo sauce ($27) and the Rigatoni Fornaio W/ pancetta, basil, tomatoes, mozzarella ($29). The Rigatoni - was one of the WORST pasta dishes i've ever had. I've made better in my kitchen at home. I don't know how one manages to make a pasta dish taste dry - but Cucina succeeded. It was like chalky paste in my mouth. And the mozzarella looked like packaged great value shredded cheese you get from the cheap section of HEB cheeses. It was also cold, and not melted in the slightest. I couldn't even finish it. The Gnocchi - which you can't normally go wrong with - it pains me to say we had to ADD SALT to the dish to make it taste like anything. I'll say it again... we had to ADD SALT TO OUR PASTA. The spicy Diavolo sauce, there was no flavor or spice. For an expensive Italian restaurant I expected way better. Zero excuse for customers having to add salt to their pasta dish. Desert and drinks - we chose the Affgato'bout it: Frangelico, Chocolate gelato and Espresso for $14. This was fine, you can't mess up ice cream - Probably came from a tub of $5 ice cream from HEB though. Finally we tried the Luxardo Limoncello, Campania - $10 and the Dow's 10 year Old Tawny n/v Port for $12. Fine just fine. Honestly yes, if we weren't happy about our food we should have said something to the waitress. However the wait staff was super kind and super great so we felt bad complaining. But this experience overall has weighed on us more and more as we've shared this terrible Italian food experience with our friends. Upset that we wasted our date night on this place, $200+ was insane. I'd choose Patrizy's food truck over this spot 100 times over."

                "description": "All I can say about this place is WOW.   We came here for a work dinner while in Austin for our annual conference. Our group was served food family style, starting with charcuterie boards, followed by salads, and amazing, hearty entrees.  The charcuterie and salads were delicious, but obviously the real stars of the show were the entrees.   My absolutely favorite was the tomato cream sauce gnocchi. Holy CRAP this stuff was good. I kept going in for more, and more, and more... I noticed we had plenty to go around so I didn't feel bad about going in for like four helpings (literally). It was thaaat good.  The chicken parmesan was really good as well. Chicken was nice and moist and the dish overall had amazing flavor.   Another shining star on this establishment is the owner. He is the SWEETEST man I've ever met! We walked in and we were immediately treated like we were family. I'm talking hugs right at the door! He was just so sweet and clearly so passionate about people loving the food. Business owners like him are one of the reasons why I love working for Yelp - I really do get to meet the best people!   Highly, highly recommend if you're a lover of tasty Italian food and of course, wine. You will not be disappointed."

                "description": "I'll be honest. I passed this place many times thinking \"That is the dumbest name\" and never went there because of it. But one night I found myself wanting a nice dinner and it was nearby and open. I ate at the bar and the bartender was delightful. The owner also hung out with all of us at the bar and chatted us up. The food, every morsel, was fantastic. I had the focaccia to start off with a mezcal Negroni. So freaking tasty. I forgot to take a picture of my main course because I was so excited but it was a tomato and gnocchi that was to die for. I had to get the tiramsu at that point and was full and not disappointed. Definitely doing a date night here soon."

We made reservations on a slow night and when we got there there was one other table but despite that, the host acted totally dismayed that we had a stroller with us and informed us (very rudely) he'd have to switch our seat. I couldn't understand why that was an issue considering there was an abundance of seating, all of which could comfortable fit our small stroller. Just really bad customer service and the food wasn't worth the price either."

Every time I find myself in this establishment, I am off-put by the care shown to me by the staff, and how excruciatingly good the service always is. Also another thing that irks me is just how good the pretzel is. Why can't other tap rooms produce a pretzel of the quality of the Food Truck Bavarian Pretzel.  Also the price of beer during happy hours, Friday's, and Sundays is OUTRAGEOUS. $3 on select beers?? What is this? My friends fridge?? On top of this the incredible selection makes me red in the face with frustration, that like that special someone, keeps me coming back for more.   All and all this establishment is painfully well run and makes me smile."

We didn't have the menus out anymore so I asked the waiter how much it cost. \"About $20\" she said. When the bill comes, the pitcher was actually $50! The whole table ordered some, and we were all pissed.   I called the manager afterwards to express my frustration with how the waiter mislead us. He proceeded to criticize, mock and delegitimize my concern. He said I should have \"read the menu\", but the waiter should also know the prices. \"About $20\" is wayyyy off from $50.   Growlers literally does not care about their customers, and will gladly yell at you for THEIR mistakes."

They capture a broad spectrum of tastes and styles of beer. The food is bar style, wings, fries, tots, sandwiches, etc.  nothing I ate was noteworthy. There is room for improvement on greeting and service times.  There was one person working the bar and another waitress floating but no one approached us so we got up and asked.  Then another gentleman came from the back to wait on us.  There were not enough people in this place for the service not to be swift and great. Especially when I bring a party of 8 that are all eating and drinking. Anyway it's a good stop for a quick bite and a beer if you're in the area.  Just not a place on my list to revisit."

                "description": "Growler USA is definitely one of my favorite places to go to for drinks and food. There's a fantastic selection of beer; with something like 100 taps, you're bound to find something you like, whether you want a sour, IPA, or stout. Most of them are Texas beers and the selection is always changing. If you're not feeling beer, there are plenty of other drinks too: sodas, kombucha, wine, cider, mead, etc. A huge plus for me about Growler USA is they have pours starting from 4oz -- perfect for flights and lightweights! -- to the typical 12/16oz, and of course they fill growlers.  There is also decent food that goes a bit beyond typical pub food and is of course more varied than a food truck at a brewery. I'm particularly fond of the tater tots and mac and cheese, but it looks like they've added some new items to the menu in the last couple of months.   Another great aspect of Growler USA is the incredible staff. There is one woman in particular - her name eludes me - but she is extremely knowledgeable about beer of all kinds and can give you some great suggestions based on what you're feeling (or even if you're trying to do a beer and food pairing)!  I believe there is also some kind of special every day of the week. I know Sundays are $1 off sours, happy hour all day (discount on all appetizers), and I believe the tapover beers are discounted as well. Plus they do special events like Beer 101 classes. For all these reasons, I think Growler USA is a great value overall and there really is something for every taste. I know I'm always learning and trying something new every time I come here, and it keeps me coming back!"

The extensive menu and regular Tap Takeovers encourage would-be cicerones to expand their palate.  Don't bother with an entree. Food is mostly overpriced and underwhelming, so maybe get a large appetizer to share with your party. The wings and tots are alright and I hear good things about the pretzels.  The staff is all pretty nice. The price point and atmosphere attract a slightly older crowd for a location so close to a university, so don't worry about this place being flooded with undergrads like myself most of the time."

I just walked with my wife and daughter for lunch.  We waited a few minutes to be seated, or told to seat ourselves - but were totally ignored.  Finally a guy at the bar told the bartender that we had been waiting a while and she said, loud enough for us to hear, \"I don't care, I'm busy.\"  The place was not remotely packed.    Terrible, and very rude, service by the bartender working today.  Candidly one of the worst experiences I've had, and we didn't even make it to a table.

I've had the tater tots and pretzel, and both are simple but delicious. Parking is easy, and the staff is helpful and friendly."

This is an amazing hidden gem on campus... I can't believe I haven't went to this place before! They have some awesome deals and $3 growler fills on certain days (which is unbelievable deal).  I will be back thirsty to drink! Check this place out for sure! If you come during happy hour they have some awesome deals for food as well (your typical bar fare)."

                "description": "This place is awesome. It's definitely got that local bar feel. The people walk in and are greeted by their first names. My favorite thing about this place is the selection of beers and that you can get 4oz choices for roughly $2. That way if you don't care for something you didn't spend $6-$8 on a glass. There are TVs and good music playing. The staff were incredibly nice and helpful. The food selection is good and tastes good as well. We will definitely be back. This is a feel good place to relax and have a drink and bite to eat away from the typical touristy spots in Austin."

In the end we bought 2 additional growlers on her suggestion about some rare / different local beer from Live Oak Brewing. Also bought the 512 IPA for my Bro. Honey Sriracha wings and tots were a nice snack while we tasted the different beers. Great place and atmosphere!"

There's a mix between high tops and low tables, plus a large U-shaped bar in the back. They also have a front and back patio with additional TVs.  This location is strictly drinks so we usually bring food in with us we pick up on the way. The vibe is fun on Sunday's and if you want to mix it up, they have ping pong and beer pong out on the patios free to play."

The layout and vibe of the bar is amazing with great indoor/outdoor flow for those days when the weather is not our friend. Their back patio is tucked away and offers some peach and quiet while still being able to enjoy the game. We have hosted a few UCLA Alumni events here and the manager, Casey, is always very helpful! They share a kitchen with the pizza joint next door. Though I can't recommend the pizza the wings are phenomenal."

                "description": "This place is horrible! They over charge you and then supplement the charges buy saying you order \"FREE NACHOS SALSA\" if you so happen to not want the free salsa and chips they and leave on the table unopened!!! Yup you guessed it they!! Wipe the table downs and recycle the chips and salsa! I wrote a review on this \"RACIST\" place on yelp for another HORRIBLE experience! But my buddy wanted to go yo local place and he duped me Into coming here on a fight night!   I wrote this review already and I think they got it removed because it was so damaging to what they call \"business motto\"!  I WILL MAKE THIS SIMPLE!  I went to this place to watch a fight with a buddy!  I am not a big drinker!! I ordered one drink!! JUST ONE! My buddy had two drinks I believe and he also happened to also not order free bag of chips and salsa! But they made they way from behind the bar to our table! SPLENDID!!!!! Fight is over and i want to pay my bill will honor and dignity!! NOPE NOT TODAY!!   The waitress brings the bills, my bill is over charged! So i asked her why am i being charged for chips and salsa! \"Hold on lemme get the manager!\"   This Sorry excuse of a manager walks to our table and requested the issue! As I explained to him that you are over charging customers, he states \"i do it to everyone and no one has a issue but you!\"   Ok, Manager today you will not over charge me and you will correctly charge me so i can be on my way!!   He violently yells at me and tells me to get out but then remembers he has to get rid of the evidence so he voids my transaction!  Charges My friend because he paid before me and DIDNT notice the over charge!   THIS PLACE IS RACIST!! THE way that Manager treated me as if we meet him before! I am a minority!! Why would he treat me as if i am hanging around this place! I was a patron and he treat me less then human after I discovered they COVID Gorging secret!! If allowed i will add pictures of receipt! Second bad experience i was in where i found myself being yelled at by a WOODROW employee while trying to pay!! I HAD TO WRITE ANOTHER REVIEW because they may have removed my other one!! I just want an explanation on why are you doing this to customers and why are you so aggressive with black customers! He was emotionally violent and it scared me so i walked away!  I just want clarity and a non aggressive place to have a beer or watch a fight in SOUTH AUSTIN while being BLACK!! Nothing much!"

The staff is attentive, the beer selection is dope, and having a traditional low key sports bar on the south side has been great. The food trucks that are adjacent never seem to be open when I come but the walk up Brooklyn Pie Co. is a game changer. All in all if you are a south sided looking for sports and cools beer with friendly service Little Woodrow's south is a safe bet. Just don't expect Bella and whistles. That's not what they do."

We might as well be sitting outside. Looks like a ski lodge with everyone bundled up. Not to mention covid and cedar are both high right now. Furthermore if I was running this establishment I think people would be more inclined to drink more if they weren't freezing their asses off. Anyways it's a great place just seems like a no brainer to close the door on a below freezing day so your customers are more comfortable."

My son and I decided to wind down at Little Woodrow's. Temp was in the 30s that night, but they have a really big and nice fire pit outside.    We arrived around midnight:30 on a Monday and the crowd was light and fairly quiet.We sat in a booth not far from the door (but also not far from the bar).  Only one bartender that night so the wait seemed a little long, but there was really no reason for them to staff two bartenders on a Monday evening.    Drinks were good, conversation was easy (no need to yell at each other because the crowd wasn't loud), and the place was nice and clean (restrooms too).  This was my first visit to Little Woodrow's, but I'd go back :-)"

I'll tell you which ONE, Woodrows Southpark Meadows because they are adding  club  soda  to  their whiskey so therefore they use the illusion of giving you a decent serving. It's just a serving of club and a 1/2 shot of whiskey. News flash that's not part of the recipe... It is essentially orange pill to wipe around the rim, whiskey Pour  over an ice ball/block, bitters and then it's not meant to be shaken it's meant to be stirred   Yuck!"

                "description": "Since I am the Yelp duchess of the UFC gym in Southpark meadows, I had to check out the UFC gym sponsored event at Little Woodrow's. As a side note, Cowboy Harley Davidson also co-sponsered the event. There was give aways and a chance to ride on a bike (it was stationary). I had a chance since I know the manager at UFC, to put my skills to the test and throw on some gloves and do some of my kick ass kickboxing moves. However, having been maybe drunk/heavily buzzed at the time this happened, I was more concerned of not falling on my ass and less concerned on my actual technique.   I honestly a little excited for this event because I really couldn't wait to see some of the UFC fights on the fight card. Plus I got a chance to check out Little Woodrow's since it is close to my house.   Overall Little Woodrow's is a dive bar. They don't serve food and it is strictly about the booze. You can order from the pizza place next door but if you read my review of that place I would recommend getting food else where.   Anyway, the bar also had a dusty dirty chiller machine with jager and whiskey fireball bottles chilled and ready for shots. I will say they need to clean that fan that keeps it cool before it catches on fire. haha This bar was great for watching the fights since they have multiple TVs and a huge big screen that comes down."

I've warmed up to it quite a bit. From what I can tell, it operates really well and you're gonna get consistency.  Things of note: - Large patio space with plenty of seating and TVs - I don't really care for sportsball, but they play all the big games, matches, etc. and a lot of people turn out to watch, and the community is just *fun* - Open mic standup on Mondays (it's not terrible usually!) - Attentive bartenders; have twice seen them taking care of too-inebriated patrons. - Good food truck, also have popcorn (from a local place) - Very regulated with last call and when you have to finish your drink by. They will be open at the posted hours. - Patrons can get a little crazy but they're almost always friendly.  A solid bar, by far the best in Southpark Meadows."

I will never come back and I urge you to spend your money elsewhere. The staff is as unprofessional and rude as they come. They ruined my night along with everyone I was with.

Tuesday night is \"big beer night\", which means that 22 oz drafts are the same price as 16 oz drafts.  Cool.  I drank  3 22oz lone star drafts.  Pints of lone star are 3.00, so, i was a little surprised when my tab was over $13.  I asked about it, and was told that lone star was different.  This had me start doing Math.  Apparently, on normal nights, 16Ox is $3, while 22oz is 5.50.  Your paying almost $.07 more per ounce on a 22oz glass than on a pint.  Even with the minimal discount of \"big beer night\", you are STILL paying more per ounce on a 22oz beer than on a 16oz beer.  Way to screw your customers  LW.  You now have one less customer."

You are going to make the crowd bigger and then you will take my seat at the bar and this will just get awkward.  Just kidding...maybe.  I love that they offer several cider options and that they check on you often.  I never feel like I was forgotten about.    No cover for UFC and the regulars that come here are just as friendly.  I actually met a couple of people here and we now hang out together.  Thank you Little Woodrow's for helping me grow my social circle!  They usually have something fun going on as well.  Totally my go to spot on a Saturday night when there is a good fight on to watch."

The venue was packed but the spacious outdoor seating still made everything feel comfortable.  Our server was kind and put up with my wife's and mine poor ordering habits. My wife got the croque monsieur, and I got the pressed Cuban burger. Both were very good. We also got the chips with Gruyère cheese sauce. Also delicious.  Their drinks were okay, nothing to write home about. I'd stick to beers here.  Overall we had a good experience and would come back either just for dinner for us, or with friends."

Their happy hour is pretty great. Still, I never stay longer than an hour, because as I mentioned, it is _toxic_ bro city up in this bar, unfortunately.  As for their food, their poutine is delicious. As is their Wisconsin Wurst, and honestly most of their sandwiches are up to par. The bar staff are always kind and helpful.  I only wish the environs were a bit less nauseating."

                "description": "On the whole I was sadly a bit disappointed in the quality of food and experience at Haymaker.  On the experience, their mobile web UI is very dated and not fully functional: we ordered online for in-restaurant pickup, and never received a confirmation via phone or email that our order had been placed. After waiting some time, I went inside to check on our order status, and they indicated it had not been received. Slightly inconvenienced, I placed the same order again in person. A few minutes later, the server let me know that the web order had, in fact, come through, and that they were producing one order and a separate, duplicate order. I asked them to cancel the original order placed through their mobile website, but their system does not allow for reversal of web orders. I had the in-person order reversed, having encountered friction while attempting to simply place an order at several steps along the way.  On the food, their grilled chicken sandwich was substandard quality at best. The meat was rubbery, and the secondary ingredients (lettuce, tomato, pickles, bun) were of pretty transparently low quality. I'm open to giving it another shot, but the first-time experience was, all things considered, an unfortunate one."

                "description": "Been here a couple of times pre covid and once fairly recently. Their outdoor space is a great spot to hang out and watch a game with plenty of tvs and well spaced out tables. They have reopened for indoor dining but when I went in to use the bathroom the space between fairly crowded tables was definitely too close for comfort.   In terms of food they have a pretty nice variety of out there sandwich/burger options along with typical bar fare. While I appreciate the variety I've found most of the food I've tried to be okay at best. Most recently I've tried the wings and Italian hoagie. The wings were super bready and the sauces weren't very flavorful. The roast beef and sausage on the hoagie were also both fairly bland.   They have some pretty solid drink specials (when I last went on a Tuesday all Texas beers were 3$) and compared to similar spots they have a really wide selection of options.   Overall, I think the vibe here is great and the drink deals are hard to beat. But between the less than stellar food and questionable crowd control I can't say I'd recommend coming by in the near future."

The problem is they don't know how to communicate or remove people from the reserved area without being assholes about it. The sad thing is that our business with 70+ employees is located just down the street at The Station and now we will be going to Love Supreme or Oddwood or Batch or The Vortex for any happy hours."

I stopped in during the week with no preconceived notions or ideas of what to expect. So what did I learn? Its a cool little craft beer bar with some great food items.  The night we came in they had a distributor there handing out all kinds of marketing swag, stickers and such. It wasn't pushy at all it was just laid back and I loved it.  The beer list now that is a headache - there's so many choices! OMG :)  It's around the corner for me and I have already stopped in about 3 times. Each visit has been the same for me - just perfect.  So far it isn't log jammed with crowds of people which I enjoy being able to sit without the typical ATX line w/a 20 min or more wait. Let's hope they are busy enough to stay around but not too much that I can't sit right away! ;)  Thanks for the great local vibe you put on guys. I love it!"

I realllllly wanted to try the soft pretzel because reviews were good and it looked amazing! The first few bites while it was hot were so good, but as it cooled off and I became satiated, it was just alright. I wouldn't be surprised if the cheese sauce that came with it was the same as the sauce on their macaroni and cheese. I think it tasted familiar. I gave the tomato soup another try, and it was just alright too. It's got a funny tangy metallic aftertaste. House pickles were fresh and interesting but I could only eat so much before they became overpowering. This time they included beets, green beans, and okra. I checked on their spiciness and was told they had a kick, but it wasn't too bad for me. I hate to say that the best thing I had was a free piece of Halloween candy from the bar. I really want to like this place. The owner was there most evenings and is friendly. However the food never meets expectations and is a little pricier than I'd consider appropriate."

The bar was sparsley populated for a Saturday night, though they did have a live band playing.  I got a Founders Solid Gold beer for $5.50 and ordered the pork belly hoagie for $12. The food came out pretty quick, but it felt like the kitchen staff wanted to get ouf of there and kind of rushed it together. It was just OK, not the kind of food I'd expect from a 4.5* establishment.  Nothing really wrong with the place, but I don't see how the ratings are so high. Perhaps there's people living in the building and they're just pleased to have a better than average bar in their building? I don't live here, so I don't know if I'll ever make it back in.  Bottom line: good bar, but so many bars in Austin, it didn't grab me as anything amazing."

                "description": "So happy that the Hi Hat is back open. They're doing a great job disinfecting everything and keeping everything tidy. The food is delicious and so are the drinks. For vegetarians, they have the best avocado toast I've ever had and that's coming from someone in LA where we are as basic as it gets. I've also had their shrimp benedict that is not currently on their menu which is so yummy. Lastly, I usually don't like micheladas but they make the best!! The mix is homemade and it taste like perfection with the new Zilker rice beer. Thank you!"

They were not your normal fried wings, they seemed like a flavorful baked wings hybrid.  Different but not bad, because I was hungry and they had the kitchen open late.  There is outdoor seating as well."

                "description": "We were walking around on what was quite possibly the rainiest weekend this year so far and went to another place which had a 30-45 minute wait time. We walked around thinking we'll have to go back to our friend's apartment and drive somewhere when we ended up at this place purely by happenstance.   The good, the bad, and the ugly:  The good: The presentation of the food is so pleasing to the senses. Just as pleasing as it is to look at it, it is equally pleasing to your taste buds. I substituted my chips for the beets and oh boy, what a great a choice that was! The guy taking the order (Oh, btw, you have to order at the bar) told me that some people don't like them because they taste too earthy. I have never understood how people cannot enjoy eating beets. The highlight of the entree was supposed to be the portobello mushroom burger served on a bed of creams with some guacamole and aioli but the side of beets totally took the center stage. The vinaigerette they were sitting in when mixed with the cheese totally elevated the dish and give it so much dimension once you really mix it in together. You really want to take pictures and tell your food that this one is for the gram. I'll let the photos speak for themselves  The bad: Portions are a little bit on the smaller side but that could possibly be because we have huge portions in Houston. Or that I have a food addiction. No one else seemed to have that problem so you can just ignore the last statement. But, the service was a little lacking even though the restaurant was pretty empty.   The ugly: This does not necessarily apply to me but my friend is a vegan and they don't carry soy milk. Their reasoning, we put it out but no one used it and we were throwing it away. Solution could be, just give it to people who ask for it?!  I think, overall, we had a really good time over here. The food was great. On Sundays, they have live music where we were told that the music doesn't get so loud that you are not able to hold a normal conversation."

                "description": "Rolled in here for the first time on Saturday afternoon and had my eye on their reuben. I was NOT disappointed! They brine their corned beef for 11days and it is juicy, crumbly perfection! The kraut they use is actually on par as well, w/the perfect balance of sweet and sour.  I am not gonna lie, the reuben here might just hold a candle to my all-time ATX fav at Waller. They are different stylistically, but both hold their own.  While I was here Saturday, I did their little sampler pour of one of my fav high abv beers, Wake up Dead on nitro by Left Hand. It was just what I wanted. At 10.2%, doing a full pour is a bit much, but their little $3 sampler was perfection.   I also discovered their \"Wine Wednesdays\" during my Saturday visit and after the gracious bartender Phil (who I have affectionately nicknamed \"GreenBay\") let me sample their 1000 Stories Bourbon Barrel Aged Zin. I was smitten from first whiff and in full lust after the first sip. I knew I had to return to make a half price $44 btl mine!  As luck would have it, my schedule allowed me to come in on the following Wed. I am not going to lie, I was so looking forward to doing damage to a bottle of a 1000 Stories all by my lonesome. However, because my \"luck\" has always been spelled w/a capital \"F\", they had just sold their last btl of 1KStories when I walked in. I was heartbroken. But, the wonderfully empathetic staff here not only let me sample the Substance Cab (it was a lovely cab, but I had my heart set on the BB-aged Zin!) before offering me a glass from the last open btl at HH pricing. GreenBay even let me kill what little remained at the end of the night. Great service will always make or break any experience, in my opinion.  It was busier than usual due to it being ATX Beer Week, but even the patrons at this place were gracious. There was not a seat to be had in the house and this kind man at the bar let me have the very tightly squeezed-in seat next to him.  BTW, the reuben here is so nice I had to have it twice! It was just as perfectly delicious the 2nd time as it was the first.  I will definitely be back the next chance I get for another attempt at Wine Wednesday and anytime I need an old school reuben fix. So glad I discovered this place, its vibe, and wonderful staff!"

The food was just okay and the service was eh. They do have a large selection of beers though. The place is very small inside a d the bathroom are somewhat outside....sucks in a cold night. It's definitely an interesting little find. Not one of my favorites though."

Parking is street and WiFi available. Free music co Stanton with a stage literally in the corner ready to go on short notice. Specials daily and happy hour until 7pm on Tuesday through Thursday. Food looked good but I was here for the beer. Fresh draft line makes me happy so no complaints here. One TV and friendly service. Floor and tables clean and although loud it's not in your head intrusive. Really can't ask for much more from a neighborhood bar."

I visited not too long ago and had their eggs benedict for Sunday brunch which was nothing short of amazing. He ordered the Hi-Hat plate which he also enjoyed. We ate and marveled at the talented jazz band that was finishing up their set. This place is cozy, has an enormous selection of beer, and a knockout menu for you to explore (with daily specials). I would come here again and again.  10/10 would recommend this place to others."

                "description": "First off, we wasn't planning to come here but looked what was in the area and this place popped up. When you go in, the area is a bit small. You can grab a menu off the wall and then order from the bar. They have a few chairs for bar seating and about 6 tables inside varying from a two seater to a six seater, and there are about 3-4 tables outside and then a bar top around the patio. If it is pretty warm, I would definitely recommend sitting inside. They said that this was the busiest they'd been so food took longer to come out than usual 30 min-1 hour. It was definitely worth the wait! I ordered the eggs Benedict with a cilantro sauce on top and it had chorizo as well! It was greatly prepared and was the perfect amount of food. The biscuits and gravy are also pretty darn good! You can pick how you want your eggs with it, and it also comes with bacon. We only did self serve water, but our total was $26...in the halfway mark price range. WORTH IT THOUGH! The staff are polite and try to do everything to accommodate you and keep up with other customers/work. The only reason I knocked off a star is due to the seating inside, making it hard to fit everyone!"

Can't say that I've ever had chorizo in my Egga Benedict so that was interesting. I'm not sure if I love it but it's def decent. I'll have to say the mac n cheese stole the show hands down. I added it to my order after the bartender and another customer both recommended it. I don't normally eat mac n cheese but I'd def order theirs again!"

I crave their roasted beet salad and pop in frequently just for it.   They have a spot-on beer selection and their Mac and cheese is to die for.   Beware of their spicy Brussel sprouts - they're spicy!  If you go for brunch, they have mimosa pitchers for a reasonable price. And order the Hi Hat Plate. It is absolutely the best brunch dish I've had. Crunchy, zesty, filling and indulgent!"

The owner greeted us and came over to chat...really nice guy with a lot of well deserved pride in his establishment. We ordered 4 appetizers as a meal. THEY WERE HUGE!!!

The food truck seems to be the only option for food which is tough because your options are very limited.

They accused me and my friends of being too drunk to go through, i felt violated and disrespected. I am not one to write reviews but this was necessary. They need to know how they disrespected my wife who is military and my friends."

Last three times Ive been here for football on Sunday and each time whole sections of the bar have been staring around looking for a non-existent waitress for thirty minutes at a time. This most recent visit I got a beer when I first sat down and literally didn't see a waitress for an entire half of football after that. When I finally did get another beer ordered they forgot it four times. That is not an exaggeration. FOUR times. The fourth time I was slightly annoyed as you'd imagine and she acted like I spit in her face and gave ME all sorts of attitude...like I'm some prick for asking for the beer Ive paid for and that you keep forgetting?? I just go to Rustic Tap next door now."

They have a great little food truck attached called \"One Taco\" which has really good food, and Little Woodrows definitely has a great selection of draft beers  (in two separate bars that you can grab it from) along with a great environment. The staff is super friendly and remembers you if you come in often which makes it a fun place to go.  I don't  come here a ton outside of Sundays for gameday, so I can't give too much advice on whether or not it is the place to go on other evenings"

                "description": "I like that they had a bar in the middle of the city where you could sit outside and enjoy everything that's going on. They did also have space heaters but not too many. There is also a covered outdoor area but no heaters under those. They have tons of tvs so a perfect place to watch a game. The indoor part of the bar is tiny. Definitely don't go there if you want to be inside. From what I saw there was no lawn games like other Little Woodrow's like cornhole. I think I did see a ring game but that was all. They have multiple bars however during the day only the inside one was open. I loved the vibe though, really chill and perfect to be in the feel of Austin. The best part was the food truck there One Taco. This is the only food there in comparison to the ones in San Antonio with full menus. Would definitely come back!"

We love the vibe here and you can always quickly score a strong pour even when they are busy.  During SXSW we figured it would be wall-to-wall and we were pleasantly surprised to find the bar area pretty empty (the patio area was jammed). We scored a nice side booth that was great for people watching.  They do have some decent beers available and if you have the munchies there is a food truck on site. Good pours and a good vibe..."

The place was full enough, but wasn't exceptionally packed like many other spots on this street, making for a more relaxed vibe. Their creamy orange frozen drinks were a dream, and we had several, served up by a friendly and unpretentious bartender. We look forward to coming back on our next trip."

Every time I have been here it has not been overly crowded which is a good thing. We came here on a late Saturday afternoon and we were all able to get seats at the bar so we could laugh and talk to each other. I'm one of those picky people I can't drink well drinks and majorly batched sugar stuff so I asked if he could make me a skinny margarita. The The cute bartender said we usually do not have time to make skinny margaritas, but since I'm not so slammed I will gladly make one for you. He made a really good one. I am a big fan of his. My brother and his pals really liked the whip drink, a specialty frozen drink that is orange and super delicious looking."

I still can't get over the fact that the drinks were so cheap here. Definite plus in my book. Having a pizza place next door made it even better. Service here is awesome.

Will the bartender put on the football game your friends request?  The answer to those was no, but What can you do. You're not gonna please everyone, and seeing how this was 30 people, a third of which I didn't even know, I could care less about them. My friends were happy. That bartender could have put on the Giants game though.   Nice bar, with a great selection of drafts. The outdoor patio in the back was perfect for the evening, catching the sun as it was going down. You can even order pizza from the food truck out front. I know it's off to pizza in Austin, being from New York, but I was craving something small and satisfying. Plus it was night one of many. I needed to keep room for the rest of the vacation."

                "description": "Lambert's was the reason for our return trip to Austin.  They have amazing boars ribs on the menu - so good we've talked about them since we got back from our 2015 trip.  And they were as good as we remembered.  They are on the small side, so don't try to share an order. The BBQ is delicious.  They have an extensive whiskey menu with some nice options at varying price points. There was a small outside patio area that during warmer weather appears it would be good for hanging out and dining.   Staff is friendly, knowledgeable and everything was delicious.   Be sure to get reservations because they are always busy."

                "description": "Underwhelming mostly due to the awkward service. Waited at the podium alone for about 8 minutes before we were greeted (bad sign). We had reservations for lunch and were seated quickly once help arrived.  Started with queso which was disappointing after reading reviews. It's standard cheese sauce with some tiny bits of meat and bbq sauce on top. It is probably made in house but maybe not, can't tell.  I had the chicken chop -- good, filling, Outbacl-ish, too much blue cheese for any human, as expected.   Partner had the three meat (brisket/sausage/rib) which was yummy. Note that you get a single piece if each meat so don't get too excited if it feels like a deal. Filling and tasty but not a great value.  Overall I would not go back as there are too many other good BBQ options around to go to what is clearly your typical expense-account-hold-the-personality establishment."

                "description": "Enjoyed dinner at Lamberts on a Friday evening. We made a reservation which was essential because the place is full! The restaurant is an upscale bbq restaurant  with fun takes on classics as well as an upstairs dining area with live music on certain nights. The food was delicious, perhaps overpriced(adding one sausage link was upwards $8-10). We enjoyed the waffle fries, Mac n cheese, salads, brisket, and more. We also enjoyed espressos martinis and a bottle of Pinot noir.   The only real critique was that even before our food was finished or all our dishes were served every 5 seconds someone came to ask to take our plates at one point they didn't ask and just took it. I would get it if we had been lingering for hours. This was maybe 30 Minutes in before our main course was even served. We were so annoyed we just paid and left a bit hungry. I've never experienced such a thing. Maybe they overbooked?  It's an Austin staple but there's better barbecue to be had without the hassle."

                "description": "Not a completely typical TX Barbecue joint with collard greens, wild Boar ribs and other unique twists on the tradition. I got brisket which was tender, smoke forward and really good! Great service, a bit upscale and a great experience. The sides are tiny. Kind of a joke or tease because they were good. Left me wanting more. Nowhere to park so rideshare or walk."

                "description": "Great food on a Saturday night in November. The live music from upstairs was good, but plenty loud enough downstairs. Ate in a corner of a bar. Better live music and bar experience than restaurant experience. For the food and the money, there are other barbecue places in town. Good brisket. Very solid, filling, and excellent mac and cheese that felt almost concentrated or reduced. Some of the sides were quite spicy"

                "description": "Arrival late evening and first meal in Austin in search of bbq!   Fancy bbq and dining here and they are booked - even to the last hour prior to closing! Whew!  Luckily, there were bar seats available for 2. I can see why! The bbq shops around this one (just a couple) were out of favorable meats so this is the only spot that has all the selections on the menu and stays quite late open.   Their bbq meats, such as brisket and baby back ribs, were savory to delve into, moist and delightful! Service was superbly attentive! I adore their collard greens. Other bbq shops only serves up coleslaw and maybe string beans. Yum!   Housemade bbq sauces, went along with the meats!   For what it is as bbq dining meshed with fine setting, it is appealing here, surely!"

                "description": "I am from the midwest, I also recently went to Nashville, so I have tried good BBQ...but THIS spot was next level.  Everything here was FANTASTIC.  From the service to the food this was a 10/10 experience.    A friend who used to live in Austin recommended this spot and I couldn't be more grateful.  I came here for lunch on a Sunday before my flight out of Austin.  Upon arrival we were greeted by the host and, after we were seated, given warm mini corn bread muffins - WOW, I mean I would come here JUST for these...so delicious, and such a hospitable touch.  My friend and I wanted to share an array of item, so we ordered the two meats BBQ plate with 2 sides.  We chose the potato salad, cider braised JBQ collards, and we added a side of the mac and cheese (we just had to try it).  For the meats we got the Texas brisket and the fennel and coriander crusted pork rib.  The food came out fairly quickly and we dug in...after the camera took the first bite ;)  The food was INCREDIBLE....I can't even think of a word to describe how EXCELLENT this BBQ was...the pork ribs were out favorite but the brisket was sooo tender and delicious.  The sides were out of this world...I mean if I had to ask for a last meal, this one might be it... the mac and cheese was creamy and flavorful, the collard greens weren't overcooked or mushy, they were the perfect savory flavor and consistency.  I will say, the potato salad was good BUT if I had to only pick two sides in the future I wouldn't go with it again.  It was pretty basic and I am not always a fan of the large red potatoes in a potato salad.  The house made pickles that are included in the meal were a delicious way to round out our meal.  Compliments to the chef - the food here is something I will dream about.  If you aren't convinced already - you should ABSOLUTLEY add lamberts to your list if you are visiting for the weekend or become a regular if you live in Austin.  Next time I visit, I hope to make it for one of their live music dinner events, but just a lunch here was a treat in itself."

                "description": "Came here for lunch and the prices seemed a bit more reasonable than the dinner menu.  The portions were very filling with a Chips and Queso and 3 Meat Platter easily filling up two adults.  Kinda wish they had more BBQ meat types available at lunch (beside other sausages).  Chipotle Queso with Burnt Ends: This appetizer so filling, it's almost like a light meal.  The queso isn't your typical microwaved Velveeta, but some sort of yummier in-house blend.  And then they toss in a bunch of BBQ meat with a nice drizzle of BBQ sauce.  There were some freshly made flour tortillas on the side, which were perfect to wrap up some cheese dipped meat.  And the thick fried corn chips were great for soaking up cheese alone.   Prime Texas Brisket: Definitely the best meat I tried here.  Thick, tender, fatty, meaty.  All the perfect things BBQ could be.  I kinda like the mustardy sauce pairing with this one more than the sweet sauce, but it's actually very tasty by itself.  Fennel and Coriander Crusted Pork Ribs: Felt a tad over salted / over smoked.  It tasted jerky-like and had a firmer Chinese spareribs texture.  I prefer when pork ribs have the meat almost falling off the bone and are primarily infused with just a subtle smoky flavor.  Texas All Beef Hot Link: Lots of nice spices in this.  Not as complex as the brisket or ribs, since it's basically just a sausage.  But really good for a sausage.  Baked Mac and Cheese: Loved how creamy and flowing the cheese sauce was.  The al dente pasta did a great job carrying that cheese sauce.  Sadly, no gratinéed cheese on top like fresh out-of-the-oven mac and cheese.  But the breadcrumbs gave it nice texture.  Ranch Style Borracho Beans: Hardy pinto beans.  Lots of good sauce, which seemed tomato-centric.  Some subtle sweet tones."

                "description": "FIRST TIME AND LAST! THE PORTION, TASTE,  AND PRICE ARE A TOTAL MISS. $34.00 AND NO SIDES? NEXT.   My first time in Austin, and we were looking for some great bbq. Well, I thought I had found it and I'm super sad this place Moses the mark. Who pays 52.00 for a plate with two sides? Let's get into this. . .   PROS: HAPPY HOUR MENU is the biggest pro! If you're a light eater like myself, happy hour menus can really help to try things in a way smaller portion. Pro #2-I had a reservation for two, and it ended up being for 3. There was no drama, or extra wait. The customer service was a 10/10! Most places get really upset about changing reservations (no idea why? More money is a great thing lol) so I'm glad this place didn't.   CONS: THE PORTION. THE PRICE. NO SIDES. I don't mind when food is expensive, just please be worth it. At Lucilles bbq it's 36.00 for 3 meats and two sides ;enough to feed TWO) . Here, it's 3oz of 2 meats and 1 sausage and 0 sides for 34.00. What the hell? Just like all the other comments stated, the food was not worth the price. We got 2 \"table sides\" which is 18.00 tacked onto the 34.00. I'm paying 52.00 for something that's usually $35.00. No thanks. Now let's get to how the food tastes. .   FOOD: 1/10.  Mac and cheese: The Mac and cheese was crispy? No cheese? Not wet inside, and HARD. -10! Beans: 9/10- the beans were amazing. But 9.00 for a tiny bowl? What the hell, lol.  3 meats plate: rib- 1/10 jalapeño sausage: 2/10 brisket 9/10. The only thing worth getting on this plate was the brisket. It was really tender and amazing.  Starter: Queso dip-The queso dip that was truly amazing and literally the only thing worth getting at this restaurant.   All around. I will never come back. I wish we would've spent this money at a different place. I get they're trying to do upscale bbq, and it totally missed the mark. There was nothing special or different that was worth the price or taste while having a vacation type dinner. The ambiance was the only thing that I can truly say was special on this visit."

                "description": "My friends and I went to Lamberts on our first night in Austin, in search of a great entry to barbecue in Texas! I'm a little bummed to say Lamberts missed the mark for us.   As far as the location itself, it was a generally nice building and it was really great that they had reservations available (when many barbecue places often don't). However... when arriving at the restaurant, our table wasn't ready at our reservation time so we ended up waiting for 15-20 minutes. Not really the end of the world, but it was a little disappointing, and the staff recommended that we get drinks at the bar... which would be great if there was space to hang out by the bar or in the waiting area.   Onto the actual food and drink experience: the drinks were solid and we all tried various cocktails and didn't have any bad experiences there. The food itself is one of my bigger qualms with Lamberts -- quality is OK but quantity is really not there for what you're paying. I understand the appeal of an upscale barbecue restaurant, where the ambiance is nice and you can get a table indoors, but it just didn't seem like you were remotely getting your value for money here with the food (both the main dishes and the entrees). Portions are small, and the quality is *just* ok, especially compared to some of the more notorious barbecue spots in Austin (which provide better taste and quantity for less $$).   Service was solid and the staff was nice overall -- they made their best efforts to overcome any challenges of the evening.   In general, I'll say you can probably find a better barbecue spot in Austin than Lamberts if you're really looking for good taste and good value for money. if you're really looking to get the ambiance of a cozy restaurant and get some decent (but expensive) barbecue, Lamberts could work just fine for that purpose."

                "description": "Happy hour here is such a great deal! From 5-7pm, Tuesday's through Saturdays, a selection of their appetizers are discounted. I got the crispy wild boar ribs, the frito pie, the red snapper ceviche, and the bbq clams.  The boar ribs were prepared like Buffalo wings; there was even blue cheese. The frito pie was shockingly good, I really liked the brisket buried underneath the mountain of frito chips and sour cream. The red snapper ceviche was served in a glass that was annoying to eat out of, and it was good but not the best version of ceviche I've had. The BBQ clams in white wine sauce was interesting and I liked the sourdough bread in it, but I'm realizing I just don't like clams very much.  Regardless, all of the dishes were done well. Service was also excellent - they start you off with jalapeño cornbread, and end you off with wet hand towels."

                "description": "My husband and I ate here for a dinner date tonight. We were a little nervous about eating indoors, but the staff did a good job of spacing tables and wearing masks.   The food was incredible! We had ceviche, brisket, Mac and cheese and the 3-meat plate. I was a little fussy about paying this much for bbq (it's a tad on the spendy side) but it was worth it. Completely delicious food.   There was a little side of sauerkraut that came with the 3-meat plate that I could eat every day. It was as good as kraut I have had in Germany and perfect with the sausage.  Beware of the carrots on the side of the bbq plates. They are tasty but SUPER spicy.  We found the atmosphere a bit noisy and there were several larger parties where heavy drinkers were getting a little out-of-hand, which was a bit of a damper on the date night vibes. Parking was also a little tricky, but typical for downtown: either street or garage.   We did have reservations via Open Table which I would recommend because they were pretty busy.   We appreciated the clean atmosphere, friendly staff, curated cocktail menu, happy hour specials until 7 PM, and delicious food."

While I am use to a nice moist brisket, I got a very fatty cut, highlights were the greens and cornbread.  The building was nice and it seemed like a popular business lunch spot but I was expecting top notch smoked meats.

                "description": "We were hoping for the most amazing brunch buffet in the city today, but due to Covid concerns, they have taken the responsible approach to temporarily put it on hold. In the meantime, the full menu is offered. Nonetheless, we were attended to by Alfonso whom we discovered was as knowledgeable about the menu and beverages as he is passionate about the company. Their version of pimiento cheese is phenomenal. My fried pork chop was incredibly juicy, and Edwyn's salad was well thought out.  The new GM Josh stopped by to make sure everything was as it was supposed to be, which they certainly were. In a nutshell, this is an absolutely amazing place."

                "description": "I have been to all of the locations in the Austin area and they are consistently good.   I met a client for lunch. They arrived early and ordered the guac and chips as an appetizer.  It was fresh, the chips were not overly salted, nice and crisp and a good amount to share for more than just 2 people.  We both ordered the special that day- the \"Spicy Jambalaya\" as it sounded really good. I have yet to have an entree here that I did not like.  This one was just ok. It was supposed to be chicken and shrimp.  Both of us only had one shrimp and only a couple of pieces of chicken. To me, jambalaya is at least 50% meat and 50% everything else. This was primarily rice and so much tomato sauce that was all I could taste. It was not spicy either so they brought us their habanero sauce (which is really good) which added the kick it needed.   The service is always great, the food is fresh and overall a good place. I was disappointed in this particular dish so I would not order it again but I will certainly go back.  There are a lot of really good items on the menu."

Our work group met for lunch today, there were 8 of us.  Most had not been.  Our server was on point.  Management was in the dining room backing the servers up.  The team worked together to take care of all guests.  The food was generous in portions, outstanding in quality, and delicious in taste.  I had the Fat Jack Burger.  It was perfect.  One of the best burgers I have had since coming to Texas.  It was not dry, prepared med rare, and had great flavor.  The bun was awesome.  Restrooms were spotless and smelled clean.  Good job, thank you.  I will be back.  Support local!!!"

                "description": "We've been coming to Jack Allen's for their heavenly brunch for years now (hello, tomato basil pie!), and I'm beyond remiss to only be reviewing it now, when we're eating \"linner\" here for the first time! If my husband were a restaurant, he would be Jack Allen's. Classic. Stylish. Cool Cat Texan. 90's grunge rock comfortable. FYI that Jack also feeds Camp Mabry on the regular, so we're both definite fans! You'll never ever go wrong with their boozy Sunday brunch. Period.  But does that culinary wizardry extend to Sunday linner? Why, yes. Yes, it does!   Can I say straightaway that the Slow Braised Beef Barbacoa Enchiladas were slap yo mama yum? If you're in the market for southwestern comfort food, look no further! The slow braised beef was flawless, cheesy goodness! Diet food? No. Excellent food? Yes!  First things first, though! The House-Made Pimento Cheese with Flatbread Cracker amuse bouche was stupid good! If pimento cheese was on your childhood menu, like it absolutely was on mine, you'll find this starter profoundly soul-warming! We bought a mason jar full of the cheese to take home because como no?   The Crispy Chicken Lollipops appetizer was out of this world! Crispy sweet heat and the most tender chicken thighs on earth with a pile of Jack Slaw that we would buy by the pint! This would actually be a perfect entree size for me for next time! I'm filing this away!   The Chicken Fried Pork Chop is straight up Sunday dinner at Mom's! If your mom is a stellar chef, of course, which we all know that they all are, right? The masher and the gravy were a cashmere throw! Ridiculous! Just look at the picture, y'all! You. Will. Not. Be. Disappointed.   The drinks all go without saying! The chemists behind the bar are wicked good! My agave skinny cocktail was on point! I knocked back three. No judgement! Hubby's Moscow Mule was bracing and bright! He knocked back three! No judgement!   The Blondie pie? Best dessert ever! I really don't know what else to say about it! I'm without words, and my husband is currently apoplectic!   By the by, our server, Christian, was the pitch perfect Jack Allen guide! Jack Gilmore is lucky to have him! As were we!   p.s. We picked up the Jack Allen cookbook while we were there. Tomato Basil Pie, we shall bake you!"

                "description": "We had a lovely meal here. The margarita took a while to arrive but was delicious. We shared the Chunky Queso with guacamole. So good. I had the ribeye tacos. An enormous amount of food and tasty. The steak was prepared perfect and was tender and flavorful. We even had pie for dessert. All the food was great. Plenty of places still struggling to have enough servers but our guy tried very hard and was extremely knowledgeable about the menu. Look forward to returning."

I called and they transferred me to Josh one of the managers,  He quickly found the order understood the issue and immediately gave me a refund and gave me what I had ordered at no charge! Fantastic customer service I will be telling everyone I know about my experience."

                "description": "*Update*.....Jack Allen's Kitchen on Anderson Ln is my go to eatery for fresh comfort food. They were doing farm to table before it was a foody phrase. Everything on their menu is excellent! Burgers and fries, fish tacos, salads and chicken fried steak are some of my favorites. These guys get it!!! They don't overthink their food and make the dishes something they're not. I often say, \"Simplicity is best served warm with a side of sweet potato fries.\" If you feel this way, Jack's is for you. In short, they prepare recognizable dishes with fresh ingredients at a good price point. I highly recommend Jack Allen's Kitchen for your next comfort food.culinary excursion. You simply will not find better food for the money anywhere in Central Texas. Run, don't walk, to any of their locations for great food."

                "description": "The food was okay, but nothing outstanding. Not a great sign when the appetizers were the highlight of the meal. We had the Barbacoa Stackers, guacamole, and catfish to start, and all of them were very tasty but not really great for splitting among a large group.  Didn't try dessert, and the drinks weren't bad just a little pricey to me. The entrees were lacking however, I split a plate of Chorizo Stuffed Pork Tenderloin, and Pesto-marinated Crab Stuffed Chicken. Both dishes were fine I guess, but both were light on flavor. There was barely any chorizo or crab in the respective dishes.  Short version, I'd recommend the appetizers, but that's about all."

The service is always good. The food is consistently good as well.  My only -1 is the food tends to be a little bland imo. Still good, just missing a kick, if that makes any sense. I've had many things off the menu now, chicken fried chicken, enchiladas, pasta, appetizers, etc. They're all good, but never my favorite. In fact part of the reason I've tried so many things is I'm looking for that ONE thing that makes me say \"let's go to Jack Allen's for dinner.\" But again, the food is good. I wouldn't hate on someone if they suggested we come here for dinner."

I really dug the music as soon as I walked in and decided where my clan was planning to post up. That is always a good sign especially for me who thrives on good music + strong drinks.  Parking is limited but there is plenty of parking up and down the street along the fancy apartment condos. The street is lit up so I felt pretty safe with my car parked a little further down from the entrance of the bar.  Super chill crowd and vibes here from all staff and the patrons. I enjoyed sitting outside on the small but mighty picnic tables. It seats 4 super comfortably with a few friends who were able to stand at the end of the table to converse and use the bar top holder behind them to set their drinks on.  Love their french fries as they were thick and almost curly-esque? I also loved the long corndog they have on their menu too. Everything is made to order and came out piping hot!  Cool local bar that is off the beaten path. We came here after visiting a brewery down the street so we could enjoy some spirits and shots!   Looking forward to more hang outs here at Frazier's in the future!"

It's close to my neck of the woods. The spot is a little old school feeling, cool and chill. The drinks are good. The food is delicious! The tunes are rockin! The bartenders and door guy always seem to be on their game. Did I mention they also have Jell-O shots here ... yes, that's right! Go on and order one to start out your night right or heck, end your night!

                "description": "Frazier's is everything I want in a local bar. I wish I lived closer so I could call it my own. It's the type of place you want to walk to after work is done and sit down with a drink and brush off the day.   There's loads of space inside and the people there seem to really enjoy it all.   The closest bar in town is Nickel City, they seem like sister spots. If you like one you'll love the other.   Food. They got that too and it's all the greasy fried nonsense you want at a bar when you're knocking back drinks. Corn dogs. Yup. They got em and they're damn good. Want a breakfast corn dog you ask? Yeah, got those too. So next time you want brunch head on over and grab some pancake batter dipped and fried breakfast sausage and dunk it in maple syrup and thank me. Totally worth it."

                "description": "This place is AWESOME!! The whole vibe is just so right, and the staff are so friendly and welcoming! We had been searching for a new local bar that had food AND was dog friendly, and we definitely found it in Frazier's! They have an awesome retro vibe inside, with some vintage arcade games, a jukebox and pool table. The bar is long, with plenty of seating, and plenty of TV's with sports on. They also have a small outdoor patio which is smoker-friendly as well. We decided to order food after hearing everyone within earshot talking about their menu favorites, and it was the very best choice we made all day! The chili dog was huge, and although they say it's Cincinnati-style chili, it was not cinnamon-heavy like most are, which we appreciated! The wings were some of the best in town, and so meaty, and perfectly crisped. They came extra saucy automatically, so again, another win for Frazier's! The fries are something to write home about, let me tall ya, they are the thick, twisty, plump potatoes, which they sprinkle with their wing seasoning. Holy cow were they amazing! The drinks were cheap, the beer was cold, they had frozens, they have a super fun brunch menu, there literally isn't a single other thing we could have asked for in a bar! And the BEST part, they are completely dog friendly, both inside and out which is a total jackpot win for dog parents, and they even have treats behind the bar for your pups, with lots of love and attention to give!"

They have a great selection of sauces as well. The fried pickles and patty melt were awesome and the fries had a seasoning that was finger licking good. The bar itself is very cool and divey. Feels like what Austin used to be like! Will definitely be a regular here moving forward"

Barback that buttons one button at the bottom of his shirt is a hot-headed douche . I think he was irritated because his chain got stuck in his two chest hairs. Gonna drop some baby powder off for him. Front door guy with long hair chill. May bring a flask and hang with him in the lot.

                "description": "Frazier's is big cold mugs of beer fantastic! Its dark its loud its enchanting. The bar has some cool vintage beer signs and artifacts for decor, custom pool tables and is all around classy in all the right ways.   The food served at Frazier's is bar food perfection. You'd be hard pressed to find a better corn dog and they've made classic greasy bar food like the patty melt relevant again. I've seen them insist that they are \"Making Patty Melts Great Again\" and I don't think you can prove them wrong.   Frazier's is also home to one of the best Thai style chicken sandwiches I've ever had. Which brings to point the unabashed diversity of the bar menu.   Take for example the \"Chopped Cheese\" sandwich served at Frazier's. A New York staple famed for its low cost at local bodega's. Finding one as authentic as the one served here (at least in Texas), is as far as I know impossible. They also continue to respect the heritage of the sandwich's low cost and sell it for only 5 dollars.   The staff at Frazier's is the most amazing and friendly group of folks you could ask for. Service is fast, friendly and delivers that everyone knows your name local bar feel that so many places strive for and never achieve.   Frazier's deserves nothing less than a perfect score, I cringe when I read reviewer Concerned C.'s review that refers to Frazier's as \"Hipster\". I cant help but imagine that for him to make such a misnomer he must not be hip enough to even identify what \"Hipster\" is. His statement that the TV's are never on only continues to reveal his ignorance (see attached photo of TV's on showing the game) shame on you Concerned C.  So I give Frazier's Five glowing stars, I'd give them six if it were an option and I look forward to spending many days eating chopped cheese and drinking from giant frosty mugs. Kudo's Frazier's Long and Low may you live long and prosper."

The seating right off the bay was a little less \"nice\" than we had imagined but we didn't let that bother us.   The problem came when we received the menu and it was much smaller than advertised online as well as more expensive. When we asked the server he was fully aware, but seems as though they had made no initiative to fix the issue. The plus side at this place is your inside of a nice hotel like Hilton, but other than no upside.   We ended up leaving without eating and went to Velvet Taco which never disappoints."

We had to sit outside of the restaurant because they were so busy (and it was a Monday night)- definitely recommend making a reservation. The waitress was so friendly! We started with the chips and dip, which were great. My husband and I split the roasted chicken and steak. Everything was so tasty. The kitchen was totally happy to modify their pepperoni pizza to be half cheese for the kids we had with us. Really great! They have a great cocktail menu as well. Just a note, the menu listed on their website right now doesn't match what they are serving."

For dinner, I highly recommend their handmade pizza (we tried pepperoni) and their salmon entree. Scrumptious!  We tried a few of their desserts and I'd rate them in the following order - chocolate cake (decadent!!!) , bourbon bread pudding (served with ice cream!) and their cheese cake (served with fresh peach slices).  Great ambiance and a lovely bar as well. I didn't try any alcoholic beverages but they make a mean virgin mojito!"

I want to be clear we never got any food and we're there from 7:15pm until 9pm. During this time no one took our dinner order. We cancelled the apps and I told the waitress we didn't want dinner as we never got the apps anyway. She promptly told me it wasn't her fault. We paid for our drinks and left. It looked like most ppl there were upset and had a similar ordeal. I understand when it's short handed but if there is a problem getting food out I think we should have been informed.

There was a dining room but it was not being used. I was kind of concerned and asked if it had table service - we were assured it did. I wouldn't have minded ordering at the hostess desk or bar and picked up the food but was told we would be taken care of. :D Yeah, 25 minutes later we left - tried to flag down wait staff after 15 minutes which is when we started researching other places to eat. I get it. They're short staffed and the hostess placed us really out of the way. But this Hilton has real problems managing expectations and keeps falling short of their promises. I would just avoid this place if possible."

                "description": "I absolutely loved the food here ! of course the restaurant is inside the Hilton hotel , and just FYI you'll have to pay for parking every day that you're here , which is about twenty five to forty dollars . when we got to the restaurant I believe it opens at five o'clock to ten o'clock or eleven , and everybody was really nice . because of Covid you must have your mask when you arrive , however when you sit down you can take your mask off . we got to sit actually anywhere around the vicinity of the restaurant , so we sat further away from The inside seating and sat a little bit across from the restaurant. The waitress was really attentive, she informed us of different things on the menu, please see my pictures of the menu. I really enjoyed the tomato soup, this is not your regular Campbell's tomato soup, it was so creamy I love the croutons that was added, it was definitely very savory and sweet. I also enjoyed the apple cider wings, they were cooked to perfection, the meat was falling off the bone. I also enjoyed that they had hot tea and gave you a little bit of honey with it, and the honey is like a new jar That you can take home. Overall I would deathly come back here to try some more food, they also do to go and they will deliver to your room if you stay in the hotel."

Secured a corner spot on the bar, grabbed a margarita and hung out for 2 hours.  I got the brisket Mac and cheese and the cornbread to go and both were awesome! The pizzas looked good too.  They have a bourbon bar which seemed to be pretty popular as well!"

The crab cakes are very good, tasty but lacked a little zing in the sauce.    But, perhaps most importantly, the drinks are outstanding lol.  On my last venture there, I was suffering from a stuffy head and relied on the bourbon bar magicians to doctor me up.  The drink was citrusy, rich and healing.  Thanks Doc!  See you next time!"

                "description": "On a day to pick up our SXSW badges at the Austin Convention Center food was on our mind since it was lunchtime. Since we were located next to the Hilton Austin I remembered reading Cannon + Belle was very good.  So we walked inside and had no problem getting a table.  It was near 11:00 AM and our waitress notified us breakfast was ending and gave us two menus. I did not feel like eating eggs so I ordered a Grilled Chicken Sandwich and my wife got the Brisket Pizza from the breakfast menu.  The place is nice and uses gold ware.  It's bit of fanciness to match elegant drink ware.  I reminded me of my grandmother's with her luxury dinnerware.   Soon our food arrived and my chicken sandwich came with creole potato chips. It was a bit spicy, but my sandwich was very good and the chicken was fresh, soft and juicy.  I enjoyed the sandwich very much.  I looked over to my wife's huge pizza where it was covered with diced bbq and scrambled eggs in the center. I tried it of course and the bbq had a smoked taste, and the eggs were farm fresh.  I pretty much ate her eggs and some of the pizza crust which was very crunchy.  Our server was excellent and kept our drinks full.  This place definitely meet and exceeded my expectations."

They have a full breakfast buffet at $22 per person. We didn't have a lot of time so we chose to order off the menu.  Good selection and good prices.  Mostly business attire as it was people staying at the hotel. But you can come as casual as you wanted. It literally is in the lobby of the hotel.  One block from visitor center.   Super fast service so go even if you are in a hurry!!  I got Just a side of pancakes for under five dollars, it was the perfect size and the butter is mixed in with cinnamon. Yum oh"

This seemed to be the only location open to get a meal, and although they were under staffed and overwhelmed by patrons they  handled the rush like champs and still provided a quality meal!! I had the CandB Burger and wasn't disappointed, flavorful, juicy and cooked to perfection.  I'll be back under a less stressful situation to text other items on the menu."

He has a lot of options that will work for any occasion. For our group we had a certain set of things we wanted to accomplish and Michael put together a custom experience for us that 100% delivered.   Michael is fun, knowledgeable and professional. He was prepared with anything we could have asked for and when we asked for an audible he was able to accommodate with zero problems.   I think it's also worth mentioning that his bus is immaculate, new and comfortable. That's a big deal when you spend a couple days traipsing around TX.   Highly recommend Michael and Native Experience for your Austin adventures."

Michael picked us up at our airbnb in Austin and drove us out to Fredericksburg for the day.  This was such a great alternative to staying a night in Fredericksburg because we didn't need to drive.  We went to a couple of really unique spots and had a couple of hours to explore Main Street in downtown.  It was a fully custom tour based on what our group wanted to do.  Michael really made the experience - he was a super entertaining driver and had a ton of local knowledge about the area.  I would highly recommend a tour with Native Experience and would definitely do it again."

                "description": "I haven't been here since I lived in Irvine, but we were craving some Italian food after all the barbeque, so thought North Italia would be a safe choice. This location is very spacious compared to the Irvine location. I love the atmosphere and ambiance of the restaurant. It gives off a classy casual vibe. We came here for a late lunch around 3pm on Friday and there was no wait.   Margherita pizza - You can never go wrong with a margherita. We did feel like the proportion of the crust to the actual pizza slice was really off. The crust was super thick while the pizza was so thin and flimsy. Pretty hard to eat. The bottom of the pizza was also burnt. The pizza topping itself was really tasty though.   Spicy rigatoni vodka - The star of the show every single time! The dish is bursting with flavor and every bite is amazing. I wouldn't miss out on this. I've tried their other pasta dishes but this is always my go-to. It also does have a little spice kick.   Service was friendly and quick. We were a bit disappointed in the pizza but nonetheless, it was a great quick bite to fulfill our cravings."

We were told 20-25 minute wait, ended up being 40 (no worries, estimating can be a challenge), ordered a $150 bottle of champagne which didn't see flutes (ever..) along with 3 cocktails. After waiting 20 minutes for glassware, we asked for wine glasses since \"there were no flutes..the wind keeps breaking them\" (or so we were told) still also didn't see our cocktails for 25 minutes (post order time) due to the glassware shortage. An hour and 15 minutes after placing our order until we asked about our entrees, 3 out of 5 arrived within 10 minutes of asking and we needed to wait another 10 minutes for ONE more and 4 minutes after that for the last (which happened to be the soon-to-be bride... go figure). We decided to skip table side dessert due to the time issue and asked for one coffee to go... saying it was lukewarm is generous... then the bill comes.   If you have endless time, don't want updates on what's going on, enjoy lukewarm coffee, and drinking champagne out of wine glasses THIS is the place for you!"

We came for an early dinner at 4:30 before catching a show later that night. Our food arrived sometime close to 6. We both ordered pasta dishes which usually tend to be the quickest.   We were very easy going and polite despite everything going on. People who sat down after us have already received there food and we're still waiting. After an hour the manager eventually comes over to us to let us know our food will be out...20 ish minutes later it comes AND MY PASTA IS COLD. It was so cold the sauce was already solidifying.  2. Portions are extremely small. I'm so glad that this place wasn't crazy expensive cause then I would be super upset. We were so hungry we decided to eat and leave to eat at the show lol.

This time I went I got the Charcuterie Board; you get a lot on it for being only $18. I also got the Italian Farm salad. I get this salad every time I go to North. I CRAVE this salad. It's my favorite thing. My boyfriend decided to try something new and got the spicy rigatoni pasta with Italian sausage. He loved it. It will now be one of his go-to's. Service was standard. I will continue going back over and over again because of the consistency, price, accessibility, and taste of food.

BTW...It is fun to watch them make the pasta in their kitchen. I had the Spaghetti and Meatballs with a large mixed greens salad ( see picture). The others had chicken pesto, Squid Ink Malfadine and shrimp over pasta and shrimp scampi over pasta. It was one of the few Italian restaurants that is open for lunch on Sunday. They also have a small Sunday Brunch menu ias well. I highly recommend North Italia at both locations. The food is always fresh. The wine was pretty pricey by the bottle but, that is to be expected."

We are vegetarian and got the spicy breakfast pizza special without the bacon... I can't explain how tasty it was!!! The sauce was spicy and tart and just to die for. The arugula on top was also so fresh!!!! We even asked for a side of the sauce to complement our strozzapretti pasta which we asked for without the meat. I had a glass of wine (usually don't like wine or alcohol while I'm eating ever) but the Riesling was actually mild and sweet and went well with the food. I will always recommend North Italia to whoever will listen"

                "description": "I don't even know where to start because it was all wonderful. From the Pomegranate Mule, to the Italian meatballs, to the prosciutto pizza and followed by Tiramisu. It was all so good. Later that night I was lying in bed craving more of those dang meatballs. For me you know it's good when you want more and a day hasn't even passed. The white truffle garlic bread is also a must. So much flavor! Service was great. The only thing that's weird about this location is that there isn't really a place to sit while waiting for a table unless you want to stand outside... which is fine as long as it's not freezing outside. It's not enough to take away a star because the food and drinks were fabulous."

The minestrone soup tasted truly mediocre.   Bolognese was salty but tasty   Carpaccio could have used more dressing and taste.   The hazelnut torta was quite excellent"

                "description": "Ugghhhh this is one of my favorite places of all time to dine at. Some items are hit or miss but I typically order an app, pizza, and pasta to share between 3 and have enjoyed everything I've ordered after trial and error.   The Calamari is arguably the best appetizer they offer. It's cooked perfectly and sooo good with the lemon squeeze and arugula salad on top. Any pizza has always been delicious and my favorite pasta has probably been the Strozzapreti although it is super heavy and filling. I think the location at the Domain offers larger portions at the same price point so I would recommend that one over the Downtown location tbh.   Also, they do free birthday desserts! My friend ordered the butter cake and it was divine. We love their sangria as well and a pitcher is great for a table of 3 to share."

The asparagus was a nice addition and the truffle oil sealed the deal. Regarding appetizers - the burrata anolini was delicious. The heirloom tomatoes were roasted perfectly and fell apart in your mouth. I will be returning to North Italia asap."

The stereo system was bumping, and Daniel, our amazing driver, had no issue with us turning it up to 11.  Our group was most guys in their 30's and Daniel gave us good recommendations on spots to check out that were age appropriate.  In between spots, Daniel drove me to a gas station to help me restock on beer. He even came in and helped me carry and load beers into the coolers.  Great communicate from Daniel from beginning to end, and he someone found the perfect spot to pick us up on busy Rainey St at the end of the night.   Great value and great experience.  Highly recommend."

                "description": "Coffee in the Time of COVID. There I was, deep in North West Austin. I really needed a cup of joe to soothe my nerves after the drive and the only place close by was a little boutique cafe innocuously named Coffee Shark. The out door seating area was populated by middle aged professionals, who I presumed were working on their screenplays while on lunch. The cafe was in an office place overlooked by Mac-mansions perched on the hills surrounding it.  I girded myself for the aromatic punch of patchouli and sandlewood mixed with the audible assault of world music and hemp-wearing hippies. I entered the cafe and was pleasantly surprised by the lack of the typical Austin vibe. The young lady at the counter took my order, a medium cappuccino, without a hint of pretentiousness. I perused the wares for sale, mugs and tshirts, local coffee beans, metal straws. Thinking I should prepare for disappointment I grabbed some sweetener.  The cappuccino arrived promptly, hot and inviting. To my delighted surprise it was rich, creamy and flavorful.  I skulked out of the cafe, my expectations of over-priced culture dashed on the rocks of pandemic panic-less normalcy. Great coffee and great service."

                "description": "Pretty nice for a hidden coffee shop in a large commercial complex. Would not notice it from the road or walking past unless you know what you're looking for, as it blends in with the rest of the modern building architecture. Not the warmest building from the exterior, but they've done a good job trying to make it welcoming indoors. A variety of seating with one high top table. Most of the seating is 6+ capacity tables, so if you don't like sharing, this is not the place for you to study/sit alone. There is bench window seating, but with two walls of windows I imagine those seats might get warm in the summer. Some outdoor seating as well, for those who prefer that.  I got the grilled cheese and apple sandwich. The flavor combination was well done, but I was a little disappointed by the ratio of filling to bread and felt the sandwich could have been fluffed out a little more in terms of filling. The chips were neither amazing nor terrible; pretty standard fare.   I also got two different hot chocolates. One regular with almond milk, one Mexican hot chocolate with oat milk. Of the two, I'd recommend the first one. Good flavor and nice quantity of whipped cream if you ask for it in a mug. The default seems to be to-go cups, so make sure you're clear if you want to sit and stay a while when ordering. My friend got the Mexican hot chocolate with regular milk and the spices smelled fantastic, but with oat milk they got overwhelmed and it was mostly an oaty flavor.   Welcoming and friendly staff. Would definitely visit again."

                "description": "I ran into Coffee Shark for a quick pick me up during my lunch break and was pleasantly surprised. First of all, the place is huge. I don't think anyone would ever have trouble finding a seat and it seems like a nice quiet place to work for an afternoon. I appreciated the fact that they had a lot of flavor options. I decided to get a Vanilla Rose Iced Oat Milk Latte and it was so good. The flavor was subtle and it was perfectly brewed. The only reason I knock it down to 4 stars is because it's definitely on the pricier side. I would expect to pay minimum $7 for a latte when you go in. While it may not be an everyday stop, I would still go back for sure.   COVID Precautions: Masks required for employees and customers."

We went to this place to try the steampunk coffee as other fellow yelpers have mentioned but I dint see option of steampunk coffee on their menu. There was only oNe person behind the counter for taking order and  making.  We ordered  blueberry scone, cranberry muffin, cappuccino  and house coffee. Muffin was huge, both muffin and scone wasn't  fresh at all, tasted like, when you leave them for couple of day on  top of the counter and take a bite. cappuccino  and coffee was good, service is ok, they  have ample seating. Recommend  cappuccino and cOffee not baked goods though."

It seemed so promising, but my friends and I ordered three different drinks, and each one was incredibly medicore. The chai latte was almost bland, vanilla latte tasted worse than an instant version I could buy at a grocery store, and even the normal latte lacked flavor."

                "description": "We've come here several times now so we must like it.   I have ordered a breakfast sandwich that's good. There's a pretty well endowed breakfast menu, not huge full breakfasts, like pancakes, but for a coffee shop there's a lot of offerings.  Our coffees are consistent.  It's definitely not my favorite, but it's always good. Consistency is hard, which is why I don't have a favorite coffee shop.   The outdoor area is great bc we always have my kids in tow and sometimes there's another kiddo out there for them to mingle with.   The details: It's an older, white, crowd. The industrial decor is neat, but the chairs are really loud when you move them.  There's plenty of parking. Staff is friendly.   It's always relatively quiet. *the reason i noticed the loud chairs *"

                "description": "Coffee is good. I have nothing negative to say about that--just the absolute worst customer service I have ever encountered in a coffee shop to date. The owner, or whoever he was, was so terrified of people I wasn't even sure if I was supposed to be there. Pictures look great, I'm sure the place can be a lot of fun if it weren't for COVID-paranoia. Seriously, I went all over Austin that day and NO ONE was halfway as petrified as this guy.  My brother tried to take a sip of his coffee but was soundly rebuked for exposing his nose and mouth for 10 seconds. I understand we need to be careful, and we were, but if you go to a coffee shop you should at least be permitted to make sure the thing is edible before you leave!! BTW, we wore a mask and were very careful the entire time being there.  Won't be back. There are many other decent coffee stops in Austin."

Good food, excellent desserts, and consistent coffee brewing skills exist here.  4 stars because while everything is good overall, the nitro cold brew coffee on the other-hand well to honest...sucks! Its just weak cold brewed coffee, it doesn't pack a punch of caffeine like other cafes that offer it on their menu. If you're gonna do something, do it right or do it better!  But great little place. Indoor and outdoor seating. Good lighting inside and fairly quiet environment if you're working out of the office.   The staff is friendly but not super helpful."

I love coffee but I'd honestly would get the chai next time - it was absolutely delightful. We also sampled our fair share of pastries including a blueberry muffin, pumpkin bread, and croissant. The muffin and bread were really moist and delicious, but the croissant was very bready and not a flaky, buttery croissant I was looking forward to. I think they get their pastries from a local bakery so that was cool and I would definitely try out their other pastries. Will definitely be back!"

                "description": "A Special Wing Outing   In searching for a new place to enjoy chicken wings there was one place I have not been to in a long while, The Park. At first I thought I should have made reservations where the place was packed but luckily there was a table available. The place felt like an upscale sports bar and great place to hang out.  TV monitors were all around showing various sports programming. The place was a bit loud but if you want a quieter atmosphere then suggest sitting in the partially outdoor bar area. Plus the patio area would been a good spot for those still cautious where patrons were seated really close together.  I ordered the 5 Garlic Ranch Rub Farm Fresh Wings along with a draft beer.  The wings were really good having a unique flavor among other restaurants. From my experience chicken wings tend to taste better from restaurants than wing places. They tasted like were slow cooked with nice spices on them. It had a side of ranch sauce to dip them in.   We had a great time here and be back for more."

Beer - barely cold Michelada - no flavor Mexican Martini - There MIGHT have been alcohol in it; at $10 Chicken carbonara -Rago and noodles NO FLAVOR; this is why I cook at home Wings - must have a had a sale a my Sam's for Tyson Buffalo Chicken Wings  The Oasis is know for their atmosphere and horrible food. The Park falls into that category.  Maybe they have a different menu for weekend brunch, but their regular lunch is not good."

I went to happy hour here with 8 of my coworkers and the outdoor seating was really spacious and well distanced from other tables.   Highlights: Their frozen margaritas (pretty strong especially for my low alcohol tolerance lol), the free tequila sampler my group received (:, the service, and the fact that they are really flexible with splitting checks for large groups!  Needs to be improved: The food was way too greasy and there weren't any plant based options for my vegan coworker. It would be nice if they had a smaller selection of dishes that were better quality and with half the oil added."

Definitely a sports bar vibe, with lots of TVs, but never gets too loud (at least when I've been there) as it's really spread out. They seem to have a nice separate outdoor space that people sometimes use for private events, which I love!  The food is good -- typical burgers, sandwiches, salad, tacos. I love that they have the option to get any time of burger/sandwich on a gluten free bun or a lettuce wrap. Their lettuce wraps are huge and keep everything together! I got the Hippie with grilled chicken and loved it -- the chicken was blackened and spicy - yum! My boyfriend got the Fat Chick (not what he ordered..whoops, but still was delicious). Fried chicken with gravy, mashed potatoes, and sautéed veggies. They have a \"Hot\" (adobo) and \"Skinny\" (grilled) version of this. Nice to see some healthy and more indulgent options.   Definitely recommend if you're looking for good food, strong drinks (and some fun cocktails), and a nice place to hang with a friend or a group!"

At first, I was thinking I was going to be walking into an Applebee's and I don't think I was that wrong but where The Park separates from Applebee's is the fact that The Park is actually has good food. Well at least their burger was amazing.   Friendly staff. Good, really good, drink happy hour. We sat outside and while a normal outside sitting decision is dangerous in Texas heat The Park actually made the sitting experience enjoyable.   If you are confused on what to get, as I was, may I suggest The Rebel burger. A good sized, well done, burger with fried pickle chips on it. My thinking is this. I'm going to get pickles anyways, I might as well get them fried as well."

The service was very friendly and she gave a great suggestion on the mushroom burger.  The fries were perfectly crispy and not to large of a serving that I was overly stuffed.  I love that their burgers don't come with mustard and mayo and will only add them if you request it.   The hubby had the park burger with onion rings, which he enjoyed buy nothing extravagant.      I did like that they were playing old music videos."

Stick to the burgers here, y'all. I got the veggie, which had a delicious flavor and texture, it was black bean. My bf got the grilled chicken. We both loved out burgers and they have great topping choices too. Huge drink menu. Great mac and cheese and sweet potato fries too. Waitress was the nicest person."

                "description": "After going to the domain location for the first time in January of 2022, a friend invited me to the location on slaughter and I was excited to go do the brunch special that's $16 because it was amazing at the domain. All the the food was old and just sitting there, we were there for about 2 hours and not one did they change anything out. My favorite thing to get is max and cheese and I checked 4-5 times to see if they changed it out. I didn't want to be rude and ask someone to change it out to I asked our waitress for a side of max And cheese (already $5 extra even though it's included in a $16 buffet) so she brought me the photo of the Mac and cheese in the smaller plate which looked like they scooped it out of the Mac and cheese that had already been sitting there. It was dry and barely tasted like cheese. This place doesn't even deserve 1 star! I was super disappointed. We ended up having to order food on top of our brunch special because the food was so old and nobody would replace it for TWO HOURS. The domain location is the one I would recommend instead."

                "description": "I've found Long Play to be a good reliable hangout spot if I'm looking for a non-brewery casual environment in the neighborhood. They have a wide array of drink options that should keep any group satisfied.  There's lots of sizable tables on their patio. Enough so that even though they allow smoking outside I've never had to sit close enough to a smoking table to be bothered by it.  The bartenders are all really friendly and happy to make suggestions. If you're there on a less busy night the indoor seating has a nice intimate atmosphere, but can get crowded fast on the weekends if the weather isn't great outside.   The Korean food was super unexpected the first time I visited, and while I haven't made it part of my experience most times I've come here, I can't remember myself or any friends having a bad experience with the food.  Overall I'd highly recommend giving them a try if you're looking for a casual bar in the area!"

They have old fashions on tap for $5, which I think sets them apart - as well as assorted Korean food, including dumplings.   This place reminds me of eclectic, old Austin, and I absolutely love it. I could see it being an institution in 20 years like Lala's is now.   Can't wait to go back :)"

I had the fried chicken, which was crispy, juicy and just a little bit spicy. It was served with a radish salad, I think. My friend had the bibimbap, which was also excellent.  It's kind of small inside, but the patio is pretty spacious and dog friendly. And the best part is they play full vinyl albums over the outdoor speakers. They've got great taste, and I would definitely be a regular if I lived closer."

Stopped by for a margarita and a bowl of meat chili while running from point A to B on Sat eve.  The chili is indeed delicious - no beans, with a good amount of heat inherent - I'd place it as one of the best bowls I've had in all of Austin.  Good liquor selection for cocktails, and a goodly amount of picnic tables out front to soak up the sun.  They were spinning Herbie Hancock and Specials records, which hits some sweet spots for me.  Added bonus that I easily nabbed one of their adjoining parking spots.  Hoping this one sticks around - it definitely has the makings for a great neighborhood bar!"

We sat at the front for the best view. Quiet electric barge, no spray. Could not hear commentary; boat may need Bluetooth speakers at the front. Good views of downtown buildings! We saw two groups of egrets settling in for the night. We saw some bats flying out of the Congress Ave bridge! Not many bats because this was in November.  We missed a few bats because the boat returned to the dock to drop off some people who needed to use the bathroom :( The tour guide could have stated that the boat had no bathrooms. It is obvious to the guide but not to the first-time visitor. Tip: go to the bathroom before you board the boat."

Capital Leah was great as she lead us on the tour of the lake and city, with the finale of the trip seeing the bats fly out from congress ave bridge. Definitely recommend to anyone! We love our bats here in ATX"

The bats are still finding their way back from Mexico but it was still fun to see the bug hungry little critters emerge a few dozen at a time and head out for a night of dining on the local farms. If you want the full bat experience that happens in July according to our boat captain."

The tour included city views with running commentary followed by the bats flying out from under the bridge for a very long time. Our questions were addressed and we saw many unusual birds and other sights. It was a real highlight for me. My only concern was that my GPS took me to the bus entrance and I was almost late trying to find my way to the parking garage and then through the hotel to the boat dock. The rest of my family got there in plenty of time but they were more familiar with the area. I got a great video of the bats so it was totally worth the hassle."

We've always had 6 folks, so it's a super economical outing and it's BYOB and snacks. They have a little thingie for you to plug your phone in for some tunes, too.  Very little interaction with staff beyond checking in, getting the quick lay of the land, errr, lake, and when they help you dock at the end, so super COVID safe, in that respect."

I'm glad I got there at the time I did because there was an even longer wait time for all the people who came after me. It was $18 total for us to rent a two-seater for up to an hour. Totally worth it. We saw Austin from a whole different perspective. Also, it was quite a workout - a nice one though."

They are open right now and a friend of mine and I rented stand up paddlebords recently for an hour on the lake. We went mid morning (they opened at 10am on a Tuesday) and it was glorious. Hardly anyone was on the lake. The staff is super friendly. They have a tent outside and a touch less payment system. Prices are reasonable and their equipment is good too. They have some outside cubbies for your stuff should you choose to leave anything at the dock. The pics are from the bat cruise in October 2019. Highly recommend!"

Lorrie our tour guide was knowledgeable and funny (and we had a bit of a weird situation with a passenger being disruptive which she and the other employees handled quickly and professionally).

Another person on the tour said she thought it'd last around a half hour, but we were on the boat for nearly 2 hours! Watching the bats was incredible. We went in early November, so we weren't sure how many bats would be left, and there were TONS! It's truly an experience I'll never forget. Thank you to the employees and captain!"

Also ordered their chips with different dips for an appetizer as well...the cheese hardened so fast the chips they gave us was so weak that they would just shatter so you could barely eat the cheese.

The Park demands to be seen, it's located on a busy street where it's not hard to miss.   I came in to meet a few friends for The Park's Sunday Funday, where they boast about a ~$20 Brunch Buffet and 5 different flavors of Mimosas. Everything tasted dry and bland in the ingredients. But, what more do you expect for such a low cost? The typical breakfast is served (eggs, bacon, sausage, waffles/pancakes) with handful of lunch entrees (fried rice) and a variety of desserts (pudding, cookies).   Would not return."

Not exactly anything to rave about but a really good variety for what you pay for and the atmosphere more than makes up for it w versatile seating options and plenty of tvs to watch sports on. Mimosa flavors are great and the buffet had plenty of options to appease everyone at the table, even the picky ones. It is obviously a go to for many as the line was wrapped around and down the sidewalk by 11am when they opened. It's usually my go to in the domain when I want to have a quick catch-up w someone."

The French toast, the eggs with veggies, potatoes, fried chicken, and the macaroni hash *mouth waters* was all cooked with love and seasoned well. The mimosas during brunch was $2.  I had a pineapple basil or something and that was very tasty.   Our waitress was very attentive and gave good recommendations."

Biggest complaint would be the occasional long black hairs in my food and the filling felt a bit scrimpy (pic attached)- there just wasn't much meat, mostly cabbage in the taco, and the tortillas were just too large. I honestly chose this place because of the sign out front advertising the frozen mojitos, and that was the first thing I inquired about and they didn't have them. I got a regular mojito and it was honestly made alright but a horrible experience consuming it because instead of putting mint leaves in, they were finely chopped up so I got pieces of mint in my mouth every sip I took. Probably won't be back."

My first time in a while out and the service was on point with the continued mimosa which there are 8 types. My favorite thing about the park is eating outside and given gloves to make my plate each time you go to the buffet for brunch. The chicken enchiladas are on a point as well.   Recommendation: go early to avoid long waits"

They have a great happy hour menu that I will have to stop by again to give another try! However parking garage is right across the street and it's free so that's always a plus! I had their margarita and chips and dip, nothing to rave over but nothing to \"complain\" about. I know they have more potential and quite possibly caught them on an off day. Will update this review when I revisit!"

The place is lively and has a dark, rustic feel to it. Seating inside and out!   I liked the fries the most. It was unlike any fry I've ever had. It was fluffy and addicting!   Based off of how good our burgers tasted, I'm sure any of the other choices are just as good! They were so large, we could hardly finish it. Tastes just as good for leftovers.   Don't skip the fried pickles! They're a good starter.   Mac and Cheese was good, could've been a little more cheesier, but it was creamy and it had an adequate amount for what it's worthy (lots of people get skimpy when it comes to adding a side of Mac and Cheese)   Our server was friendly and attentive. Great at memorization--he didn't have to write anything down with no mistakes. And those who dropped off other food at our table were nice as well!"

I have lots of drinking experience in Austin. Workhorse nails it. Anyone can come here, feel comfortable, enjoy super-solid food, a great beer selection, and walk away with an affordable tab. It's just perfect..  LOVE the new COVID sidewalk space. PLEASE keep it. Probably 90% of the patrons here smoke cigarettes and the back patio only barely sufficed."

                "description": "I can't comment on the bar itself since I didn't get the chance to drink there, but it's decent burger at a great price.  The burger itself was overcooked and dry; I don't know if this is normal, if the kitchen was having a bad series, or if the customer can request medium-rare.  Something to consider for next time.  And there should be a next time too, because this is still a great deal: burger + side for under $10.  Sure, it'd be nice if cheese wasn't an upcharge, but that's really a minor quibble.  Inside, the décor is funky and vibey, much like the other restaurants and shops in this North Loop neighborhood.  What stands out most inside is the massive album art print from Stone Temple Pilots's Purple.  Thanks to this, I haven't been able to get \"Interstate Love Song\" out of my head for the past four days."

                "description": "Came here with the coworkers on a Friday right after work. This is a great spot with an outdoor seating area in BOTH the front and the back (which I didn't know at first).  Their drinks are pre-California exodus cheap, so grab a beer or two or three. They also have grub. There's plenty of burgers to choose from, a coworker said their portobello burger is bomb. I got the burger special, which was arugula and blue cheese. My burger was slightly overcooked and a coworker's was well-done, so you'll have to be mindful of that; if you like yours med-rare or medium, I would call it out. I thought they were pretty generous with the blue cheese, but the burger itself could have been slightly larger; they're thick but relatively tiny. Buns are toasted. I think next time I'd go with one of the classic burgers since I felt the burger special was really heavy, the arugula doesn't bring enough balance for the funkiness of the blue cheese. The parmesian fries were alright, a tad too salty for me.  The guys behind the bar were nice, a bee got stuck in my bottle and they kindly replaced it.  PARKING: there's a few spots out front, but there's plenty of parking around the corner in the residential area.  Come for the drinks, stay for vibes."

                "description": "It's a good dive, with tons of beer on tap and surprisingly good food. Lots of vegetarian options too. Service is pretty decent considering how grungy the place is.   However: I definitely got at least one drink in a dirty ass glass, and the kitchen staff is, shall we say, pretty casual about food hygiene. And yet I still liked it somehow. Maybe because so many other places in present-day Austin are just gentrification normie hellscapes-- this is a nice change of pace."

                "description": "I have been to the Workhorse Bar three times before yesterday, and those experiences were all 3-4 stars.  But this most recent visit was teetering on between 2-3 stars.    I ordered the White Manhattan, which has always been awesome!  This visit it tasted like they poured me a glass of watered down Moonshine and added a twist of Orange.  I ordered a second one just to make sure it was just not a bad pour.  Nope the second one was as bad as the first. The odd thing is they bartender who made them both, was the same bartender who has made them for me on my prior visits.     We were also quite bothered by the loud group behind us slamming their cards on the table as they played some unknown card game.  They were overly loud and obnoxious.  We were not the only customers who were annoyed.  The other pet peeve I have is when large groups of people stand at the front door of an entrance to smoke cigarettes.  On this visit there was always a group of 3-7 people puffing away well within 15 feet of the front door.  People...please go smoke out back on the patio.  The upside of this visit was the music from the jukebox.  For $2 we were able to select 8 tunes.  Music selection is random, but good."

                "description": "Workhorse is the perfect little neighborhood bar. It has a fairly large and very affordable selection of drinks, an all-around-the-clock \"happy hour\", great bar food and a nice staff! They also have a jukebox (select 4 songs for a dollar) and a patio in the back.   In the food department, they've got a good selection of sides and appetizers, as well as burgers, salads and fries. Vegetarians will be pleased to find out they have several veggie options, including two types of veggie burgers and many sides. The food is cheap and tasty. I don't know about you, but for me that's getting pretty close to my definition of heaven!   If you want available seating space for the duration of your stay, I recommend visiting between Monday and Thursday. Friday and weekends are very popular nights and you might not be able to find a cozy spot to sit, although that goes for most bars.  If you pass by the North Loop strip one evening, you should definitely drop by and have a taste of Workhorse."

It's located in such a chill part of Austin, so it's perfect when you feel like going out, but not going out (if you know what I mean)! They have a ton of beers on tap and handful of yummy sounding cocktails. We didn't eat here, but when we saw their blue cheese bacon burger with huge azzz onion rings on the side we were wishing we did! It was totally embarrassing, but my husband accidentally spilled his first beer on the bar and the bar tender did a great job at not acting completely annoyed at him, although he was. He even poured him another which we were not expecting at all, so that added to our great experience here! Highly recommend, but only if you're not a high-maintenance little princess because it definitely has some grunginess to it ;)"

                "description": "For flyrite only:  We stopped in here when they first converted over to fly rite and ordered the chicken quesadilla, buffalo chicken sandwich, kale slaw and tots. In my opinion the best things were the tots and the quesadilla. The quesadilla had A LOT of veggies, more than it had chicken. The kale slaw didn't have much flavor and the sandwich was average.   Overall, it is a little pricey for the quality and with so many options nearby, we probably won't be back."

                "description": "After a long day walking around the Domain our last stop was to find a place to relax and have a drink before returning home so selected Lavaca Street Bar. From the outside it looked like a sports bar and it was. When you enter you can order food from a full menu of mostly seafood cuisine. We just skipped this and headed straight to the bar where located right in the middle of this establishment.  This place has lots of flat screens showing a wide variety of sports entertainment. The beer choices was excellent and enjoyed the one I had. Staff were nice and tended to our needs very well.  Fun atmosphere where there was an adult birthday party going on here. Another nice design is very open to the outside even if sitting inside unless way in the back. We enjoyed it and next time pick something off the menu."

We ordered food through fly rite chicken, and I ordered a Bloody Mary from the bar. Pretty tasty food, Bloody Mary was tasty and enjoyed that on a warmer afternoon.   Lots of cool places to visit around this area. I suggest trying the Buffalo chicken sandwich with a side of tater tots."

We haven't been to your place in a while due to the pandemic. We walk in excited and salivating and walked out disgusted to learn it was like Fly chicken or something like that. Seriously? You had a perfect blend of affordable high-end food and now,,,, wow you offer such exiting fare as chicken sandwiches?! How is this something anyone looks forward to? Such typical bar food.  I told all my neighbors this and they were shocked. GET BACK THE OLD RESTAURANT. Guys, *that's what made you special and memorable. Your bar isn't that exciting or enticing without it.. think about your Rock Rose Street competition. We were sooo sad to see these food items go. I hate to say it, but we will NEVER be back. Why did you ruin a good thing?!?"

                "description": "Was in the mood for a late night meal and decided to hit the Domain for Lavaca's 30th Anniversary Party to grab a bite to eat. An absolutely phenomenal decision as the food was delicious! Neither of us ordered drinks (I was a little disappointed - didn't see any special anniversary drinks available!) but the food was great.   There are several locations for Lavaca Street Bar, but we visited this one because it's closest to my house. As it is also a bar, you will need to bring along an ID because they do card to enter. This location, as with the others, features both indoor and outdoor seating. We opted for a closet table because I'm on crutches so mobility and accessibility were a main focus. Be advised, you order at the front and they will bring your food to you, but you cannot order anything from your table. Instead, when you place the order they give you a numbered placard to place on the table of your choice.   In perusing through the menu, there were several items that caught my eye, but when I went up to order I noticed a special on blacked tuna tacos for the month...of course this was what I ended up selecting based on the recommendation of the cashier. WOW! My tacos arrived to the table deconstructed as they do not have any suitable corn (gluten free!) tortillas so I couldn't actually eat them as tacos. (This was not the hill I wanted to die on with my celiac disease) It was a beautiful display and they were delivered by the nicest man (super friendly, very accommodating, etc.) but I was quite disappointed that I was unable to enjoy them as tacos because of the tortilla situation.   Despite my disappointment in this....they were amazing!!! The seasoning/rub used to blacken the tuna was probably the best I've ever had and I absolutely have to try it on other meats as well. My friend ordered the chicken quesadillas and also loved it, but I think mine was better.    We came at a pretty busy time (I mean there was a party going on for goodness sake!) and our food was still on the table in the blink of an eye. I will say that this isn't the place to go if you expect to be waited on hand and foot, because this is not that type of establishment, but the service was stellar and entirely met my expectations.   The only reason I'm unable to give a 5 star is because I was unable to enjoy my meal as it was intended and I honestly can't believe they didn't have corn tortillas I could use instead. They did get creative in deconstructing it a d it was still beautiful and delicious, but I really wanted those tacos and I'm sure the tortilla would have changed the flavor as well. Hopefully next time they'll have something suitable as I definitely intend for there to be a next time!"

                "description": "AVOID THIS PLACE AND DO NOT ORDER FOOD HERE! I came here expecting a restaurant, but it turns out that they added a food truck to avoid the COVID shutdown. Almost an hour and a half wait (88 minutes!!) for a set of wings and a sandwich, and it came out cold. Not worth the $20. The best part? When I asked the Lavaca Street Bar folks about how much longer it would be, they said that it wasn't their problem and offered no help. I also tried to go to the food truck, but there's no one at the window to help (you have to order through an app)!!   The beer was fine."

                "description": "FOR FLYRITE    I usually visit the location on 7th street bc my bf is obsessed with this place. We went to the location at the domain bc it's closer to his place and it was probably one of the worst meals I've had in a long time. I already took a risk going to the domain which is like a scene from Mad Max as it is (no one wears a mask and acts like they don't know what 6ft apart means)  We decided to redeem our free sandwich promo from the app. Both our meals were incorrect and the tater tots were soggy. No, it wasn't from waiting to get home. I snuck one out of the bag at the restaurant when my bf wasn't looking and already knew dinner was going to be a no go for me. But I gave it chance. I had a long day and waited to eat until I could have a nice dinner with my lovely partner. After a hangry drive home I popped open my little box of incorrect disappointment and was instantly sad that my food was wrong. I powered through about two bites to find a long overly dyed hair in my chicken sandwich :(. I was tired and ready to end my night that I just pounded down my tots which later gave me a stomach ache.   I felt a call to rectify my order was unwarranted since it was a free sandwich and I still wouldn't eat there again anyway. My bf loves this place and it's a shame that we won't share that experience again. Oh well, onto finding the next chicken sandwich."

We got a steak poboy, ceviche, and dozen Rockefeller oysters and it was well over $70 with tip... we haven't even ordered drinks yet which is a separate process. Bartenders are usually slow and talkative to people they know and who seem to also work there. The place itself is open, has tons of tvs, and dog friendly which is why we've continued to come back. I just wish we got better service for the prices we're paying."

My wife isn't the biggest burger lover, she has to be in a very specific mood so it surprised me when she said she wanted to go give it a try.  The inside is pretty dark (it is a bar though so can't really fault them for that.) Have a small patio outside which is dog friendly. Though it is right off Burnet, the parking lot is a bit tricky and can easily be missed, especially during high traffic times.  The guy behind the bar was pretty friendly, especially when we told him how we found out about the place. We went during lunch so we kept it simple. Order of cheese curds and I got the Cobra burger and my wife got a basic beacon cheese burger.  First, these are by FAR my favorite cheese curds in town. The breading has a bit of a spicy kick to it that really makes them even more delicious. The burgers come with fries and a pickle spear. It was juicy and perfectly cooked. Great flavor and the Cobra burger has a good kick to it. My wife has literally been asking me to go back for the last 2 weeks so we went again today and it was all just as good as the first time. So check them out, just be cautious about the parking."

Great beer selection included our current go-to Electric Jellyfish.   For food we started with the cheese curds. Incredibly crispy. I'd put theirs up against Any I've had in Wisconsin.  Finished up with a cheeseburger and fries. Both were Shockingly good. Not just good for a dive bar, flat out legit.   Can't wait to go back."

                "description": "In the past we haven't had the greatest of experiences here but we decided to give them another try. It was  a very different experience this time and one that will keep us coming back. Our bartendereress, Mikey, was the sweetest person we've met in ages. She was extremely cheerful, very accommodating, and always kept a good close eye on this. We watched her interaction with other customers as well, and she always took such good care of everyone as if she had known them for a hundred years. The food menu is quite extensive, and everything we've had in the last few trips has been really good. Good Old Pub grub! The beer selection doesn't change as often as we'd like but at least they do keep some really good local or Regional beers on tap. Would like to see a few more selections switching in and out occasionally now they were hooked. Tonight we came in we weren't really too hungry but we needed to eat something so she suggested the chicken Philly which she was able to have split for us. It was actually very very good. We will definitely be regulars here. It's amazing what a bartender can do to bring business in, our last battle experience there was a bartender who seem to have a  snarky attitude, very opposite from Mikey!"

                "description": "Review for Billy's on Burnett  TLDR: a perfectly above average dive bar  For the food: I ordered Billy's \"The Shults\" burger. The wait time for the food was perfectly reasonable. The burger was well seasoned and well constructed. The only real complaint was the pickle on top was rather small and lackluster. The fries were fresh and crisp, and also well seasoned.   For the drinks: Billy's offers a more than ample beer menu with the common stock, as well as a decent selection of local breweries.   For the atmosphere: Billy's certainly fronts the image of a dive bar, and does so very well. Dimly lit, slightly crowded, and a prominent bar situated directly across the entrance all help establish the environment they want. The patio in the side is well shaded, and has much less road noise than I initially expected. The only complaint is the flies on the patio are out of control.   For the value: Given the location, I can't really blame Billy's for the prices. I feel like I payed a bit more than what I would have wanted for what I got, however, that feeling isn't uncommon in Austin in general, and especially Burnet.   Everything else: there's virtually no parking at Billy's, however there is some street parking within easy walking distance. And yet again, the flies on the patio are on another level."

                "description": "Billy likes Billy's on Burnet. It's a dark, divy beer bar with a solid food menu including many fried appetizers, from wings to okra, and myriad burger and sandwich options, even hot dogs and an entire column of veg-head choices. I myself enjoy the indulgence of a cobra burger w/fries and a fine Texas craft beer, of which there are many. The burgers are pretty darn good and the beer is cold, so what else do you need? Entertainment? Billy's has you covered with a pool table, darts, several TVs and some arcade games in the back. Other notes: there is a patio and a small parking lot, but there is street parking nearby."

                "description": "Aaron Franklin has long touted Billy's on Burnet as a superior restaurant for the best in burgers, and once again, he is correct about food.  The folks at Billy's did confirm that the James Beard Award winner is a regular.  The menu's, order source and pickup is at the bar.  We were clearly the only \"non-regulars\" there that day.  But, we were warmly greeted and walked through the extensive menu of burgers, sandwiches, and yes, beer options.  We will definitely be backed to try many of the other options.  The prices were very reasonable as fries come with the burgers.  The burgers were delicious, juicy and HUGE.  The burgers are served open faced.  If you like to cut your sandwich in half, the basket makes this a bit difficult.  The only downside, I gained a pound.  There is plenty of parking, the inside is much larger than we expected, and yes, it is a classic dive."

                "description": "Very disappointed by our experience for takeout tonight. My husband wanted a patty melt and I wanted a club sandwich. The online ordering and curbside pickup were easy and user friendly. The food, specifically my club was a big let down. I was expecting a traditional triple decker on toast style club. It was on a hoagie and even worse, there was a dark hair in the lettuce on my sandwich. Needless to say, lost my appetite after that, I tossed it. I added, in advance a 25% gratuity because that's how it works ordering curbside and during COVID19 I've been wanting to support local businesses and their staff. Won't be ordering takeout again."

                "description": "I went to Billy's for the first and last time on Sunday afternoon. They said they allowed dogs on their patio, so I figured I'd bring my well trained 3 year old pit/bulldog mix. Everything was great for 45 minutes. My dog met 3 other dogs and got some puppy rubs from about 5 patrons on the patio, and then everything changed in the blink of an eye.   An intoxicated man holding his toy dog stepped up onto the patio and immediately zoned in on mine. His dog growled at mine while my dog whined and wagged her tail because she just wanted to meet another dog. The intoxicated man sternly asked me if she was a rescue to which I replied \"no, I've had her since she was six weeks old.\" To which he replied \"Your dog is aggressive.\" I told him he was aggressive and he went all in and said \"if yOur dog touches my dog, I will slit it's throat.\" This quickly turned into a heated altercation where I knew something bad was going to happen if I stayed, so I removed myself from the situation.  I went into the bar to let them know that there was a disgruntled patron out on the patio that threatened to slit my dog's throat and the bartender asked who it was. I pointed him out through the window and she said \"Oh. He's a regular, that's so weird, he never acts like that.....\" and just shrugged.  As soon as I took one step out the door, this regular of yours, Stefan, got right back in my face, chest bumping  me, trying to rile me up by calling me insults and slurs. He went over the top and came out with the statement \"I can't wait for you to throw the first punch, so I can sue the shit out of you.\"  I'm a General Manager of another local restaurant and I understand the value of a regular customer, but sometimes if a regular oversteps their boundaries they need to be handled. Y'all are an establishment that's main priority is providing a safe environment for ALL of your customers, not just your regulars. Y'all could have prevented this whole situation from escalating and chose not to. I'm honestly more disappointed in your staff than I am with the situation with Stefan.  Out of my four years here, this was the worst Austin experience I've ever had. You guaranteed the fact that my friend and I will never return to be a potential regular for you because we shouldn't have to question our safety."

                "description": "I was very let down by my experience here. My friends raved how good this place was.   I walked up to the bar and explained it was my first time here and how did it work. The two people behind the bar, a heavily tattooed dude and a middle aged lady, were less than hospitable. I forget his exact words but something along the lines of what you see is what you get. I was waiting for my friend and just wanted to get a starter while I waited. I ordered the chili cheese fries. Lady says no, we don't have that bc of the water boil issue. I said ok. I asked if they just weren't doing appetizers. She said they were only doing fried things. (Correct me if I'm wrong but fries are fried, right?)  I said can I get queso and chips? - no.  Mmm ok can I get a blue moon- no.  I made a joke at this point bc it was awkward and like what the hell. I said I'm really striking out here. She said they had something similar and went to get it. Then this guy standing next to me orders chips and queso from the dude bartender. When the lady brought me my beer back I mentioned this and she freaked out on the dude bartender. I ruined the other guys opportunity to get queso and they made him order something else. Oops. Then I hesitantly asked if I could get frito pie. Finally I got a yes. But that yes makes no sense. I couldn't get chili cheese fries but I could get chili and cheese on Fritos? I walked away confused and put off.   My friend showed up and we decided to split a burger, we didn't even want to ask the employees what they recommended because of their foul, unhelpful, annoyed attitudes. Even my friend was like what the actual F. They were straight rude. We ordered a burger. The bun was soft and that's about it. Nothing special at all. Food was a 2, service was a 0 so as much as I hate to leave reviews like these, they get an overall 1.   Customer service, a smile, a friendly demeanor go a LONG way. Won't be giving this place a 2nd Chance."

Service was really fast, even when all the trivia people arrived/ ordered all at once. If you are coming for trivia/ an event, you need to get there really early for a table. If you are coming to just hang out, double check that there is not trivia/ an event that day. A few folks walked in, saw all of the tables packed and left.   Food reviews!  -Veggie burger: solid patty, hefty amount of avocado. Not the most interesting veggie burger, but definitely solid.  -Turkey Rueben: yum, devoured quickly -Chili cheese fries: Also yum, also devoured quickly. An excellent topping to fry ratio.  -Roast beef sandwich: The person who ordered this said it was good, but wasn't going to order it again. Said it was a little too greasy/ soggy.  - Fries: They are really well seasoned but they are also really unevenly cooked. One fry is perfect, the next one seemed almost raw."

How bout two bucks off any Real Ale draft on Thursdays. Here take your 4 stars Billy. Minus one star for being a Green Bay Packer Bar (kidding).   Billy's is a chill neighborhood bar to grab a bite and have a beer or two. Their draft selection is awesome with all your favorites plus a few that will surprise you. Checkout their burger menu it's pretty extensive. I opted for a boring cheeseburger with fries. Burger was cooked perfectly and served on a bed of spiced up fries and it paired perfectly with my pint of Real Ale amber. Will definitely return but not on a Packer game day (Go Pats!)."

The sausage was incredible (this is coming from someone who HATES sausage on her pizza). The meats had so much flavor. Also, the service was incredible. The first time we came by, the wait after being seated was absolutely insane. We were so hungry! However, the waiter was so attentive to this and gave us a free dessert!   ....which leads me to how good the dessert is here! I am not a caramel fan, and this caramel ice cream was insanely good.   Please come to north italia. Trust me. It's our new fave!"

                "description": "Let me say start with how amazing the staff are! We were greeted immediately. Our waiter is a Rockstar! As busy as they were, she came and checked on us frequently.   As you can see in my pictures we ordered a lot, lol. We created our pizza. The pesto was perfect. The crust on the pizza was crispy and soft. Great flavor overall.  I ordered the squid Ink. It was great spice and delicious. Only negative was the shrimp and it needed some type of veggie. The shrimp didn't hold flavor well in the dish. I think Argentina shrimp would be a better pick for this dish rather than basic shrimp.  My little one of course with her sweet tooth ordered the glazed Italian donut french toast. It actually was really good. The wild blueberry, honey lemon ricotta, hazelnut and mint combination was actually a really good combination. This dish is super sweet so make sure you have some milk or water to drink.  My other child ordered the breakfast sandwich. She loved it. She really enjoyed the hint of spice it had in it. And my oldest child ordered the Pollo fritto and asked for over easy egg. We also ordered one too so we all could try. Let me say how they cooked the perfect cut of chicken. Normally you order chicken like this and they give you a dark meat cut thigh. Not here! It was a juicy white cut. The crust was perfect! The hash brown balls were yummmmmy! We all enjoyed those.  Overall, great atmosphere, great service, great food! We definitely will be back!"

                "description": "An amazing experience with awesome tasty food. I may not be an Italian food expert but all I tasted was freshness, bold flavors, and great tasting meats.   The charcuterie board has figs, different types of meats such as salami and prosciutto. The char bread is awesome, nice char, mix of oils, and the crunch really helps break up the saltiness from the meats. The white looking sauce is actually cheese spread, I wasn't too much of a fan but it was ok. The best part of the board was the little Italian almonds, soft and firm yet nice crispy shell.   The beef carpaccio is yummy, tasty, and just look at the dish? You eat with your eyes and the dish appeals to your vision. Must try.   The zucchini chips are additive, nice crispy, salty, chips, a bit too oily but it's what is expected, very nice house chips.  The spaghetti and meatball dish is good but I wasn't blown away, I had a better elsewhere. The spaghetti tasted a bit too Al dente, too firm, just missing flavor. I would of spun the spaghetti in olive oil, salt, and black pepper then placed the sauce on top. Sprinkling parmesan cheese helps,"

                "description": "I'm literally sad to give just one star to this location, my family loves this place but our experiences were pretty bad every time. First time we came, the bartenders were rude from the start for no reason at all. We got our usual drinks - Sicilian margarita and ginger blossom margarita. First one was fine but ginger was overly sweet, we asked to change the drink and the lady just refused saying that's how it should taste like. Once again, we go to north italia a lot and we never had a drink as sweet as ginger blossom at this location. Fried calamari were greasy and chicken pesto - super salty. Another time we came , it was slow - bar was pretty empty, the bartenders were ignoring us and chatting with coworkers - service was just poor. We ordered a take out once and salmon came out raw, when we asked for well done. There was wrong dressing and no utensils in the bag.  Why we keep coming back you ask? My husband loves the place, or loved actually, so we were thinking it was that one time of bad service but it just kept continuing.  So, I wouldn't recommend this location to anyone"

                "description": "Make reservations in advance! This place is always packed and when we arrived today the waiting time was about 1h. Luckily, I had made reservations in advance. Family decided to order the zuca chips and meatballs for apps, unfortunately none of their apps are gluten free! This was just a huge let down. They loved the zuca chips and none of them enjoys zucchini...funfact. The meatball in my own daughter's word were very soft and flavorful, the cheese just makes it perfect.  For mains we had chicken parm and bolognese. You can't go wrong with bolognese, if you're in doubt if a restaurant is good just order that and you will see. They gf pasta was perfect! The sauce was amazing! Very Italian style with the some fennel flavor! The sauce was great! Not very acid and would adhere to the rotini pasta perfectly!  My girls had the chicken parm and they said it was amazing! Chicken was still moist with a perfect crispy crust with cheese perfectly melted. The pasta was also good with some white sauce. Neither of them could finish their plates which means dinner is guaranteed for the teens!"

My partner and I love Italian food and have been searching for the best gnocchi, unfortunately they didn't have any. The waiter was really nice and polite and mentioned how everything is made from scratch. Although I trust her, the food was average. It tasted straight from a pasta sauce can. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good, in exception of the bread! Would go again but just for the bread."

Not a bad 20 minute wait for a Thursday night. Our server was fabulous an gave us great recommendations. We had the classic board an everything was perfectly balanced with the great bottle of Cabernet we choose. Server was attentive glasses were kept full. We split the Pig pizza. Sausage was spicy an pizza was overall very good. Restrooms before our walk back to our hotel left us both grossed out an nauseous the urinal smell was just horrid we will skip that next visit. For such a nice place to eat I was a bit to shocked."

                "description": "Wanted an Italian dinner the first night we were in Austin. Found this place about a mile from the hotel and take a chance. Pretty busy but it was Friday night around 6-7pm. Had about a 45 minute wait however we were able to sneak into a table around the bar (first come first serve).  Wife got the chicken parmigiana. Probably the best option on the menu. Crunchy chicken with great sauce and amazing noodles on the side. She also tried the bread as an app. Very crispy and fresh.  I got the Caesar salad because I wanted something lighter. Not bad but it's a salad. Also got the meatballs. Pretty delicious.  Server was very nice and we had a great time. The domain area was very fancy with plenty of shops and stores to roam around in. Worth the visit."

Cappuccino: I had asked to make it with whole milk, but still it was watery and just okay, they give it so much, asked for stevia, but they don't carry it:(  Farmers scramble: it's scrambled egg with veggies, and comes with a side of crispy potatoes and a toast. I had requested to make eggs spicy if possible, but it was super bland, other than salt, no other seasoning whatsoever, when I got my food, nothing was hot, not even warm, it was room temperature, so potatoes were not crispy, but taste was good, toast tasted good too, it would've tasted good, if it was atleast warm.  Our server was nice and helpful!!"

I like this place because the bathrooms are decent for a bar, they have live music, there is a ring/hook game, and they serve cider.  Upstairs the other night they were having a comedy show which we sadly had to miss due to having other plans that evening. I believe they are doing more events up there but haven't been since during reopening after covid."

                "description": "TLDR: Matt and Steve saved our Bachelor/Bachelorette party from complete ruin on Labor Day weekend. We owe them a great deal of gratitude for the UNFORGETTABLE, FIRST-CLASS EXPERIENCE in Austin!   I happened upon this bar when my friends and I were walking around downtown Austin for a combined Bachelor/Bachelorette party. From first glance, it seemed like a typical Austin bar. Later in the night, our party was moved from the roof top bar we booked at the Marriot Hotel to the crowded hotel lobby due to a severe thunder storm. Needless to say, our large party of 30+ was broken up between random groups of party goers, diminishing the original experience.   It was recon mode time! I called every available open bar in Austin to see if they were able to help our rowdy group. Denial after denial, only ONE bar was able to step up to the challenge: San Jac Saloon!! Matt was updating me prior to our arrival. He was friendly, respectful, and accommodating. When I first arrived at the bar, I was so excited to see the large space with a full bar and lounge area. I couldn't have asked for more! The party goers AND bride and groom were VERY impressed with everything San Jac Saloon provided in ways of atmosphere, drink variety, and ability to have a safe, fun celebration.  Steve was our outstanding bartender; he livened up the night with his humor and antics! It was such a wonderful experience that words cannot fully describe the sincere gratitude we owe to Matt and Steve!!   If you want to support an authentic, passionate, and all around AMAZING bar, please support San Jac Saloon. I'd like to think we got a nice, hearty slice of southern hospitality as guests and I would 100% go back again for more.   My sincerest Thank Yous to Matt and Steve! You two are superheroes."

The band this past weekend was by far the best they had yet. Super interactive with the crowd, the place was packed. Drinks are cheap compared to other bars in Austin. It's definitely a dive bar but a great one. They take song requests which we love!! You'll find both younger and older crowd here. Good mix."

There is a speakeasy type quiter spot on one of the higher floors if you dont want live music. Either ways a great spot to have fun in Austin. Must visit."

After unexpected lightning forced us to leave our original outdoor venue, Matt and his team were extremely helpful and provided us at the last minute with a private upstairs part of the bar to host our event. Even with very short notice, Steve the bartender gave us great service and ensured everyone was having a blast. Great drinks and great people in a fun space, I'd absolutely recommend stopping by!"

                "description": "The music was good and that's why I dropped in one evening a week and a half ago. However, they have this angry Irish bartender that was picking fights with several customers. Additionally, he sat at the end of the bar ignoring customers while he visited with friends. He complained when the customers gave him smaller tips and was rude the entire evening. You couldn't say anything without him yelling at or arguing with you. Not sure if this is the vibe the place is going for, but I will not be returning. I also spoke with a few of my local friends and family about my experience and they will be avoiding the place as well."

                "description": "This place is amazing! So we heard Jared was part owner and so we stopped by. We went earlier in the day  and we had a puppy with us. We met this amazing man with a beard (We think Brian?) he was so welcoming! He had us take a group photo AND he let us bring our puppy inside. I bought a couple shirts and we weren't planning on returning for the night since we had a reservation at FBBC at 6:00 PM. However unfortunately our two transgender friends had a bad time... It's a long story and we left a review on their page hopefully to fix the issue but we were so upset from the bad experience. So we told ourselves hey! Let's go back to San Jac they made us all feel so welcome and Jared and the other owner know how to run a bar. ID checks TOOK 2 SECONDS FOR EVERYONE We went back inside and the process was easy and we went back inside and walked upstairs. We spent 70 dollars on an Uber just to come back!! Brian was gone which made us sad because we wanted to tell him how absolutely incredible he is. But we met this very nice Irish man upstairs and he was incredible! He fist bumped one of us and we handed him a tip and man he was such a gem. The music in both areas was rockin and we felt so welcomed and at home at this bar. You see... we had some charity shirts for Jensen and Jared because I run an organization called Castiel's Angels and they needed updated t-shirts with their new television roles and charity organizations. We were told by Brian to bring them to brewery but after what happened we were like ... no let's bring it to San Jac. They took the shirts and we are confident Jared will get them without an issue. We will be back when we come back to Texas. We are originally from Nevada, Oklahoma, and California and this road trip was supposed to be special. San Jac made up for our trip and we were treated with such respect! Best bar ever!!!"

Full bar with open seating even a higher level with tables overlooking the live band area. The band played remixes of songs with a southern touch. There is a small dance area filled with energetic people!  The drinks are average priced with beers on tap.  Definitely had a good time and would surely return!!"

                "description": "ordered: -burrata -steak frites  the burrata is more or less standard fare-- about what you'd expect. but the rest of the dish are what elevate it. the burrata is nestled in a bed of spring mix with a bright green pesto topped and confited tomato. the dish is served with thickly sliced and buttered bread that the menu calls focaccia. aside from the rosemary in the bread, it was much thicker and fluffier than any focaccia i'd had before-- reminiscent of a texas toast. the sunflower pesto was a pleasant surprise. the sunflower stood in nicely for pine nut and was a nice textural foil to the burrata by adding a subtle crunch that is not typical of pesto. while still rich, the sunflower made the pesto a bit lighter than your standard pesto--which again paired nicely with the richness of the burrata.   the hanger steak was well seasoned and had a nice crust on it. the flavor of the meat itself was buttery with a very even gradient of pinkness throughout. the fries however were nothing special. the flavor of the tallow wasn't especially noticeable and i noticed the size and shape each fry was cut to was uneven-- though this didn't seem to affect the texture of the product much."

                "description": "I really wanted to like this restaurant. There seems to be mix reviews here on Yelp. BUT from my own experience, it was awful. The service was good and the servers were super nice. Unfortunately, this particular evening I got food poisoning from whatever I ate.   Mocktails - 5/5  Starters:  Crispy Brussels Sprouts - 1/5 Odd Bits - 1/5  Pasta:  Bigoli alla Carbonara - 4/5  Meats and Mains:  Wagyu Coulotte - 1/5 Wagyu Bavette - 1/5 Sirloin - 4/5  Sides:  Charred Broccolini - 1/5  The servers and service was fantastic. The mocktail they came up with was super tasty. Their pasta was really good. That's where the positives end. Both Wagyu steaks were way under cooked and raw. Very little flavor and not a good Wagyu at all. The odd bits I ordered, were chicken hearts. I'm going out on a limb, and thinking since they were also under cooked, that's where I went wrong. The sides were not good at all. Bland, flavorless.  I left the restaurant and headed home, not knowing the fresh hell that awaits me on my trip there. Within 10 minutes on the road, I was forced to pull over on the side of 290, projectile vomiting for almost an hour. I felt absolutely terrible for about two days. Sad, I really wanted to try this place."

The spinach and mushrooms were well seasoned and delicious.  The Caesar salad was amazing. The dressing was delicious and the chicken on top was perfectly grilled. The flavor tasted like it has been brined for a while--perfectly salty and tender.  The brown butter cake was not very good and the fries were just alright.  Overall, food: 4.5/5 Service: 4/5  Very pricey but you pay for high quality ingredients."

                "description": "I was seriously disappointed by my experience here at salt and time which had been highly recommended to me by a friend. They missed pretty much every mark in terms of a good dinner experience. Let me elaborate.  We got there an hour before closing around 8pm, and were going to try to get in and out quick and didn't want to make them stay too late after closing. Well, we didn't have a choice because right off the bat we had to wait for menus for probably five minutes, waited another 10 for the waiter to come take our order, and when we finally placed our order probably 20 minutes had gone by so we put our whole order in at once.  We ordered the little gem Caesar-type salad, a ribeye (MR) and Teres Major (mr).  We waited (literally) 45 minutes for our salad!!! Waiter kept telling us it was coming and at the 40-min mark he asked \"you guys still haven't gotten your salad?\" Seriously!!!? It's your job to bring it to us and we've asked you about it three times now!  Keep in mind the restaurant was nearly empty by now. When we finally got it there was minimal apology and he seemed very nonchalant like it wasn't a big deal and turns out it wasn't even little gems. I grow little gems and serve them at the restaurant where I work and was super excited for them but this was just a regular iceberg wedge. After 1.5hrs of waiting at this point, steaks came out. Sauces were all wrong and not what we ordered and my steak was over cooked! Clearly medium and not medium rare since my partners was cooked correctly, there was an obvious difference. But at this point, being checked on by our waiter was a ten minute affair so we just shut up and ate it because it was getting late. There were no apologies, no comps, and the waiter kept trying to push us on dessert when we clearly were ready to leave. Dropped the check and proceeded to say \"there's no rush!\" ... yeah no sh*t I can tell that's definitely a motto here. And on top of that there was automatic 20% gratuity. I usually don't mind that, because most restaurant that do auto-grat have good service where I would've tipped 20% anyways. but it should not be a motivator for the servers to not give a crap about their tables like it is here.   The steaks tasted good but for the price, the horrible service and the inability to get orders right, this place was a total wash. You can get better steaks elsewhere for a cheaper price, where you actually enjoy your dining experience. Maybe in the future if they got new staff or management this place could be a really nice restaurant but for now, I can't recommend it."

                "description": "Came here on a burger recommendation. It was a nice little place for brunch. I don't if I was just bad at finding it, but apparently they only have the brunch and dinner menu on the weekend. The lunch menu is only offered on weekdays so if you're wanting to come here for the lunch menu on the weekend, you are out of luck.   But their brunch menu still does offer a burger, the Butcher's Breakfast burger to be exact. It's pretty much the normal Butcher burger but with eggs and bacon added on, and i think cheaper too. I got it medium and it was a nice, hearty burger. It was a juicy, steak-y patty and the brioche bun was quite soft. I probably should've just taken the bacon and eggs out and eaten it separately though. It got a little to big for me.   Beef fat fries are a must try though. Nice soft potato filling, with a slight crisp. I might be wrong, but I tasted a hint of cinnamon and it had a quiet deep fried donut flavor that I am all too familiar with. Very addicting.   Came here on a 1PM Saturday and there was no wait, but I do here it does get crazy busy during dinner times so make sure you have a reservation. Our server was really sweet. The place overall had a calm and chill atmosphere and felt very clean."

                "description": "Best burger in town without a doubt. My friend was singing it's praises for a while and so a group of us showed up all ordering it. Go figure. But it lives up to the hype for sure. It's basically made from trimmings from the butcher shop, so it's ground pretty fresh, seasoned well and honestly tastes almost steak like from the cuts, so highly recommend medium rare or medium on the burger. It's also massive, so no chance you'll leave hungry. Some fresh veg and a nicely toasted bun round off the sandwich. I would also recommend adding some bacon at least to your burger, as it's crisp contrast and who doesn't like bacon.  As if that's not enough, the sides there are also A+. The beef fat fries have a lot of flavor, but also thick enough that you can appreciate the pillowy potato inside. The what I assume house made ketchup adds some needed acidity to all the food but jives well with everything. The shishito pepper app is also really good if you can tolerate a little bit of burn.  Service is a bit on the slow side at the restaurant, so I would definitely recommend getting a reservation if you can but also being patient and just enjoy the decor and conversations with people. The appetizers came out same time as the food too, so waiting an hour for food at 1pm on a Monday afternoon sounds a bit long, but good thing we had good company at least."

                "description": "This was my second time at Salt and Time. I figured that if I picked a non peak hour reservation I would have a better experience that the first time but I was wrong. We ordered the burrata to share since it was one of the things that I tried to order last time I was there but they did had ran out. I ordered the steak and frites and a glass of Pinot Noir. The entrees came out but the burrata was nowhere in sight. We asked the server and he said he had forgotten but would put the order in and comp it. Not ideal, but we were looking forward to it and said okay. The hanger steak was inconsistently cooked (some parts were medium, others medium rare and there was a tiny part that was definitely rare). I did not mind cause it was delicious anyway. The showstopper was the chimichurri... very bold flavors. The burrata was worth the wait although I would have still preferred it as a starter. When we got the check, we noticed we were charged $2 extra for each one of my husband's beers. We let the server know and he promptly took care of it. However, another employee (perhaps the manager) seemed upset about it and kept saying pretty close to our table that the price for the beer should be $10 instead of $8 like it says on the menu and that he had requested that correction in the menus he had printed. I understand they should have been corrected to reflect the price increase but that is in no way our fault. Good meal though, but wish we had gone somewhere else."

The reviews don't lie. GET THE BURGER. Oh and the fries were bomb too.   My wife got the BBLT (beef bacon), and I have to say, it was the best BLT I've ever had. On top of favor, the portion was ginormous. Though, it didn't hold up as well as a leftover.   All in all, highly highly recommend, especially once they open dine in. The patio seating is nice but way too hot during the summer"

                "description": "Pretty miserable experience. There were at least 5 open tables when we sat down so they were not busy. It took 10 minutes for the waitress to give us a menu and immediately ask for our drink orders. 20 minutes later we get them. We've been here for 30 minutes and haven't gotten to place our order yet.   I order the $52 filet as did my friend. I ordered mine medium rare, he ordered his medium. His looked well done but he likes his meat well done so he didn't care. Mine however was completely raw on the inside. Not \"cooked rare\" raw. This thing was seared for maybe 10 seconds. It was also very tough. The waitress just dropped off our food and we were waiting for steak knives for 10 minutes until I walked to the hostess and asked for them.   I sent the steak back and it took at least 25 minutes to get it back. At this point so did not want to pay $52 for a reheated steak so I asked another waitress to grab me a burger instead so I could get the hell out of here. They come back with my steak, which was missing a piece, that had clearly been thrown into an oven or microwave to increase the internal temperature.   If you're coming here expecting an artisan or holistic steakhouse experience, go somewhere else. If you're looking for some $15 cocktails to drink in a gentrified strip mall butcher shop, this is the place for you!   My experience was so bad that I considered contacting my credit card for a refund. It was that bad."

First and foremost the Beef Tartare is probably one of the best beef tartares I have ever eaten in my life - the mix of flavor was just incredible, and the steak was perfectly diced! I could eat this everyday. Absolutely superb.  We also got the Cesar salad to start which was another hit. For the main we shared the Wagyu NY Strip, side of fries and broccolini, and the sweet corn agnolotti. My ONLY complaint was that there wasn't a larger portion of the agnolotti, delicious stuffed pillows of creamy sweet corn. Service was friendly and hospitable, will definitely be back!"

                "description": "Went here last night and it was the best dinner I've had in a while.  I was a little hesitant based off other's reviews regarding how slow the service was.  This was definitely not my experience.  Our server was awesome and the food was amazing.  We ordered the charcuterie + cheese board, carpaccio, salads, pasta and steak.  The steak was well worth it- I could use my butter knife to cut it.  Also, I love that you can buy groceries and products there too at the butcher shop which is connected to the restaurant!"

                "description": "Salt and Time, in east Austin, is a wonderful butcher shop, as well as a great restaurant.  Covid brought the addition of the upscale butcher shop, complete with many house-made items, terrines and fine meats...very impressive selections.   During Covid they also expanded into a new patio for dining, complete with large overhead fans, which made a very pleasant setting on a warm evening.   My daughter and I enjoyed a really great Charcuterie Board, that included 4 wonderful house-made meats, accoutrements and sauces. We shared it and both loved it.  We also shared their absolutely delicious Butcher Burger, made from steak trimmings. It was cooked perfectly and served on a brioche bun with all the trimmings, and the best French fries we've had in a long time.    We will definitely return to this east side neighborhood gem!!"

                "description": "Brunch today allowed me to check another big name off my list. I heard their Butcher's Burger is the best in Austin, so with nothing else calling to me off the menu, I had to try it. It was ok, I think? It was so tall and hard to eat that it was hard to really process and appreciate the flavor. They cooked it right, but the runny egg made the bun slide everywhere and mayo seemed like overkill. The Beef Fat Fries were pretty good, but not so good that I felt compelled to eat the whole serving. My favorite thing was the Charcuterie Plate that we split before the meal, especially the summer sausage, mortadella, and unidentifiable pink pickles. My friends loved their Steak and Eggs. I tried a bite of a friend's French Toast and would have gladly eaten more! While we were waiting for our food, browsing the butcher shop was interesting, and I liked seeing what products exist even if I wasn't in the market to buy anything. Service was attentive. I'm already planning on coming back again sometime because I know other carnivorous friends will love it. But now it's time for an afternoon nap!"

                "description": "This place has been serving the city for decades, and I find myself in every once in a while to watch a ballgame or two. NFL Sundays are really busy, so plan accordingly if you want to come then. It's more or less a KC Chiefs bar, but everyone is welcome. I prefer the upstairs part of the bar, but there's a huge downstairs and even some outside seating available.   The drink selection is alright, but I wish there were more draft beers for patrons. I do like the Zilker Parks and Recreation whenever I come in because it has that crisp taste of a good Pilsner. I even found it at Spec's after I tried it here. I also like the Electric Jellyfish IPA, which has a high alcohol content and it is a good drink if you want a little more \"party\" taste. I just wish they had more good beer on tap... oh well.  The food here is alright. I had some fried pickles the first time I came in, which weren't the best but good for a snack. They also have pizza, which I never had but may go for it next time. I never really have food when I come here, but maybe I should indulge in some dinner in the future.   I love coming here to watch ballgames and just to hang out in general. Trivia on Wednesdays from 7-9 if you ever want to bring some friends to play, I love it!"

The upstairs was a little busy with groups, but after sitting at a table for a few mins, we were eventually able to grab a spot at the bar. There were 1-2 bartenders for the evening and they did the greatest job managing the busy bar. The red-headed guy bartender made me the most delicious drink with a pretty flower in it! It was pink and sweet and so tasty!  We also shared the hugest mozzarella sticks I've ever seen and they were DELICIOUS!! We also also got the potato skins (which are literally two giant twice-baked potatoes) and th pretzels with queso!"

The food is pretty standard bar food and there are plenty of beer and drink options. Also this is a Chiefs bar and gets busy during those games so keep that in mind because if they happen to be playing, it will be extra busy and hard to get a seat."

I showed up on a Saturday evening to catch a big soccer game and could barely find a spot at the bar to grab a beer and some food. The bartender was awesome and fun to talk to. The food was good and the beers were all local. I went with the longhorn Philly with tots as my side. The sandwich was filling and the tots were great.   I will define they be back"

                "description": "Cheddar Blanket burger FOR-EV-RRRRR!  I absolutely cannot handle how much cheese comes on this burger sometimes but if it means losing the (hamburger) buns then so be it!  I need it to get in my belly as fast as possible!!!!!  Been coming to The Tavern since I was a student at UT in 2001.  This place is THE BEST PLACE to come watch futbol (soccer) games, UT games, NBA games, and all other games under the earth's sun.  There is plenty of room for you and your friends and family to watch the games, eat, and drink here.  One of the best places to be an avid sports goer as the service, food, and overall ambience is super welcoming.   Recently I brought my family in from San Antonio to try some tasty burgers and have a couple of pints during a Sunday afternoon.  It was super tame downstairs but I saw dozens of people head upstairs for game watching. My family really loved all the options on the menu and first thing out of their mouth was \"It is super laid back here\" and they enjoyed it.  Everywhere else we went we drove right past people standing outside waiting to get seated even after brunch hours!   Parking is located across the street and isn't too bad during lunch times.  If there is a serious or big game going on you might have some trouble finding a good spot but there are nearby garages around the corner and/or paid parking.   Love the new clear dividers between booths and seating now as it made me feel really comfortable now that masks are not mandatory."

This is a chiefs backer bar so if you are a fan it's a great vibe to watch the game and they have the sound on. The bartender let us order the sampler app as they have a limited menu on Sunday for the games! Got some beer and then right before the half we ordered burgers and they didn't come out at all. We reminded our bartender and she said the kitchen lost the ticket, she then went missing and someone tried to give us a burger we didn't order almost 40 minutes later. The kitchen closes at 10 and we still didn't have our food so we asked for our check and left because we were starving after waiting almost a hour and 20 mins for our burger."

I was over on this side of town thrift shopping, then decided to blow my careful thrift shopping budget by overpaying for yet another dinner out. I was expecting an older bar to have an older clientele, but it was surprisingly full of college kids. I guess we are closer to UT than I remembered. I ordered the Loaded Potato Skins. Potato Skins? More like a whole twice-baked potato! It was huge and yummy and pretty much worth it!"

Used to come here often because i lived down the street and i always felt like an inconvenience. still went because i liked the happy hour deals and the food was good.   tonight (easter) i placed a to-go order via yelp on grubhub. i'll admit that on a holiday it's probably wise to call ahead and make sure a place is open. but when yelp was giving me the option to place a pickup order, i went ahead and put one in-- i used to work in the restaurant industry and i know the business has the ability to cancel the order automatically if they have settings on to reflect that they are closed on certain days or hours.   my boyfriend went inside to pick up the order and unsurprisingly was given cold and inattentive service as always. best part is that he was told \"it's easter hours, we don't have an order for you.\" no special hours posted anywhere on the front or side door of the business, no half-assed apology, and there were still plenty of other folks inside being serviced.   i understand that i'll need to contact grubhub to get refunded for my order, but the lack of service is honestly so disappointing. i want to love and support a local legend in a city that i was born and raised in, but the tavern makes that really difficult."

It gets good ratings as a sports bar, and there were lots of tvs.  But the bar in uncomfortable, the space is drafty and cold, and the food is frankly bad american. The chicken sandwich recommended by the barkeep as her \"second favorite\" was pretty good fried chicken, ruined by drenching in Frank's hot sauce and raw onions.

However, now that I find that it's literally impossible to visit The Tavern, or at least to attempt to drive there in a motor vehicle, I'll likely never patronize the place again.  Parking has become a challenge in recent years in Austin, but after trying in vain to find an available space at 4:00 on a Saturday afternoon for drinks and an early dinner/late lunch at my once-favorite watering hole, I'm certain that I'll never put myself through that frustration again."

                "description": "Don't expect covid protections here. It's a no frills pool hall in Texas. Nobody in the establishment is wearing a mask, including the bartenders and waiters. If that's not a problem for you, then you're in for a good time.   We came in on a Tuesday night and easily found a pool table to ourselves. We opened a tab and had no trouble getting drinks without having to leave our games. The mixed drinks are nothing to write home about, but we had an excellent time drinking and playing pool. We also easily played some table shuffle board. They have computer slots/keno games to gamble with in a shady corner is that's something you're into.   The place was acceptably clean and the staff were all very friendly. Just make sure you have a VALID drivers license regardless of your age! This was place was a good time and I'll definitely be back again in the future."

                "description": "Came in on a Thursday, some aggressive lady with glasses and bun, answers the door with \"Do y'all have ID's?\" We said yea and showed ours, then she says \"So then talk to this dude at the door\"... I walk in and there's a table with some merchandise on it and this little man, asked if we were there for the event? I said \"we didn't know there was an event\" and then he said it was $25 per person... well we didn't know, we just came for a drink and some parents night out. So I said sorry and we excused ourselves and then this same lady at the front was smoking outside so I said \"Sorry, we didn't know it was an event\" and she snarkily says \"Yeah! it's dwarf wrestling!\" Like I should be ashamed of not knowing this. I feel stupid, my bad.... But maybe next time have a sign on the door! We read the entire door and no sign about this, a cover of $10-15 we would pay but we didn't want to do $25 per person, since we had not  arrived for the event. I think if you have an event, try being a bit nicer. Some people are not regulars and just want to come over and you could sell it a bit, instead of making us feel bad for not know about your poorly advertised event.  I still like this bar and I like that people can smoke in doors (although I'm not a smoker) we have enough bars we can go too and this one is for smokers, so I don't have an issue and I know what I'll smell like when I leave."

When I got home everything smelled like cigarettes. This is completely illegal and just downright nasty. Everybody knows secondhand cigarette smoke is really bad for you so open up a flipping window if you're gonna let people smoke. If you're too lazy to go outdoors to smoke then this place should be regulated by the health department better, this isn't your house, and no one saying you can't do something but it's just nasty and it's really bad for your health right now my throat is on fire because I've been breathing secondhand smoke I don't wanna sound like a whiner or entitled millennial but it secondhand smoke dude and it's nasty."

                "description": "Shooters been a great home for me for 14 years, it has been like my Cheers bar, after a stressful day of work, on my way home I stop in, staff is always friendly, I love the entertainment offered, Golden Tee, pool, sweepstakes, karaoke, bands on weekends. Staff has always been good to me over the years, and have been like family, met many current friends because of Shooters. Never a cover, and probably the best drink prices of any bar.  This place has great potential, but they need to make the best of some of its best assets, especially the use that beautiful patio more for events, music, etc. You should have a solo acoustic artist out there in spring/summer/fall and promote some games on the patio, it just seems as it's used as wasted space currently, and that's a shame."

                "description": "Stopped by with others for a quick pop as we were beered out from Whitestone's delicious Oktoberfest beer. Bartender was patient with us as we pondered our last cocktail of the day. Notice I said day not evening. We settled on shots (why not??!!). We all received generous pours at a reasonable price.   Shooters is a great sports bar with multiple TVS (they do have the NFL ticket). There are plenty of pool tables and games to keep you occupied. I would definitely come here to watch games but the cigarette smoke stench is too much for me, and I'm a cigar smoker. We visited for about 10 minutes and my clothes stunk of smoke. I wish they would go smokeless like their other venue on 620 or at least add some additional smoke eaters. If you are a smoker it is a 5 star joint... for others 3 makes it AOK and a fair rating."

There was only 2 of us. There's nothing posted about this. We were tipping the bartenders as we ordered. So on top of the $32 in tips we gave, we were forced to pay another $23 on our bill. They should have a notice if you plan on keeping your tab open, a gratuity is automatically added. Even for a party of 2. Ridiculous"

They offer a bar with ample seating, plenty of individual tables for seating, several pool tables, have a stage (that was empty when we visited), have an outdoor patio and an add collection of gambling machines in the back corner.  I am sure it is not real gambling, but the game players certainly looked like they were in Vegas.  Prices are reasonable.  Would not come out of my way to come here, but it is a decent dive bar."

                "description": "Tipster Tours is a must do if you are visiting Austin for the first time (they also offer a tour in San Antonio's downtown if you also visit during your trip since it is only 90 minutes away from Austin). There are 5 tours available to choose from (some require a minimum of a group of 6 though) and are free! This walking tour allows for you to give any tip that you want after it is done. You are under no obligation to tip anything, but it would be nice for the tour guide to get something from you.   During our visit, we only went to the downtown tour, where you meet outside of the state capitol. My husband wanted to check out another tour but during our visit, it was raining and I just didn't want to walk in light rain and mud (yeah I'm a sore sport). For most tours, you just show up at the location. There is no need to RSVP (you can see the dates and time available on the company's website).  For our tour (about 90 minutes), we had Laura as our tour guide. Because this tour is all outside, we brought our little girl dog (she told us this was her first time having a dog on her tour). For this tour, it leaves the capitol, heads to the small park across the street, then to the governor's mansion (where you will most likely see either the governor's golden retriever, Pancake or their newly adopted little puppy golden retriever), various murals, other historical places and ends at the Driskill Hotel.   We learned so many things on this tour, the 3 of us enjoyed it (I am sure my little girl was happy to mark her territory as we walked along) and would highly recommend this tour. The walking is pretty easy and so most should be able to be fine."

However, being \"Tip\"-ster, they are appreciative of tips and in the FAQ suggest $15-$25 per person per tour. Over a 2 day period, we took 3 tours...Music, Downtown and Eastside Arts. Each tour was 1 1/2 hours. Laura was very knowledgeable and was easily heard and understood. Questions were welcomed and answered. At the end of each tour, we were given information on what we could do next. Check the website before you go, as the time had changed from the week before when I planned. The time change was bolded, so easily found. Highly recommend these tours. Since we were on a \"stay\"-cation, we may do the others they offer soon!"

Newly unveiled in October, this company allows participants to \"pay\" for their tour once its completed by tipping their tour guide. This is a fantastic idea because it practically ensures you'll get a fun and informative tour.   Joey, our guide, was very friendly and knew his Austin history. He delivered his facts and info with wit and humor which kept everyone attentive and entertained. I highly recommend him if it's possible to request a guide.

Had a friend in town to visit a few weeks ago and we did the Downtown tour, then returned yesterday with my sister for the East Side Art tour. I have to be honest and say that I didn't anticipate enjoying the art tour (art isn't usually my thing), but it was super fun and informative. Both tours were great and completely worth the time and money. Love the idea that you pay what you can afford in order to bring tours to people who wouldn't otherwise be able to participate. I definitely plan on making my way back to take the other tours!"

Korie was informative and friendly and helped with suggestions of places to go after the tour. Now I want to sign up for more of the Tipster tours so that I can learn more about the city I've lived in for 20 years!! So whether you're an Austin native or just visiting, I'd suggest making time to tour the city with Tipster."

                "description": "We had such a great time on this tour!  We did the Austin Music Tour and had a nice time with our guide Laura!  She took us to some cool places and it was fun to learn what the venues once were and how they came to be what they are today.  My boyfriend wrote down some places and we visited them later that night.  Walking tours are such a great way to explore a new city and I love the idea of tipsters- pay at then end what you think the tour is worth.  I also feel that Laura took the time to create a great tour and was very passionate about her Austin music!"

As a bachelorette \"day party,\" we gathered together and hopped in the super roomy and comfortable All About Central Texas SUV and headed out on our journey.   Kim is extremely knowledgeable about each winery; the history, the best wines to try, the \"wine club\" or other bonus things each winery has.   We stopped in on 3 different wineries and Kim had made superb choices in each spot; from the wines to the view to the suggestions on what to try and how to make the most of our samples so everyone could try as many as possible (thanks for that tip, Kim!).   Be it an afternoon with a group of friends, or a romantic day for two, All About Central Texas is an outstanding choice.  Thanks for everything, Kim!"

I did the Fredericksburg tour and based on my wine preferences she had some great suggestions on which ones to stop in, there are so many! I even joined a wine club, the tastings were informative and she is just a lot of fun and I didn't have to worry about driving or directions and could enjoy the pours and some snacks.  I highly recommend All abt Central Texas tours, they are personable, you can really get to meet the others in these small groups- Thanks so much!"

                "description": "Horrible service. I'm staying at Hilton and wanted to try this place since it's inside the hotel. A couple of days ago, I wanted to place a to go order for breakfast. I called countless times for over two hours (no joke) and was either placed on hold or sent to voicemail but no one ever assisted in placing my order. So that day was shot and I went elsewhere.   I tried placing another to go order this morning and called over 40 times, literally! But once again no luck. So I decided to stop by in person on my way to work. (If you're wondering why i kept trying it's bc the hotel offered food credit to be used at the restaurant.) I advised the male host that I attempted to call and even showed him the call history on my phone and that no one ever answered the phone. He claimed he just arrived at work and couldn't explain why there was no answer. He was not sympathetic one bit. I proceeded to place an a order for the açaí bowl to which he responded that they couldn't serve it since it was no longer breakfast time. Mind you, I had attempted to place my order by calling before breakfast ended and I wanted to show him my call history before 11:00 am but he could have cared less. So I proceeded to ask for the manager. (My apologizes for acting like a \"Karen\" here but I felt justified.)   While waiting for the manager, I dialed the restaurant again to test if they would answer since the restaurant was not busy. The phone is next to the host's stand where I was standing and I noticed that the calls were not being answered. The ringer was off but the phone would light up. The phone also reported 117 missed calls! Wth?! That's a lot of business they're losing from potential customers that want to place food orders.   Richard, the manager, just added fuel to the fire. I waited nearly ten minutes for him. When he finally surfaced from the back I explained the situation. He was very cold, not apologetic and just asked me if the açaí bowl was all I wanted. When I answered in the affirmative he said \"ok\" and walked off. Never said it'll be right out and never apologized. So rude and unprofessional and so disappointing coming from management.   I eventually received my order but not an apology.  The food prices are also excessive. Can get much better tacos at much lower prices elsewhere with much better customer service."

                "description": "SXSW beware.   I came yesterday for lunch. Carne asada tacos were great and the salsa was also great. The server was a middle aged white guy who was beyond nice.   So my punishment for coming back today is mediocre food, visibly smaller portions, and rude service from a young woman with braids uptwisted.   I asked for a sample of queso. They aren't even close to capacity. Walk up seating. The response was \"No.\". Not, I'm sorry we aren't allowed to sample. Just NO.   I kept looking at her with a blank stare and she said \"I'm serious. I would have to charge you to get anything from the kitchen!\"   Since I never asked for a FREE sample, I just looked at her and placed my order.   Chips and salsa. Overpriced at $14. And confit pig tacos $12.   Here's the thing. I came yesterday and got my salsa in white bowls served on the white plate.   Today someone decided since I was by myself I would get a half portion.   This is so fcuking ghetto. You're getting the same $14 it doesn't matter how many people are at the table.   At this point I'm pretty done. However the icing on the cake. I've been sitting here for 45 minutes. I finished my food. And this waitress hasn't once stopped to see if I need anything. AGAIN. The restaurant is at 50% capacity as to what it was yesterday when I got better service and better food.   I won't be back."

                "description": "As a long time Austinite I have a real problem paying for chips at a Tex/Mex place and this place wants $7(?!) for a bowl ($14 if you want salsa with that) But it's a taco restaurant in the touristy Hilton so I can't say I'm surprised.  I was working in the area and pressed for time so I thought I'd give it a try.  Having said that, their Confit Pig tacos were fine (great flavor and sauce) although the pork was a little tough and at $12 for 2 these are the cheapest tacos on the menu.  $19 Carne Asada Burrito? You must be joking. I probably won't be back.   They've got nothing on Torchy's, Tacodeli, Veracruz, or any of the multitude of great, inexpensive, and authentic taco trucks in town. The ubiquitous hipster logo says it all. Don't be a tourist!"

                "description": "Admittedly I came here on New Years Eve for some late night munchies before the countdown, not knowing this joint was part of the Hilton Hotel. That explains why the prices were slightly high when tacos are ubiquitous in Texas.   The fish taco was actually really good. I think they might have been a close tie for tacos I've had on my Texas trip. However the old school tacos were kind of boring and a little difficult to eat because they were getting soggy.  Our drinks were really good...but really sugary. It would be hard for a drink to taste bad with that much sugar. I would commend a bartender that can make a drink taste good/sophisticated without resorting to all that syrup. I felt like I was drinking candy syrup. This missed the mark for me in creativity or sophistication.  Would I recommend this place again? I'm unsure. If I stumbled upon here, I would definitely eat here again but I'm not sure I would go out of my way to eat here"

                "description": "Really enjoyed the food and drinks here on my recent trip to Austin. I haven't been to Austin in over 12 years so it was nice to get back downtown and see what's changed and what's not.  On a quiet Thursday night, stopped in to a relatively empty house.  Guessing given it was a weekday, on a rather chilly night for Austin, and with 6th street so close by - that's why it was so quiet.    To our benefit though, as we got great service.  My prickly pear margarita was perfectly balanced, great drink to end my night on.  For food, started with the guacamole, fried brussel sprouts, and for my main I got the al pastor tacos.  Let me tell you, those brussel sprouts are were it's at! They were perfect, the flavor was outstanding.  The soy glaze that's on top is delicious.  While the guacamole itself was great, the chips were a total let down.  For a taco joint, you'd think they'd fry up some fresh chips - these were sadly not - but good enough to get that guac to the mouth.  My al pastor tacos were pretty good, but I would have loved a little more char on the pork.  The pineapple was a refreshing topping, just enough not to be overwhelming.  Again, service was great, not too intrusive and at a good pace.  Def. look forward to coming back here when I return in March!"

A friend and I split a bunch of things off their bar snack menu. The deviled eggs with pickled mustard seeds and bacon were fine, but the mustard seed was a weird addition that managed to completely mask the bacon. The carnitas tacos were bland, couldn't taste the salsa verde. The Chimichurri tacos were better, the steak was nice, but again the flavor was mellow at best.   The tots absolutely stole the show though, this is what you should order. Tater tots covered in fried cheese curds, poblano gravy, and a sunny side up egg. This was hard to finish because of its density but is so good you'll put yourself through the pain to try!"

                "description": "Cool little place located a floor before the Hilton Austin mail lobby and across from the convention center.  Bad thing is they don't open till 4pm, good thing is they are open till midnight or later depending on the night.   Decent size full bar located in the back of the restaurant. Great selection of local craft beers and some that are local!  Then there are the tacos, they come out really really fast after you order them, bad thing is they come really fast after you order them .  They are lukewarm at best.  And rather tasteless, no seasoning or lack of.   Came here multiple times during a week stay at the Hilton, service at the bar was never an issue."

                "description": "When our first choice for dinner didn't pull through we were desperate to find a quick (we had less than an hour!) and tasty place to find dinner. It also needed to seat 7 of us... oh and it was a Saturday night.   That's a lot of requests, right?   Well lucky for us, Yelp found us Austin Taco Project. You would never know that this was inside the Hyatt hotel, but it is! And it's pretty darn cute.   It's divided into two sections - the bar and seated. Both of which will get you a waiter. We opted for the bar area and were super comfortable. Our waiter was amazing and everything you'd want in a waiter. Unfortunately his name escapes me, but he was pretty darn fabulous. Quick, efficient, even taking off a drink that never arrived (totally not his fault) yet still giving the drink to our friend in the end.   The tacos at this place were all over the map - and I like it like that! A little different, a little strange, but still familiar. I ordered the Umami Taco which was both vegan and gluten free (not that it matters to me) but I do love anything mushroom. The waiter indicated it was salty and suggested I add avocado to cut the salt. He was so right! I do love me some salty things but the avocado was exactly what was needed - and some lime!   I also ordered the deviled eggs . Why? Because I always order deviled eggs. And they didn't disappoint! A great treat on a hot day!   Cocktails were splendid and on point. And everything on the menu was a delight.   Definitely look to this spot for a quick cocktail and bite with friends!"

                "description": "My friends and I came here for dinner on our first night in Austin and had a decent meal. I had made a reservation in advance, but it wasn't super necessary as the restaurant wasn't crowded around 8pm.  To start, we all split an order of Tots (fried cheese curd, poblano gravy, and a sunny side egg) and the Elote (charred corn, chipotle aioli, queso fresco, cilantro). Both were super delicious, and far surpassed the tacos I ordered for my main meal. I got an order of the Umami Tofu (mushroom mix, fennel salad, and candied ginger). Having candied ginger on a taco was a super interesting experience, and honestly I'm not mad about it. Overall the tacos were decent but a little cold and incredibly oily.   I appreciate what Austin Taco Project is trying to do with unique taco creations, even if they don't always work out, but honestly my biggest complaint is about the slow service. Despite the restaurant being relatively empty and our waiter standing 15 feet away from our table for the majority of the night, he visited our table very infrequently to check on us.   Overall it's not a bad spot, but the food quality and service could definitely use some improvements."

                "description": "Parents, hubby and I landed here after a particularly harrowing travel day. We were eager to get our grub on and this place sounded nice so we trekked 5 minutes on foot to get here.  I was a little turned off by the host taking leading (?) us to the table, leaving the menus on the table and walking off without pausing to see us to our seats. He continued walking off without saying another word or a backward glance at us. It was like he went for a stroll, slowed down to leave some menus on a random table and went on his merry way. Mind you, the place was mostly empty so he wasn't like, rushing back to seat more people.  Anyway, our server came by in short order and took our order. To start, we ordered the onion dip, the ribs, deviled eggs and the elote. I definitely recommend the elote which was delicious and quickly devoured, followed by possibly the onion dip. It did double duty as saucing for the tacos (more on that later).  My parents enjoyed the ribs. I abstained.   As for the deviled eggs...I'm willing to allow may be it was just this batch but we're fairly confident this gave me the runs all night and some of the morning, too. I ate 75% of the dish while hubby ate the rest. He had diarrhea once that night.  Parents were fine because they didn't have any. In any case, they tasted a-ok, maybe a bit on the tangy side.   For mains, we shared some carne asada tacos (x4), brisket tacos (x4), carnitas (x2) and Eisben (x2).  The two types of beef tacos were just ok in our book, both leaning towards the dry side. The carne asada was a bit extra dry, hence why I decided to throw some onion dip on top. In contrast, the carnitas were really great as was the Eisben, also a pork-based taco.  For drinks, I ordered the sea foam paloma which didn't do it for me. Can't say why...I think I would just preferred a salt rim, I think.  Anyway, our server was nice and professional...got us our requests in short order so that was a plus. However, I don't think I would make this a repeat."

                "description": "Quickie Pickie is just an unassuming spot for a great experience - it's a combination of a small store, coffee shop, and mini-restaurant, and delivers on that combination in a great way. We initially stopped in after a nearby restaurant had a 1.5+ hour wait, and I'm really glad we did!  The staff at Quickie Pickie is super friendly, and quite helpful in making suggestions for coffees and tacos as well. The tacos are pretty decently sized, so I'd say 2-3 would be a good quantity for the average person. I personally got 3 and was stuffed by the end of them. There are a good amount of small tables inside and outside so it was fairly easy for us to nab a spot even at lunch on a weekend.  Overall, I'd definitely recommend checking out Quickie Pickie if you're in the area and looking for a bite to eat!"

The staff didn't seem to be too inviting, but they were quite busy stocking the shelves and tending to the store itself. The beers on tap were great and very affordable. The grocery items were all slightly expensive, but were quite diverse - tons of vegan and dairy free ice cream options if that's your thing. Can't wait to go back and try the tacos. I think this place is a great pre-game or before dinner drink option without any frills."

They have an incredible variety of national and international beers. I also appreciated the fact that they had a fridge where you could buy just a can. They also had a wide variety of red wines and non-alcoholic drinks. They provide free WiFi (password is winebeer) and have lots of seating inside and outside. This would be a great place to camp out with your computer and work offsite. There is a restaurant that serves hot food but you can also grab some quick refrigerated bites that are in a fridge on the right side of the place. I got the Waistline and it was pretty good, it was pretty dry. They serve their sandwiches with ruffle-style potato chips. I wouldn't come back for the sandwich but I do appreciate the beer variety!"

After placing my order along with the orders of my 3 family members, we took a seat and patiently anticipated the arrival of our food. After about 30 minutes I walked up to the cashier and asked about the food, he said he would ask about it.. Moments later the long haired man with the attitude called me back to the counter and handed me a bag of cold bagals and tacos \" I called this order like 3 times he snapped.\" (This I knew was untrue because I had 4 pairs of ears intently watching and listening for every single order that was placed.) Why he was so hostile, I cannot say. When I unbagged the food I noticed we were short a bagal. I went back to the man and asked for the bagal they had forgotten. He found the receipt which had no 'classic bagal' on it. Of course this meant nothing to me other than another mistake on their part and inconvenience for me. To my surprise he actually rung up an order for a classic bagal. \"That will be 6.50$\" I looked at him half shocked by what I was hearing. \"I don't have any intention of paying for that\" I replied. \"Ok well just get out then.\" He sneered. I understand it I hard to find good labor these days. But never have I been so appalled by any establishments customer service."

It is such an Austin spot. The inside is kind of like a bodega, but they have a working kitchen and coffee bar. We arrived 5min til 2PM when they switch to their afternoon menu. The girl behind the register told us to make a quick decision because once they put the breakfast stuff up they do not pull it out again even if you were in line. I ordered a bacon, egg, and cheese taco. This is my go to order when getting breakfast tacos. I had considered getting two, but I'm glad I didn't. Those things are loaded! I took advantage of the three different salsas that you can put on your tacos as well.  Our group sat outside on the front porch. It was nice and seclusive.

I felt like a kid in a candy store shopping through their aisles of ice cream, healthy frozen foods, health bars, different jerkies, wine, and kombucha! I was very tempted to blow a lot of money here, and I wouldn't have even felt bad because of how healthy everything is. The prices are pretty reasonable, so you can get quite a bit here. There was even lamb jerky in bar form and I'm now obsessed with Kosmic Kombucha, which is brewed right in Austin. Matcha Peachu is a cleverly named flavor and delicious! I was happily surprised to have found Bobo's bar since I found them on Instagram literally the night before.   The coffee was yummy and a lot of people seem to come here for brunch. The people here are incredibly sweet and represent Austin very positively. There's also a good amount of seating inside and outside, perfect for the absolutely beautiful day that it was."

                "description": "This time I figured the best way to evaluate them would he to try one of their staples, so I got a burger. Specifically, I got the \"Drunken Burger\" covered in queso. Their queso has beer in it, hence the name, which I thought made it taste funky. The burger patty was cooked to perfection. The bun was ok, better than some, and at least it was toasted. The pickles on the side also tasted funky but I couldn't tell if that was a sign they're \"higher end\" or cheaper than standard dill spears. My side of onion rings was the best part of the meal. Portions were huge and service was good."

                "description": "While we were charging our electric car in Austin, we were looking for a place that was close by to eat late at night on Monday. There were not a whole options in the specific area aside from burger joints and a Chili's. I stumbled upon this place on Yelp and I am glad I did. When you first walk in, it is very dark and gives you a dive bar feel, which is totally fine with me. After looking at the food menu, I wanted to try everything. We opted for the pear, fig and Brie pizza and the Ruben pizza. Both were probably some of the best pizzas we had had in a very long time. The bartender and the entire staff were very friendly, in fact a few people checked on us while we were sitting down. $5 doubles were a bonus. This place didn't disappoint."

First off, their mimosas are fire and I haven't found anywhere in the area who can make them nearly as good! Definitely better than most of the brunch places I go to expecting a killer mimosa.   Their prices are great and the food is pretty good. I dig their queso fries because the queso isn't thick, but I have seen reviews where people aren't the biggest fans. Their sandwiches are good and it's always a good time on sundays.   Everyone there is welcoming, no matter the team they're rooting for. Also, the reason they get five stars is because the service is amazing. They all work together and truly pay attention to the customer.   I advise anyone (eagles fan or not!) to check it out."

However it is a pretty interesting food option... they have some cool pizzas like the one with green chili's on it, or the bacon and pesto, and some other interesting combinations.   We were here for a movie premier... my wife friend was in a 21 min shirt film and this is where it was premiered. It was a cool deal!!  The place has s back room with a projection tv on 3 of the 4 walls. We got have some light food, got a free drink and watched the premier... it was pretty good!  The location is loud, lots of bar people, large outdoor seating area... like I said it is a bar with some interesting food.  Bartenders were fun, quick and on top of their game!   The event was well done.. photo both set out outside, kids dressed up to open doors... it was pretty cool!  Nicely done!!"

There is a group of hardcore cowboy fans that meet up on Sundays to watch the game organized by a guy named Dan (he's awesome).  The service was excellent. Room full of rowdy fans and our food/drinks were on point with flavor, price, and the time it took from ordering to receiving the food. Our waiter was great! Didn't catch his name, but he was fantastic.   I'm in love with Mister Tramps."

My friends also got lots of drinks and I didn't hear any complaints coming from them so....I think it's safe to say that it lives up to its reputation as a good pub/bar.   The entire location appears to be dedicated to a soccer team, but as a non-watcher, I can't really comment on that other than to say that they play multiple kinds of sports on the many tv screens, and they are always open to requests as well from what I've observed.   The staff is absolutely lovely and very good about checking in with you, getting orders correct, and being extra friendly. (Don't forget to tip your waitress/waiter!)   I've only ever been for the trivia, but I know they also offer stand-up and I'm sure they offer more on other nights of the week. Anyways, this is a cool place and I will definitely be a frequent attendee!"

They do offer some pretty decent standard bar fare: wings (they state they're \"oven roasted, never fried\" and I am totally perplexed at how they get that outer crispy goodness), burgers (not huge but good), pizza (especially after midnight - see tip below) would be in my top three. This dive-ish joint also has some of the friendliest staff around and a great beer selection with awesome prices - including some local craft selections: Infamous, Stash, Thirsty Goat and more - over a dozen different selections of craft on tap at any given time, plus all of their bottle selections and other libations. There is always a shot special board, so be sure to check that out if it's your thang.  And, if you Bleed Blue like me, you will be thrilled to know this is Cowboys country y'all!!! How 'bout them Cowboys?! Fans gather by the masses to Mister Tramps on game day...there's even an entire large viewing room with three HUGE projection screens that is curtained off by what else but Dallas Cowboys curtains (they support other teams as well; maybe more than one set of curtains?). If you want to partake in the fandemonium get there early to procure a seat at one of the many communal tables.    Overall: Yay, I'm a fan...I'll be divin' in again real soon! ;) Cheers!  Tip: Order a pitcher of beer after midnight and you can buy a pizza for a buck - yup, one dolla! Full menu available every day until 2am."

The place was very clean.   The food was very good.  I loved the garlic green beans, could easily of been the best part of the meal (if you like veggies... as I do).  The fish was tender and seemed fresh. Came with my favorite kind of fries... thick steak fries.  The pretzel was warm and very good, was the same as a perfect old fashion European pretzel.   The fried pickle slices were very enjoyable as well.   I absolutely loved the Redhead In Bed drink, a new favorite for sure.  The Bonkers Grapefruit Cucumber drink was a relaxing refreshing drink.    I do recommend this Irish Pub. I am giving it a 4 star only because it is like so many other pubs I have had the pleasure of visit."

I suppose for a younger crowd who cares nothing about actual Irish ambience , it's a great bar.  But personally I prefer a bit of Irish music as opposed to the rap that was being played .

The Mac and cheese was also very unremarkable which is very rare for me. Probably won't come back again."

It's usually sooo loud inside the bar area/on their patio so this is the happy middle ground and don't have to scream to hear your friend speak.  I've honestly never tried their food because I'm usually not in the mood for dive bar food, but can speak to how great their variety of beers is. My personal favorite is the victory sour monkey."

Our server was part of a family of servers we learned from the youngest server. She was the older sister that helped with our order. She recommended a beer my wider really enjoyed.   Our food was very well prepared and was on point.   My wife was overheating after we ate and we were trying to find our server who seemed to be on a break. We literally waited 15 minutes before going inside to see if we could fine her. It appears like she had 2 tables inside and must of lost track of us outside.   All in all it was a great lunch and we would have loved to give it 5 stars but paying should not be the hardest part of going out to lunch."

There's a terrific beer selection, a lot of different seating options, and a fun glass floor.   There are a lot good food choices here.  The pretzel is massive, fish and chips crispy and flaky, and classic burger always cooked to specification.  The fried pickles have a great batter and the Guinness brownie is thick and chewy and comes with creamy ice cream.  Service is generally spot on, and they have done well when I've come in with a group."

They even had the first half on for us just for them to turn it off when the second half, tied by the way, started. For a sports bar this was very disappointing and I don't recommend coming here for a big game whatsoever. We were stuck watching a postgame report over the last five minutes of a close, actually live basketball game. Ridiculous..."

Right from walking in it seems like this place gets really into soccer games, so I'm sure it'll be a hit when Austin FC starts playing.  Their draft selection is solid, even looking at their menu they have a good mix of several types of beers. Thought the bock type was a little funny, they also have sours, tripels, you name it.

Food tastes dry and overcooked (INCLUDING THE PRETZEL). Cocktail ingredients are not portioned correctly, so expect your cocktails to taste different from each other. Drinks can be compared to Dave and Busters, which is a yikes considering this is a pub/bar."

Tons of memories here with good friends, sitting outdoors drinking whiskey and smoking cigars, minus the cigars. The irish coffees to the wide selection of beers on tap, you'll never run out of new things to try. They've got a killer happy hour menu, if you catch them at the right time, you might be lucky enough to get the worlds biggest pretzel with cheese/honey mustard dip. It's like $5 and it's worth every cent. I love pretzels and this one ranks right up there at the top.   The outdoor section provides excellent seating for 'people watching', especially during the night when the Domain starts livening up with interesting sorts of people. Love Jack and Ginger's, one of the nicest bars in Austin."

                "description": "Starting with the positives, the beer selection was really excellent. I absolutely loved the Austin Eastciders cranberry cider, very refreshing and tart. My partner got the Sippin Pretty sour which was also delicious with some hints of guava. There were plenty of options for whatever kind of beer you like.   In terms of the food, that's were the stars got dropped. My shepherds pie was very ordinary, nothing special about it. The potatoes were pretty chunky and it felt pretty heavy with the cheese and sour cream. The salad was airplane quality, just some greens and tomatoes. This was also pretty overpriced even for the Domain, $16 for very average food.  The fish and chips was the superior entree. The fish was ginormous and crispy, albeit pretty greasy. Fries were sitting under the fish which made them go soft pretty quickly. The green beans were pretty crisp but it was so awkward to eat with the low quality plastic utensils. I understand it may be more sanitary to eat with during the pandemic, but they were those small, bendy, cheap utensils you get with takeout which made it pretty difficult to pick up the beans and fish.   Overall, go for the drinks and atmosphere. Plenty of TVs inside and in the patio and friendly servers. Skip the food!"

I do not live there though. They said they would mail it and I would send shipping. I said okay amazing I will even pay for the hours of the employee and tip etc. Then just crickets. Their phone number doesn't work first, no working voicemail. They respond every few weeks saying \"still waiting on tracking\" even though they claimed to have mailed it 3 weeks ago. So yea, someone stole it. I spoke with a Candace from their venture group and she assured me it was sent..but, never got it. Crazy. They blocked me from facebook even. Pretty wild."

Not only did it take nearly 30 minutes for it to be ready (while other patrons who ordered food after me got their food before me) but I finally got my food by the bartender rudely flinging it in front of me on the bar... and then walked away. No \"here you are\" or anything. In a hope to support a business during this time I would have expected a little courtesy. Let alone when you are operating at less capacity. Yikes, unfortunately next time I will be taking my late night orders from somewhere else.   I did add a star because there was a second bartender who was friendly to other patrons, but I had not interacted with her."

Immaculate floor displays, well organized, nice vibe. While we were there, several customers came in and made purchases.

The male barista that took our order was so rude and snooty that it really took away from the experience.  If there was a coffee shop that defined snooty, intimidating, and snobby this would be it.  He just stared as we tried to figure out what to order, and made us feel like we were more in his way than wanting to help us.  Aside from the service, the coffee itself was pretty disappointing.  We got: -Texas Teddy (do not recommend at all.  It tasted like iced creamer with a splash of cold brew) -Vanilla Latte (this was a pretty standard vanilla latte) -Nitro Cold Brew (basic cold brew)  There's way too many great coffee shops in Austin than to waste your time here.  Do not recommend."

However, it's definitely one of those forgettable coffee shops. I ordered my classic vanilla iced latte, and I had one sip and threw it away. It was probably one of the worst iced lattes I've gotten in Austin. It tasted almost watery. I definitely won't be back, but I am disappointed to say that Cuvée did not meet my expectations."

                "description": "Came here in the late afternoon on a Wednesday. There were a good number of open tables, but it was around the holidays so I might've caught them on a quiet day.   The service was really friendly and I went for their recommendation of a Texas teddy. It's their nitro cold brew with some vanilla and your choice of one of their milks. With nitro cold brew being creamy on its own this took it to a whole new level by adding the milk, I thought it tasted great with their oat milk.   The two main downsides are that their drinks are fairly pricey compared to most other coffee shops in the area, and the seating isn't conducive to spending much time there. There are a good number of tables, but most of the seating isn't too comfortable and the tables are all pretty close together.   Overall, I think it's a good spot if you want to grab something quick and you're near by, but I wouldn't go out of your way to try them."

I'm a morning regular here and I grab a Large Drip Coffee and a TacoDeli Vaquero almost every morning. Thats how much I like this place.  Do I own some of their swag? Of course! You have to represent your local businesses or else it will all go commercial.  I love the team here - so quirky and knowledgeable about coffee. I never heard of a Texas Teddy before and they have them so there's that if you like those.  The wife always gets an Almond Milk Latte and a Zucchini bread.  Have they messed up our order before? Yes, they are humans after all. Have they righted it times 10? Absolutely, we always leave happy.  I've worked here a few times refilling coffee and listening to some great music here. I just love the vibe here. A great place to experience!"

I sat at Cuvée for about 2.5 hours to do work and the shop made me officially hate Doja Cat by blasting her music loudly the whole friggin time. My clumsy self dropped 8oz of my sour coffee on the floor before leaving so I was scrambling around the shop to find enough paper to clean up the mess. 2 employees just completely ignored it like nothing happened even though I was the only customer in the shop. I'm happy to clean up after my own mistake but would love to have a mop instead of ten tons of tissues / paper towels used. I guess it's hard for coffee shop employees to care these days when unemployment benefits are bigger than their paychecks."

If you don't ask if a customer wants cream and sugar (like every other coffee bar in town is doing), then when the customer asks for politely cream and sugar, you shouldn't snap back at a customer that the CUSTOMER should have told you.  And then when you bring the cream (but forget the sugar), you shouldn't muffle something as you're walking away, and then YELL at them \"WHAT DID I JUST SAY!!??\", as if the customer is a child, when they don't follow the instructions you muffled at them.  WTF is wrong w you.  This man was also asking me just 90 seconds prior if I wanted to leave him a tip on a $2 coffee."

Since the pandumbic, HP has pared down their menu a bit, and it seems like the prices also went up - par for the course. I admit that at first I was upset that the fried egg sandwich was removed from the menu, that really hurt. However! The few times I've opted to visit since COVID have all been seriously five stars. The salads are way better than before, the pan-roasted chicken was mind blowing, and the black and bleu burger is easily the best I've ever had. Plus, the fries, of course.   Today we ventured out for a rare outdoor family dinner and it was top-notch. Although the menu seems smaller in ingredients than it used to be, the execution has really stepped up. The service has been great too. Can't wait to return."

I was brought fried dumplings expecting the steamed ones I always had in the past. This service person did not even ask if I wanted steamed or fried. She just assumed! Then when she brought it out, I had asked I think it was a she if they not have steamed and she said that they serve them fried if not specified!!really? So I ordered the steamed and told her I would take the leftovers home. We ordered Wom Kim peach pudding. Mine looked normal with beautiful crust and his looked like it came off another table they cleaned off. It was shaved off and only half of a serving.  I was thoroughly disappointed in the service and the quality of their food.  Don't know if owned by same people, Vic? I will not spend my hard earned money where my business is not appreciated. I feel they think they are entitled, very sad they think that way! K. Hawkins"

My friends and I popped in for Sunday brunch, no reservation and we were seated within 5 minutes. You cannot beat $3 mimosas (and they were on the heavy side). The fries are so unique. Crispy but not greasy. We had 2 orders of the honey butter chicken benny which was fantastic, but filling. You might consider splitting that with someone. It was just an explosion of flavors. The chicken and waffles and french toast were well received too. We had a great experience and hope to return soon"

Our server was also inattentive and unfriendly which is why I really can't even give this place two stars, there was just nothing redeeming about our experience. Even the fries, which were known to be a delicacy, were bland and limp. Never coming back."

                "description": "This review is for before the pandemic. Only went here once but it was in my draft reviews.  Great wait staff and a pleasant atmosphere! My waiter was very good with timing and seemed to know the exact time it was best to come around. I enjoyed his service.  The dinner salad was served on a warm plate. It would benefit from some fresh color like from shredded carrots. The small grape tomatoes were delicious. For the entree, I ordered meatloaf because I was missing home. It missed the mark.. maybe it was because it wasn't my grandma's meatloaf, but I couldn't eat much of it. It was meant to come with this meaty brown gravy. Thankfully I got that on the side. There wasn't a baked ketchup layer on the top of the meatloaf, which is often my favorite part.   This isn't normally a place that my friends or I would visit because it seemed that most of the food is pretty expensive. I had a gift card."

                "description": "Few restaurants after the pandemic actually improved in quality and service.  HP is not one of them.  What was once contemporary in concept is gone. Hospitality is hit and miss, a reality for most places these days.  Menu has diminished, both in variety and quality.  All appetizers are fried.  Very limited options for healthier sides.  Desserts have shrunk to two boring, overly sweet, high carb features stuck in a rut from the last century.  Management should just whittle the menu down even further, selling the only items worth positive mention in reviews.  Have the black and bleu burger with fries and leave it at that."

I  ordered the Asian Chicken Salad and ate every bite!  It was so good also!!!  We had a friendly server in training (1440) and he made suggestions on what he had tried (Chicken Guacamole BLT) so maybe I will try that next time!

I ordered some takeout here yesterday and got served a burnt chicken fried steak.  When you're charging 15 bucks for a plate stuff like this shouldn't happen.  The cook can see it's overcooked, make a new one instead of leaving me pissed off and unhappy with my decision to eat dinne here.  Felt ripped off.  Weather it's old oil in the fryer or lazy/incompetent cooks.. pay someone a little more in the kitchen who will give a shit."

It'll be a great space to spend an afternoon once the pandemic ends.  Call ahead if you want to pick up some of their fabulous Texas Holiday Nog, but remember, only 2 bottles per person per month.  Careful though and drink responsibly. This is not your father's Oldsmobile eggnog. It will sneak up on you and kicks you in the noggin like a freakin' mule."

The bar tender seemed to be really put out that we were even there.  Didn't welcome us, when we asked if we needed to go to the register part of the bar to order,  he looked at his phone and rudely said, I'll be with you in a min. Then continued to be annoyed that he had to take our order. The place was empty only 1 pinter group of 4 so wasn't like he was super busy.  They even said he didn't really seem to want to be there and definitely didn't want to be taking our orders.  The AC was also very lacking we were all fanning ourselves with the menu which seemed to be the best use of the menu since he didn't want to serve us. The sink in the women's bathroom barley had water coming out if it and they were out of toliet paper but we dare not ask the 1 bar tender as that would have really put him over the top. I wouldn't recommend this place and if I was the owner I'd want to know how bad my employee is. No wonder there was no one inside."

                "description": "We passed by this place heading to the Drip yesterday and since I'd never heard of it, I immediately yelped it.  A new distillary only about 10 minutes from my Casa?  Hell yes, I'm curious.  And I'll admit I became even more curiouser after reading Arian's review....I intended to ask them about this \"one of the best after-hours swingers hangouts in Austin!!!\" sitch.    The tasting room was a little hard to find as it's around the back of this little warehouse strip but it's open and spacious and we were only the 2nd couple there on a Friday evening.  We were warmly greeted and bellied up to the bar.  Our bartender (and all the staff I think) are in the Stinson family.  She was very friendly and gave us all the history of the place and explained each tasting in length.  They are currently offering a tasting of 4 of their liquors for $7 (these served quaintly in communion cups) and have cocktails they can serve as well.  We sampled everything (of course), the vodka, the white rum and dark rum, the elderflower liquor (think St Germaine) and the Holiday Nog.  She also threw in a sampling of their Bailey's style coffee liquor that's not quite \"ready\" yet.  I immediately fell in love with the Holiday Nog, which doesn't actually have any egg in it (thank goodness) and is made more with rum than whiskey (again, thank goodness).  This will go great with holiday gatherings.  I will keep an eye on their FB page for release of that coffee liquor!  All of their bottles run in the $25 range.  Hubby and I each had a cocktail, him the mojito and me the Citrus Fizz, and both were made well and were tasty.  We also bought several of their cocktail glasses as they are sturdy heavy glass, perfect for Bourbon.  Which, btw, they are still perfecting their whiskey recipe and will offer that in the future as well.    We really enjoyed talking to everyone and after getting a little liquid courage, I did ask about the swinger's parties.  She laughed and said that was just a friend making jokes....I wonder......"

What's the big deal you ask? Let me offer a few reasons to stop in:  - whiskey tasting flights of 4 for only $11   - also offering other gin or vodka mixed drinks  - great tasting room with some cool, historical architectural elements   - wonderful deck under the shady oaks to enjoy the quiet Hill Country ambiance  - for beer or wine lovers, they also offer those (and snacks) in an adjacent  building  So this is simply a great stop off the beaten path if you are headed out to the Hill Country or just want something different that is just down 1826."

You'll more than likely have new products to sample every time you visit. There are flights and a great variety of coctails. Today, there were 5 whiskeys to pick from. Only outdoor seating. The scenic views are amazing. I recommend walking around and checking out the grounds.  Friendly service, great drinks and chill environment. I'll definitely be back."

Nor did the Black Walnut Cocktail mixed by the affable and amiable Richard.  I figured to spend about an hour or so but instead closed the joint down! The bourbon is delicious and as a Magnificent Bastard it was a real trip to find my name on the Wall of Magnificence.  The grounds are lovely and well worth wandering. If you get the chance to stop in and sample the whiskey you will NOT be disappointed! If you are a Magnificent Bastard, it is so much fun to see where our favorite videos are shot.

I had seen the videos on YouTube, and I had some time before my flight out of Austin, so I drove up on a Friday, had a cigar while I waited for the place to open (they have seating for cigar smoking on the porches!), and then sampled some of their wares.  It's excellent, and I really can't say more than that.  Try the whiskey neat, or in a drink - everything we tried was wonderful."

                "description": "Well Austin, I finally made 2k reviews on Yelp. I must have no life. haha!  My husband and I had come across Still Austin Whiskey while having drinks around Austin. My husband loved their whiskey and wanted to check out their place of business.  Sunday afternoons a few times a month, they do drag queen bingo. After the gym, I showered and we came here around 1:30ish. The drag queen bingo was underway and quite crowded. We grabbed a drink from inside and headed out to the beer garden area to observe. It was so much fun and recommend it.   They have a variety of drink cocktails to try with either gin, whiskey, and a beer or two. My husband got a flight and said it was good. I opted for the gold rush which was bourbon, honey, and lemon. It was quite tasty and strong.   I would like to note that I am gluten intolerant. I talked to the server and the manager about the gluten content. I was told that due to the distilling process basically, all spirits are gluten-free. I disagree with this information because I have had issues with some booze in the past as well as people in the gluten-free community. However, I am intolerant and usually only affected by gluten digestive-wise. I did have some mild digestive issues later that day but I made the choice to have a drink here. So make your decision wisely if you have problems with gluten.   Overall, this is a great place to grab a drink and chill for the afternoon in south austin. There are plenty of other things nearby to check out including food trucks and places to drink. The parking lot can get crowded so look for the overflow parking area or follow someone who is going to their car to leave."

                "description": "Good austin outdoor spot. Came here for Sunday drag brunch bingo.Good time and the drag host was pretty funny and friendly. Dog friendly. Got an old fashioned for 6 bucks so that was a solid deal. Didn't get any good but it looked like a bunch of fried options which my friends seemed to enjoy. It was about 60% full on a Sunday afternoon. I will say that the music was way too loud during the bingo so that made it hard to talk. Outside of bingo, the volume was fine. Overall I'd recommend it. If not, St Elmo brewing is next door."

                "description": "Our guide was pretty freaking awesome. I don't remember her name but she was a pretty red head with cool tattoos. I'm a tequila girl so I wasn't too eager to learn how gin and bourbon are made, but she really had my attention the entire time!   We were in a group of 10 which was just right. Everyone could get a few questions in if they wanted...laid back...chill...ITS AUSTIN!  Now, to the best part....and boy I was a bit disappointed. I've been on several tours in distilleries and the tasting at the end could get you about 2 shots away from tipsy. Typically there are about 4 samples....1.5-2 ounces each.....  Here....there were 2 samples with 1.5 ounces TOTAL!  I know all they do is gin and bourbon but can a SISTA have a bit more?! The tour is around $15pp, but I'd be happy to pay the standard $30-$40 for a tad bit more licka.    The gin and bourbon are still yummy!  Get a cocktail.....The old fashioned will have you stumbling!"

When we arrived, the place didn't have electricity or AC due to an electrical issue in the area.   Rather than cancel, they treated us to some complementary drinks to make up for the electrical and AC issue.   The staff was very friendly, professional, and turned a bad situation into a very fun and amazing time. Couldn't have imagined it being any better!   The guide was very knowledgeable, the tour was insightful, and the tasting at the end was great! Go support this local Austin business!"

                "description": "So, we decided to just stick with tasting their liquor instead of getting drinks. They don't have tasting flights, but they do have an option to order a taste of any of their liquors for $2 each. That's not bad at all. We were able to taste the whiskey and gin. The two year whiskey was the winner. I did see some yummy cocktails that I would love to try in the near future.   They have inside and outside seating. The outside patio has a cover for shade, but you do have areas where you can get sun   There's a food truck on site.   Parking is available on site, but shared with the other businesses. For those that want to make an afternoon or day out of your visit, the other businesses are all drink or food related."

Our tour guide was incredibly knowledgeable and was able to answer all our questions. I felt like I got a lot out of the tour and now have a basic grasp of how whiskey is made.   The distillery is pretty small and they currently sell bourbon and gin as their bread and butter, both of which you'll get to sample at the end of the tour. Highly recommended to check it out as it's just a fun atmosphere."

The staff was fantastic and knowledgeable and we tried some of their whiskey as well as some mixed concoctions that were fabulous.  There is a great open patio area that shares space with a food truck and the Bearded Bread Company, but the winds were blowing like crazy and the temps were too cold to be outside long. Definitely try this place!  And then explore other spots in the same Industrial Park!  The artwork on the buildings is also great to tour on its own."

                "description": "I must say that Hy Rum has arrived.....and in a really BIG way. How so? Well, let me tell you. 1.) Their new set up on Frog Pond Lane just of Hwy 290 is not only convenient to the ATX visit, but it will become a frequent destination. 2.) Indoor seating - both at the Tiki bar, but the innumerable comfy seating areas look nice - and I can't wait to try them all! They are all in on the Tiki motif, as they really transformed this former pool supply facility into something special. Outdoor seating: Lots. Seating with a view of the Hill Country, under the twinkling lights, in the yard - or even around a game of corn hole. They have something for everybody, including your well-behaved dog. 3.) Drinks: Hmmm...where to start. Their seasonal drink menu when we visited in January 2022 was fantastic. The first thing you notice if you sit at the bar is that the bartenders are mixing and muddling with the using freshest, usually made-in-house, all natural ingredients whenever possible. The Hot Buttered Rum drink is amazing. It will have you googling 'recipes' before you get home. Warm, spicy, buttery, and with a whipped topping topped with a hint of rum flavor (yes, they whip rum into their topping). It was our favorite on this sunny, but blustery day. Another winner was their 'Knotty Hot Chocolate' with Mexican chocolate and cinnamon. On their 'regular' menu, I tried their Old Fashioned (in which you can choose Dark or Spiced Rum) and I can tell you it was spot on. 4.) People. We were promptly greeted and seated by Master Distiller James Davidson who also told us their story and even took time to visit with us a couple of more times. He was super friendly and funny. 5.) The Booze. We tasted several with our favorite being the Spiced, but their rum family offers Dark, White, Spiced, and several flavors: Coconut, Orange, Pineapple, Extra Rich and Spicy ('the Chupacabra' which has espresso, chocolate and cinnamon infused) and even a Scottish style gin (aka Jinn) 6.) Speaking of special, check this out: Hye Rum now has a weekly event calendar with something for everybody: Brunch and Learn, Family Night, Suppler Club, Cocktail classes, and even Mardi Gras. In addition, you can book a facility tour that includes a tasting flight for only $20, which we will definitely be doing next. Soon, they will add an 'Event Room' as well just to cover all their bases. All that said, Hye Rum is making all the right moves and seems to have hit the big time. All I ask is to save us 2 seats because this place may be hard to get into - and we will be back!"

Love their tiki themed tasting room and cocktails - it made me feel like I was on a tropical vacation.   I'm a big fan of coconut rum so I ordered the Cocojito and it was so good. My husband loved their piña colada and our friend had a rum flight and ended up buying two bottles their dark rum.  James, their master distiller and cofounder, was there on a Saturday and took care of us the entire time. It was so nice to see how passionate he is about his craft and the distillery, and making sure that all their patrons feel welcomed.   Looking forward to making this one of my regular spots!"

The entrance can be easy to miss if you're not paying attention. Once you turn in, there isn't much parking and the entrance is tucked in the back off the road.   When we got there, the staff were in the bottling area filling, sealing and packaging fresh bottles. It was a cool process to watch from the bar. If you are a whisky fan,definitely stop in."

                "description": "I was in Blanco camping at the state park right before Christmas. I was drinking eggnog at another distillery in the area with my wife and friends  when my buddy, John, mentioned they were stopping here on the way back to camp, as well.  When arrived, we were welcomed by a very friendly young man. We sampled all of the products on hand. I was blown away by the full-flavored taste of the gin that they only sell on the property. It is like sipping the essence of a hike through a juniper forest. I have never experienced anything like it. It is destined to be my favorite late night sipping beverage.   I left the distillery with a bottle of Ben Milam Barrel Proof Bourbon and a bottle of Provision Distiller's Gin. I've been sipping on them ever since. I will definitely be back for more!"

                "description": "Great little distillery that I expect will be  going places before you know it. It is fairly new and doesn't have much business, but I don't expect that to last too long.  We stopped by on a Saturday afternoon. The tasting room is small, but quaint. Their single barrel bourbon is smooth and subtle. It was our favorite whiskey of the day (we were on a self guided distillery tour). The tasting was $5 for two. Definitely also the cheapest tasting fee of the day.  If in Blanco, don't miss out in trying this whiskey out. You may just find yourself a new favorite spirit."

                "description": "Driving through Blanco last week and I've always noticed the road sign but I haven't stopped in before. Check them on Yelp and Google and couldn't find much info, so what the hell, turned around to check in out for myself.   First thing I noticed was the large shade tree, several chairs, and lush grass. I could just see me and a group of friends sitting there having a few drinks and enjoying the cooler fall temperatures because here in South Texas 91 degrees in November is just that, cool Fall. I'm having a hard time getting used to that.   Inside is a small tasting room that is put together nicely. The guy working the counter could have been a little nicer. He was busy taking in inventory and obviously working but I'd like to have heard about their process, why are they better than other distilleries in the area, what sets them apart? Who is Ben Milam, I asked and he said it was the grandfather of the owner. I know who Ben Milam was, and that is a leading figure of the Texas Revolution. I'm not a Texan but I am a history buff and there is a lot to know of Ben Milam and he's great a cool story. I purchased a flight and a bottle, roughly $56 for both. At least pretend that you care a little bit more.   The bottle I took home, it was, and I say WAS fantastic. Unfortunately, Game 7 of the Houston/Dodgers game was a little stressful and the wife and I put a huge dent in the bottle on the first night. Ha! I now have to go back and pick up another, darn. Can't wait..."

I looked at the menu and she just stood there. I ordered the flight and, again, nothing. I was the only one there and tried to make at least some small talk, but she was too busy with her cell phone to even speak. She told me NOTHING about the spirits, the distillery, nothing. She seemed put out to even be there. Finally, I bought a bottle, THEN she decided to speak. It was a horrible experience and I wish I had waited to buy the bottle at the local liquor store where it was actually cheaper. Can not recommend this place at all. The products are good, but get them at the liquor store that is right up the road."

                "description": "One of my favorite things about exploring small towns is sometimes you find the most unexpected gems. We traveled to Blanco, TX (pop. 1700) today for Old 300 BBQ, and by chance decided to take a different way out of town than we'd come in. Right off 281 we passed by Ben Milam Whiskey, just opened since March. We had a very pleasant visit and enjoyed their whiskey flight, along with a sample of some of the best gin I've ever tasted. Everything was outstanding, but I couldn't stop thinking about their rye whiskey and had to take a bottle home with me. This is worth a trip all on it's own, even if you have to go out of your way. Nice people running the place, and fantastic whiskey."

He not only knew about the bourbon and rye, he was able to discuss whiskey from other distilleries, places to eat and other topics.   We enjoyed the bourbon and rye enough to buy both before we left. They both had nice aromas and smooth tastes. We will definitely enjoy these bottles and try to spread the word about them."

We visited when they first opened and were in awe of the stunning tasting room, lush green views, and one of my favorite parts is the tour to include a look inside their rickhouse. They are currently aging straight bourbon whiskey in 2020 with a projected release time of 2023. They are currently offering enticing cocktails made unaged new-make whiskey, along with craft gin, rum, and agave spirits distilled in-house.  Not only does this craft distillery provide a welcoming new space but they are also all about transparency and sustainability. Expect live music, events, exclusive events for members and more!"

                "description": "What a gem of a place! I go down the street to Meanwhile all the time, but had no idea this place even existed.  Fierce Whiskers excited me as a whiskey fan, but I do like that they have options with rum, agave, gin and other spirits.   There is definitely a lot of potential for this space, it is so cute, however they've only been open for 6 months, so they still have room to grow, they don't have much seating outside, and it would be nice to have some music, or yard games, or something to do as you're enjoying a craft cocktail. Hence the lack of star to only 4 stars.   I had the Gold Rush for my drink, a whiskey, honey, lemon concoction.   That being said, I was here for a happy hour with an organization I am in, and we had a great time. We spread out in the lawn area and everyone had a great time.   They also have a delicious food truck on site: Char ATX.  More on that in my next review where I'll be talking about the food I got there.   Definitely a cute date spot, catching up with friends, but wouldn't say it's great for families or a large group really. I hope that they continue to add on to the space and grow to utilize the space more. I'll be back for sure."

They have a lot of seats inside and outside and have food trucks on site if you are hungry. I liked their expansive menu of different and fun cocktails, that are also really delicious. The only thing is that you pay for not a lot of drink...but that's ok. Enjoy your company!  I hope they get more staff and maybe some waiters, because their can be a log jam at the bar with a line waiting on the bartenders to make these tedious drinks and it can take a long time."

The large glass doors open up to a spacious outdoor seating area. The drink menu is fairly priced with cocktails that allow you to taste their very own whiskey, gin, and rum. If you prefer straight whiskey, they have flights/tasting samplers you can ask about.  I loved the food truck parked in their lawn (Char ATX) with delicious yakitori (Japanese meat on skewers).  They have tours of their facilities which sound really interesting. I think those tours are about $15/person (please verify with Fierce Whiskers for most up-to-date pricing).  Good-sized parking lot  This place is a hidden gem. Drive past Meanwhile and head straight to Fierce Whiskers. ;-)"

Fair warning their whiskey is new aged and won't be ready to be bottled for sale for another 2+ years. This made the tasting a littleeeee rough, but I learned a lot about whiskey so it was worth it.

He picked us up from our Airbnb and drove us 45 mins out and back, while we blasted some rachet songs to sing haha. He would check in on us during the winery to see if we needed anything or have any questions, and he would offer to help us take multiple pictures. He also got one of the wineries to allow us to explore their cellars!   On our last day in Austin, he drove by our airbnb to pick up someone else and honked at us as we waited for our uber. We were all so happy to see him again, as we all enjoyed our experience with him.   I recommend Texas Tipsy Tours with Arlen ;)"

Arlen was our diver and was so knowledgeable and friendly. He picked us up right at the hotel in Austin. I felt the price for the experience is definitely worth it. If you were considering this experience, I highly recommend this company. They care and that is important."

They do all the heavy lifting with the friendliest spirit and let you and your group have the time of your life!  We had the BEST time on our tour and absolutely adore Arlen, our driver! He was the kindest, most considerate, thoughtful, responsible driver ever! He was so fun but also let us have our time to just be girls and we didn't have to open a single door, make a decision, or carry a single bag (if we didn't want to) the whole time we were with Arlen!  Also, the management team was incredible. Wei booked last minute and they were so accommodating and listened to our unique needs/wants for the tour! And we're so detailed in instructions. I have had bad experiences with wine/bus tours with other companies and I was SO impressed with the whole experience at Texas tipsy!"

From the minute I called to book to the minute I said goodbye to our driver the day of the tour they were fantastic.   So when I called there actually weren't any times available. They worked with me to make sure they had a tour time and sprinter available for our group of 6. I had a million questions; they were patient and kind.   Our group was 6 but one of my friends asked if we could add an additional person. Reached out to TTT and they said sure no problem. Literally 3 HOURS LATER I got a call that another girl tested positive with covid and wouldn't be able to come with us obviously- they were so nice and made the switch back to 6. Very grateful for their exceptional customer service.   Day of our driver Bryant was early which was great! Got on the bus and let us have free range of the radio, answered any wine questions we had or any questions about Fredericksburg. He was a fantastic host. Always texted 15 minutes till our time at the winery was up and took as many pictures as we wanted. He was so sweet! He also made sure we were never thirsty or hungry. Which for a group of girls is very important- smart man! Haha   I've heard things about other companies having hidden fees and people getting charges after leaving Fredericksburg and we had none of that. Texas Tipsy Tours was very transparent with all of their pricing and they had no hidden fees.   Thank you TTT for making our trip perfect. You won't regret booking with them."

                "description": "My experience with Texas Tipsy tours was nothing short of perfect!!! From pickup to drop-off, Courtney (the owner) made our experience amazing! When I initially started inquiring about a tour a few months ago, many of the companies only offered private tours for a minimum of 4 people. However, Texas Tipsy Tours offers small group private tours (i.e. 2-3 people). This was perfect for me. She also made planning our trip so easy, and she promptly answered all of the questions I had.   On the day of the tour, she picked us up from our hotel in Austin in an Infiniti SUV (it was very clean too)! She even made a pit stop for me at a CVS on the way to our first winery. Throughout the 6 hour tour, she made sure we stayed on schedule. She even let us change a stop last minute because we wanted to check out a brewery!  One thing that was amazing was the comfort she provided! She allowed us to pick the music, provided phone chargers, and let us control the AC! She even opened our doors for us AND dropped us off/picked us up right in front of each place we went!  Overall, I highly recommend Texas Tipsy Tours, and I will definitely be back!"

We were planning to also see Vista Brewing (all in Driftwood), but we chatted and laughed so much that we ran out of time and Eric, driver/owner was flexible with our change of plans and let us just extend our time enjoying the fabulous view at Driftwood Estate.

It was as easy as getting on the phone, explaining what I wanted, and Courtney took care of literally everything else. We picked the breweries we wanted and even included a food stop. She coordinated the bus pick up, drop offs, schedule, and even reserved tables for us at each stop. I love that we had our own bus (very nice one, by the way!), and had the flexibility to create our own tour based on beers and food my husband liked. It was the perfect Saturday in Austin! Payment was very easy as well - they sent me an invoice to my email and I was able to pay directly online for everything. Highly recommend, and thank you Texas Tipsy Tours!"

I have taken quite a few van tours around the hill country and Texas Tipsy Tours sets themselves apart by not just being drivers but they truly host you the entire day. I will ALWAYS use this company going forward. We did a private charter from Driftwood to Austin, TX and back and Keaton our driver was a delight. He made sure we were picked up on time and each of our stops were easy and flexible. We did a mixed tour around Driftwood and Dripping springs the next day and our guide Eric executed the BEST DAY for us. He even picked up on what we were liking and recommended a change to our final stop to Vista Brewing and we were SO glad he did. At each stop he made sure we had plenty of water, snacks and chairs to enjoy the gorgeous venues. This is totally above and beyond what we would have expected from a driver. Courtney was so easy to work with and she helped make recommendations for our group ultimately making our weekend get away FLAWLESS. I promise if you don't use this company, you're wrong."

                "description": "This was my first, and sad to say, my last time doing this festival. A friend who had been a few times before highly recommended it and when I balked at the $40 (plus a $3.50 processing fee) \"pre-event discount price\" with the at the door price being $50, he assured me it was well worth it because there were so many great food and wine vendors, you get your money's worth.  This was absolutely NOT the case! Firstly, this whole thing just seemed disorganized at best and I am sorry, but for $50 ($40) they could have gotten a much nicer location than a dusty, stiflingly hot cattle stockyard!   As for what you get for $40, 6 drink tickets and 10 food tickets when drinks and food run you anywhere from 1 ticket for a meager barely 1oz pour for most of the wines to several tickets for very small portions of the food, you barely get $10 worth of food and drink! You can purchase ticket for $1 a piece, which is most definitely not worth the portions or pours you receive.   As for the vendors/vintners at the festival, there were not nearly as many as you would expect for the price point and the layout was just haphazard. Also, there were several vendors that were out of food by the time we got there just after 2pm...the \"festival\" was supposed to go until 6pm...so how the heck were vendors running out of things w/4hrs left!?!   The only highlight, for me at least, was the grape stomp, but even then, they ran out of tshirts to \"stamp\" with your grape-soaked footprints.   In any case, my $43.50 would have been better spent and enjoyed at an actual local restaurant where I could have gotten multiple full pours of wine and actual food instead of leaving this joke of a festival hungry, overheated, more sober than when I arrived, and feeling like I had just been scammed somehow. Lesson. Learned.   I am honestly shocked this \"festival\" has lasted 10yrs let alone one!"

                "description": "I had a lovely time as the guest of a coworker. However, I felt like the overall value wasn't quite there for this event. Drink and food tickets went way too fast when some places asked for multiple tickets for less than an ounce of wine or a small sample of food. The actual value was about $1 per ticket. There were also some vendors that were somewhat rude or rushing. The whole point is to get business by having people try your product, right? Well there's some wineries I'd think twice about giving my money to after their lack of friendliness.   The options for food was more limited than I expected and many ran out of food even though we got there just an hour after the event started. There are lots of raffles going on and free koozies and pens galore. The arena was stuffy inside and though fresh near the doors you ran the risk of also eating dirt.   The music was good but there needed to be more sitting areas to relax and open a bottle of wine. I will definitely go back next year, but I do hope to see more offerings."

                "description": "This was by far the most awful \"festival\" I have ever had the misfortune of wasting money on.   First of all, in 2012 it was held at the Texas Hill Country Olive Company. So all advertisements this year were of a gorgeous event at this lovely vineyard - The photos were of a classy event, surrounded by olive trees and rolling hills, adorable art booths scattered about the lovely property, smiling faces holding wine glasses. I was so excited based on what I was reading of the Olive Company event that I had my mother travel up 3 hours on the morning of Saturday the 14th to accompany me. Then I convinced another girlfriend of mine to join. We had our tickets in advance, $40.00 online purchase, and my girlfriend paid at the door - $50.00.   Now, regardless of where the ACTUAL event for 2013 was advertised as being held - between the advertisements on Yelp, on Facebook and scattered about Dripping Springs, it was VERY unclear to anyone coming from outside of town where the hell this event actually was.   So we arrived at the Texas Hill Country Olive Company to find no tents, no events, no nothing but a beautiful building surrounded by beautiful land. Inside there were very few customers. But we were greeted warmly, given amazing samples (DO go there and DO try their olive oils and balsamic vinegars and DO check out their $55.00 romantic date night packages).   Making the best of what was already frustrating, we had a few samples and they sent us on to the Dripping Springs Park Ranch - or something like that, up Ranch Road Twelve.   We were still optimistic until we saw the HUGE metal pavilion looming ahead, situated in the midst of probably two square miles of plowed up red dirt which will eventually be a parking lot. As we navigated in, driving through dirt among hundreds of cars, we noticed piles of dirt, bull dozers, caution tape... this entire venue was a.) an agricultural fair pavilion and b.) UTTERLY UNFINISHED.   I was mortified. I brought guests, I paid money, and we were supposed to be in the midst of lush, rolling hill country sipping wine and sampling cheese. Not walking through 300 yards of dirt to get to an unfinished metal building. This was already so embarrassing and already not worth the money.   We had to enter at the back of this enormous, godawful construction, walk through the art vendors, then across MORE dirt on the rodeo floor (where the paying guests tables were and the music) where we were given six drink tickets and ten food tickets. When we reached the one interior part of the building, we were encountered by swarms of casually dressed, generally rude, pushy guests who were buzzing around a square room with no proper traffic flow. There we found out that each drink ticket gave us ONE OUNCE of wine, which was poured by rude and distracted vendors. We also found that each food ticket did not entitle us to a sample - samples cost anywhere from 2 to 5 tickets. One ticket got you the likes of ONE chip with a dollop of something on it.   I was blocked and almost run over by a RUDE and completely OBLIVIOUS staff member who was blocking the only entrance to the tasting room. Other guests were hogging the only FIVE standing tables in the are, they'd put their purses up there and stand around and send other guests to get them samples, so there was no where to set down your things and you had to juggle a glass of wine, your tickets, your purse, and a plate of food and in order to eat it, back through the ONE door you went, down the stairs to the dirt on the rodeo arena floor.   We left without even using the tickets we had - not worth the paltry return for what we'd spent and what we had to endure to get there.   I will never return to this event. I want my money back from this event. The Dripping Springs Chamber of Commerce should be ashamed of the overall mess and disappointment this fiasco was - they don't deserve a dime of the money they raised from it.   TERRIBLE."

                "description": "This is probably more of a 3.5 than a 4, but the low ratings to date are unjustified so I'm bumping it up.  I enjoyed the wide variety of beer, wine, and liquor to choose from, but I wish there were a few more food options. What made it worth the price of admission was the sommelier talk at 3:30 where there was no-ticket-required wine comparison tasting, and I learned a few things. Take advantage of those demos if you go next year. Also there were a few food stands with free samples no tickets required (pecans were a favorite, olive oil, chips and salsa, etc). I wish I had hit the liquor area sooner, they seemed to have generous pours. I may hit this event again next year, or I may not, but I definitely had a good time."

I've been to many similar food/wine tastings, but this one was very low value- you received drink and food coupons instead of the usual unlimited tastings most events provide. Also, expect to experience long lines in a hot event center. I'd recommend treating yourself to a nice dinner with wine over coming here."

                "description": "I thought this was an awesome event!  Yes you had to pay $40 for entrance into the event.  For that money you receive a twin Iiquors reusable bag, some goodies inside the bag including a wine glass, 10 food tickets and 6 wine tickets.  Each wine ticket was good for a 1oz pour.  And the food tickets could be used at more than 10 food vendors for various amounts.  It is called Dripping with Taste because it is supposed to be a \"taste\" not a full glass or full meal.  I will tell you that I had plenty of food for my 10 tickets!  And got to try 6 different wines!    I will say that a previous post about volunteers having to work 2 hours and then getting unlimited food and drinks is absolutely false.  Volunteers had to work a minimum of 3 hour shifts but most worked many, many more hours not only the day of the event but also prior to the event and they got the same 10 food tickets and 6 alcohol tickets.  I learned a lot about local wineries, breweries, and distilleries and tasted some awesome food from some local restaurants that I had not yet eaten at."

                "description": "If you choose to attend this festival, DO NOT PAY. You get 6 drink tickets and 10 food tickets for $40. 1 oz pours. That's about 1/6 of a glass of wine. So you pay $40 for a single glass of wine. HEB gave away 2 chips with salsa for 1 ticket, empanadas were 5 tickets. I was denied BUYING a bottle of water, so that the volunteers could have them.   This brings me to the point, if you want to go to dripping with taste, volunteer. They treat the volunteers far better than paying guests. They do their jobs for 2 hours then get to enjoy UNLIMITED drinks and food and get cool shirts that aren't available to buy to us regulars.   I was very unimpressed Dripping Springs."

                "description": "I was really excited for this, but sadly disappointed. Paid $40 ticket, which included 10 food tasting tickets and 6 wine tasting tickets. Get there and see that almost every vendor is charging 2-5 tickets for food tasting and the wine tastings are  only 1 oz pours. What??! What did my $40 pay for?? A couple sample size appetizers and a few gargle-worth 's wine samples! Furthermore, it was inside and stifling!! I'd much rather pay a little more and get unlimited tastings, at least I'd feel like I got my money's worth. Sorry Dripping, won't be back. Huge disappointment."

                "description": "They did a good job this year except for signage. There was a huge lack thereof at the back entrance where they were having everyone park when I arrived.  Everyone parking had no idea where to go. Other than that, the new Ranch/event center is nice. There were lots of vendors and lots to choose from. The tickets were more than enough to try things and the staff were friendly. Dripping Springs is a gorgeous city that should be visited by all."

                "description": "A piss poor event.   It was raining when we arrived, I know that no one can help that, but we were one of the first to arrive and we directed to park at the back end of a mud field. Instead of filling up the lot nearest the event, we had to walk though a water logged muddy field.   Then the signing up volunteers, one of the online register volunteers, was the rudest person I have met in a long time. She reminded me of one of the Orks from Lord of the Rings.   So you get 10 food tickets and 6 drink tickets. What you fail to learn until you have paid ($50) is that 10 food tickets doesn't mean 10 small samples, all of the samples were multiple tickets. Essentially, your $50 gets you two tacos and the six drink tickets equal about one glass of wine.   A truly crap festival."

                "description": "After reading the other reviews I felt that I had to write one myself. Just how many wine festivals have these people attended?!  I have attended literally dozens of wine festivals, mostly in California. Believe me that the Dripping with Taste Festival is, by far, the best value on the market. Spending $40 for the initial tickets is next to nothing compared to the analogous events in California. AND purchasing additional tickets for a buck each is very cheap compared to other such events.   I have attended the last two Dripping with Taste festivals and plan to continue to attend every year. I look forward to this event based on the quality of the event and the very, very low cost. Both years I have come away with the feeling that I got more than my money's worth and found several Texas wines to add to my wine cellar!"

                "description": "Went to this event for my birthday and...gee...what a rip.  Like the other person said its located at a huge agricultural pavilion for horse and gun shows.  I live in Drippings and saw this massive structure being erected.  Its quite the eye sore.  That'd be fine if it wasn't so expensive.  Worse, it is actually held in a tiny closed off indoor part of the complex that's maybe a 1/8th the size of the whole place.  Needless to say, it was over crowded, people packed in like sardines.  My family wanted to leave rather quickly because it just flat out sucked.  Some the vendors were generous some were stingy and acted like it was a chore to deal with you.  Stay away from this event."

                "description": "The last time I went to this event was several years ago and I was very disappointed with the venue and the offerings and had not gone back. I decided to try it again this year since it sounded like a great venue but I was very disappointed here as well. The place was nice and large but very hot and had a messy, red dirt floor. Really, I spent $40 on a cattle pen?  The wineries were nice but there were not enough food vendors and most were over-priced. My legs and feet were disgustingly dirty by the time we left. It also made me wonder how much of that dirt ended up on the food.  That's two out of two disappointments with that event and I will not be going back until a better location is used. If it happens a third time, well it will be third time and your out. There are plenty of nicer wine events around Texas that don't charge that much for entry and are much more fun."

Mother Nature decided that we needed some rain, and she was right! Though we were a little soggy when we arrived, that didn't dampen our spirits. We sampled food from most of the vendors, the quality was outstanding and we found everyone to be warm, friendly and knowledgable. As always, great wines, loved the beer garden, and glad to see the addition of spirits. The music added a nice ambience. We enjoyed our beer, wine and food sitting comfortably watching the shows. We had a wonderful day, we're looking forward to next year's Dripping With Taste. The Chamber should be very proud of this years event."

Great drinks, great staff, and tons of games to play with friends:) just wish they had paper straws. We loved Ashley the bartender on staff. Super friendly and made sure we loved our drink choices (all the drinks here are great).  Special note: They also rescued a baby cow named Moonshine who is like a little puppy- she loves some pets and will lick your hands a few chickens running around too.   Drink suggestions: great bloody Mary's! I also really like their passion fruit vodka!  Food: mmmk they have the best Mac and cheese! This is a must here. It's super smokey I loved it. They have lots of meat options too.  They have fans blowing water/misting you in the heat and twinkle lights everywhere.  Kid friendly? Yup, although I didn't see any when I went they gave a big play structure behind the car!  Parking on site"

We are visitors to Austin and Planet Rock was recommended by a local family last night at dinner, so wanting to experience local places rather than tourist spots, we decided to give it a try. It did not disappoint! I have to say that we enjoyed the BEST Bloody Mary we've ever had! Planet Rock's vodka is so smooth and with the added Bloody Mary mix combination and a piece of brisket, heaven! Service was excellent and the live music by Sharon Bourbonnais was very enjoyable also.

We got there for lunch time and to try a cocktail and eat BBQ as it's really near the local RV park. The vodka is delicious. They offer samples and have a broad selection of flavor profiles. We tried a good number of cocktails each of which was fantastic and flavorful. Jackie the bartender was wonderful to talk to and kept my wife ms drink full, my kids happy with mock tails and unsold me on a bottle of vodka, and a cinnamon vodka ( I hate cinnamon). Catfish, the master distiller came by the bar and had some awesome stories and insights into how Planet Rock became a thing.   If that's not enough to get you there for a taste, the BBQ truck does great food. Get the Texas Twinkie. The ribs were great as was the quesadilla and the stuffed potato but trust me, get yourself a Twinkie.   If you are anywhere nearby try this place. It's pet, child, and adult friendly. And they have live music. How can you go wrong?"

The demon vodka is a terrible mistress that can weaken your soul, lead you astray and give you many hangovers. The prices of vice, in its many forms.  But I ask, are we to avoid the rich experience of human vice, or is this pursuing human vice that gives us meaning?  Good vodka enables the philosopher that resides in each of us.  Many adventures await us as the consequences of our choices.  Vodka is a choice. Choose wisely."

                "description": "Great bbq and some of the best infused vodka drinks I've ever had.  Music venue is the perfect size for a killer laid back Central Texas evening.  Here's my checklist for your afternoon- 1. Have a killer drink. 2. Have some killer bbq. 3. Say hi to Catfish, the master distiller. He's the one with the magnificent beard and the hearty laugh likely by the bar. 4. Pet a chicken (there are a few running around)  5. Say what's up to Moonshine, their mini zebu cow that thinks he's a dog.  Can be seen chasing squirrels or prancing around the grounds.  If you're looking for an afternoon to enjoy a perfect slice of some of the best things Central Texas has to offer, this is your spot."

Beautiful outdoor patio seating or you can sit inside. They have 2 tasting menus to choose from for $15 each. Hubby went for the bold reds. They don't have all white tasting but our amazing server let me taste all the sparkling wines which was so fun! The sparkling Chardonnay was my favorite. Hubby's favorite was independence and tandem.  They have charcuterie boards ($25)  or you can bring your own food. We got the charcuterie board and had a great selection of cheese."

                "description": "I am working on a plan to visit all of the Hill Country wineries at some point. I purchased the Christmas Wine Passport to help me with this in December, and Spicewood was one of the vineyards I passed through. The experience was good. The facilities were beautiful, and it was a peaceful place to chill and relax. I got there shortly after opening, and there was only one other couple there, so I was able to get my tastings quickly and easily. The wines were good, especially their dry sparkling, but I was not moved to come home with anything. The selection I was offered was more heavy on bolder reds, and as a matter of preference I would rather have a good mixutre of reds and whites. Nevertheless, this wouldn't be a place I'd cross off my list. Their tempranillos were quite tasty, and I did like their dry sparkling wine."

                "description": "GF and I both came in at 1pm on a Saturday afternoon via a prior RSVP to meet Ron Yates himself and do a full tasting experience with him as our server. This experience was amazing!  The indoor tasting room is large and open, welcoming and chill. Adorned with many award-winning wines of theirs that number beyond what I could count.   We got front-of-house seats together and begin our tasting journey through several whites and reds and sparkling wines. After what had to be 10-12 wines, we honed our picks down to the 'cabernet claret' for my GF and the 'tandem' red for me. However, not one of the wines we tried did we both truly feel we hated or disliked. Normally 1-2 are an easy pass but frankly, every wine we had was very good. My GF prefers sweeter wines across the board so the fact that nearly every wine she had still pleased her was saying something.  Ron was a top-notch host and server for us. His passion and love for wine is all but very clear in his conviction to his craft, knowledge of wine science and methodology, history of the business origins, name creations and labels to the wine bottles... all of it is an adventure with him as the animated storyteller of his wines and how the grapy goodness in the bottle got there and what you can expect to experience when it hits your lips.  I have to mention that they host an annual chili cook-off event every last Saturday of Feb with live music, 15+ chili contenders, and wine tasting all day long. It's their most successful event to date each year. When he spoke of that I made plans to be there for that for sure!  Ron and the team have a solid handle on this wine thing that is for darn sure! We only barely looked over the vineyard grounds so next time we come back, its gonna be charcuterie board, wine and time out in the vines for sure!"

                "description": "Upon arrival at this gem a couple years ago, we had our doubts. The few Texas wines we had tried were subpar in our view. Spicewood's offerings opened a whole new chapter in our wine lifestyle upon completing that first visit.  When we first entered their tasting room, we noticed a plethora of wine award medallions on display. Being a volunteer on the Houston Rodeo, I was especially pleased to see many Rodeo Houston awards. But that wasn't all - Spicewood has awards from wine contests all around the country! Hmmmmm...  As we proceeded through our tasting, we were immediately impressed. Texas wine? This good? Yes, indeed! So good, in fact, that I joined their wine club without hesitation and remain a member to this day.   We visited again yesterday and enjoyed complimentary tastings of six nice wines and picked up our wine club orders from the past couple of quarters. We sat on their patio overlooking the vineyard and remarked how we are so happy to have found this spot. Oh, and the people working here are gracious and genuinely friendly.  Spicewood is a tad off the beaten path, but definitely worth the trek."

Of course things were a little different with Covid going on but everything was spaced out and carefully planned out for everyone's safety. When we arrived Ron was in the porch helping the guests with their wine selections. He is always very nice and makes everyone feel at home. It's always nice when the owner with everything he has to do remembers your names. After our picnic we got to sit in the Wine Cellar which was awesome. Highly recommend visiting, enjoying the scenery and trying out all the great tasting wines.   Hats off to Ron and Crew!   Adrian and Cyndi"

                "description": "Hmm...it has taken me over a week because I hate to say something bad about someone's business. Last Monday we stopped here after a fantastic visit to Marble Falls. We felt...tolerated...at best. We were met by 3 huge dogs who barked incessantly upon our arrival and throughout the visit. When the host finally came out he didn't offer up options for the tastings like we've experienced at other wineries. I'm pretty clear on what I like and had some ideas of wines I'd like to try with the intent of buying enough bottles to make a case of assorted bottles upon departing. The owner, who has great reviews on Yelp, either wasn't there or was busy. We didn't see this person. But we pushed through the tasting, cut it a bit short, and left much, much sooner than we'd ever imagined we would. My intuition upon arrival was to just leave. We should have done that.  This is our experience. And it just wasn't pleasant. We were the only guests yet felt we were in the way.  Hopefully, for others, their visits will be more aligned with this place's other more positive reviews."

                "description": "I was pleasantly surprised by Spicewood Vineyards.  Spicewood was originally founded by the Manigolds.  Their vision was to make wine only from estate grown grapes. They were smart when they planted their vineyard.  They analyzed the soil and only planted grape varieties that would thrive in their soil.  Nine of the original 17 acres planted by the Manigolds are still producing fruit. For Texas that means something. That means wine sourced from grapes growing on vines that are now 24 plus years old.  Ron Yates took over from the Manigolds and is now the owner of Spicewood, and with wine maker Todd Crowell is making some good Texas sourced wines.  They now have thirty two acres planted on site, and partner with other Texas grape growers.    I like that the tasting room is a bit off the common path. That means it is away from the hustle and bustle of other Hill Country wineries.  The tasting room is spacious.  It has a homey lodge like feeling that is very inviting. They also have a beautiful tree shaded outdoor space.    The staff here are like family. They are knowledgeable and friendly.  I tasted through a selection of their vast options available. I found them to be well balanced.  Surprisingly I liked their Sauvignon blanc along with other of their wines."

                "description": "My experience was a 4-5 like many of those you will see here. However, our lovely day was ruined when one of the resident dogs or a customer's dog charged us aggressively while I was walking with my 10 month old baby in my arms. I cannot be sure if it was a resident dog or a guest's dog, but it was one of the gray colored Blue Lacey's).  Regardless, the dog was unprovoked by us. I had to hand my baby to my wife while I tried to protect them from this aggressive dog, hair bristled up and darting in at me aggressively as if to bite. Luckily it didn't bite us. The dogs owner chastised me for reacting strongly in defense of my wife and baby, which really frustrated me. We immediately left and I will not be returning. I wanted to post this in case a child is attacked by a dog on their premises in the future. It is documented and the owners have been informed that their aggressive dog or lack of leash laws are creating a liability and awful experience."

                "description": "I'm badly remiss in not posting a positive review for almost a year; what's more this is one of my personal favorite wineries in Texas Hill Country.  It's time I corrected this.   Spicewood has one of my personal favorite tasting rooms; while on the inside it's nothing special, the outside grounds and seating mimic an upscale, modern country house that I could see myself living in (*cough cough* once I win the lottery *cough cough*).  There's also a cool little stream they have running through the place so you can hear the sound of running or falling water when you sit to have a sip.  Nice touch.  Spicewood's won a bunch of awards for various wines but the two standouts IMO are their 2013 Syrah and their Riesling, which has a fruity taste and a magnificent green-apple crisp bouquet.  Note: As of May 2016, their site does not show the Riesling for sale, so I'd call ahead if you want to taste it.  As an added bonus, it's only 10 minutes away from It's All Good and Opie's, both of whom have some of my favorite BBQ outside the Austin area."

I'll pay for wine as long as it's delicious and this one is fabulous. I like the patio outside. You can bring your dog and  kids if you'd like. The ambience inside and out is relaxing and fun. It's an excellent place to chill out with loved ones. I'll be back."

                "description": "This vineyard has a broad range of varietals for producing their many wines.  Some are very surprising like their Tempranillo Rose, Mourvedra, Cab, and Pinot.   Since they seemed to blend grapes from outside of Texas with estate, gives their wines a different character than most I've tasted from Calif and Washington for the same grape varietal.    For non-wine items to consider, the staff is super friendly and knowledgeable, dog friendly, indoor and outdoor seating with a nice babbling brook adjacent.   They do have an event facility and would make a nice venue for any type of occasion.  They have a hearty cheese plate that won't disappoint.  I would not use the spicy cheese however."

The bus was comfortable, the ride was smooth, and the mood was great.  They have earned our business."

                "description": "Looking to experience great Hill Country wines and barbecue - we had both taking Winding Road Wine Tours Salt Lick Sunday Wine Tour.  The tour picked us up in Gruene in a new luxury bus at 10:30. We were greeted by the tour owner Billy Martin.  The bus was very comfortable with a u shaped seating arrangement and a table in the aisle.  Should seat around 12 people comfortably. The bus has a great sound system that is Bluetooth enabled - Billy played whatever we wanted from sources such as Pandora and Napster music service. First stop was Driftwood Estate Winery. Driftwood has perhaps the best winery views in the Hill Country.  I really enjoyed the reds and came away with a bottle of Longhorn Red to enjoy at our next stop Salt Lick Barbecue. Yes, Salt Lick is byob. It was beginning to rain and Billy dropped us off near the check in stand. He's thought of his customer's needs providing us large golf umbrellas. It was busy with people waiting to be seated. However, he got us seated right away. Our final two wineries were Fall Creek right across the street from Salt Lick and then Wimberley Valley Winery. Fall Creek has solid wines and the service for our group was outstanding. Wimberley Valley Winery was an unexpected pleasure. Their tasting room is roomy and comfortable with plenty room at the tasting bars and a comfortable seating area facing a large stone fireplace. They have a variety of wines bottled on site along with other wines from around the world. The grounds were spectacular with numerous large shaded decks to enjoy a glass or bottle as you wrap up your tour.  What a great Sunday drinking Texas wines, eating Texas barbecue and meeting new friends!"

I don't know if the business has just gotten bigger than the owners can handle but communication was subpar. It took several calls and emails to get answers sometimes.   At our first tour, Kathie took tons of photos and would pose us at the wineries. This tour, we had to prompt her. It was a cloudy day so not the best for outdoor pics but I was disappointed we took most of them ourselves or had to ask her to take the pictures.   Our tour was April 11, it is now almost 2 mths later I haven't received the few pictures we took. I emailed twice and have finally heard back that the SD is apparently not working. I'm not sure why I had to email to find this out, seems like this info should have been divulged as soon as the problem presented itself.   I hate to downgrade the star review but my second time with this company just wasn't as epic as the initial tour I took with them. The wineries all seem to love this company though."

DTWT was very accommodating, scheduled the wineries we wanted to see, ordered the lunches, and then confirmed our selections a couple of days prior to our tour. At the last minute after visiting with a couple in our third stop, we changed our fourth stop to a different winery. Jason (our driver) was happy to accomodate us. My only regret is that we didn't choose a few wineries a little further out of town, so we could spend more time in the limo listening to our Willie Nelson songs. Jason was awesome, and I highly recommend this tour."

First, the bad news. The booking process is way more arduous than it should be. My initial discussion about the tour plans happened over the phone, so I asked for a written, e-mail confirmation of what we had discussed - specifically how the deposit and refund policies work. It took me more than three weeks to get that first e-mail confirmation of our booking and deposit payment. I then went back and forth, back and forth, back and forth with the company, hammering out the details, like setting a pickup location and our choices for the winery stops. Many times, three weeks would pass and I'd have to make multiple attempts before I would get a response to my e-mails. Sometimes, the responses would be incomplete and we'd repeat the process of trying to get information confirmed. Seriously a pain for an experience that costs $129 per person.   Now, the good news. The online payment portal for each attendee was a breeze to use and eliminated the need to handle money all through one person. As for the actual tour itself, we couldn't have asked for a better experience. Our driver, Bobby, was on time and wonderful on the day of the tour. He was funny and polite and had good knowledge of the area. Also, very importantly, he was a good and safe driver! The Mercedes bus we took was very clean and spacious, and they provided water, cups and napkins. They also allowed us to bring our own food onto the bus. The three wineries we visited, Driftwood Estate, Duchman and Fall Creek, were all accommodating and fun. The views were lovely and we never felt rushed and made it back on time. It was raining when we got back to our car, and Bobby was so nice and helped us get our stuff back into our car in the pouring rain.   All in all, despite a wonderful wine tour, I'm not sure I would recommend this company, only because I spent way too much time hounding them throughout the booking process. While the wine was excellent, I NEEDED to drink after dealing with their horrible communication. Discover Texas Wines should strongly consider re-evaluating their communication practices and hire more people to keep up with the demand for their service. It's the only way they will stay competitive in the long-run!"

He took lots of photos for us and kept us cool with cups of water.  We went to Driftwood Estate (beautiful views and grounds), Duchman family winery (beautiful Tuscan architecture), and Driftwood (had the best wines!). We did a half day and it was the perfect amount of time.   Couldn't have been any better! Thanks Roy!!!"

                "description": "We used this company for  a bachelorette weekend the company was extremely hard to work with. Communication with the company was extremely difficult. However, Mike (magic mike) completely turned a ruined weekend around. He was so nice and fun he sang to us and played guitar. I have never met a more generous and kind person. It might take you sending 3 emails to get responses from the company but definitely use Mike for your tour!"

He picked us up on time, was incredibly friendly, and funny even though we were a bachelorette party and knowing the possibility of it getting crazy with 7 girls. Seriously, request Roy. He made the trip a blast. There was cold water for us in the bus. Oh did I mention it's a Mercedes bus? Super nice! An AUX cable was available to play our own music too. The selection of wineries was amazing, perfect mixture between red and whites/dry and sweet, so every one of us could have something tasty. The drive was beautiful and not too far out of Austin. Overall, I am very impressed with this tour and the wonderful employees. Would definitely go again."

                "description": "Absolutely do not recommend using this company. I made the reservation back in January, gave my card for deposit and was told I'd be emailed a link for everyone to pay. Over the next two months I called and emailed asking about the link so my friends could pay their part and I was repeatedly told they were having issues. Okay fine, no big deal- I also emailed again saying we can just pay the day of if the link wasnt working and never received a response. The day before our tour, as I was driving from Dallas to Fredericksburg I get a call from Some guy at the company and he seemed very annoyed with me saying no one had paid yet. Um.. I'm sorry I didn't realize you finally sent it after months of my asking. (He had sent it the day before calling me to tell me no one had paid) The vehicle I requested was not the one that showed up. The driver Julia was late bc she did not write the address down correctly. We also had 3 girls cancel last minute, so we were down to 5 instead of 8. Considering there minimum is 5 I wasn't expecting that to be a problem but Julia felt the need to bring it up multiple Times as if it caused some inconvenience for her. Rude people, horrible communication."

Roy was a true gentleman and really took good care of our group all day long, making this a truly great experience. Noel was very helpful in booking us, even with a last minute addition to our party. I will be using these guys again in the future, and would recommend anyone who is looking for a first time trip to do the same."

                "description": "What a fantastic time! Organizing a full day wine tour for 50 people in the Texas Hill Country may not sound like an easy task, but Noel at Discover Texas Wine Tours made it smooth and most importantly, unforgettable. His main goal is to make sure everyone is comfortable and has a good time! Most companies were not able to host a group this size, but Noel made it happen. He made sure our bus was the best he could find, worked to have a lunch catered for us at one of the stops, set up private tastings with many of the wineries to accommodate a group our size, even stopped to let one of the guys who didn't drink wine buy some beer. I can't say enough good things about Noel and how hard he worked for our group. I highly recommend him and look forward to another tour with him soon!!"

Planning to visit four wineries on a Sunday afternoon, I hired Vintage Car Service so we wouldn't have to worry about becoming safety hazards on the road. Prior to our visit, Josh offered advice on where to go. Lezli picked us up at our BandB right on schedule. We were impressed with her knowledge of the area and its wineries. She helped us rearrange our schedule a bit when our visit at one winery went longer than planned (that's on me - I tried to cram too much into an afternoon).  THIS is the way to do a wine tour. We will be regular customers when we return to Fredericksburg!"

I'm so glad I did.   1) personalized service. Josh took us to 4 wineries personalized to our tastes. Your tour is likely going to be nothing like ours. If you want a distillery tour they can do that too.   2) new, clean vehicle.  My mom has mobility issues. Getting in and out of a shuttle isn't the easiest. We could relax in this SUV and she had no issues getting out of it.   3) private service. Josh was our photographer, tour guide and even purse holder for the day. He knows a lot about wine! At the end of our tour he brought in all of our wine! We could do things at our own puce.   4) the price was comparable to other services. The price does not include tastings but that is ok. Sometimes you just want a glass or two.   Overall, I would highly recommend this service!"

Josh picked us up on time from our Airbnb, the car was spotless and we made a few adjustments to our itinerary along the way which Josh was super helpful with! Snacks and waters were provided in the car, which came in very handy between the wine stops! Josh took pictures for us and even mailed us the most amazing large postcard with our pictures from the trip. Great attention to detail from start to end! Will definitely make a reservation with Vintage Car Service next time we're in Fredericksburg."

They picked out some great tasting spots to suit the different tastes of everyone in our group. They called ahead and made reservations where needed and offered us lots of great tips along the way. Even with a little rain shower, our entire group had the best time and we felt like VIPs everywhere we went! Comfortable. Professional. Affordable. Worry-free. We can't wait to book our next Texas wine adventure with Vintage!"

They worked with me on the wineries and Distillery the group chose to ensure that the time worked within our tour, so everyone could enjoy the tasting and lunch without feeling rushed. Austin Wine Tours also provided us with a great driver. I have to say our driver Charlie was awesome, he called before arriving, he was prompt and ensured we had everything before leaving the pickup spot. Charlie made our tour very comfortable, the ride to and from the wineries and Distillery was amazing. Charlie ensured that we were taken care of.  We will definitely be booking another tour with you folks and requesting Charlie.   Thank you again,  Laurie"

On the day of, I got a heads-up call to confirm the time and pickup location. We had a larger, rowdy group of gals on a bachelorette trip and our driver Song took SUCH good care of us! She immediately asked us what music we wanted to crank and encouraged all the \"wooing\" from the back of the van. She also offered to take pictures of us, scouted out the best locations for group photos and even took TONS of candid pics of us while we enjoyed the winery and distillery we went to. She helped with all of the logistics of checking in at each stop and making sure we were taken care of. She also let us make a pee stop on the way home...and overall she was just SUPER nice and was basically hyping us up the entire day, making sure the bride felt special and making sure we all had fun. By the end of the day we all felt like she was part of the crew. Thank you again Song!!"

The wineries were beautiful and we were able to schedule a stop at the salt lick for our private tour. Kyle was the best tour guide ever!! He was very personable, took numerous pictures for us at each winery and made sure we were having fun! I would def. recommend if you are looking at different companies to pick Austin Wine Tours (ZWay Tours) since I called 5 others and they were the most accommodating with what we wanted for a private tour and their price beat most of the other ones too!  Would def. book them again and request Kyle!"

                "description": "The review that I left in regards to the services booked through Austin Wine Tours was in no way false. I will stand firm by what was written.   I even received a call back in May while on a business trip from the shuttle service company asking if we would pay the overtime for Hugo because AWT had not paid them yet. We even tipped Hugo an additional amount for his extra time spent with us.   The response just posted (almost 4 months later) is also extremely unprofessional and misleading. We were promised a great time for a bachelorette party and were let down. Plain and simple. Those employed by AWT that we spoke with were rude as well. Secondly, I never said that AWT hosted prom events/transportation. I was told that the company that is usually utilized was completely full (by Brad) and that prom happened to be a priority and the school bus that was sent was all they could get us even though we were promised a party bus.   At the end of the day we were completely dissatisfied with the services offered by AWT. Calling a client a bridezilla (who in fact actually never spoke to any AWT employee), claiming your company has gotten PTSD from our group and falsely accusing our group to be racist by saying we told \"blackie to leave\" is unprofessional and disrespectful amongst other things said in response to our reviews. All of those involved would be happy to discuss this event again in a professional manner since you mentioned that we were offered a full refund when that in fact was not true. We were offered maybe $350 (I could be wrong on this amount since we haven't heard/spoken to anyone from AWT for several months) in return if we removed our reviews.  As a company you should take responsibility instead of blaming others for your mistakes that way you can fix the problem and do better for future patrons. Especially since there has been no money refunded at this point."

I initially booked online and didn't know what venues to go to at first but they recommended the ones that we ended up going to even though it was completely up to us where we wanted to go which I liked. We decided after to tastings to go eat at Salt Lick BBQ and the food was amazing and hit the spot in between tastings. After that we went to our final tasting at Fall Creek which was right across the street and the service there was great. It made our bachelorette party very fun and we didn't have to worry about anything other than having a good time which I liked."

They sent an incorrect party bus for a bachelorette party, contracted out at last minute to another company (who were amazing), sent us to Deep eddys where we were turned away!!! Brad would NOT let me speak and kept interrupting me. The professionalism of this company was simply awful. And they still have not refunded anything from this trip!!! Disgusted and I will never recommend this company to anyone. Spend the extra money and go elsewhere."

                "description": "Booking our wine excursion was stress free the moment Sara answered the phone! Sara was very informative and laid everything out, giving us a doable timeline for the afternoon we wanted. The itinerary we received gave us a good idea of how long to spend at each venue. There were only 4 people in our group, so we were able to do a very flexible hourly option, with appointments at the wineries.  Since we had less than 5 passengers, our tastings weren't included (informed that going in) however, that did not deter our experience... it was awesome! Buying a bottle of wine at each venue was very affordable when we split the cost among us.  George, our driver, was professional and friendly; and the limo experience was awesome! You might want to bring snacks just in case someone gets a bit tipsy, but most wineries offer food of some kind. Thanks Austin Wine Tours, for making me look like a champ with my high maintenance friends... I'll be back!"

                "description": "So first....let me say that our group totally dropped the ball on planning.  We reached out to Carla 3-4 weeks before but did not confirm until the week of the wine tour.   By the grace of the \"wine\" Gods, Carla could fit us in her schedule!  She is completely open to letting you choose your places or you can follow her lead!   She picked us up at our accommodations which were several miles outside of Fredricksburg.  We did introductions and she laid out the things that were already scheduled for the day.  On our way to the first winery, we decided to \"reroute\" the tour to hit some lesser known spots.  TBH, we were excited for Carla's recommendations.    Our first stop was Six Shooter because of their variety of dry wines, sweet wines and meads.  You have to try the Jalapeno shooter!!!  SO GOOD!   Second, we made our tour time at Real Ale and did a beer tasting. Third, she realized the majority of our groups like Whiskey, so we stopped at Andalusia Whiskey in Blanco!  This place met the needs of our entire group (even the non-whiskey drinker) and was by far the most unique stop of their day!  If you go here, try the Cherry Cola cocktail!   We stopped for lunch at Pecan Street Brewing in Johnson City, where we drank lots of water and had really great food.   Our last stop of the tour was Zero815 Winery which had a cool mix of wines and friendly staff.   At the end of the day, Carla made sure that we made it back to our accommodations safe and sound.  We had the very best time and she knows some of the coolest places that you might miss without her expertise.  She was extremely professional and very down to earth.  She was always around to help with recommendations or just to snap photos of the group!     We highly recommend doing a tour with Carla and Texas Wine and Spirit Tours!   You won't be disappointed!   We'll be booking with her again the next time we are in the area!"

The weather was pretty bad that morning, so we started a little late, but the van that they have is really, really nice, clean, and spacious. She even has a little stool in case you need help getting into the van, and she helps everyone get in and get out. We went to three places around the Johnson City area. The first one was a quick tasting, the second one we learned A LOT about wine and got a lesson in how to properly drink wine, and at the third winery we got the most interesting history lesson about President Johnson and Lady Bird Johnson from the winemaker himself. Leslee personally knows the places and owners and was just the best tour guide. One of the places on the tour where we were supposed to also eat dinner at cancelled due to the weather, but Leslee was quick to find a different place for us to go to. She took us to a cute cafe in downtown Johnson City where we ate a ridiculously good dinner. We even went to Leslee and her husband's bar at the end of the day for one last drink and got a chance to meet her sweet daughter as well. I thoroughly enjoyed the tour with Leslee and highly recommend D'Vine Tours!"

Cadye was really helpful getting everything all set up on the front end; Clint's phenomenal positive energy, incredible industry knowledge, and evident rapport with all of of the wineries/vintners made the trip incredibly enjoyable.  Can't imagine doing a wine tour with anyone else."

                "description": "I cannot say enough good things about Clint and Cayde and Rat Cellar Wine tours! If you're looking for options during the pandemic, contact them! Cayde was very informative, professional, and has been staying up-to-date with all the current laws with the changing issues in the pandemic. But the moment your tour starts, Clint takes away all your worries and concerns, and created a fun atmosphere filled with lots of knowledge and wine tasting! If you're looking for a sommelier who knows his stuff, Clint is your guy! If you want your sommelier to not be pretentious, again, Clint is your guy! I would highly recommend them to anyone who does not know Fredericksburg, and anyone from novice level to expert level of wine expertise. We made awesome memories thanks to Rat Cellar, and would use them again in a heartbeat!"

We love these guys more than ever after going out with Clem for a tour of William Chris, Pecan St Brewery, Hye Rum, and Pedernales.   Clem was a fantastic host for the day! With several years in the Industry and a passion for wine making, we received the red carpet experience! We once again had a great time touring and learning from an expert. They will tell you as much, or as little, as you want to know - but make no mistake, these guys know what they're talking about!  Book your wine tours with Cellar Rat, you'll be in great hands!"

                "description": "BOOK WITH THEM! From the beginning Cayde was a great help with booking and recommending different places and atmospheres. We were looking for a mixture of red and white wines as well as making a stop at a brewery. As this trip was taken to relax a bit we opted to go a more relaxing atmosephere. The three stops that we made were great and weren't typical touristy places which made it even better. Chris was our tour guide and he was awesome!! He gave us recommendations of where to eat, information about the areas, and overall was very personable! We couldn't have asked for a better tour guide, he took all of our bags back to the car, he mentioned that he had umbrellas just in case, and was great about letting us know that he was on his way and that there was a little delay. This company isn't like others, they listen to what you are looking for in the experience and there were no problems! Chris even found our airbnb that was a bit off the beaten path. I would book with them again!"

                "description": "Booked a tour with Cellar Rat during the first day of our trip to Fredericksburg since we had never been.  We thought a tour would be a good way to get our bearings.  We stayed just out of town on the west side of 490 so our \"wine\" tour started with a quick tour of main street which was helpful later when making dining decisions and deciding our our tourist stops.  Clint was very knowledgeable about the town, the wineries, wine in general, and very personable.  He had all our stops planned out and tastings booked.  Definitely relaxing to have all that handled for you so you can enjoy your vacation.  The tours are somewhat determined by the agenda/goal of the people on the tour meaning you stops might be different.  I was told some tours are based on the best views, best wines, and possibly distillery tours if that is of interest.  We wanted an idea of what the area had to offer which took us to Kuhlman, William Chris, and Astris.  We also had some samples during lunch at Hye Market which was a great stop as well.   Several stops included a tour of the grounds and a behind the scene look at the production side of wine making.  We ended the trip that day with about a dozen bottles of wine, a mix of reds and white, which is a testament to the quality of the stops and wines the area has to offer as we primarily drink dry red wines; typically pinot noirs.  Would definitely recommend Rat Cellar and look forward to touring with them again next trip."

                "description": "We had a great time with Cellar Rat Wine Tours!   Everything went smoothly from booking to the actual tour. Cadye provided a quick and thoughtful response to our initial inquiry and walked us through creating the best tour for our group. She was patient while I got consensus with the group of which wineries we wanted to visit.   On the day of the tour, Chris picked us up on time and gave us an overview of what we could expect throughout the day. We had a lot of questions and he answered them well.   Our group stopped at Kuhlman Cellars, William Chris and Pedernales. Having worked in the industry, Chris was able to get us some \"behind the scenes\" looks at the wineries. He also was patient when we wanted to have another glass at certain wineries. Not to mention, he was always willing to help us document the trip with a picture!  I can't forget to mention we also had lunch at Hye Market where we got to taste some of the Cellar Rat wines! They were great! The restaurant itself is in a post office that is still operating and looks like it did back when it opened decades ago. Chris was also sure to make sure we had snacks and water throughout our trip!  I would highly suggest booking Cellar Rat Wine Tour to learn more about Texas wine culture and the area."

Chris, our guide was excellent and went out of his way to accommodate us.  He is also knowledgeable regarding the wine, spots, and was extremely profesional and nice.  They made accommodations to pick up and drop us off where we were staying.  He kept the van cool for us and our wine during this hot weather.  He also kept us hydrated by having plenty of cold water bottles handy.  Highly recommend booking a tour with Cellar rat wine tours.  You will not be disappointed."

You are treated to such a fun experience with delicious wines (and not to mention, plenty of learning), good food, and a great travel buddy and conversationalist to boot. Some may argue the company is pricey considering the available wine shuttles, but it is SO worth it. You get plenty of attentiveness, the day is laid-back with ZERO planning on your part, and you get home at the end of the day feeling great and hopefully, with some delicious wine.  I love Cellar Rat Wine Tours and would highly recommend to anyone hoping to check out the wine scene around the Fredericksburg area."

We had a 11 people with us for the tour so were in their largest tour van, and even with the large number of people Clem was able to keep the tour feeling small and intimate.   2 of the 11 people were very interested in the actual wine making process and Clem to the extra time to discuss more in depth the process as well as show the group the actual wine cellar where the wine was stored.   Lunch was provided in the cost and this made this tour group even more attractive to us, as all the other tour groups we looked at did not provide that.   If you're looking for more of a personalized tour from an experienced professional, this tour is definity with the price of admission.   Cheers!"

Brandy was super accommodating in the reservation process and her husband Matt picked us up the day of at the hotel we were staying at in San Antonio.  He assured us it would be a very different tour from what we're accustomed do and he was right!  He was so knowledgeable that we really enjoyed the tour.    We had shopping time in Fredericksburg and we never felt rushed.  Excellent recovery on their part too when there was a slight hiccup in our reservation and with what was available to tour, he didn't skip a beat.  He  made other arrangements and we continued our tour.  Additionally, I left my iPhone charger in the van and they had it delivered the same day.  One of my girlfriend's left her sunglasses at the Sisters Creek Vineyards and Matt was able to recover the sunglasses and had them mailed the same day.  That's true service!  We would most definitely enjoy doing another tour with Cottonwood Wine Tours in the future and we plan to do so soon."

I did not expect much but I was not impressed with the timeline, the first winery, the driving, or the mask mandate. To start, we were one of 3 stops and that should have been planned better. One pickup and drop off only. Second, the first winery was not pleasant, friendly, or poured enough wine to have two sips. The second winery was more energy and fun. The driving was a little unsettling. Before ever sipping wine, I felt sick in the van with the disruptive swerving and plowing over bumps. I was uncomfortable with the lack of ventilation as well. While I do not expect a lot for $125 a person, I did expect a fun experience. My recommendation is drive yourself, get a hotel, and not be confined to a timeline, other people, car sickness, or bad wine."

We had our first stop at the Saint Tryphon winery, which was the cutest place with an amazingly knowledgeable and friendly staff!! Tres  presented our tastings and was great to talk and listen to.  Our group of six bought several bottles of wine.  We then journeyed to another gorgeous winery with a little less on the customer service.  We gave our feedback immediately to Diane, who said that she would have a discussion with that winery and I believe she will!  Diane then took us into Fredericksburg and pointed out many local establishments.  Throughout the day, Diane provided many facts and tons of information about the area.  She even managed a quick detour to drive by Luckenbach for us!  We chose this company because it is a small business and were very pleased with the personal touches, snack bags, and intimacy of this tour.  We would highly recommend this company for your wine tour adventures!"

It was a Friday and my mom's actual birthday when Matthew picked us up at the hotel.  Right off the bat he was really cool and laid back.  He had a lot of fun facts about San Antonio as he is from there and the drive out to Sister Creek winery seemed like we were just hanging out with a friend.  Coming from the Willamette valley I have seen plenty of winery's but nothing like this one. It is an old cotton mill turned into a small winery that produces some great Bordeaux varietal blends and even a Pinot Noir!  Matthew was very knowledgeable on the topic of wine and wine making.  After the wine tasting we headed to Luckenbach for some beer and a little live country music. There is a lot of history to this place and we had been there 33 years prior when my sister and I were toddlers.  He told us no rush and let us enjoy this little country music Mecca, he even had the famous song loaded up on his phone when we got back to the car.  We had him take a picture of us that emulated the one that had been taken so many years before.  Next stop was some Texas bbq, like real bbq, he said we couldn't expect any city bbq to be better and I would say he was right!  All in all this tour was awesome, I would have loved to take other tours with Matthew, like the Alamo or some of the other missions but I don't think he offers those yet, maybe an idea?  He was very personable, knowledgeable and friendly.  The type of person you want to be around and I know my mom had a very special birthday because of this tour/guide.  I highly recommend Cottonwood wine tours for any tour they offer in San Antonio, it is run by Matthew, his wife and his mother in-law and I look forward to returning here to see their success!"

We visited two wine vineyards and were able to spend the last hour of the tour walking around Fredericksburg. Overall, the tour was amazing! It was put together well and worth the price! I highly recommend doing this tour if you're in town visiting or live in San Antonio. They also give military discounts"

                "description": "I'm visiting my friend in San Antonio who's here for work and she booked this wine tour for us. Matt picked us up and was super friendly and gave us a lot of information about San Antonio, the winery we were headed to, and was just overall really nice and friendly.  At the first winery at Sister Creek, we switched out with Brandy because she was doing the actual tour we booked, Matt was just doing our pick up. Brandy was super fun and every bit as good as Matt. She took us to another winery, let us walk around Fredericksburg (after some great advice on where to eat), then at the end decided she'd take us by a small local liquor distillery that makes some really cool stuff like jalapeno moonshine!  From start to finish, it was amazing. These two are friendly as can be, very knowledgeable, and nothing felt cookie cutter. They make it feel like a personal experience. I definitely recommend giving Cottonwood Wine Tours a try!"

The experience was great and although I am 8 months pregnant we still had a good time and got to purchase some wine to try for after the baby comes. Also they didn't charge me for the wine fee so that was a plus since I didn't get to do any of the wine tastings."

He was so polite and interesting, genuinely knowledgeable when it came to wine and the Hill Country. After our first winery, we got back into the car to find goody bags with water and snacks waiting for us. He had extra chocolate if we needed it!    I really liked having time to eat and shop in Fredericksburg between drinking. He pointed out suggestions for places to eat or to drink more on Main Street before dropping us off. He even took us to a bonus winery not on the schedule since we were doing so well on time.   I highly recommend Cottonwood. Matt was easy to contact and professional throughout, even when we were all a bit tipsy. He was a very safe driver. Great job."

Throwing a surprise weekend is stressful enough but Woody was SUPER accommodating especially for being so last minute.  There were many tours that I could've chosen to stick with but Woody was so authentic about his services and was a person of integrity when it came to what he offered.  He personally picked us up from our little hotel we were staying at and drove us to all three of our tours. His tour bus was super clean and we all had a blast! He even offered to pick up some cheese and snacks at the HEB close by to have on the bus if we wanted! I really appreciated Woody taking the time to answer my numerous phone calls with questions I had as this is my first Bachelorette party I threw.  I HIGHLY recommend using Woody if anyone wants to have a great time and looking for someone to trust. I will be booking with you again Woody, thank you so much for everything!"

If you come across Fredericksburg Uncorked Wine Tours, stop your search and make the booking.   Organizing a wine tour for 18 girls as part of a bachelorette party was a breeze with Woody, the owner/operator of Uncorked. He gave great advice, offered competitive pricing (especially for the expectant mothers/non-drinkers in our group), and was easy to communicate with. Woody was incredibly patient during the lead up to our tour, and then was a funny, gracious, and attentive guide during our wine tasting experience.   Our tour was fantastic from start to finish, and I can't recommend Woody and the rest of the Fredericksburg Uncorked team highly enough. All (18) of us had the greatest time!"

I called him Friday morning at 8:50 hoping I'd get a call back before the 10 am tour and I did ten min later and I was able to get on his first tour . I honestly called three or 4 more tours throughout the week and left messages and he is the only one that called me back. Not only did woody come through, he came through at the last minute when I thought We weren't going to make a tour.  He was funny , knowledgeable and overall a great guide. He even recommended a few things that weren't apart of the tour (Alamo Springs Cafe) which we ended up going to and was delicious.  Lunch was not included but the place we went to was pretty great for a sandwich . I'd hang out and grab a beer with woody any night !  Thank you for making my boyfriends birthday a good one !!"

                "description": "Woody was nice at the beginning but there was miscommunication about lunch and he decided to take it upon himself to charge my credit card without my permission. I was upset and apparently he was too so he threw customer service out the window. I never agreed to Woody keeping my credit card information on file after he charged the wine tour for 11 girls (almost $1,300).   The driver Tommy was nice but he did nothing special and didn't know the basics of Woody's business. Had he known even a little bit about Uncorked Tours, there wouldn't have been confusion about lunch.   As far as the wine tour: William Chris and Lost Draw were my favorite wineries. Hye Market pretended we weren't there half of the time. Pontotoc was greedy with their pours.   Woody was very unprofessional and difficult to work with at the end. I would not recommend him. Book early to get the highest rated wine tours (2-3 months prior)!"

I called the number provided on the website and had a great conversation with Woody. He set up the perfect private winery tour for me and my friends on Sunday, since Saturday was full. It was a really great and memorable experience and I would definitely consider doing it again! We had our own spacious limo that we could sip on wine we brought with us, as well as some we purchased at the wineries we visited, while driving from one vineyard to the next (drive time between each location was max. 15 minutes). Overall a great experience!"

My driver clearly had everything under control, so I was able to relax with my friends and start the party as soon as we got on the bus!  Our kids were so jealous when they saw the cool bus their moms' were leaving them in!  Honestly, the bus could have driven us anywhere and we would have had a good time, but Santos' attention to picking great vineyards and James' attnetion to keeping us on schedule made everything perfect!  Our group was different than most -- in that we wanted to take it slow and just relax and were not too concerned about whether we made it to all three destinations.  We also had some nursing moms and wanted to be sure everyone was accomodated.  James was very accomodating and once I conveyed that we were more relaxed he made sure we had all the time we needed.  I also felt like the driving was very safe and overall the attention to safety was as it should be.  The price was reasonable, as well.  All in All, Keep Austin Wet made our vineyard tour perfect!"

Santos was so enthusiastic about hosting our party, which was a welcome relief as that is not always the response you get from tour companies when you tell them you're a bachelorette party--no matter how well-behaved you may be! Our driver, James, was wonderful and so helpful the entire day, especially at the end when we elected to add another hour and an extra stop; he catered his recommendation to our needs (gluten intolerant guests + casual interest in beer and liquor) and we had an amazing experience. You can't beat the pricing, but for what we paid our experience definitely exceeded every expectation. Thank you so much for everything, and we look forward to using you again in the future!"

He was quick to respond and helped me schedule a party bus big enough for all of us. David, our driver, showed up early and made sure we had everything we needed for the trip. He had a giant cooler with ice and waters that we were able to load up with seltzers. I booked our wineries ahead of time which made getting into the tastings a breeze. David made sure we got to each winery on time and went in ahead to ensure each winery was ready for us when we arrived. He even coordinated to have the band at one of the wineries sing Happy Birthday! David was absolutely fantastic, and we had a great time with him. We will definitely be booking with them again for our next trip. I highly recommend Open Range Tours to anyone visiting Fredericksburg!"

As we had a decent amount of guys with us- he suggest Garrison Brother's Distillery which ended up being a HUGE hit!  He was extremely professional, courteous and just an absolute delight to spend the day with!  He also has a wicked funny sense of humor.

A 15 passenger VAN showed up with a dent in the side and ripped seats. We were told we could bring coolers. We were only able to fit 8 adults in the van with our two coolers- no way we could've had another person in the van. None of the wineries had been scheduled yet and the ONE we had specifically requested was not available. We had to scramble ourselves to find wineries, in which we were promised everything would be done ahead of time. The meat and cheese tray that was promised was a small tray that was bought during the tour at a convenient store to feed 2 people. Our driver was great, however the owner did not deliver what was promised and we were highly disappointed. There are plenty of companies to choose from, and I would NOT recommend Open Range."

                "description": "We went to Fredericksburg for a girls trip and wanted to spend a day at the distilleries and breweries. David was fantastic to work with planning everything out. I wouldn't have changed any of that part. But, once the day rolled around we were met with a hiccup. The driver, not David like I was anticipating after multiple conversations, arrived in a mustang for 5 of us. Obviously that wasn't going to work so I was offered by the driver only to cancel or reschedule. Our trip was planned around spending our day out and about so cancelling wasn't an option for us. After a phone call to David, we were assured our day wasn't ruined just a bit delayed. The driver left and showed back up with an SUV and away we went. The driver wasn't interactive and she didn't seem to even be having a good day... It happens I get it but come on. Anyway, we made the best of our day and enjoyed ourselves. When we were dropped off, I tried to pay but she said to get with David. No problem but I did have a problem with her then saying that she'd go ahead and take the gratuity and that the standard is 20%. I didn't even know what our total cost was to figure 20% but asking for the gratuity before I even paid for the day was in poor taste. We did go ahead and tip, and well mind you, because that's the kind of people we are. I ended up calling David and finishing out the transaction and once again, he was a pleasure to deal with. Overall, we'll use them again because I appreciated David that much. But, I'll definitely make sure we don't have the same driver. 5 stars for David but 4 stars overall for the above mentioned."

                "description": "I rented a party bus through this company a couple weeks ago. In the beginning, Robert was extremely accommodating and friendly. And our driver, Terrell, was great. We got dropped off at COTA for a show and had a great time!  But where it turned south was at the end of the night. I texted our driver 30 minutes before we needed to be picked up (like he requested) and he said no problem. Then we left the concert and were walking to the pickup spot where I gave him a call. He said he got in an accident but would only be 20 minutes and I said that's fine. 20 minutes roll by and I gave him a call again, no answer, but texted and said it would be another 20 minutes. We ended up waiting in the cold for almost an hour and well after most people had left COTA. Multiple people in our party ended up just taking ubers because they didn't want to wait. The whole point of a bus is so you don't have to wait.  The next day, I texted Robert saying we would like a refund for the extra hour we paid for waiting that we wouldn't have used if we had been picked up on time. He said he would call to discuss but never did. I've now sent him multiple emails - mind you, being incredibly nice about it. All I asked for was an hour refunded back - not the whole thing, not even half. But still no response.  The customer service level of this company is terrible should anything go wrong. So hire them at your own risk."

                "description": "Apologies for this review being so incredibly late but Austin Nites was the best! We had rented a party bus on pretty short notice to take a Bachelor Party to and from Lake Travis and Robert and team were amazing.   It was also Prom weekend so the schedule was packed for them but they still took care of us and worked with our schedule.   Our boat ended up staying out on the water longer than scheduled which through our plans all over the place and Robert was there waiting on time. Given his packed schedule, the driver did have to leave without us but Robert made sure to get me in contact with another service and they sent a bus over right away.   All in all, it was an incredible experience!"

Missing panels inside of bus missing or duct tape together.  Another party bus parked next to the one we had and it was so obvious how terrible looking our bus looked.   Can't believe owners would let this bus represent their company. Hope they use our $700 toward getting it fixed.   Driver was pleasant."

But how is that supposed to work when you have a huge group? I called austin nites party rentals for a few reasons 1. I love puns and 2. I'm am austinite and 3. My group was over ten people and we wanted to go out and have nothing to worry about. Great party bus, great personable driver, great experience definitely reccomend these guys!! DONT DRINK AND DRIVE!! Call someone you can trust call Austin Nites!!"

                "description": "I'm incredibly frustrated with this business.  We had spoken a couple times in the months before I decided to book and I initially felt great about potentially booking with these friendly people.  When it came time to book I called them and was told, once again, that our requested date was open and we talked out an agreement.  The owner tells me we're good to go, and that all he needed me to do now was to send him my information so that he could get a contract sent that same day.  I'd explained to him that I was booking this bus ride to and from a party boat, and that I would be booking with them that day as well.   SO, I get off the phone and send my info.  I call my party boat folks to let them know I've just confirmed my bus, and I'm ready for a boat.  I book with them based on my discussion with these guys and put down $400 to hold our reservation.  It's been two weeks since I last spoke with this company and they have ignored my calls, texts, voicemails trying to figure out why the contract hasn't come through.  Our event is next month, and at this point I've been researching new solutions, and unfortunately the new solution means I can't use the same boat company, and therefore I've lost my $400 deposit.  I did not have this money to lose, but after being ghosted by this company I guess I have to take the loss and move on.  They seem like nice people, and it takes A LOT to get on here and write a negative review, but this has caused me a lot of stress and I want to prevent this from happening to anyone else.  I hope at some point I find out a reasonable explanation and can revise this review, but not counting on it.  We'll see I guess."

                "description": "BOOK WITH THIS COMPANY!  Robert did a solid job taking me and a bunch of my friends to Lake Travis and back on July 4th. His price was WAY lower than other companies I called, being the ONLY one that actually sticked to his regular prices during this busy day. He arrived early and was 100% responsive to my emails and phone calls. He arrive early to pick us up and was extremely friendly and professional. He helped us carry our coolers and accommodate everything on the bus.  The bus itself is amazing. Seats are stacked in two rows facing each other, which is great for dancing and socializing, since you are actually facing half of the crowd. The sound system is also very good. I almost feel that the bus trip was even more fun that the boat.   In summary, Austin Nites Ent. is the best on price/quality, Robert and his wife are responsive, professional and friendly, and the whole experience I had with them is positive. Would highly recommend anyone to use it, and will definitely consider using them again if I ever need to.  Thank you guys!!!!!"

                "description": "We rented a party bus from Robert for my brother's 30th birthday. They were one of the only companies I found that didn't increase their rates because of prom season. I called about 10 other companies looking for fun and safe travels with almost all of them being ridiculously overpriced to take advantage of the prom goers. Robert was very accommodating, professional, and had awesome rates. He called two days before the scheduled time of arrival to check in and verify everything was still good to go. He asked if there were any changes in the amount of people and offered a bigger bus just in case. Our drivers, Patrick and Joe were awesome! Patrick called me early the day of to verify everything and let me know he'd be there at 8 and then called again when they were almost to our pickup location. They arrived right on time with an awesome bus just for us. He had coolers with ice, a flat screen tv, music system, AC and even a bathroom in the back. What more could you ask for? Part of the evening was spent at Graham's Central Station in Pville. We didn't realize prior that Graham's doesn't serve food anymore and had to order pizza to the bus. Patrick gladly retrieved our pizza and brought it to us when it arrived. We all had a blast, felt safe and were taken care of. Highly recommend Austin NItes and shout out to Patty PartyWagon, if you had a Yelp page, I'd write a review for you too."

Sam, the owner and driver, was unbelievable. Very accommodating, great driver, and super chill.   We planned to hit up the Salt Lick on the party bus and then venture around to some breweries afterwards. Sam made sure that the group got where we needed to be on time, had great suggestions for breweries, and made sure we were having as much fun as possible.  The bus is great. Fit everyone comfortably with enough room for a cooler in between all of us. Sam had her playlist turned up or she would hand over the AUX cord and we could play our tracks as loud as we wanted. The whole experience was incredibly laid back and worry free. I would absolutely recommend Cool bus ATX to anyone that wants to have a great time with a big group in Austin.   On a side note, if it is Sunday, make sure that you buy beer on Saturday because they don't sell it on Sunday before noon.   Thanks again, Sam!"

He ended up being our driver on our own private bus for a 40th birthday trip with 4 crazy girls. He was at our beck and call and did not complain once. We had 3 wine tour stops and then Luckenbach, and it was soooo fun!  All 3 places were each different than the other which gave us a great variety. Thank you John for a wonderful time!"

It was so relaxing to sit back and enjoy the day with friends, all while knowing every detail had been taken care of.  This coming from a very \"type A\" personality is a huge 5 star! We did the \"red rose\" package, touring 3 wineries and had a few hours in Luckenbach.  John was friendly, fun and a great host. All we had to do is drink wine, visit with friends and enjoy the day! If you are looking for a fun experience, try Yellow Rose! We will be back next year to do it all over again!"

                "description": "Do not use this \"tour\"!! It is cheaper to pay the tasting fees and hire your own driver. The owner is greedy and a complete A. We originally had 5 ladies who were going on the tour with us and one backed out. We didn't ask for a private tour and John (who I'm guessing is the owner) didn't tell us until we were already at the first location that he would stop the tour until we paid for a fifth person that wasn't there. No wonder he kept pushing cash, it was a complete rip off. It was either go home after that tour paying $125 a person..Or have two more tours while paying for a person who wasn't there. PS it's about $15 for the wine tastings. ($15x3=$45) It was not worth it. On a positive note, Gary at Hanhe Estates winery was amazing. Highly recommend this guy and his wine."

                "description": "\"Tour\" is an awfully strong word. We were picked up and then drove for 45 minutes without our driver, John, saying a word about where we were going or how long it would take to get there. He then picked up 3 other people when it was supposed to be a private tour. He took us to the wineries but never said a word about where to go or what to do. He followed us around at the wineries and sat with us. He was 30 minutes late then forgot what the schedule was supposed to be and tried to keep us at the 2nd winery until 30 minutes after we were supposed to be home. He told us we could pay with cash or card, but he only actually took cash or PayPal, which put some people in a real bind. He hounded us about payment the whole time. It was awful and we will never do it again."

                "description": "10/10 would recommend Moon's Vineyard Voyages to anyone looking for a good time in Fredericksburg! Ginger was the absolute best driver and guide!! We had a group of 6 ladies on our trip and it was easy to communicate and book our tour with Moon's Voyages. We did the half-moon tour on a Saturday morning/afternoon. Ginger arrived at our Airbnb with the bus on time and after picking up other people at their various locations, we reached 4.0 Cellars for our first tasting. Our second tasting was at Hye Meadow Winery followed by lunch at Hye Market, where our lunches were ready on the table for us! We finished the day at Fat Ass Ranch and Winery before all being taken back to our respective locations. All 3 tastings were amazing! We never felt rushed or that we were on any type of time crunch. We were able to enjoy every glass and had no worries about who would have to be the designated driver. Ginger was so much fun and the absolute sweetest! She made our tour a blast by keeping us safe and making us laugh!"

                "description": "If you're staying In Fredericksburg and want to do a wine tour, be sure to call up Brandon at Moon's Vineyard Voyage. My boyfriend surprised me with this during our weekend getaway. Brandon was super friendly and knowledgeable of the area and the different things to do in Fredericksburg. He picked everyone up from where they were staying, which was awesome. The first place he took us was to was Fiesta Winery. This place was my absolute favorite! We were allowed to pick 6 wines to try and we got to keep our tasting glasses. I got lucky and liked all 6 of mine! The next stop was the Garrison Brothers Distillery. Bourbon on a wine tour?! Super unique. This consisted of a tour of the distillery and we learned how bourbon was made. We got to try it every stage of the process. And they also taught us how to enjoy a glass of bourbon. It wasn't my cup of tea, however it was a cool experience and my boyfriend loved it! For lunch, we had some awesome sandwiches at the Hye Market. Super yummy! Our last stop was the Hye Meadow Winery. Also a cute winery. We had such a great time on this tour. Brandon gave us his card and told us to call him directly if we ever want to do it again, that way we don't do the same tour twice. We live up the road in Austin, so we definitely will be coming back very soon!  Pro tip, eat before you go on this tour! You will be drinking a lot!"

She kept us up to date on how much longer we had at each winery so we could time our experience appropriately. She also made sure everyone got free water if they wanted it. Anything that was purchased was also taken to the van for us and stored safely! I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great way to experience the wineries in Fredericksburg!"

He picked us up at our hotel and took a ton of pictures for us at each stop. Immediately after one of us purchased something, he wrote our names on it and stored it safely on the bus. He allowed us to hook up our bluetooth in the bus so we can have our own choice of music. We never once felt rushed to get to the next winery, either! Among the things already mentioned, he provided bottled water, opened all the doors for us, and gave us great Fredericksburg recommendations!"

My husband and I were taking a few days off after our wedding and this was a great activity. We tried great wine and beers and everything was already setup for us when we arrived at each place. They all had a heads up about our recent nuptials too apparently, and made sure to take care of us :)   We ended up in a private limo which was a lot of fun but sounds like a great options for groups too! I highly recommend."

Hen was knowledgable, affable, and gracious even though this wasn't a very profitable day for him. He gave us a great selection of wineries based on our preferences and we had a nice sandwich lunch at Hye Market. He even carried the boxes of wine/beer to our hotel room."

The transportation (van) was very clean and well-taken care of. We had the van to ourselves on the couple's tour but it can easily fit a big party!  Booking a couple's wine tour on their website was super easy (and I'm sure it would be for big groups too)! The date availability, cost estimate, and customizability is spot-on. The moment you book, they send you a comprehensive list of wineries and distilleries (!!!) with rankings of the view + wine. They also have great options for add-ons, such as a charcuterie board or stopping by for lunch mid-wine tour. Love that.  There's no doubt I would choose and recommend 830 Elevated again for any future wine excursions in Hill Country. Thanks again, Brayden and Deb :)"

                "description": "We had the absolute BEST time with Brayden on our tour. From start to finish everything was so easy and customizable to what we were looking for while planning our annual girls trip. Prices are incomparable with Five Star treatment on a PRIVATE tour. Right after booking we got an email with a list of the area wineries and restaurants that had notes and ratings so we could choose where we wanted to go. This is a private tour so Brayden picked us up right in front of our Airbnb and we were off. We toured four wineries and he kept us on schedule but never rushing us. After the tours we opted for the night service so he dropped us off on Main Street so we could grab dinner, sing some karaoke and when ready to be picked up to end the evening just had to shoot him a text and he was there. We just cannot say enough good things about this company. Do not second guess - book with Brayden and Deb"

They were on time and very accommodating, went as far as going to buy a stool for my friend who has trouble getting up and down the steps to the van. The wineries they took us to were exactly what we asked for. We never felt rushed and they handled everything for us and we never had to lift a finger to do anything. I would 100% recommend them and will definitely be using them again!"

                "description": "I came across 830 when our bed and breakfast cancelled our room and wine tour reservation (due to remodeling) a month before our 10 year anniversary trip to Fredericksburg. I believe they were on the city website as a recommended tour, but also Google directed me to them. Either way, I am so glad it happened this way - our experience with 830 was indeed elevated!!! The customized tour that Deb set up with me over the phone was exactly what my husband and I wanted - a distillery, a brewery, and a winery that made you feel like you were in Napa. Without even knowing us, Deb helped picked the perfect places for us to enjoy. Communication up until the tour and the day of the tour was prompt and courteous, always with our best intentions in mind (example: Deb texted us and offered to pick us up even earlier than planned due to the heat at one of the outdoor locations). The drive in between locations was full of great conversation, and we were thankful they provided cold water for us. The van was immaculate and the drive was very comfortable - I didn't know the luxury that a private vs public tour would offer! Deb was so knowledgeable (she's a local, of course!) and so sweet with helping us newbies figure out what to do. Her service went above and beyond, and she made us feel like celebrities. It was an absolute pleasure to work with them - do yourself the best favor and book with them!!"

They made the trip so easy, worry-free, and fun! Brayden and Deb were super communicative and gave us a wide variety of wineries to choose from. We ended up going to Baron's Creek, Signor, and Augusta Vin. Deb was our tour guide and took care of absolutely everything and was such a joy to be around. If you are headed to Fredericksburg and wanting to visit the wineries, you won't regret choosing to book through 830 Elevated!!"

We were able to customize our winery stops which was not the experience we had previously with a different wine tour company. We spent the day with our group of four instead of getting shuttled around with strangers to fill seats (which I really prefer)! We requested a charcuterie board in the vehicle and Brayden picked it up while we were at one of our stops. We will definitely be back and use 830 Elevated for all of our future trips!"

                "description": "I like their hustle. Wife and I wanted a private custom tour (because COVID). But the best we could find was a limo driver that would charge us almost what it would for 4 people. Then we found 830 Elevated. They're filling a niche most tour companies aren't by providing an affordable private tour option for couples. They were great. Small, young company. They don't have deep knowledge on wine like veteran companies but they are personable in that they also tour wineries themselves and can share their inputs."

                "description": "The worst experience. Here's my story-   I booked with this company over a month in advance prior to my trip to Fredericksburg for my fiancé and I's anniversary, as well as his birthday. After booking, the company was very communicative for the first few days. After the first few days, I did not hear a word from them until the week of our trip. I had told them a month in advance which places we wanted to go. The week of, they inform us that Augusta vin is not taking people for reservations. Which was fine, we went ahead with the other vineyard they had suggested. We had booked for a Saturday. That Friday at 3:00AM, they had informed us of a change of driver due to a family emergency which we completely understood, and now that our pickup time had changed to 11:30AM instead of 1:30PM. I wake up to that email Saturday still understanding, and we changed our plans to be at the pickup destination by 11:30AM. We are waiting there over 15 minutes for them to show, and no one does. We call, leave voicemails, and still hear from no one. 30 minutes passed, they send a TEXT MESSAGE informing us they aren't showing up for the entire time and that we are on our own for the entire day. LEAVING OUR PLANS FOR THE ENTIRE DAY RUINED. Incredibly horrid communication from this company. DO NOT BOOK WITH THIS COMPANY!!!! I seriously am understanding that situations happen in life, but they had guaranteed us a driver for the day regardless of what had happened. I was truly heartbroken to have not received a personal phone call from the company, instead they just send us a text that they are not coming. I have NEVER written a review for a company before, but this needed to be shared. We discussed the situation with multiple locals in the town, no one had ever heard of this company. Whatever you do, save your money and time."

They are absolutely fantastic. This company is top notch and I highly recommend them. I just came back from visiting the area with my sisters and niece. We booked a 4hr reservation with Kirchman's, so that we could visit 3 wineries for tastings. George, our driver, was so kind and accommodating. He even took photos of us at each winery and texted them all to me. The vehicle used for transporting us was nice and clean. He offered us bottled water and kept our wine purchases safe at our various stops. Whenever we were ready to head to the next location, all I had to do was text him that we were walking out and he rolled right on up in the car. Convenient and awesome customer service! I will definitely use them again next time I visit the area."

                "description": "So, first want to start off by saying that Rick saved our entire trip to Fredericksburg. We contacted him late Thursday night when our original plans fell through. He was super responsive and able to get us in on the upcoming Saturday.   The bus itself is really nice, great sound system. Rick and Erica texted us before we arrived to ask if we wanted an array of coffee from the coffee bar on board and we were greeted with our orders. We also had so many snacks and drinks available.  One of the greatest things is that this isn't a preselected tour and you can go where you please during the allotted time. They even dropped us in town for dinner at the end of our time.   We can't thank them enough and highly recommend using this service in Fredericksburg. Thanks for making our girls trip amazing!"

Rick was very easy to communicate with during the planning process, the day before our trip and the morning of our pick-up. The bus was perfect for our group- modern, comfortable, clean, and stocked with waters, snacks and custom coffee options. Rick always there when we were ready to travel to our next destination. We were sad to see our trip come to an end. We would book with him again and highly recommend!"

                "description": "Had a fantastic time visiting the Fredericksburg wine country with Valet for a Day. We had 6 adults, but our bus would have easily held double that (I didn't count the seats).  Rick was our main point of contact for inquiries, as well as our driver for the day. He was super easy to work with and helped us figure out what we really wanted to do. We had to get picked up from the Horseshoe Bay Resort (which is about an hour from Fredericksburg). So, we were able to visit two wineries (Becker and Bingham) and one distillery (Garrison Brothers). Garrison Brothers was the favorite by far and we ended up eating lunch there, too. Garrison also has tours starting at 10 while most wineries don't start until 11. Rick helped me work out a feasible schedule and then I had to book the tours themselves (which was more of a challenge than I thought because you're trying to coordinate specific times for specific places and one site will time out before you finalize, etc). So, by the time those were booked, we ended up having to alter our schedule and Rick was great about it. He showed up on time. The bus itself was fabulous. He had custom coffee orders ready for us, plus sodas and water onboard, as well as snacks (bags of chips, crackers, Snackens, etc). We were on time for every tour and never felt rushed. We were also back on time, which was important to me since we had to pick up our kids from the kids club. We paid a deposit up front and the balance a few days before our tour. Then, we paid tips in cash on the day of. I would absolutely recommend them and would use them again."

The view is unbeatable, it's absolutely gorgeous. They also have a dug out cave under the property where they store their wine. Contact them about setting up a tour for a really unique, awesome winery experience. They wines were great and cheaper than if you go further down 290 to Fredericksburg. On another note- Sam took AMAZING Care of us. He was super knowledgeable, personable, and made sure our glasses didn't go empty. We absolutely will be back!"

Lots of great photo opportunities here too. There's a cellar downstairs where they have the barrels. Get a tour to understand the careful decisions they made to make these amazing wines! Owners are also on site and so knowledgeable. It's hard to meet people that are so dedicated to high quality grapes and quality oak. I've been to a few wineries around lake Travis and this one is my favorite by far. The wines are dry wines. They are not sweet!  Definitely worth a drive here!"

The chenin blanc and rose had enough buttery and/or spicy notes to be enjoyed during the winter. Their reds are impressive as well. We liked the Temptation. They do tastings and will throw together a mean cheese board. The day we went we got a spicy pepper jack that was lovely. There's plenty of outdoor seating, abs that's where you really want to be to soak up the Hill Country views."

Once we arrived, the spectacular view gave us pause. We loved the service from Sam, who is passionate about wine. It was so educational hearing about the grapes used to make the wine and how they harvest them. We did an extended tasting and loved all of it.

The staff are laid back and not pushy. We usually enjoy one bottle on their awesome deck. It sports views of the hill country and on a nice day is tough to beat. They also allowed us to bring our own snacks and set up our own charcuterie board. This is a major plus for me as some wineries don't allow this. Don't change this please; for me it easily earns 2 stars on its own.  Really can't think of anything bad to say. Great experience and hoping to make a third visit!"

                "description": "My family visited the winery to celebrate my parent's wedding anniversary. They are wine lovers so my siblings and I wanted to take them on a wine tour discovering what the hill country has to offer.  We came across this winery after searching numerous lists and reviews, and can I say we were more than delighted by our experience.  From the start we were amazed at the breathtaking location.  The cliff side view evoked a sense of peace and tranquility that we thoroughly enjoyed while sampling the delicious wines. Chip had such an infectious personality introducing us to the different blends while also interweaving many funny anecdotal stories related to each bottle.  It was a very different experience from other tastings, where our guide gave a more dry delivery of the wine selection not invoking as much feeling toward specific blends.  Not only was Chip a great ambassador for your vineyard, but the pièce de résistance was Doug's tour of the barrel room.  Doug's breadth of knowledge and true passion for wines made us appreciate more not only the wine but the vineyard as well.  It is always so exciting for us when we encounter other individuals who have such heartfelt passion for what they do.  We were a captivated audience from start to finish, and truly felt like we were talking to an old friend about our love for wine.  The years of hard work and family incorporated into growing the winery shows and was so refreshing to witness.  We drove back home and couldn't seem to stop talking about the winery and how great of a time we all had. My parent's loved the trip and now have a wonderful memory for their anniversary.  We've already been discussing future trips to come and enjoy dinner in the barrel room, so we will definitely be back!"

                "description": "They say getting there is half the fun! That's definitely true of Hawk's Shadow Winery, accessible only by narrow ranch roads that wind through some of the prettiest parts of Texas Hill Country.  The end of the drive is just as pretty - the patio offers plenty of shaded tables with sweeping views of the surrounding hills.  Since it was 100º when we visited, we opted to sit in the equally impressive, air-conditioned tasting room with high ceilings and glass doors that roll up in more temperate weather.   The premium tasting will set you back $14 for six wines.  I enjoyed the white wines the best.  The 2016 Juliette Riesling and 2015 Luna de Oro orange Muscat blend were both clear and crisp. The 2014 Temptation tempranillo was on the hazy side.  My server also gave me a bonus tasting of the 2013 Wild Child, a syrah blend that I really liked.  I ended up taking a bottle home."

                "description": "I wanted to visit Hawk's Shadow due to the highly rated reviews on Yelp. Could this place really be as good as they all say?! It is! It just may be my new favorite winery around Dripping Springs/Driftwood.  TASTING: Tasting menu offered good balance of 3 whites + 3 reds ($14 for 6), all distinct in flavor. All were high quality - smooth, dry, great finishes and easy to drink. I was impressed with every single one! The Cab Blend (Fortitude) was my fav. Pours were a decent size and several different people served us; each gave a detailed flavor profileandhistory on the wine, which I always appreciate. What I enjoyed here that is different from other wineries is that they give you time to enjoy your tasting and savor each wine. Not once did we feel rushed. It was relaxing to simply chill on the patio, feel the nice breeze, take in the view, and slowly sip while chatting.   ATMOSPHERE: 10/10. Its a bit of a drive and more secluded than other wineries in area, but SO worth! Views are top notch. You can enjoy the panoramic picturesque Hill Country backdrop from indoors (glass windows from top to floor) or outside on the covered shaded patio. You feel like you're out in the middle of the country on a nice retreat away from the hustleandbustle of the city.   SERVICE: From the initial email where I made a reservation to the minute I left the winery, I felt well taken care of. Hawk's Shadow offers excellent customer serviceanda warm family feel. Staff is really friendly, courteous and engaging. I loved the personal touch of the owners walking around to greet customers/chat- definitely tops other wineries in terms of service.   Everyone in our group loved Hawk's Shadow and I will definitely be back. They offer the same gorgeous panoramic views as Driftwood Estate Winery (arguably, even better), but have WAY better wineandservice. So, if you're thinking about checking out Driftwood Estates, skip the crowds and check out this hidden gem instead!"

                "description": "The greatest hospitality! Feel like I just allowed to get tips, education and experience without being put down. So many of the \"wine road 290\" wineries feel they are too busy or prestigious to speak common \"wine\" language. Not here! We called ahead, as recommended by website. The GPS was accurate. A beautiful hilly route- just trust it!!! We were greeted -Sunday afternoon-as the Hawk shadow team was just cleaning up after a grape stomp. They invited us in to the warehouse to see the 14 vats at different stages of processing. It was very interesting to see the D stemming and the foam on the top of the juice. Sam then gave us a tasting. $16 for 4 wines and $20 for 6 wines.  Very Good blends with the different combinations from regional wines and Canadian Texas grapes. I loved the \" tuck under \" cellar. You take the spiral stairs down to the basement to get the \"barrel room\" experience.  The name Hawk Shadow is very heartfelt as well. The winery is named after their horse, hawk shadow who passed away in 2007.  In addition to the very spacious tasting room they have two different levels of patios and you can have awesome events there as well overlooking the beautiful Hill country. It's really worth the drive from San Antonio. Thank you Sam and Hawk shadow. I wish more wineries would realize that your total experience is based on not only the taste of their wines but how you are treated! Thanks and we'll definitely be back!"

                "description": "A great winery!  This is a beautiful winery and a great stop if you plan on visiting the other winery nearby or salt lick BBQ. Everyone is exceptionally helpful, they have a very comfortable tasting room, but I felt the tasting was way overpriced, so I decided to just buy a bottle of the Fall Creek Vineyards Tempranillo to drink while the rest of the group had their tasting.   They have an impressive operation and make some wonderful wines, definitely worth the stop. Cheers!"

Got to get one of the bottles for a present and an edged glass to keep.  I plan to visit Texas in a near future and this is one place that I plan to come back again. Wine first and bbq later.  Of all of the wines Mourvedre was our favorite."

I love coming out here for a wine tasting and enjoying the outside patio and having the vineyard to explore. The landscape is gorgeous and the staff are so knowledgeable and friendly.  Most importantly, the wine is delicious.    Pro tip- for an additional $8 you can add on an extra tasting of the ExTerra Tempranillo (usually a $100 bottle). It's amazing and a must try."

We took a few bottles home. When we tried the Tempranillo and it swept us off our feet. We have since found some of these wines in our local Houston Spec's.   The facility is clean and the grounds are well kept. The restrooms are also clean!!! Our host was simply amazing and went above and beyond to explain the process and enjoyed the discussion describing the notes we would/did experience. Really enjoyed the entire experience."

                "description": "TLDR: relaxing atmosphere with nice white wines. Good on the spectrum of Texas wines but not on the level of French or Napa wines.  This is a great spot right across the street from salt lick. Parking lot is gravel but there's plenty of parking available. Hostess was extremely friendly and great conversation.  The wines themselves are good- we especially loved the Chardonnay and reserve wines. Based on Texas wineries, I have to say this is hands down one of the better vineyards. That being said, I have a deep love for Russian river valley wines (especially green valley pinots and Chardonnay's) and Texas grapes just don't measure up. Is that an unfair comparison? Probably.  Overall highly recommend visiting and supporting local. You'll want this on your wine tasting list of stops for sure, and best of all it's fairly close to Austin."

                "description": "Fall Creek Vineyards totally exceeded our expectations! We have been super strict about staying home during COVID-19, but my #1 birthday wish was to get out ... in a safe way. With young children. My husband called Fall Creek ahead of time and was told that kids were allowed and that there was plenty of outdoor space.   We arrived around 2pm on a Wednesday afternoon and were greeted by a super friendly and knowledgeable gentleman. I wish I had grabbed his name, because he was seriously amazing. He let us know that a food purchase was required to be served on premise, which was not a problem at all because everything looked delicious (we chose a cheese platter), and gave us a wine menu as well.   We selected our own seats and were able to stay away from the party that came in after us. Our sommelier was so knowledgeable and provided everything in a COVID-19 safe way. He was also super sweet to our kids, even though our three year old was crushing crackers on the table (we cleaned up after him before we left but it was still so embarrassing).   All of the wines were delicious. We ended up leaving with their Tempranillo, their Sauvignon-blanc (vintners-selection) and two souvenir glasses.   We spent about an hour at Fall Creek, which ended up being the total highlight of my birthday, but could have spent more time there exploring their beautiful grounds  had we not had a dinner reservation."

                "description": "Texas has great wines.  A short drive from Austin (right across from Salt Lick) you can spend a few hours in the vineyard, sit in the patio, or stay inside. Of course, there is wine tasting and a variety of bottles for sale.  Fall Creek makes wines in all price points. From the quite good inexpensive wines to award-winning bottles for people who really know their reds. I am a fan of their Tempranillo.  If you are in Austin, it's worth a visit!"

My mom's in town so I wanted to take her to a winery semi-close to Austin but not too far away. ENTER: Fall Creek. It's been recommended to me by several friends so figured I'd check it out for myself:  PROS: Seriously the nicest staff in the world. Thank you Daniel! Plenty of socially distanced tables and chairs in LOTS of different areas of the winery A bottle of their amazing Sauvignon Blanc - $22! Great snacks to accompany (I got Pimento cheese) They had live music on a Saturday with a full band. swoon! Across the street from Salt Lick if you want foods  CONS: Seriously none. Couldn't have asked for a more perfect day. Can't wait to visit again!   Pro tip: go to Desert Door nearby for more fun. :)"

                "description": "FCV at Driftwood is a nice little winery, with seating indoors and out. When we were visiting, there was only one other guest present (midday Tuesday). As a personal recommendation, if you're trying to social distance, I would suggest visiting here only during the weekdays when it's less busy, otherwise it may seem too crowded since the place is on the smaller side.  The food menu mainly consists of cheese and snacks that go well with wine but it's a little overpriced. The staff was nice but they were just there for the most part, nothing more to enhance our experience.   3/5 staff/service 4/5 nicely decorated interior and exterior 5/5 with the right company"

We opted for two full glasses of their most standout wines and although it was much more expensive wine than I'm used to, we did get a generous pour. The backyard terrace is peaceful and has many seating options. I would've loved to see an option where you could do a wine tasting outdoors, perhaps the same way you order a beer flight. I saw this because wine tastings are only offered inside."

Our 2nd stop was Falls Creek....it was so pretty with perfect sunny weather and enough seating inside and out. Covid is still among us so they offer hand santizers but you bring your own mask. Most patrons didn't have on of course once they had their wine in hand.   We opted to sit outdoors. Tables are 3-4 ft apart in some spots so choose within your comfort zone for social distancing. We grabbed a quick glass of wine and made our way to the next stop.   Looking forward to returning with the hubby this summer."

We requested the tasting - 5 wines that are pre-selected, you aren't able to choose.  After the second (extremely small) pour, we had to request water.  Decided to order a couple of apps for the group..we were brought store made hummus and pimento cheese - still in the plastic container, propped on a plate with a wrapped package of crackers.  Had to request small plates, which seemed to surprise our server.  By the end of the tasting we were all sweating as the sun was beating down on us and there seemed to be no AC. The wines were okay, but the experience and service could have been much better.  I wouldn't return."

                "description": "I've had my fair share of vineyards from local like Grape Creek in Fredericksburg then to Castello di Amorosa in Napa Valley. I was embarrassed after taking my family to experience the wine tasting here. Although, some of the wine were fairly tasty, but the serving was small compared to the vineyards I mentioned in the beginning. I had never been to a wine tasting with a pour stopper that was new to me. Mind you they charge $20 per person for wine tasting. We were observing a table near us that was getting extra pour from the pour stopper technique. We decided to order 2 cheese plates ($25/plate) that came in this container after we finished it, which was a small portion by the way. We noticed that the container said \"Best By: 2/12\" we visited 2/13. So we alerted our server she politely checked with the back she was told that it meant Arrived By, which to me was odd. If it was \"Arrived By\" I think that's what they would've put on the container but I guess just to shut us up.  As to COVID capacity the patio was full we couldn't wait to leave. This is my family and I's experience I wish it could've been better."

It's basically an outpost of the parent company in California. Based in Paso Robles, Graveyard Vineyards is a small producer. The wines offered are all grown and made in California.   We opted for the tasting. They offered 6 wines for $15. We enjoyed generous pours of 2 whites, 1 rose, 2 reds, and a dessert wine. All of them were very good! You can tell their not Texas wines (in a good way!).   The staff was incredibly helpful. They offered tastings outside and were very attentive! I would absolutely recommend stopping by if you're in the area.   If you can grab a Malbec, do it!"

                "description": "Our family was in town from CA and we decided we would go wine tasting locally and try some Texas wines. The wineries prior, all staff wore masks which was nice since we had a couple high risk individuals in our group. When we arrived at Graveyard, the outside was not impressive, not exactly the winery ambience. Once we got inside, the male was not wearing a mask (ok... fine... mask mandate lifted.... ) but he then told me I could take off my mask standing about a foot away, and I told him no I can't, we have high risk individuals. He then said to go outside for the tasting which we did. But honestly, who tells people to take off their masks or suggest they take off their masks during a pandemic? He has noooo idea of our health conditions, concerns or even has the right to even suggest on the matter. I was definitely taken back.  Once we went outside the table was just covered in pollen and debris and leaves. We were all so itchy from all the leaves under the table. Just no grooming or landscaping or care given to the on-site property. It was not a relaxing atmosphere whatsoever, as mentioned prior, a parking lot view/feeling.  The female local staff member had superb customer service, but again, in our faces pouring wine with no mask on. Out of the wineries we went to that day, this is the ONLY place where they were mask free. Although the mask mandate was lifted, we're still in the midst of a major pandemic and felt other establishments honored that respectfully. We felt very safe at all the wineries prior.   Grapes not from Texas.   Pros: Wine was good."

                "description": "Graveyard is a brand new addition to the winery community in Drip, having opened in late January. They are an offshoot of a parent winery in Paso Robles, CA. The wines they sell are all produced, bottled and shipped here from that operation. They do yet carry the entire CA inventory but do plan to increase the Texas offerings.   The wines available include a couple of Graveyard's more affordable blends - Paso Tombstone White and the red blend from that line. Both are pleasant, sippable blends at a very reasonable price point. The red was light slightly complex mix of common reds produced at the parent vineyard. They also stock Ascender, a credible Brut. Their estate Cab is actually very good- a lighter Cab with a nice effect on the palate.   The lounge itself is pleasant and airy without being pretentious. The staff, especially manager Adam, are all personable and informative."

Graveyard expects you to take three shipments and are unwilling to cancel your membership before you pay for, and receive three shipments.  I have received two shipments and did not want any more Graveyard wine.  When I reached out to the wine club, the response was \"you are asked to received three shipments; you've had two.  Your third one is coming up.\"  I am going to be candid here.  I just don't care for the wines.  I know others like them very much.  My sister, who lives near the tasting room in Dripping Springs, loves the wine.  There is nothing wrong with the wine; I just don't care for it and I think two shipments is enough to make up my mind.  I conveyed my feelings to the wine club manager and her solution was to downgrade me from a 12-bottle shipment to a 6-bottle shipment.  I really don't mean to knock Graveyard.  But my suggestion is to buy a case of wine and try it before you join the club.  I want to emphasize that there is nothing wrong with the wine; it just does not align with my tastes."

It was a relaxing time playing checkers and sipping wine under the trees, though. Our server was wonderful and covid-safe. Unfortunately, one staff wasn't wearing a mask, even inside, but we didn't have to deal with him much. We really enjoyed the wines. I know they are based out of Cali, but it was still nice to get a decent sparkling wine at a Texas vineyard. They were all good, but that was a nice surprise."

We were given a room temperature bottle of Rose and were told by the staff it was \"the usual temperature they sold Rose.\" I don't know about you, but I crave a cold Rose in this Texas heat. They ship in all of their wines from California so you won't find any Texas wines here either. Without good customer service or outstanding wine, we won't be back."

                "description": "You know how back in the day folks had a milkman? Well, I wanted a piece of that nostalgia but don't drink milk. What I do consume a decent amount of, though, is olive oil, so I went about getting myself a mOOn (yes, I did just combine man and olive oil and no, I'm not ashamed of it).   Really, I was low on olive oil and missed my window for my grocery delivery so took the opportunity to support local and explore Texas Hill Country Olive Co.'s offerings.  The website is super easy to navigate and they have a wide variety of olive oil and vinegars, along with bundles of multiple if you don't know where to start. I received my order within a two-day window during the week from Xmas to NYE, without opting for any expedited shipment, so that was a lovely surprise.  I am a fan of anything chili or jalapeno, so I opted for their jalapeno-infused OO, along with two standard olive oils just to have on hand. The 100ml bottles run $12 each, not including shipping (my 250ml that I usually get from Imperfect Produce is $4.79), so a pretty stark contrast in price. I used the jalapeno on popcorn the other night, as well as toasted bread, and it didn't really have any kick to it, which was disappointing. I was hoping that for the price, it would be a boombastic flavor ball, so I could justify its purchase and continue to patronize from my mOOn.   I am so happy I could support local, and maybe if I visited the estate, I would have a better appreciation for the product, but as a stand alone, I most likely won't be ordering again."

                "description": "Well that was underwhelming.. I read about the olive farm and thought it was something unique so we stopped by for a visit. Unfortunately I was told by one of the ladies in the shop that they suffered a huge loss in their crop a few years ago and the olive grove is still recovering.. Which meant that there isn't much to see in terms of the olive trees. I did an olive oil tasting but that in itself wasn't that memorable either. It felt a bit like a wasted trip to be honest.."

I bought several gift boxes for friends and colleagues; everyone was very excited to receive them. They also sell pesto artichokes in a glass jar packages with a cute wooden spreader. Shopping locally was a personal goal of mine this year. I thought this place was perfect! They gifted me a box of very delicious butter pecan cookies when they rang me up. I ate all of it in two mins... couldn't even remember what brand it was."

                "description": "I don't understand this place. It is basically a gift shop and a small restaurant. I wonder where the olives come from to make their myriad of products? Doest seem like the olive tree orchard is producing enough olives for more than a few martinis! We were greeted kindly at the door but there is really nothing to see here. We were expecting an opportunity to sample some of the products before purchasing but no tastings were offered or on display. So we are back to the fact that you drove here to enter a gift shop. Hmmm  p.s. I see after reading reviews thst perhaps large trees died last winter which is sad. It also appears that tastings are offered here but the kind lady who greeted us did not mention them sonperhaps they are scheduled or have been stopped for covid so check before you come so you aren't dissapointed like we were."

                "description": "Beautiful property although the olive trees look like they didn't survive the snowpocypse. You can walk around the property. Staff are very friendly. Supposedly the owner picks the grapes and they have a few types of wine that gets made somewhere else. Can't tell you how it is since I didn't feel like purchasing a glass or bottle. They don't do wine tastings anymore although there is a sign out front.   Their olive oil and balsamic vinegar was tasty on fresh bread. The flat bread was just that... flat. To a crisp. The margarita flavor meant some cheese and basil but not really any tomato flavor. Wouldn't recommend the flatbreads. It was a good idea but poorly executed."

                "description": "The place is really not worth visiting unless you're coming out for the tours. It's a gift shop where you can already buy mostly everything online to begin with. The restaurant menu is terribly overpriced for what you're getting on the plate. Think margherita pizza but at the size of a standard flour tortilla.  My recommendation is to save your money, go straight to the olive oil section in the store, buy in bulk, go home and create your own tray of olive oils and eat it however way you want to enjoy it.   The olive oils are exceptional by the way. Infused garlic, rosemary and sola stella were my favorite. If you're into balsamic, the strawberry infusion was a surprise crowd-pleaser in our house.   3/5 stars for the giftshop/restaurant location. If this was a review specifically for the olive oil, I would rate it much higher."

                "description": "In planning for our day trip, I thought about checking out an olive orchard. Years ago, I had read about Sandy Oaks olive orchard but never quite made it out to visit. On my search online, I found Texas Hill Country Olive Company in Dripping Springs. The timing might not have been the best since the arctic freeze affected the olive trees. We did see both mission and arbequina a year and a half old olive trees. Under the shade of the oak tree and a breeze, we sat to listen to Cara (one of the owners) share the history of how their family business started. With a brief visit with the resident chickens we headed indoors for the abridged version of the mill tour. Finally understood how extra virgin olive oil is made and not to ever buy light olive oil!  After the olive orchard and mill tour, we joined the tasting tour ($10). There were so many varieties of olive oil and balsamic vinegar and flavor profiles similar to wine tasting. I loved getting to combine the balsamic vinegar with the olive oil and tasting with the bread and apple.  It was fun shopping at the store. Goodness with making choices though! I knew I definitely wanted their olive-based products.  Next time we'll have to stay and enjoy some lunch."

We bought bread and olives and had a flight of olive oils to taste with small pieces of bread. They serve wine and beer too. The bistro had already closed but we will definitely be back. The staff was friendly and informative. We even walked into the olive grove to see the baby trees up close. The Sicialian olives with garlic are amazing. We also bough feta cheese olives. The caramel sauce we bought went great with Frederick peaches we bought on the way home. We also had some delicious Gelato which was cold enough to take to go."

We were able to snag a couple rocking chairs on their front patio and enjoy the beautiful weather. The Salumi plate was one of the more interesting charcuterie boards I've ever tried. The cheeses were on point, some sharp and others soft with herbs and spices. It could have used a bit more jam and crackers overall. The view off the porch was worth the stop itself. Would definitely recommend trying when in the area and I'm sure a tour would be fun when the trees are in season. I was disappointed they didn't have olive oil tastings going on due to Covid, but I also understand."

I am in LOVE with this spot.  I went last week for my Birthday with Brother and Sister-in-law.  It was wonderful.  The olive oil is probably the best I have ever had, I ended up buying a bunch of olive oil after lunch.  We sat for two plus hours, eating, drinking and just enjoying the scenery.  We were so incredibly lucky because the weather was amazing, and there was a beautiful breeze so it was cool and comfortable.

We've always wanted to do olive oil tastings and orchard tours in Italy, so were happy to find this until then. Unfortunately, due to the pandemic they aren't doing tastings at the moment. You can buy all the oils, as well as many other foodie items in their store. They also have a bistro with a nice menu, we came after eating lunch so didn't get to try anything. We tasted a few wines and thought they were okay, a little too acidic for our palates. The highlight was walking through the orchard and seeing the olive trees. I'd like to come back before the olives are harvested."

We did the orchard tour which was ~45min of walking around the olive trees and learning more about the process of growing and processing olive oil, as well as the different varieties. Our tour guide was great - very friendly and knowledgeable!  The tastings are cancelled due to the CORONA restrictions but we had a lovely lunch in their shaded outdoor patio. Highly recommend the olive oil and olives platter.  Speaking of COVID, great to see everyone wearing masks and the business itself enforcing the regulations. Felt very safe walking around and eating there.  And, of course, we couldn't leave without purchasing some of the delicious extra virgin olive oil and balsamic (which is not made there but commissioned from the special region in Italy).  Would highly recommend, especially if you have friends or family visiting in town. It's a short 40-50min drive from Austin."

Also, there was a kid camp going on and children threw water guns at our table while we dined as well as crawled around by our table. Not the experience we'd hoped for. Our server ghosted during our meal and left us waiting over 30 minutes to pay so we could leave. Wanted to love this place, as it is a beautiful property with so much potential. With a few tweaks, it could be so much more."

The inside is small because it's in a cottage so there's a sign saying one group at a time. The wines are from California. You can do a flight for $15 or a glass. We all chose a glass (8oz pour) whereas a tasting is 6 oz. loved our reds. There's a sculpture garden to stroll. Lovely place for convo. Also we tried the fat boy cheese spread w ritz crackers and it's so good!"

However perhaps I will be a bit biased coming from California and having tried some of the best wines, the wine here is not something for a refined wine pallet. It's a cute little spot to check out and try out but not something that would leave you wanting more. Sauvignon Blanc was the best choice of the flight and the others did not leave me too excited."

                "description": "I keep meaning to post a review for this winery. My husband and I visited them a few weeks ago to celebrate a recent job interview. They have only recently opened up, so we had never heard of them before and were excited to try them out. They had a very cute tasting room with nice stone that also felt very homey. The tasting was $20 and you get to try 6 wines. $20 still feels a bit hefty for a tasting in Central Texas for me, but their pours were pretty generous and you're not being served by someone who looks like a teenager who couldn't care less about your experience (like what Becker has become). All of these wines are from Sonoma. Overall, we didn't love the tastings except for the Zinfandel and the Cabernet which were absolutely outstanding, but I don't typically love lighter-bodied red wines or most reds from Sonoma. The quality is great, but a few of the prices were just slightly higher than what we can personally justify - I absolutely loved the Cab but it was $60. The Zinfandel was more affordable at $39. Their Wine Club gives you 20% off purchases which is nice, but it is a 6-bottle quarterly shipment. The winemakers are the Parmesons themselves and we had the pleasure of getting to chat with them while we did our tasting. They are a wonderful couple who were very welcoming and lovely to chat with. We loved hearing their story of how they got into winemaking. I would highly recommend checking this place out!"

                "description": "Happy to find this little gem of a tasting room! We've enjoyed CL Butaud wines for a couple of years after discovering it at Antonelli's Cheese Shop. It's a shared space with Wine for the People, just off Fitzhugh Road, which is quickly becoming a brewery/distellery/winery Mecca.   Whether you like white, rosé, or red, CL Butaud has what you want. Light and clean white wines. Crisp, but not sweet rosés. Love the BIG, BOLD reds. The Grenache and Tempranillo are both awesome! My favorite is the Cease and Desist, a 50/50 blend of Syrah and Tempranillo.   We've been tasting wine for years near and far. This is the way it should be done. Best experience ever. Reservations encouraged. Get your own picnic table outside and enjoy your stay. The sommeliers are friendly and knowledgeable. The winemaker, Randy Hester, will likely visit with you and share his philosophy and insight into the process. 100% Texas grown grapes.   Dog friendly. Outdoor games and food trucks forthcoming. Did I mention I'm so happy they've opened a tasting room!"

                "description": "I soooo enjoyed my wine tasting at Texas AVA, which is a shared tasting room with CL Butaud and Wine for the People.    First, the outdoor space is great.  There are about nine picnic benches, well distanced, and most of them are covered/in the shade so you aren't baking in the Texas sun.  There were also nice design touches and little decorations, such as  tablecloths and flowers on the table, so the space felt very picturesque.  Next, there are three options for tasting: all CL Butaud wines, all Wine for the People wines, or a \"duo flight\" so you can try wines from both winemakers.  I brought my mother with me to the tasting and we decided to both get the duo flight.  I enjoyed all the wines we tasted, but my favorites were the Sparkling Chenin Blanc (Wine For The People), the Pa Pa French Rose (CL Butaud), and the Carbonic Petite Sirah (Wine For The People) (we added that last one on to our wine tasting, even though it wasn't included in the flight we chose).  What made the tasting even more special, beyond the outdoor space and the wines themselves, is that both winemakers were on site and pouring the wines.  We had the opportunity to talk to each of them, which made our afternoon feel like a very special experience.  You can tell they both have such passion for their wines and their passion is infectious.  We ended up buying five bottles of wine and I'm seriously considering joining one or both of their wine clubs.  If you are looking for a spot to hang out with friends and family and taste great Texas wines, I highly recommend visiting the Texas AVA tasting room.  I've already told my friends about it and I am planning another visit very soon!"

                "description": "Viva El Gaucho!  This place is legit. I came here with a Porteno, someone from the capital city Buenos Aires. They attested to the legitimacy of the place- it even looks and smells like Mendoza they remarked...  We tried a flight of whites, a flight of reds, and a sampler plate with Morcilla, a blood sausage, some empanadas, and some proveletta, a gooey cheesy mixture, served with some pieces of hard bread. The food was all marvelous- where else can you find these more daring types of sausages, like a blood sausage! This is authentic stuff.  The wine was amazing- loved the Malbecs. They served up 2 malbecs- one high altitude, one low, and a cabernet that exemplified the region's wine. The whites were good, but Argentina is mostly known for its red wines due to the altitude and their fruity, herbaceous deep dark red wines.  The staff was great- they had a guitar player out beltin' out the jams on their picturesque patio with a great sweeping view of the hills that surround the place. They have a big fire pit in the middle of the outdoor area, which gives everything a smoky smell, that seems to blend well with the wines.  They have lots of outdoor seating under the trees, with comfortable seats, and even little teepees if you wanna do that.  I recommend everything here. It's a fun place with excellent wine and awesome food. I wanna come back for one of their outdoor all day grilling sessions that Argentina is so famous for!"

We have been there on several occasions and always left having appreciated their wine, food and service.   We don't always do the tasting, but will buy a bottle and share it at one of their tables, either inside or out; depending on the weather.   What's great about this winery is the owners! They go the extra mile to assure every guest has a great time!   We look forward to our next visit!"

                "description": "As a native Argentine and a veteran in the service industry I couldn't find a single fault in our visit to El Gaucho. This is going to be a long review because they deserve a long one. Let's begin with the service. We were 12. We asked a million questions before even arriving. Then we arrived and we drove our poor server crazy and she never lost her smile. Adrian and Mirta, the owners and chefs of El Gaucho (not the winery, the restaurant) were extremely friendly and had a smile on their face the whole time. Now the food, OMG the food!. We Argentines love meat, and we are extremely picky about the quality of the meat, and how it is cooked. Well, first of all, the meat is from Argentina so that's a good start. Secondly, Adrian cooks it to perfection. We tried almost everything. Sirloin steak, flank steak, sweetbreads, sausage, even blood sausage. I don't usually like blood sausage but he made his magic and I liked it. The empanadas were divine! I'm very picky about empanadas. I used to make empanadas and it is hard work. They make the dough and the fillings. We tried the cebolla y queso, espinaca y queso, carne; every single one of them, perfection. We were celebrating several birthdays so we asked them to prepare a cake. It was a traditional cake from Argentina called Postre Balcarce. I'm running out of words to describe how amazing the food was. I thought I wouldn't be able to eat anything else but that cake was heavenly. Finally the location. It is a long drive for some but it is worth it. Beautiful views, live music some days, an area for kids to play. The owner of the winery is very nice as well. He was walking around the tables asking everybody how we were doing. I can't say anything about the wines because I don't drink wine. Yes, I know, an Argentine that doesn't drink wine. Shocking isn't it? And I don't do the tango and I don't watch soccer (futbol people, futbol!!) except when Argentina is playing. Well there you go. I told you it was going to be a long review. I hope it will convince many people to visit this amazing place. NOTE: They also do delivery!!!"

They had a two ban band which was perfect for the setting! Great outside seating!!! We got their at 3 and stayed for a few hours because of how it was nested in the hills with plenty of trees and shade.   Great place for a date, family, kids, dogs or a glass of wine for the day. We will be coming back and hopefully have traditional Argentine bbq next time.   Suggestion: serve espresso and/or coffee"

Met an old friend here tonight who I haven't seen much since she moved to Austin while I was here for a work trip and we had a fantastic time!  The wines are tasty and the winery has some great indoor and outdoor seating with fantastic views, way up on a hill. Definitely go check them out!  I've also reached out to the management to see if I can get wines shipped back to my home state of Georgia!!!"

                "description": "When we first arrived here, it was a bit confusing on where we were allowed to park as there were to signs indicating a designated place for cars - we ended up just driving all the way up the hill and parking alongside the roundabout next to the entrance of the winery cabin.   We had a reservation for right when they opened, and luckily so - it became extremely busy later on in our visit, so be mindful if you're planning on coming here that it's popular!   Staff is extremely friendly and attentive - they accommodated our group and let us even switch some tables around since we were the first there.   El Gaucho has a smaller wine list than other wineries I've been to, but they also had a food menu that was unique to others.   Provoleta ($12.50, +prosciutto $2.00): Comes out on a hot skillet plate with some slices of bread on the side. Really flavorful in provolone, obviously, but the chimichurri gives a nice addition to the dish. Felt like the addition of prosciutto wasn't worth, however.   Empanadas (2pc - $12.50): They have an option between beef empanadas, or a black bean and plantain empanada. I tried both and they were delicious in their own ways. Some people may stray away from the non-meat option, but I quite liked it! I believe they served this with the same chimichurri that was on top of the Provoleta.   Light Flight  1. Chardonnay: Their description is 100% correct, if you don't prefer Chardonnay, you might change your mind after trying this! Super light and refreshing, really easy finish. 2. Chardonnay Reserve: Huge jump from the Chardonnay - seemed to taste more full.  3. Malbec Rose: Really great end to tie the first two together, the sweetness is subtle but still noticeable.  They have a lovely outdoor courtyard/backyard patio where more seating is available, but unfortunately the day we went, it had just rained meaning most chairs were wet. I would highly recommend trying to come on a sunny day as I think it'd be beautiful!"

Honestly, I wouldn't spend the money on it, nor ever come here  again. There was only one lady working and no one helped us out at all.  They were originally going to set up something \"special\" since it was our honeymoon and it was not special at all. They were charging us $175 for literally a bottle of cheap champagne and a bowl of crackers and cheese. For what we paid for and what we got I don't recommend it at all."

We sat down with a group of 9 girls when it was not whatsoever busy and were (eventually) greeted with \"hey so we can't do tastings because this is a large group without a reservation.\" We were happy to purchase by the glass or bottle, so this wasn't an issue but we were all taken aback by this greeting and found it pretty rude and uninviting. We barely heard from our waitress/hostess the whole time we were there.   The wine was just disgusting and overpriced. Of the bottles we purchased, the pinot grigio was the only decent one, which wasn't even made by this winery.   There are MANY better options, who actually enjoy and appreciate your patronage...keep driving!"

Brittany was fabulous and the owner, Robert, was very accommodating and friendly. Everyone was knowledgable and helped us find the perfect wine. We will definitely be back to this hidden gem!"

                "description": "Nice little place but nothing to really write home about. We arrived on a Saturday afternoon and unfortunately there were at least 2 bridal parties there.  It was very loud in the tasting area and it appeared they had only 2-3 people working.  They mentioned they had not expected such a large influx of people.  They did their best, but it was very hard to hear and they were bouncing back and forth between a lot of people trying to pay and split checks and do pours, etc.  Yes, the pours were very small and it was $15 each which is kind of pricey for that size and the wines that to me were very light.  I like bold flavors, not fruity and these were not bad, but not worth the price for me.  If there had not been so many people and it be so loud it might have been a little better, but we will not go back- crowded or not."

                "description": "Terrible wine. We had to buy a bottle because they used the Covid excuse when mind you down the road wineries we can do tastings or by the glass. We love big bold reds so we were guided to their 2015 Cab. Worst ever. The boxed $4.99 from CVS is much better. Wow, super disappointed to be conned into buying a $45 bottle of wine plus having to buy their \"charcuterie\" which was literally some cheese packets and nuts in a white paper bag handed to us for a total of $70. Rip off. Safe yourself the money and taste buds, and hit up Fall Creek or even Bell Springs."

                "description": "I infrequently write reviews but I feel that this deserves one. Dishonest and shady practice. went there for a tasting with some friends recently. It was our first time there. Tasting was $20 per person. Seems like the price has gone up from recent years based on the prior reviews. Not a big deal. At the end of the tasting, I bought 3 bottles. The staff came over with an iPad, charged me the three bottles plus the tasting, told me to sign on an iPad and asked for my email. She said that she would email me the receipt. I never got the receipt. Saw the charge on my cc bill which did not seem to make sense. I emailed them and then called them requesting a receipt to be sent to my email. Apparently, when they charged me, a 20% tip was automatically added by default to the TOTAL (including the wine bottles that I purchased) . Not just to the tasting. I called and spoke to them Bc I felt that this was not appropriate. I don't mind tipping on the service but on the wine bottles that I am purchasing to take home?? I was pretty much told by the staff tough luck. I have been to many tastings in the past and this was definitely new for me. It's not the end of the world but it's the principles..you know. Definitely will not be back and would not recommend to anyone."

                "description": "Beautiful estate. The owner came over and talked to us and was so sweet and pleasant to talk to. The woman, Lauren, who walked us through our tasting was equally as sweet, friendly, and knowledgable of all their wines- which were delicious. Very light reds, European style. So if you're into more California/west coast style wines, it'll be a bit different for you. If you're looking to do a large party I'd recommend giving them a call in advance to help set up for your group to give you the best experience possible. Large space, beautiful building, yet feels very cozy. Definitely a great spot to hit on your day trip through wine country in the Hill Country. (Their Sangiovese and Cab 2015 were incredible.)"

The wines we tried were unique but not to justify paying 28-48 per bottle, yes it's \"small batch\" but if they're that much the tasting should be comped."

                "description": "Was out in the hill country this weekend with a friend just meandering around during our staycation. We stopped at Jester King before this and just looked for cool places nearby when Solaro Estate popped up on the map. Wine, closeby? Sold.   Since we'd never been there before, we each decided to do a tasting so we could try their 6 best wines. Their whites were crisp and refreshing, but I didn't fancy any of the reds. I usually love pretty much all reds and favor them much more than whites, so there's a good chance my tastebuds were just all out of whack this weekend.  When we finished our tastings, it was raining cats and dogs out, so we decided to have a full glass of white and sit outside to watch and listen to the rain fall on their tin roof patio. It was glorious, even when the rain got so intense that literally everyone else who was outside went inside to hide from the aggressive mist. Since my friend and I are classy AF, we were in workout clothing and makeup-less, so we didn't mind the rain one bit. It was extremely peaceful, and seeing the gorgeous rows of grape vines behind the veil of rain was a memory I won't soon forget.   I'll be back for sure!"

                "description": "I just recently moved from Switzerland, and was surrounded by fantastic wine tasting experiences.  I was nervous about trying Texan wine, but started my Texan wine experience at Solaro after having read many different experiences about the local vineyards around the Dripping Springs area.   The tasting room is located in the vineyard, which is great. I love that this is a small production place, with a family oriented feeling, and the staff are knowledgeable about the wine and production.  I guess the owners can often be found in the tasting room, but just happened to be away the Saturday we went.  They often have events, and we were enjoying one of their Saturday live music events from 2-4pm.  They have a great indoor and outdoor seating area full of charm.    For $10 per person you can enjoy a tasting of their varietals.  There was nothing that was bad, but from the tasting list, I enjoyed the Miscela Bianco the best. After enjoying all their selections, I signed up for their annual wine club, which was a great deal, and then was able to taste some of their higher quality more expensive wines, which were great.  I look forward to going back and touring the vineyard, as a benefit of being a member.  We also signed up for the grape stomping that will be taking place in the next couple of weeks as they need a bunch of people.  What a great opportunity to be part of a grape harvest!  I could have spent several hours just hanging out here. I only wish they had some food to enjoy with the wine and music.  Next time I will remember to bring my own picnic.    I am very happy to have been proven wrong regarding my concerns about Texan wine! Thank you Solaro!"

                "description": "We have been visiting the Hill Country Casitas for several years as a regular getaway place just 45 minutes outside of Austin. Featuring beautiful views of the hills, each of the Casitas have their own personality. Sized for different needs, each Casita is well designed for comfort with well selected furnishings and finishes. Most have outdoor fireplaces, which are wonderful for gathering around on a chilly evening. All of the Casitas are very comfortable. However, for couples, I would highly recommend springing extra for the very private \"Pauline\" Casita. Located at the top of the hilltop, the Pauline features a large soaking tub and double shower. The views are spectacular! If the Pauline is booked up, there are others that are comparable.  Recently, Hill Country Casitas added a large pool and spa, which are great for warm months. Other amenities include a large outdoor pavilion, a retreat center, firepit, and outdoor game area.  Hill Country Casitas is also adjacent to the wonderful Hawk Shadow winery which we recommend for the tastings which are held on an outdoor terrace overlooking the canyon.  If you are a \"dog person\", Hill Country Casitas also is very \"dog friendly\". I can't recommend it more highly for couples, family get togethers, wedding celebrations, or corporate retreats.  Five Stars! Check it out!"

The Casitas are so comfortable, spacious for a studio and had all the basics.  We enjoyed evenings on the patio.  We checked out the common area and walked the area---bonus we meet the sweet resort cat!  We will definitely return, hopefully this fall when it's a little cooler and we can enjoy the firepit.  We felt secluded, but close enough to wineries, breweries and restaurants.  We cooked steaks on our grill for our Anniversary and enjoyed a wine tasting at Hawks Shadow, literally around the corner.  My only suggestion (not a complaint) bring a sleep mask if you need dark to sleep late."

                "description": "Our family stayed in #8 and #10 (2 bedrooms each) November 19-21, 2016 for our daughter's wedding about 3 miles down the road at Heritage House. We were very pleased. The McRoberts were helpful and kind from the moment we made our reservation in June until after we had checked out.  My wife and I plan to return in the Spring of 2017 for a fun little getaway.  Our cabins had only been opened *very* recently (a month?), but everything was in order with one exception: both showers in #8 were barely more than lukewarm. They just needed a slight adjustment and this was taken care of very quickly (surely we were actually the first guests to stay in #8). The bathrooms had *plenty* towels and shampoo, conditioner and bath gel was provided.  The kitchen was well stocked with cups, plates, silverware, etc.  The beds were comfortable. The heating unit was a little tricky to figure out and so we were actually a degree or two warmer than what would have been ideal but we will know how to operate them next time.  There was little to no landscaping in place yet but we knew we were staying at a very new facility.  The gorgeous weather we enjoyed that weekend made the lack of landscaping a non-issue for us.  However, there is no asphalt on the property.  The roads and parking areas are crushed stone(?).  I don't know if that would be messy or not on a rainy weekend.  The outdoor furniture on the covered patios is very nice and makes for a very relaxing place to hang out when the weather is good.  Another nice touch is the use of keypad-operated door locks.  It's nice to not have to keep up with a key.  The surrounding area is authentic, beautiful Texas Hill Country.  The Dripping Springs area is booming as a wedding destination but the hospitality industry is lagging way behind the demand for lodging.  So, Hill Country Casitas should have no trouble attracting enough guests to be more than a little bit successful."

We ended up renting the entire property, so it felt very secluded and private. The whole property was breathtaking! Each Casita was beautifully decorated with spa-like bathrooms that were stocked with all the toiletries you would need, comfy beds, and private patios. The private fireplaces at each Casita was such a great bonus, they were perfect for the cooler weather. The pavilion had a fully equipped kitchen with beautiful views which was great for our rehearsal dinner. Mary and Rob were so great! They made sure our stay was stress-free and relaxing. We were beyond impressed with everything. We will absolutely be back for our 1-year anniversary! Thank you for making our wedding weekend beyond exceptional!"

We rented out all 10 casitas for three days for a mini wedding getaway. I had some funky ideas about what I wanted to do for my wedding and Mary at the casitas was a big part of that. She was amazing. The owners pay crazy attention to detail, they responded to my million emails quickly, and made our stay out there super easy. It is the perfect place to stay whether a romantic vacation or a fun weekend with a big group of people. There is a volleyball court, the most amazing fire pit, an outdoor kitchen that is jaw dropping... I could go on and on. Don't miss out on staying at the casitas! I know we will be back!"

The Casita has a ton of windows with incredible views out of each one and this particular casita is very secluded and romantic.  Also romantic is the free standing tub for two and the dual head shower!  The facilities are dog friendly and our dog had a great time.  It was raining over the weekend but it was still a great get-away and we just enjoyed the outdoor fireplace most of the time.  It is only a short trip from Austin but you feel like you're miles away.  Each Casita has a kitchenette, very nicely stocked with essentials, which makes it convenient if you want to cook.  We stopped at the Salt Lick on the way out there; picked up some BBQ and enjoyed that all weekend.  The winery across the street, Hawk's Shadow, has some great wine for tasting too."

                "description": "Hill Country Casitas located in Texas Wine Country!  It's a hidden gem...an oasis of tranquility...And, so close to the finest Texas Wineries!  I recently stayed in Casita #7 solo the 3rd weekend of November.  The Casita was an absolute love nest!  Beautifully finished...And, luxuriously appointed.  The Casita begins and ends with a lovely porch - including seating and a wood burning fireplace.  It can be quite the gathering spot or place for quiet reflection.    From the porch the Casita has two double door entries - one to the kitchen and living room and the other to the bedroom.  In the morning I enjoyed drawing all the curtains and opening the double doors from the bedroom.  The views were spectacular.  The kitchen has everything you need - with the exception of an oven (you'll find that in the pavilion - plus, there are gas grills on the property as well) and groceries.  The owners do go above and beyond by supplying spices, olive oil, coffee creamer, tea.  Prior to my arrival - I purchased fruit, veggies, salami, crackers, cheeses, olives, and water.  This was great with my wine!!!  The living room is quite comfortable with a lux leather sofa for relaxing chats....but, I spent most of my time out on the lovely porch.  The bedroom is a dream!  The comfortable bed with bedding that had the perfect weight!  I haven't slept that well in months!  The bathroom is just beautiful!  Dual Sinks and Dual Showerheads...Can I say love nest again?  You must try the wonderful toiletries (the scents are amazing)!  Make it a special day...enjoy a picnic with a glass of wine - I did!  Mary and Ron have placed their heart and soul into Hill Country Casitas and it's easy to see!  I can't wait to visit again!!!  What I loved: The accommodation was self-catering and private.  I enjoyed company and also had an opportunity to enjoy just me!  Absolute relaxation!  It was an opportunity to \"check out\" vs. \"checking in\" to a commercial hotel.  Recommendations: Fly into AUS and rent a car and be sure to arrive prior to sunset.  Don't purchase the toll package - it's not necessary.  *When returning your car to AUS stop at the Shell off Hwy 71. https://www.aroundairports.com/map/?iata_code=AUSandtoaddr=2453+Highway+71+E+Del+Valle%2CTXandname=Shellandcat=gas  Stop at H-E-B grocery store for provisions (you will not be close to a store).  *H-E-B is a full service grocery store and pharmacy that happens to be a Celiac's gluten free haven too! https://www.heb.com/heb-store/US/tx/dripping-springs/dripping-springs-h-e-b-611  Recommended Wineries:   Kuhlman Cellars had the most impressive wine tasting.  It was very informative with regard to food pairings - Ask for Oscar.  Special Note:  Call ahead and they will accommodate for food allergies. http://www.kuhlmancellars.com/.  Barons Creek Vineyards had the best tasting wines. Special Note: Picnics are allowed!  http://www.baronscreekvineyards.com/  Compass Roads Cellars has \"Charles!\" I still have hearts in my eyes! https://store.compassrosecellars.com/"

                "description": "A last-minute decision to stay at Hill Country Casitas paid off big time. Gorgeous stone cabin. Wood burning fireplace and since they are her favorite, S'mores and coffee. Best bathroom of most anywhere I've stayed. Big comfy bed with a view. Kitchen just the right size. And the pavilion area is gorgeous. Loved sitting in the La Capilla (little chapel). Loved the Hawk's Shadow winery around the corner. I'll come again when I can stay longer!"

                "description": "I recently had the opportunity to spend the night in one of these lovely Casitas. Needless to say the experience was delightful. The small touches throughout exemplify hospitality at its finest, from the binder with local info and hotspots, the ice cold water in the fridge, and to the cream, sugar and coffee so thoughtfully provided, it was the little things that made the stay so much sweeter.  They say the stars are big and bright deep in the Heart of Texas well that is so true out in the middle of the Hill Country. After spending a lovely evening next door at a local Winery (yay, Hawk Shadow!)  listening to some lovely music, I spent some quality time staring into the universe, enjoying the solitude.   I had a wonderful  night's sleep on the most exquisite sheets that smelled so delightful. The silence was quite deafening in its totality out here in the countryside. I know there were other people on the property but it did feel like an oasis. I woke up refreshed and spent the morning watching the sun rise over the hills with a hot cup of coffee in my hand savouring the crisp fall morning. While the property is still in the process of blooming, Mary and Ron were the consummate hosts, making sure I had everything I needed to enjoy my stay. I am looking forward to returning in the future for a much longer visit."

                "description": "We were RVing at Guadalupe River State Park and wanted to do a wine t asting. We found Pontita nearby. Beautiful winery with lots of additional plans for their future. The Owner runs it as non-profit; only taking in what is needed to run the winery, pay staff and make the wine. He gives profits to an abused woman shelter -- nice!   He also concentrates on Rieslings.  We do not by nature like Rieslings, however, these are not sweet or overly sweet. We did the 5 Riesling tasting and were very impressed with them all -- so much so, we bought a bottle of our favorite.  Our server was super nice, informative and made our tasting even more enjoyable.  Beautiful tasting room and outdoor patio."

                "description": "If you're looking for an amazing local-style experience, then this is your place. They specialize in Riesling wines here, but they do have some outsourced reds available if you really want some. They have a really good variety of Rieslings: some dry and some sweet. I was already a fan of the dry one, but the semi-sweet ended up being our favorite. It was just the perfect balance of sweet and dry! It was so good that we took like 3 bottles home   I also appreciate the ambience and the service. The sunset was beautiful! They have cornhole if you and your friends are looking for something to do, but really the environment was great to sit and talk. I also want to point out that they had excellent service. At one point I got stung by a fuzzy caterpillar, and both our server and the owner kept coming back to check on us. In general, they have a great vibe, and they provide amazing customer service that you can only get at a local spot.   TLDR: We had a wonderful experience. They specialize in Rieslings, and their semi-sweet was our overall favorite. The service was exactly what you'd expect from the Southern Hospitality vibe, and their sunsets really were the best. Highly recommend!"

What an incredible staff, they made us feel at home instantly like we were with friends and family. They have amazing plans on expanding the location to include a wedding venue and picnic area. I'm from New England so I'll definitely be back to check it out again. The charcuterie board was so good we ordered another! We had the Riesling flight which was perfect! Brought a bottle home for girls night later ‍"

                "description": "The staff are very friendly and welcoming. My group and I had the pontita white wine tasting, and it was amazing. You get a taste of 4 wines, produced by the owner, with a bit of background about each wine from the owner himself. I don't know much about wine, so I really appreciated that he took the time to explain its history, the process it takes to make it, as well as the differences among wines, champagnes, and sparkling wines. The wines were pretty good, but my favorite was the semi-sweet Riesling. Be warned, I have a sweet tooth. If you like dry, fruity wines, the tart apple dry Riesling or the rarity dry Riesling are good choices. The physical vineyard itself is a work in progress, which was explained when we first arrived, but I believe when it's completed, it'll be beautiful."

They let us know that they were social distancing and wearing masks (as well as having plenty of outdoor seating).   When we arrived we were two of the four guests there and were lucky enough to have Pat, the owner, spend some time with us. He walked us through the wine tasting and some really interesting wine history during our visit. He was very welcoming and engaging the entire time. When we left, we wanted to purchase a bottle from him and he graciously allowed us to sample that wine (as we had not tried it during the tasting) before purchase. The tasting area is very nice and open with a beautiful pergola out back.   We were very pleased with our experience and will definitely be back soon for some more wine and some more history!"

                "description": "Two of my granddaughters were in town from Houston.  We wanted to support small businesses over the weekend.  Pontita was one of the wineries we patronized.  Upon entering the building we received a warm Texas welcome.  We were seated on the patio.  This is a very new winery so the vines are limited and the ambiance under development.  The waitress shared the vision with us in detail.  I recommend limiting this presentation to a high-level with a display board to which they invite customers to review.  We all ordered the white wine tasting flight.  Pat the owner serves the tasting.  With the first wine he spent significant time explaining the wine, discussing the wine making process, and waiting for us to finish that wine.  He arrived with the second wine and continued with another detailed presentation.  I advised him I don't get to see my granddaughters much and we would like to have conversation amongst ourselves.  It was apparent from his body language that he was offended by my request.  Rather than assume customers want to listen to a lengthy presentation with each wine, provide a card explaining each wine and ask the customer if they would like to know more.  While the three of us each has different preferences in wine, we agreed Rarity was the best.  Nice done!  We bought two bottles on our way out.  Once they fulfill their vision for the property and recognize customer preferences, this should be a great place to enjoy some wine and hopefully a better selection of small plates."

                "description": "The owner Pat certainly knows a lot about wines and would give you a good talk on it. But the vineyard per se is under construction, so paying for a tour there is worthless. Would recommend just doing a wine tasting with the cheese plate. We bought one of the wines at the end, and it was 25 dollars, which is certainly a bit overpriced compared to the really good wines you get outside. All the staff were very friendly and engaging as well, and or baby had a great time running and crawling around."

                "description": "If you want delicious and fresh Italian food with a beautiful indoor dinning experience I would highly suggest this spot. I came across it while searching on Reddit and made the best deduction of having dinner there for my 28th birthday!  Our waitress was the NICEST person I've ever met. Super kind, didn't rush, had great recommendations and allowed my boyfriend to surprise me with two little cakes.   Everything on their menu hits the spot but I got the fettuccine dish and my boyfriend got the penne vodka (which he claims is the best he's ever had). The drive is a bit long from ATX but 100000% worth it.  I will be visiting back when the weather is nicer to also enjoy the vineyard next door"

                "description": "Ordered to-go. Person answering the phone was delightful and friendly. I ordered the Daily Special Mahi Lupo. The vegetables, broccolini, tomatoes, and artichoke had a very nice flavor. However, the brocollini was served without trimming the huge stalks which were too thick to eat so you really didn't get much brocollini. The bread was stale. The oil for dipping was great. The mahi was disgustingly undercooked and slimy. The fish didn't flake, it slithered. If they fire grilled it, it jumped out of the fire real quick and was almost alive. I tried to nuke it for a minute but it just didn't work. I spent close to 50.00 for a meal I mostly couldn't eat. I love the setting, the villa feel of the place but I can't spend that kind of money for a bad meal. To-go orders are even more important to get right than in-house since there is no chance to replace it or remedy anything. I am a sushi fan and can eat raw fish, but this was like nothing I've ever seen. I prefer my fish dead before I eat it. Come on guys I pay you guys to catch the fish AND cook it for me!   Sorry, my picture are too big for Yelp and I am too tired and disappointed to try to fix that."

                "description": "This place is really great for date night and a good glass of wine. I came here on a Saturday around 5pm which was extremely busy with kids everywhere. I had the Brussels sprouts as an appetizer and they were way too salty. The main was the risotto which was so interesting with the garlic probably wouldn't order it again but it was flavorful. The service was so slow but he was extremely friendly so we appreciated the service. I would dine here again in the summer for a glass of wine in their outdoor area."

                "description": "Had a great dinner with my partner the other night at Trattoria Lisina. We didn't have an appointment but were able to grab a table right away.  The driveway was hard to see coming off the road but I suppose this is due to the \"dark sky\" community. Albeit, Some extra signage would be nice.   We ordered meatballs as an appetizer and these were delicious! The garlic toast that comes with this dish is soooo tasty!   Focaccia and oil is complimentary, wish the bread was softer and less greasy but it was free..   We split the taglierini portofino. It was the right amount! The scallops in the dish was perfectly cooked, the shrimp may have been over seasoned but the lemon butter slightly cuts the seasoning.   Over all, We spent about $80 for our meal and 3 drinks.  We were pretty satisfied! Thanks for the great service and delicious Italian!"

                "description": "We brought food from here to a table outside the winery nextdoor.. with wine from the winery. I think this is your best bet if you're looking to eat and be away from crowds (for COVID).  I have to say all the food was good. The linguini was my favorite, followed closely by the mashed potatoes. The breads (focaccia and garlic) were each tasty, i could eat that focaccia all dayyy.  The lasagna was good, a bit heavy for me, though.. but what do you expect with lasagna!  I'd probably skip the Caesar salad next time..  While not my favorite Italian food ever, the grounds are beautiful, and it's a great place to bring a date or some friends and have a picnic style meal with some wine ;)"

                "description": "This place is a visual feast--a beautiful building of European flavor with a substantial Vinyard nearby, surrounded by beautiful oak trees, and beautifully maintained gardens.  While it is not easy to get to, it is the only gourmet restaurant I know of that accommodates helicopters.  (We arrived by car.)  We have met Austin friends here several times and the food has always been excellent, but we all agreed that it is now even better than we had remembered it from pre-covid days.  Warm bread came early with a plate of olive oil and herbs for dipping.  The antipasto plate and the fried calamari were both excellent, with a spicy dipping sauce.  Our friend loved the pasta dish with sautéed scallops, and the 8 ounce filet that my wife and I shared  was the best of our eight decade lifetime.  We will be back again and again."

                "description": "Driving to Trattoria Lisina from Austin is always a fun field trip out into a totally different part of Texas. No traffic, windy two lane roads and there you are, in a vineyard in the middle of nowhere. I'd have never guessed a place the size and class of Trattoria Lisina would be nestled in hill country like this.  The inside felt distinctly Houston/Dallas vibes: much more corporate and big scale than a little mom-and-pop, but in a good way. Nice and air conditioned with plenty of space too. Now for the food:  The focaccia they serve with garlic/herb olive oil is OUTSTANDING. I could have eaten it all night, so so good. Like fools we ALSO ordered garlic bread. The garlic bread was toasted baguette slices that were burnt and dried. No bueno. Also: how is one bread item the best thing on the menu and the other maybe the worst? Strange, but anyway, don't get the garlic bread when you have garlic oil and bread in your lap, overflowing. The calamari was ok but the entrees were amazing. The osso buco was SO TENDER and so full of flavor. It came with a little marrow spoon and was a huge portion. My husband got the crispy duck with polenta cakes and cranberry salsa and he was a big fan too.   The service was so nice and sweet and the setting was beyond stunning. I really liked my time here and would definitely take guests when they visit too!"

                "description": "First ever dining experience at Trattoria Lisina.  We we did for a special occasion, a \"mile stone birthday.\"  We drove 1-1/2 hours to get there!  Let's start with negatives (which I don't normally do!).  The most expensive menu item, aside from the bottle of wine, was a pistachio encrusted red snapper filet.  The fish was 2x over cooked, and was tough as leather.  The main problem was it's a filet, skin on, blood line still intact.  As a seasoned Gulf fisherman and chef, I know you need the blood line cut out of the filet, even the fishing guys on YouTube get that.  Great piece of fish, tough to cut even with the knife provided.  It's not all about presentation.  Issue raised with waiter (Joseph S), and \"he could have the manager come over to discuss.\"  As a waiter, when the dish is bad, take it away and redo!  The craft cocktails were OK, not worth the $14-$15 price tag.  The star of the evening was the calamari fritti, which was great!  Fresh, hot, tartar and marinara sauces were on point, terrific.  The veal osso buco, the best in TX, by far!  There's something about fresh bone marrow!  Dessert was the tiramisu, which was awesome, until James S added to the bill.  Overall, Trattoria Lisina is a \"destination\" restaurant, but for the $$, it's not worth the hype.  Enjoy one of the Mandola locations in ATX, the food is better and the price tag is 80% less ..."

Trick is to order from their to go line outside. About a 30-45 min wait on a Friday night. You then can sit almost any table outside, versus the 2-3 hour wait to eat inside. Plus they have live music outside so win win! We got the pork ribs and brisket sandwich, both as good as always."

                "description": "Ya take the good with the bad.   We came south of Austin to the wine valleys here and started with Salt Lick Cellars.   They had the adjoining BBQ place and we were hungry so figured to start here then hit some of the other vineyards.   The place was designed to take in a lot of people.  it was full of folks at 1PM on Friday.  There was maybe 150 cars in a lot that could hold 10 times that. The grounds were nice, with lots of shady trees and people having a good time.  I think it was more of a good time from the BBQ and beer maybe as the wine was nothing to cheer about. we walked and asked for a tasting from the little window that was the winery.  We got an eye roll and were told no.  So we each got a glass of wine, not wanting to waste the stop.   Both glasses were not good.   Not to sound like a boozer but I can finish most any glass, but we had to pour both out sadly.  it threw off our mojo enough that we didn't even get a different glass or BBQ.  The good news was there were plenty more options down the road!"

                "description": "We were traveling back home after a July 4th trip with our pup. It had just rained so we looked for a place that had outdoor seating.  The first time I was there I remembered picnic tables so we took a chance. There was already a line when we arrived at 11:30 am.  All of the outdoor tables were wet and no one was  eating outside. People were just standing around the picnic tables waiting to be called inside.  I asked the hostess if we could sit outside since we had the pup. She said due to the rain they didn't have any servers working the outdoor tabled so she recommended that we order to go and were welcome to use the picnic tables.  We had our waterproof picnic blanket with us so that was perfect.  Also, the picnic area was BYOB so my husband had a beer from our cooler before we got our meal.   We had the ribs and burnt ends plate with sweet tea.  The plate came with potato salad, coleslaw and baked beans.  The coleslaw hang a tangy taste as did the bbq sauce. We both really enjoyed our meal and will be back next time we're in the area."

                "description": "This place clearly has a cult following.   Not worth the wait or money.   The BBQ sauce is pretty amazing.   Sunday 12pm was a 90 minute wait for two people. We opted for a to go order. Took about 30 minutes. We ordered the brisket and ribs meal for $27. You would have thought the meat was top notch expensive stuff with how little they gave us. And to think, for $3 more (and 60 minutes more of a wait) we could have gotten all you can eat.  Thank God for the delicious BBQ sauce I poured all over the meat as well as the sides. If it wasn't for the sauce I would have thought I had Corona virus because this stuff had no taste.   I see reviews saying they only accept cash. We paid with a credit card. There was a minimum payment for alcohol though. I think it was $18."

It's BYOB or you can get wine or beer (I recommend lone star) in the cellar that's right next to the BBQ."

                "description": "After eating delicious bbq next door my wife and I decided to do a little wine tasting. A charming western style building houses the wine tasting room.  There are little items for sale like candles and honey.  I tasted a few where one was too tangy for me but did pick up a bottle of Salt Lick Cellars BBQ White.    Outside will find tables under huge oak trees and games to play like bocce ball. This place is designated as over 21. Besides wine they sell buckets of beer bottles to enjoy."

We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves (even had a good laugh at the tipsy women imbibing). Wish we could have ordered wine at the restaurant though. I knew we wouldn't be able to finish a full bottle and still drive back to Austin so the wine stayed stoppered. My husband was able to enjoy a couple of his beers, so a win for him."

                "description": "I've been to salt lick two times. I've been to Austin four times. The only reason I didn't go all four times is time constraint/ lack there of vehicle.   It's a nice drive out of Austin, getting a little taste of Texas hill country. Ideally I'd go to a swimming hole near by, then stop at salt lick for a great meal to finish the day.  Everything is delicious and it's an awesome atmosphere. Plenty of outdoor seating which makes it an even better experience."

                "description": "The Salt Lick Cellars was a nice little bonus to our trip to The Salt Lick bbq. With a little bit of a wait ahead of us, we decided to walk over to the cellar for some beers. You walk down the sidewalk along side of the actual Salt Lick restaurant and drool as you see the other patrons inside eating their bbq.   As you enter the cellar you are faced with various wines wall to wall hut on the far left, their selection of beers. We looked over their beer selection and picked up 3 buckets of various beers including lone star and shinerbock. After grabbing our buckets, we enjoyed some on their benches outside. From there you can enjoy looking at their vineyard or play some bocce ball. Or you can walk back with your drinks back to the wait area to be seating.   Perfect side stop if you're looking for an adult beverage while you wait if you forgot to BYOB"

Well, it was a girls weekend, we were soaked to the bone and freezing, unhappy/snippy tenders, and we were jammed in a tiny wine tasting room stuffed with other people trying to avoid the rain.  The fellow customers were likely just as unhappy as we were, but there was wine!  One note though - everyone else was just standing there, we were the only ones that were paying customers and we STILL got attitude.    Our least favorite tasting we did all weekend, but wines were good (not great).  Need to try again one day when there is great weather!"

                "description": "This place has the best I mean theeeee best bison ribs and potato salad. Open seating for outdoor orders. There are 2 main buildings but the wait for a table was over an hour. Sat outside, food came out super quick. Even got to go in the back and check out where they smoke all the bbq. Authentic as it comes. Texas bbq. This places is BYOB there were even college kids with handles of liquor on their tables as if it was almost a daily event or something to do on the weekend. Atmosphere is cool and kid friendly but you can also have a great time in the winery. Definitely a must if you visit austin, it will not disappoint my meal was about $33 and this place is cash only. The ATM wasn't working so this was somewhat of an issue but we got it handled. Awesome bbq"

Such a great surprise: BBQ and wine! What's not to like? Beautiful grounds, lots of outdoor and some indoor seating. People from all walks of life enjoying the weather and listening to some good live music. BBQ was really good and came with all the fixings. Winery ladies were very approachable and helpful. So glad we stopped in. It made the day."

I mean what else do you do after a 6 mile walk  through the parks but stop for wine!   We got good service inside, both the woman that helped us and the younger guy behind the bar were very friendly and helpful .   We both did a wine tasting (I did the whites) and hubs did the reds. 5 tastings for 12$ which I thought was pretty reasonable. The Chardonnay they had was pretty good along with another I can't pronounce . Hubs enjoyed a couple of the reds as well.  Both left with a cup of white sangria while waiting for our food next door. It was a perfect day to enjoy it on the patio as well.   Would we take an Uber out from Austin just to go here, meh probably not. However, if you're in the area it's a great spot with friendly service. When we're back in the area with friends we'd go back."

                "description": "Honestly so disappointed by the service and quality. We waited for a long time to get our six pack, then when we started drinking it, we noticed that the beer had a best by date of December 18th which was a week and a half ago. When I brought this to the bartender's attention, she said that she could only give us new beers if they hadn't been opened. She also said that the best by date didn't mean anything and brushed off my concerns. This is a quality issue. No restaurant or store should be charging full price or even selling goods past their best by date. I find this extremely upsetting as I've spent money on beer that should have been sold a week and a half ago. Also, we opened the beers but stopped drinking immediately after noticing the date on all the bottles. I don't think a cellar should be able to sell beer or wine past the best by date, and I'm sure no one wants to buy it either. Word of advice, check the date on the bottles before opening. Or better yet, don't bother waiting in the lines and spend your money elsewhere."

The place wasn't too crowded but they just opened in November and I think people are going to be learning about this place and packing it out very soon!   They grow grapes on the property but all the wine I had was outsourced since their weren't ready yet. They had three wines to try (white, rose and red) but will be having six very soon as their home grown grapes are about ready. I enjoy dry, less sweet wines and these were perfect. Highly encourage you to put this spot on your wine tours of Wimberly! They also have some snacks/small bites if you are hungry."

They now have 4 wines and all of them were delicious. I'm not a sweet wine drinker and gratefully none of them were sweet. One crisp white, 2 rosés and a red. We left with a bottle of the red and one of the rosés too. The property and views are beautiful. They have two decks with tables and umbrellas to relax and enjoy the wine, the views, the weather and a fabulous charcuterie platter. It is a bit tricky getting there BUT it is well worth it.

                "description": "My husband and I are from the North East Austin area and wanted to get out of town for the weekend to pre celebrate our upcoming one year wedding anniversary. I searched online for fun things to do in the area, and this place was consistently popping up. I took that as a sign!   I was worried because my husband isn't too into wine but he wanted to go! We arrived in mid-afternoon and it was pretty quiet. The restrooms are separate from the tasting room so I went in before we start our tasting, my husband went into the tasting room. The restrooms were clean and nicely decorated. When I joined up with my husband he had struck up a lively conversation with the two dudes behind the counter. No, they weren't two of the three dudes, but they took great care of us during our stay here!   We tried all 6 of their available wines and my husband only disliked two of them. I was impressed because he's sooooo picky. We decided on the Texas Red, and we picked up a bottle to share on-site! We also ordered a cheese and meat tray and were told they would walk it down to us so we could go ahead and start enjoying the scenery of their River Deck!! I was impressed by these guys and their customer service.   The winery has such beautiful scenery. As we move into the fall and winter seasons, this is THE place to have a big glass of wine. My husband and I enjoyed the Texas Red SO much, we bought another bottle to bring home so we can have it on our actual anniversary 10/20/2019.  If you're in the area or looming for something to experience while in San Marcos, go for a visit!"

I  have been out of town for quite some time, they were kind enough to hold my wine for me  without any issues or drama.   I believe this was my 3rd visit. The girls actually remembered me.   I love their red blend. It is fantastic. I love the environment at this winery. It's very laid back and comfortable. They have a deck that overlooks the river where you can gather and barbecue if you would like."

I'd we liked the wines, the view was the best part! The winery is on a huge property, with an area over the river to sit and drink your wine. So pretty!"

She was very thorough and knowledgeable. She made my first wine tasting experience very fun. I will definitely visit again if I get the opportunity to. The Port wine was my favorite- I couldn't leave without a bottle. 10/10!"

                "description": "Really beautiful scenery here, and overall a good experience. We came here after a visit to The Grapevine on our way back into town.   Most of the wines are pretty sweet, which I wasn't surprised by, I think it's generally a Texas wine thing. The woman behind the counter was really friendly with us and was happy to engage and talk about wine. She was very well traveled and knowledgable on many different kinds of wines and not just Three Dudes.   It's dog friendly and kid friendly here. It used to be named Three Dudes and a Dog but I guess they had to drop the The Dog part due to some legality thing.   The wine was a little too expensive... we bought a box and normally places will throw in your tastings for free when you do that, but they charged us for it. It wasn't a huge deal but I was a little surprised when she tacked it on to the bill."

                "description": "Any event with endless wine and a riverside deck is worth attending. At Three Dudes Winery, the rustic atmosphere is a perfect balance between classy and casual. The wine tasting room is open daily from 12:00-6:00 PM, and their friendly staff make it a fun and relaxing experience.  The guys behind the counter are extremely knowledgeable about each of the house-made wines, and you can sample four for five dollars. Our selections, from sickeningly sweet to normal sweet:  Texas Black Gold. A dessert wine so rich you almost can't finish it by itself. A bite of dark chocolate cuts the sweetness of the wine to make it bearable.  Texas White Zinfandel. Fruity and floral. A little too floral for my taste.  Texas White. This one is a customer favorite with a great balance between sweet and tart. Served chilled, it's light and refreshing.  Texas Red. Smoky and slightly chocolate-y. They say it pairs well with barbeque.  The only downside of the wine tasting is the size of the room. Any more than six people, and it starts to feel crowded. However, the Three Dudes (and their dog) are talking about expanding the space. You can also take a glass outside to the patio or the deck.  I left with a bottle of Texas White and a slight feeling of disappointment: I did not run into three dudes or a dog. But I wouldn't complain if I had to come back a few more times to find them."

                "description": "In the town of Lockhart a lady recommend  we try this winery since we r exploring the area. It looks small from the road but once on the grounds it is bigger. They have the grapes sent down from the hill country. They have been in business about 12 yrs and do not mass product or sell commercially...yet!. The white wines I thought were better then the reds! They were crisp but not to sweet, the reds were to heavy for my taste! Apparently they have a deck on the river to sip wine on but today they had wedding and reception to prepare for so we couldn't go down there. Certainly worth a visit!"

                "description": "I thoroughly enjoyed Three Dudes Winery! I came here for a school project and this was one of the best projects ever!   My favorite wine was the black gold! They give it to you with complimentary dark chocolate! Who doesn't LOVE chocolate?!  I wish the ambiance was a little better because this is one of the only wineries in San Marcos. The seating is nice but it's very limited!   The service was great though! The lady that was serving us was very knowledgeable on the wines and the history of the place. There are obviously better wineries in Texas but you should definitely give five dudes a try if you're in the San Marcos"

                "description": "Love love love!  We first checked out Three Dudes when my in-laws came to town. I instantly liked the wines, and the vibe. Then... my sweetheart started planning our wedding reception  (the ceremony had been out of state). Bit by bit, I fell in love with this place. It was raining on our first visit, so I hadn't yet  realized how expansive it was.  There are 2 levels of deck that sit right above the river. This provides an amazing view of sunsets and allows a nice breeze. The structure is partially covered, with a stage area (we plugged in and jammed no problem). They have tables to rent, and are super helpful with setup ideas and flexibility.  They provide servers for the wine, and totally allow you to bring your own beers (no kegs). They also offer catering suggestions. You can opt to have them do the clean up or not.  The best part: our gal, Angela! Angie is professional and communicative, but more importantly  (for us anyway), she was nice. She was wonderful in offering suggestions and patient with our changing needs. She's genuinely just a cool chica, and an asset to this backyard treasure."

                "description": "Let me start off by saying, anything to do with wedding planning can be stressful. I am so thankful that the winery helped pretty much do everything for our engagement party, and took away most of the stress.   We had our engagement party here and the package included setup and cleanup, tables, linens, wine, and food from a local bbq restaurant for 50 people. Overall, everything was great! The winery was very helpful and even stopped a meltdown from occurring. I would recommended this place to anyone! The wine was amazing and the location is perfect."

But I can not speck highly enough of Angie and her team, she worked with us, so helpful and always has a smile even when it started to storm she mar everything still fun smoothly.

                "description": "My husband and I stopped in to three dudes on our 5 year anniversary. We were hoping to stay and enjoy a leisurely bottle of wine since the weather was nice and the winery has a lower deck that looks out onto the river.  We graduated from Texas State and have spent many afternoons at wineries around the hill country, and this area is near and dear to us. Unfortunately, our experience at three dudes left us both with a bitter taste. The lady who was conducting the tasting wasn't very friendly and even though we tried to engage her in conversation she just gave short answers that left no more room for discussion. She then told us that they were holding a wedding at the venue and that we weren't allowed on the upper deck and could only go to the lower deck. This could have been conveyed in a friendly way - the upper deck is reserved for the wedding, but check out our lower deck, there's a great view of the river! Or something like that. Anything other than just flat out telling paying customers that they were too busy to serve us wine on the upper deck.  To sum it up: we were so thrown off by how unfriendly she was, we just left, and likely won't be back.  They do have good peach bellinis though and the Cabernet is decent"

They have a wonderful covered deck like area and a lower deck a little closer to the river.   The wines were good. The port was surprising, it was a big hit that night. There's enough space and areas that people could spread out and have a good time with out being too far away. They have a little stage were two bands played.   I never saw A dude, let alone three. There were two women serving the wine, Alex and Dara, who were pretty awesome. Super nice girls, helpful to the newbies and a pleasure to chat with. They did a great job all night despite the horrid heat. The manager was always around to keep things running smoothly. Super nice lady, Angie.   -100 imaginary stars for the heat but that's on Texas, not the winery."

                "description": "This winery is so great! It's has a rustic country feel and overlooks the San Marcos river. It's picturesque and is a great venue for a intimate party or wedding.   Now let's talk about the wine. No it hasn't been aged for decades but it suits the down home Texas atmosphere and the service there is outstanding. The Cabernet is dry and light and the Chenin Blanc is refreshing with notes of pear and green apple. They also have frozen wine daiquiris perfect for a hot Texas day!   If you swing by I hope you get Angie to help with the tasting or general service. She captures the sweet southern charm of Texas and knows her wine like the back of her hand. I would recommend this winery to anyone. It's reasonably priced, fun and a great overall experience."

The staff present were quite nice, just busy. We were allowed to buy wine to self serve on the back porch and were welcomed to be inside the tasting room or outside which was near the vineyard - very nice out there.  Their vineyard was planted in 1999. That may be a little unusual for the immediate Austin area. The vines and the grounds are very well maintained.   As far as the place, it is beautiful. It has the feeling of Napa but with Austin-area live oak trees.  The property borders Lake Travis though it is barely visible from the tasting room area. There's an exclusive members only area that is on the lake.  We purchased the Claros Reserve which is a Norton grape (hybrid) and is the grape grown on the estate. The wine was surprisingly excellent and cost $35.   I think that, with a reservation, this would've been a superior experience."

The property is absolutely gorgeous - I mean you can truly just sit and relax for hours while you take in the stunning view. I had made reservations but we arrived a tad bit early and Liz was happy to accommodate us sooner. I'd like to take a moment to offer my sincerest appreciation for Liz as she made this experience so memorable for us. It was our first proper wine tasting and she truly took the time to explain every single wine to us - notes/scents to look for, best food pairings, explaining the difference in textures, where the grapes are from - I mean the whole nine yards. She even showed us the safer, beginner way to swirl the wine to really delight your senses before tasting. I had added a cheese board to our reservation which we thoroughly enjoyed! Liz was patient with all of our questions on the wine (and cheese), had a wonderful sense of humor, and just a lovely personality to deliver a phenomenal package of customer service. Every single wine we tried was delicious! We took home a bottle of Claros but we seriously wanted to take home one of each. If we weren't relocating soon, we would 100% have signed up for their membership. If we get to visit the area again, we will definitely stop in. I highly recommend visiting!"

Disappointing, because we drove out of our way and had our young daughter with us. Were hoping to have a nice little picnic. Waste of time. It would have been nice if it were posted on the website.

                "description": "Came here for wine tasting and was very impressed with the vineyard. We were staying at Horseshoe Bay Resort and were deciding between several vineyards to try in the area. I'm really glad we ended up trying Stone House. We decided to sit on the patio for our tasting. I tried the classic tasting and my dad tried the reserve tasting. The wines were mostly from Australia. They had one of their house wines on my menu. I thought the quality of wines was very average. We also got a cheese board which was really good.  The area was picturesque and we were allowed to go down to an area for wine club members. They had an enclosed outdoor area for members only with a view of the lake.  Overall, if you want to go to a vineyard with great views, this is the place to go."

She welcomed us and gave us a nice toast of something bubbly and told us about the vineyard and its owner, Angela. The wine of the month was Angela's Wish. I was having a particularly emotional time with it at this point because my beloved grandmother, Angela, passed away recently and had wanted to visit this area. I, of course, had to get the wine of the month so I could keep that bottle. I told Jaramy of my grandmother and the significance of the name of the bottle and she listened with an open heart. My group also got a nice charcuterie board and sat outside. Though it was pouring down rain, we still had a lovely time conversing with others and enjoying the view."

The wines as always are tasty and reasonably priced. Beautiful property, plenty of room to space out, and following covid protocols.   We called to make a reservation but got their voice mail. Impressively, even though we did not leave a message, Doug called us back promptly and got us scheduled for an impromptu tasting.   Their tasting room manager was our host and we had a great experience.   We will continue to come back!"

The tasting was $15.   They have a cute patio where you can bring your dog. You can also bring outside food to enjoy with your glass of wine. They do sell local bread. The tasting room smells heavenly with the fresh bread right at your side.   Staff was great. Would definitely recommend."

I didn't really care for the wines. They had a bunch of roses which were mediocre. Not sure if that was them trying to find their niche. The reds were okay but nothing I would pay for for the price they were charging. One thing we were disappointed in was they charged $25 for an online reserved \"tasting with bites\" but when we got there it was basically just a tasting and we had to pay extra for food. They had a sandwich that was pretty tasty but was out of their sourdough bread. There tasting included maybe about 7 wines but I'm not sure if that was also because our server allowed us to try a few more. Didn't think it was worth $25 so I was surprised to find that the tasting \"without bites\" wasn't cheaper. I can go find better tasting wines for cheaper down the road... like at signor. I'll pass next time and try a different winery."

                "description": "Doug Lewis and Duncan McNabb are among the younger wine makers in Texas, but are rising the bar in making quality, well structured, Texan wine.  Their tasting pavilion is now open and tastings are by appointment only.  The tasting pavilion is beautiful, open, and overlooks one of their vineyards planted in 2014.  They have several acres of vineyards on site.  You can taste the current releases for $15.  The tasting is refunded if you purchase two bottles.  The bottle prices here compared to other Texas wineries are decent.    They make wines sourced from 100% Texas grapes.  I like how their wines showcase terroir driven single vineyard wines.  They focus on Mediterranean varitels.  Lewis makes one of my favorite Texas white wines, Swim Spot.  I wish they would can that wine so I could drink it while floating on an intertube.    I also like that currently their tasting menu shows the different styles of Tempranillo from different Texas Vineyards.You can really taste how the different terroir influences the varietal.  This is a great way to experience how the nauances of a growing environment affects the wine.  The staff are friendly.  They are not 100% familiar with the production of the wine.  But, can give you some highlights while tasting.  Book in advance as they are well known and can fill up for weekends several days in advance."

They've only been open a few years, and have moved from a small tasting room into a large covered patio with comfortable furniture, big fans, and lights strung about the porch and trees creating a great modern design meets Texas Hill Country ambiance.  We most recently went out for their Rose Release Party. The event was fantastic with a full patio, live music, and dogs playing in the field outside the vineyard. This winery is less than an hour from Austin, moderately priced, and fantastic for all occasions. Just make sure to call ahead to book a tasting, and you won't be disappointed.   They've been bottling grapes from around Texas for the past couple years, and I'm excited to see them finally get their vineyard matured and bottled soon!"

Stopped in 15 minutes before closing time on Labor Day without a reservation, and they were very sweet to allow me a tasting anyway.  $15 tasting for 6 wines, tasting fee waived if you purchase two bottles.  Which I did. One summery white and one Mourvèdre.  The prices were quite fair compared to competitors and the quality was there.  The Merlot was absolutely the star, but I was feeling too economical that day to buy it at $46-ish a bottle.   The patio is beautiful and feels secluded.  The hospitality was great and it was a very chill atmosphere.  It did not feel like a tourist trap, which is so valuable to me.  I'm so glad they treated me well on this inaugural visit because now they have a devoted customer for many years to come. Cheers!"

Servers are still knowledgeable about their wine and winery; wines are still very good; and now you have a very nice area (indoor and outdoor) to taste. As always, tasting is a unique experience so not everyone will agree about their quality of wines.   The best thing from all of this is there are more wineries popping up to challenge Lewis. Now everyone wants to raise the bar to deliver the best wine tasting experience possible. It is great to be a wine lover!"

We could have spent a couple of hours just enjoying the view and the great wines.  Kyle lead our tasting and was happy to answer questions as well as talk about the wines. We bought two bottles to take back to Missouri. :) Highly recommend."

The best wine we had all day and only location we bought wine. Outdoor area is nice. Views aren't as exciting as some other wineries but the delicious wine beats the views."

                "description": "Found these folks via word-of-mouth from a few folks in the local wine business. In the last year, they've expanded their tasting room substantially, though they remain \"by appointment\" at present. The current wine lineup is very Tempranillo-centric, and while there's much to be said and appreciated about this varietal in Texas, don't expect to find a large variety of wines here (the other two on the current lineup are a vinho-verde style white and a Newsom Cabernet). I must mention here that their flagship Round Mountain wines (and probably some library selections as well) are available for bottle purchase. The servers here have all been knowledgeable and provide a bit of wine education along with the pours."

                "description": "Im not a  wine drinker but for my friend's bday we took a trip to Texas Wine Country.  She wanted to try this place mostly for the ambience as it does look like a castle. I've got to say that pizza was flipping amazing! Only downfall is they do have a very large furry black dog that kind of roams around, who is very friendly and sweet, but he decided to takeoff with half our pizza, however they handled it perfectly and brought us a whole brand new pizza. We also then moved from one of the lower chair tables, to the bar style seating. Being that I'm not a wine fan I drink the Prosecco which we actually ended up buying a bottle of when we left. Overall good experience, would recommend a stop if your passing thru Johnson City headed to Fredericksburg, but not my favorite stop we made. (Trip was in March so weather was perfect during day and a lil chilly at nite so bring a sweater)"

Not much to offer food wise as they only make pizza on Friday-Sunday. We decided to order the frozen sangria after having a little sample and the lady who waited on us brought it out to us with the plastic cup barely filled. She seemed to be having a problem with the machine and getting sangria out. She said she'd bring us more out but never did. Since it was $9 a cup, I went back in and asked for more which she cheerfully obliged however she should have checked back with us on that. We got a cheese and charcuterie board and it was so good. We sat outside and really enjoyed the view. When we were about to leave, I asked could we look around the place and was told yes. My sister and I started to enter the \"Dungeon\" and another employee stopped us and said we couldn't go down there unless escorted but did not offer to escort us. Then close the door so patrons don't mistakenly enter that room.  Cool castle but employees need to step up their game."

We decided to do a tasting so we could sample a variety of wines. I wish this place had more food options (they have pizza but only F-Sun).   The patio was gorgeous and although most of the tasting are done inside, we asked to be outdoors so we could better enjoy the view. Personally, I enjoy tasting that are poured at your table but it didn't seem like that was the case here.    The wine itself was okay. I wasn't impressed by the sparkling wines but the Mythos red wine was delicious! I'll be the first one to admit that I don't like red wines but this one was special. The sweet wines a nice finish to the tasting"

We arrived a few minutes early and had to wait for the gates to be opened. We were greeted promptly inside and offered the wine tasting packages. While we tasted the wines we looked around at the decorations , I loved the dragons . They have  an inviting patio with a great view. Their wines were not really to our liking , but not everyone likes the same wines. That is the beauty of wine. I'm glad we stopped and got the castle experience."

Around 11am on a Thursday I believe there was only one person working throughout the entire restaurant and she was great, very friendly and on top of it; she ensured that our wines were refilled promptly. I believe the wines are from Italy, France, Spain, and some Texas wines. If you're looking for local wines only this may not be your place but we enjoyed the environment and service. Definitely recommended."

We had pre-reserved our patio spot and was never asked for our name. They just applied our credit based on us saying that we'd made a booking. We split a tasting and got a pizza. I'd love to review the pizza but after waiting over 45 minutes for it, we gave up and left. The live music was loud and hard to hold a conversation over. The wine was meh.  There are so many other places to go in Fredericksburg- save your $ and go elsewhere."

                "description": "My lady made reservations for me and two friends at $20 each for a nice afternoon of wine tasting. We were seated on the patio and ordered the wine tasting, a half charcuterie board and their \"wood-fired veggie supreme\" pizza. Before I get into it, I'll list the positives: The bathrooms were very clean, views were nice, and the staff was very friendly.  For a wine tasting in Texas hill country, we expected more local wines to be showcased but were given an underwhelming spread to try out from different countries. There wasn't anything we tasted that compelled me to buy a bottle--but what really stood out was the advertised wood-fired pizzas.   Anyone who was paying attention to how the pizzas were being cooked would have noticed that they were NOT cooked by wood fire but instead cooked in their gas heated oven on the patio. Granted the pizza could feed four guests easily, (you'd hope so at $25 per pizza) the toppings on the supreme veggie pizza consisted of just a small dice of raw tomatoes, bell peppers, tomato sauce, and cheese. You would think someone in the kitchen might consider adding some spinach or artichokes or maybe grill the peppers or roast the tomatoes! I may be spoiled because I've had some great pizza in my life, but damn that pizza was sad! Here's a tip, 290 wine castle--look into overnight fermentation for your pizza dough. Can you not taste how bland your product is? I won't be coming back or recommending this spot unless medieval armor goes on discount."

                "description": "Went here on a wine tour. I work in the industry so I do not question their judgement to cut my aunt off as she was being loud on her birthday. What did not make sense was the OWNER deciding to cut off the entire group. Four of us did not and never did show signs of intoxication: I've been a bartender for 10+ years. We never challenged this even if we didn't agree, we did mention how the other owner never once was wearing a mask: a regulation by law that's still in affect. After that he threatened to call the police on our group.  During this interaction, I had left my jacket in the bathroom. I asked a bartender and the OWNER about the jacket and they immediately knew what I was referring to. I never described this jacket but they did on the spot, meaning they'd seen it. Yet, after we asked why the entire group was cut off and pointed out the owners lack of responsibility to wearing a mask... my jacket was never seen. I needed to leave the property. They and their staff felt confident enough to yell, scream and talk back to me without hesitation. I simply wanted my property which they had in their possession from the beginning.   Maybe they don't care about wine tour costumers but about 4+ of us intended on buying a bottle. Glad we didn't.   There are SOOOOO many other winery's in the area worthy of your money and time. Highly don't recommend this establishment, I have over 11 years in the service industry and I have never dealt with such unprofessional workers, especially coming from OWNERS.   Go elsewhere."

                "description": "We came in on our makeshift wine tours of Fredericksburg- The grounds at this winery are beautiful! We sat outside and sampled some of their options. They had 3 options- dry, sweet, and ports. Mary, who was working that day, gave us a run down on their wines and was overall the sweetest lady! If you are looking to spend time outdoors with friends or family, this is a great location!"

                "description": "For years, Texas Hills was our go to winery. They used to have a reasonably priced tasting and many reasonably priced wines that we really loved. We generally left with 6 - 12 bottles when we made our stop.   Last time, the tasting was up to $22, and very few of the wines were anything worth buying. Also, they claim to be dog friendly, but their off leash dog does not seem to like other dogs being there, probably better to just say you are not dog friendly.   Sadly, I don't see us coming back. Too many other great choices. I gave them a second star because of fond memories of what it used to be."

                "description": "I went with my girlfriends for a wine tasting weekend and we stopped here to take a look. The wine tasting room can get a little crowded, but they do have outside seating if you plan to have a glass or a bottle. The tastings are fairly priced. The reds are $6 for $10 and the whites are 3 for $5. I had the reds since the whites were all considered sweet. My favorite red was the Sangiovese.   They sell the usual wine store items inside their tasting room. The day we were there, they had someone sampling their balsamic vinegar and oils.  For those wanting to take a bottle outside, they will place it in a chiller for you. You can purchase cheese and crackers from them, but they also let you bring your own food. They did have a food truck the day I went.   The property is beautiful and it has big trees that provide good shade. They also have a covered patio."

                "description": "We went there to celebrate my friend's 50th bday. Luckily her bday was during their annual grape stomp celebration, which is done to honor the harvest season. This is done during the month of August.  She experienced the grape stomping and got a t-shirt. And we also had our feet in it! T-shirts are also available for purchase at this event. Since the day it was all about her, I can tell you that she had a blast. And so did we! We were treated like royalties and we were not in a castle. They have a tasting room, a small gift shop, indoor and outdoor sitting. Wine club is also available. Check their website for future events, and keep in touch to see what's going on.  They can also ship wine. Isn't that amazing! https://www.texashillsvineyard.com/"

                "description": "I really enjoyed this wine tasting, and our group even got a mini tour of the barrel room and mobile bottling station! My fave taste was probably the Barbera, which was very fruity and drinkable. If you purchase a bottle, the tasting (which is normally $10) is free. Since most bottles are only around $15, this is SO WORTH IT! We got a bottle of the Due Bianco to give as a gift. The shop and grounds are lovely, and we got to play with their dog. A great start to our wine tour!"

I had to say hello this is my first time here can you please explain how it works. She then proceeded to talk. My friend and I did the wine tasting and toward the end she eventually loosened up.

A friendly chocolate lab named Lily greeted us out front and the owner greeted us when we made our way inside.  We enjoyed the tasting of 6 different wines and each one was very good. The knowledge and humor of the staff was on point. We very much enjoyed ourselves. Lots of cute things to buy in the store area. We had our young daughter with us and didn't expect it to be too kid-friendly, but they tried to interact with her which I appreciated.  Would be nice to have had a table with chairs or some sort of sitting area inside because we may have stayed longer and enjoyed a couple glasses. The outside patio was very nice, but we were not up for being out in the heat today.  We bought a few of our favorites and are considering joining their wine club."

                "description": "Located on the drive to Pedernales Falls is Texas Hills Vineyards, just a hop skip and a jump from the 290 wine road.  As you enter the property you will be greeted by the estate vineyard, and the beautiful hacienda like building nestled back amongst the trees.    They use sustainable organic methods to grow the vineyard, and the tasting room was built utilizing environmentally friendly methods.  They used earth from the property for the building, utilizing an older technique called \"rammed earth\".  They utilize only Texas sourced grapes for their wines, except for one wine on the menu that is a collaboration with another winemaker friend I am told.  They were the first producer of Pinot Grigio in Texas, and we have them to thank for the 290 wine road being founded.    The experience here can vary based on who is serving you, and when.  The tasting room bar is small and can feel very cramped amongst the unique gift shop items they have.  I tend to stay away from Saturday's as you can just feel like you are being rushed through amongst the crowds. Also, not all the staff are as knowledgeable as others.  No matter what, I have never had an experience with anyone who wasn't friendly here.  I have always felt like this was more of a homey wine tasting experience.  For a more informative and intimate feeling, come on a weekday or Sunday.  However, for $5 for 5 tastings of your choice from the menu, that is a tough price to beat.  Plus, the bottles of wine are very reasonable with the majority between $12-20.    I find the price point matches the quality of the wine here.  Pretty good Texas house wine.  I find the reds to be better than the whites   My two favorites are the Moscato (great with spicy foods) and the Kick Butt Cab."

It was packed full of a large group of drunk ladies who were whooping and hollering where the wine seller were even squinting their eyes. Our seller was nice but was pretty concerned with the other ladies around the main table so we didn't get as much attention as we thought we would in this area. Though the wine options were delightful our favorite experiences were the nice area outside, on the picnic table while we sipped our wine and dined on cheese and crackers. We bought a couple of bottles to take home and would really like to come back and try the experience again."

The unfortunate: Logan is troubling. Having an extensive background in the service industry, I know that dealing with groups can be frustrating. Especially bachelor/bachelorette groups, because everyone is typically more spirited than they might usually be. We were one such group, but we are a gaggle of teachers and young mothers, so nothing audacious was afoot. As some members of the group entered an energized conversation about football, the bride-to-be (ME) said \"fly eagles fly\". Logan felt that instead of speaking to Bob (their staff member handling our group), Nick (our tour guide), or any other member of our party that it was appropriate to walk up to me and tell me that he would \"cut me off and start kicking out my friends if we kept using such language\". My comment had been my only contribution to the whole conversation, because I had actually been speaking with Bob the whole time. I assume he misheard me, and assumed I was cursing, but my customer service background tells me that you give people a kind warning first, before launching in to the threats. We quickly wrapped up, as several members of our group had already bought a couple hundred dollars worth of wine there. On my way out, in response to me telling Bob that he was \"so sweet, I wish everyone else was as respectful as him\", Logan followed me out the door and yelled to our whole group that we could \"just NOT EVER come back\". Don't worry Logan, we won't be returning."

Crowson came highly recommended from our friend who lives in Austin, so we made a reservation for 6 people on a Saturday for a wine tasting.  They are taking Covid precautions, everything was socially distanced, our tasting was outside (and thankfully they had heaters so we were quite nice and warm), and everyone was wearing masks!  The wine was absolutely delicious and we all loved the wine we had here. One of only two places in Texas that has natural wines (nothing added). This is a very cozy, homey, winery- they make you feel so welcome, are very gracious and just a fun time ! Henry and his dad were a delight.  Highly recommend this place!"

There are only 2 ingredients in this wine - grapes and love. Henry did an excellent job of sharing his knowledge and passion for minimally processed wines (nothing added, nothing removed).  Our group of 8 was seated at the table in the tasting room as he poured us taste from 6 wines and explained his process, grape selection, and philosophy.  He was patient and thorough as we asked question after question.  He then took us into the working part of the winery, showed us how he knocked down the cap, and let us do it too!  I ended up with a bottle of one of the rosés and one of the reds, taking home to share with my husband and entice him to plan a return visit.  2019 Reviews #37"

The location, decor, ambiance (especially the Townes Van Zandt ), very educated and verbose host/vintner, and the most unique, aromatic, delicious wines all work in concert to deliver an experience that will engage all of your senses and create a pining that encourages resurgence. Henry and his family have a very bright and successful future ahead!"

From their storefront, they sell a small selection of natural wines. They are delicious and Henry conducts a terrific sit down tasting.   Appointments are appropriate; a must do while in town."

I gave it a shot and called anyway.  He was able to get there quickly and do our tasting so PLEASE call if you show up to the door with no appointment, he is very accommodating.  We are from wine country in California and have done many tastings.  The Crowson tasting was absolutely the best one I've experienced.  Henry is gently passionate, extremely knowledgeable and just a really nice guy.  You can tell that he is exactly where he is meant to be.  I can't wait to go back."

                "description": "Exploring the Wine Country nearby and was recommended to check out Henry's Wine Tasting at Crowson. It is by appointment only, but so amazing. It's perfect! He makes sure you are well taken care of and hear all about how the wine is made, the subtle differences, and gives a great background story. The wine is also really really good and very unique. I hadn't tried anything like it. During the summer, he only had a selection of whites, and although 2 people in our group didnt like white, they both left buying bottles of them! I believe his current season (Fall 2019) is reds only, but he may have a few of both at the time of your visit.  Very tasty, very unique wines. Heading back soon, just to stop here."

Henry, the proprietor and winemaker and his father Kenny, also a proprietor were welcoming and authentic.  Henry is making some unique and delicious wines.  While it may not have a beautiful vista like some of the wineries along 290, it is definitely worth your time to drink some good wines and listen to Henry talk about his wine and the winemaking process."

You get a card that's tied to your credit card to swipe or tap and then you have access to the wine you swiped for. Then you can get as much or as little as you want. It's a great way to try and explore new wines (and mead and some margarita inspired wines). Then you can load up on your favorite (what I did), or continue exploring. Really, two great options. Also, the guy working there was nice and very helpful. I've been telling people about how much I enjoyed coming here and recommending it.  Don't park in the paid parking next to Wanderlust if you can avoid it because it's stupidly expensive. Use that money on a Lyft or more wine."

Like, I was thee only soul inside the establishment from 5pm-7pm. As a patron and especially a first timer, you'd think they'd have a little leniency if you order a 8oz of wine and ask to exchange. I understand you can taste your pours, which I paid for at least 5 of them averaging $2-$3 for each TASTE. After my fourth taste, I wanted to trust that I was getting a good one because most of them were and I promise to god it was the worst taste to my palette that I've ever had. And Lissen Linda, I'm not a bougie wine person. But for this 8oglass to be $15 I couldn't even stomach it and asked if possible to exchange. I said, \"what's the policy if you get a wine that you absolutely can not stomach? Is that your own bad?\"  She said, \"yeah kinda. I'll call the manager but he's at another location\"   Okay cool. 15 minutes later I find her and I'm like, \"so can I exchange this wine or no? I don't need a refund\"   \"He said no\"  I work in the service industry as well and look out for people all the time. I just feel like she OR the manager could have made an accommodation but maybe operationally that's not the way they run things. That's my bad for not tasting the nasty ass wine. That particular 1 oz pour was like $4 so I assumed it was good to be so pricy.   ."

Wine on tap is such a great idea.   They give you a card that you use to get your wine. You get charged by the ounce. They do have happy hour. They have a good selection of wines. For those that don't like wine, they have a handful options (margarita, old fashioned)   The place is cute and they have a nice outdoor patio. They had a food truck the day we went.   Con:  - the wine comes out pretty fast, so you have to be careful as it can add up quick. If you want to taste first, be quick at closing it.  - there's no way to figure out how many ounces you are serving yourself."

You could tell they were glad we were new.  They truly have great enthusiasm for their jobs and this business.  A new product even arrived and we were informed we came at a terrific time!   It was so easy to tap my Wanderlust card and release the wine. There's a great variety of wines to choose from, including wines from France, Spain, some sangrias and hard lemonade. Warning: make sure all the taps are closed before you insert your card. I didn't see that one was turned a bit and wine started trickling and money ringing up on my card.  Because it's not very bright, I didn't see the wine flowing. Lesson learned!   There's an interesting room off the patio for private events.  I'm jealous I couldn't pop in!   Happy to see the food truck. Mmm: truffle fries and bruschetta!  You MUST come visit this location!"

Wanderlust charges by the ounce and although it adds up pretty quickly, if you're able to pace yourself, you can have a whole evening of fun. I got out of there spending well under $50 for two people, so we really didn't go all that crazy.  Try a million different wines and mixed drinks! they give you a card at the entrance and it just rings up your total, then they charge you on the way out. We had an issue with a bunch of cork settling into one of our glasses and they were able to remove that pour from our tab. The only thing is that it's hard to keep track of your favorite pours because there are so many options.  There is also a ton of space to sit. They have inside seating/lounge tables, there is outdoor seating and there's also an additional event space which you can sit in. We sat in the event space with a large group and it was so comfy.

When you walk in, they give you a separate card that you swipe before each one of your pours. I liked it because you could pour as much or as little as you wanted and it gave you the opportunity to try different wines without being committed to a full glass. Honestly, it reminded me of those self-serve frozen yogurt places. I also really liked the outdoor area - it was a great place to hang out with friends and we had a great time taking photos at the photo booth.  The only downside was that it was more expensive than I was expecting. They give you the price per ounce on the screen, but once you start pouring, it adds up VERY quickly. I could have spent the same amount of money on a way nicer and fuller glass of wine.  Overall, I enjoyed the concept and fun vibes. Would love to come back during their happy hour or something when things are half-priced!"

                "description": "What a cool little concept and space to drink wine in downtown Austin. Came here during happy hour last weekend with some friends and was overall impressed with the wine tasting here. There whole gimmick is you you can try any of the wines on the wall tap and your charged by the ounces you drink. I will warn you use a light touch on the taps as I learned the hard way the first try. Most of the wines were half off during happy hour which makes for a great deal and I also liked that there was a range of wines from across the globe and wasn't specific to one region. They also had patio seating an Italian food truck in case you get hungry. The only downside like most places downtown is the parking but I heard that's less of an issue at their east side location which I'm excited to try next!"

Red blends, dry white blends, bubbly, mead, etc. You name it, they have it!  When you arrive they swipe your card and give you another card, something like a hotel key card. You use this key card and swipe it before each self serve wine glass pour. The screen next to the tap will show you how many ounces you've filled up your glass and how much for the whole glass. The screen also shows how much each ounce of wine costs. Maybe I'm getting old and outdated but this was some cool technology! Probably the coolest, unique payment system I've ever seen!   There is a food truck on site with some seriously good pasta and appetizer types.   I can't speak to the parking situation since I walked from my location but I do believe there was a small parking lot."

Every time I have come in, Blake has always provided excellent customer service and understanding of the wine offerings. Overall, I will be back many more times to this place for their superb wine and service!  2 pro tips: Come in on Wednesdays for half off and make sure to try heal of the boot food truck."

                "description": "\"Froyo for wine\"; Fun idea, smooth process, nice spot, bit pricey.   It's a charge by oz place, like Froyo with all of the taps requiring an RFID card that you get by associating with a credit card at the front desk. Place the card on the reader and pour what you want into your glass. They have over 50 different styles, including mead, white, red, dry/sweet, and some wine-based cocktail style drinks.  They typically range from $1-3+ per oz so you'll probably come out with a $5-10 glass (4 oz) which is pretty comparable to most places.  There is both indoor and outdoor seating; interior is mostly couch seating and outdoor is patio/bench with faux grass. You can also bring dogs. The outdoor is a bit noisy, especially since it backs to another bar and is right under 35 so it was nicer indoors than out.  I don't usually drink wine because it gives me headaches and I certainly felt it the next day even after just 2 small glasses; possibly because of tasting so many different kind, so beware! Nice for trying something new but possible to get sick if you're mixing so much."

                "description": "Stopped into this downtown location after already visiting the location on Shady ln earlier in the week. I definitely enjoyed both locations for different reasons. I appreciate the way the wines are labeled in clear groupings so it's easier to just walk up and find what I'm wanting more quickly. They also have an Italian food truck in the back patio area. The truffle Parmesan fries were great and the pasta dish was a good portion. Lots of cute photo ops and decent areas of seating. I will say this location is much smaller and literally off the busy highway but still the experience they offer is worth checking out."

                "description": "I adore this place! I am on a mission to try out as many Hill Country wineries as I can, and I found this with my Christmas Wine Affair Passport. It ended up being such a favorite that I joined their club!   First, the setting is so much fun. Their main spot is in an old cottage, and they have turned it into part tasting room, part hang out, part shop, and it is oh so cute! Outside, they have a ton of tables, perfect for picnicking, and they have the lovely Airstream as well.   But the wines! I loved everything I had here. I was a big fan especially of the Lady Bird, a drier white, and the Ramble On, a delicious red blend that is perfect with garlicky foods. (I bought some to go with Christmas dinner lasagna!) The wine is served by the friendliest staff.   I am ready to go back again and again!"

You can't help but notice the cute little house with lovely outdoor seating and an airstream, parked out front. I was warmly greeted when I walked in and asked if I would like a tasting. Well yes ma'am, I would.   They had a lovely selection of 6, to try. For $15, I thought that was a wonderful deal. The women were friendly and it was a great way to break up my trip and get out of the car for a bit. One of the reds was my favorite and I may just have to stop back by on my way home to pick up a bottle.  They also have snacks and sandwiches and I bet when the weather is cooler, their outdoor space is the place to be."

We had some rich talks on everything from wine making, agriculture, farm animal showings, to COVID matters. All while sipping some spectacular wine from start to end. I was so glad this was our last stop as we had no place to be after this. We must have hung out for well over an hour drinking and talking up a storm and I loved every minute of it! Besides my wine picks, I also got some of their coffee grounds for some Farmhouse java this week. Its super good! On the wine side...my top picks of the 10 (yep 10) we tasted was the Smok and Miroirs and Cultivated."

                "description": "If you are a Texas Wine Lover and don't already know about Farmhouse Vineyards, shame on you! This is a farming family in Brownfield, Texas who has devoted a portion of the family farm to grape growing. They have a lovely tasting room in West Texas, but here locally in Central Texas, you can try their wines in Johnson City. The cute old house-turned-wine-tasting-room is a great spot to taste through the Farmhouse wines. It's cozy and they offer quite a few cute boutique shopping items in addition to their fabulous wines. Most days they offer fresh buttered popcorn...yes please! And the homemade bread packets are worth taking home. As for their wines, my personal faves are the Roussanne named 'Oh Hey, Charolais' and the blend called 'Jack Knife Reserve.' The Roussanne is a perfect fit for Chardonnay lovers, even though its not Chardonnay. The red blend called 'Jack Knifed' is a traditional GSM - Grenache, Syrah, Mourvedre, with oak aging to enhance the body. Summer is the tasting room manager here in JC and she will take great care of you. On a warm spring afternoon, you should definitely grab a glass and relax outside!"

                "description": "Farmhouse Vineyards is a well known wine grower located in Brownfield, TX. Farmhouse is owned by a brother/sister team - the Seaton's and Furgeson's. They own four vineyards located at three different sites. They have provided grapes to many well known winemakers in the Hill Country for years. They use the unwanted remaining grapes to make some intriguing wines. They are the first Texas winery I am aware of that grow and make solid wines from a Greek wine varietal, Malvasia Blanca. They also make a great sparkling wine with this varietal. They started a tasting bar located in an airstream trailer in Johnson city known as the Tipsy Trailer, and quickly outgrew it. They just opened a brick and mortar in Johnson City and celebrated their second weekend open this past weekend.  My friend and I were on our way home from our Fredericksburg wine weekend and noticed Farmhouse was still open. After several recommendations from my experienced wine friends, we had to stop and check them out. The tasting room is now located in a renovated home. When you enter, a quaint gift shop welcomes you, creating a farmhouse welcome. You walk through to a long narrow tasting room bar. We were warmly welcomed by a lovely tasting room associate. He walked us through the three different tasting flights - dry, rose, or sweet. Half way through the tasting the winemaker came over and stated chatting with us and walked us through how he made the wine and gave us the complete story. He also shared some of his labeled wine with us, which was very good. They had some tasty flavored popcorn to bite on between sips. Food will be coming in the future. We will definitely be back to experience the full tasting experience in the future. Since we didn't get to try all their wines I am keeping it at a four star. Will come back later to re-review after a full experience."

Everyone was so friendly and the owners were even there making sure people got home safely!!! 100% top notch stop and a must do on the wine trail!"

                "description": "Owners Nicholas and Katy Jane Seaton and Anthony and Traci Furgeson helped Farmhouse Vineyard realize its next natural step in its evolution, which is making wine! Their 122-acre vineyard is located near Brownfield in Texas High Plains AVA. With 16 plus varietals, it has been the grape source for many well-established Texas wineries that we have all come to know and love. We were fortunate to visit their \"new-new\" location in Johnson City at their house on highway 290. The previous location was at a trailer located near the 290 Vinery. The newest locale is right on Main street in a renovated classic home. Location, location, location is everything to a business and this place is spot on!  The owners do have plans to relocate the trailer to this new site soon.  Their expanded tasting menu consists of two flights, one has the full range of sparkling to dessert wines and the other focuses on dry Rosé, Whites, and Reds. As one of the first vineyards that helped establish Malvasia Bianca as a viable Texas grape, they have made a sparkling version called Boyfriend. The 2017 vintage has lemon grass and apricot notes that just \"bubble\" all over your palate. Their 2017 Revolution is a dry Rosé sparkling made from Counoise. With strong raspberry notes, it is crisp with a nice finish making this wine quite enjoyable on warm Texas days. For the 2017 Bloom Rosé, you get to enjoy a 100% Mourvedre Rosé that is light and refreshing with plenty of strawberry and melon notes. You will be in for a treat with their Marché. Made from a blend of Mourvedre, Cinsault, and Tempranillo, this Saignee style wine may be different than most Rosé's you've tried, but it is equally pleasing for the upcoming hot summer. There is a lovely red blend called, Ramble on which is a melding of Tempranillo, Merlot, and Cabernet Franc. It is smooth and fruit forward and we believe most red wine lovers will readily enjoy. Wine tasting at Farmhouse, will also provide you with a rare opportunity and special treat!  In their selection is one of Tim Drake's legendary wines called Assistant. This House of Drake greatness blends 76% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Merlot, and 9% Syrah sourced from Columbia Valley AVA in Washington.  It is a superb dry red wine blend with a beautiful fruit finish that will leave you craving for more!  Their semi-sweet dry white called Housewife is a Malvasia Bianca with nice melon and pear notes with just enough sweetness to boot. Lastly, you will get to enjoy their 2017 Sweet. This blend of Malvasia Bianca and Orange Muscat combines a bit of citrus and vanilla notes for something quite enjoyable and their sweetest dessert style wine. If you have visited the trailer before, now you have a new excuse to revisit and enjoy their expanded wine selection.  The staff and owners are quite friendly and will make you feel very comfortable as they chat with you about the wines. We strongly encourage you to stop in and visit their new location and wish them well as they kick off this new phase in their journey."

They were suppose to serve breakfast between 9-9:30 and it never got you'd until close to 10. The trash in our room was very taken out upon our arrival so our  bungalow smelled like somebody else's trash. We couldn't check in on time because they were short staffed even tho they told us we could the day before. One of our screens was falling off. We have extra pillows in closet but no extra pillows.  I swear our place was never actually cleaned between the people before us and us.   Serenity you looked so cute and wrap wanted to book our wedding there but you were just too dirty.  Hot tub had so many chemicals it took off my spray tan in less than 5 minutes. You couldn't sit in tub because you couldn't breathe with all the chemicals."

                "description": "To begin with the website is messed up and doesn't let you book reservations....  Next, the phone number listed is to an answering machine in which you have to leave a message and hope they call back.   Upon making the reservation I was assured everything was going to be great with my room and the special lovers cruise package I paid for.  On our way to the resort I called to inform them we were on the way and to ensure everything was good with our room.  I was assured by the staff that everything was in order with my room and the lovers cruise package.    Upon arrival we went to our room and not only was the lovers cruise package I paid extra for not set up but there was also animal feces on one of the rugs!  This naturally upset us to a large degree.  Here we are not two minutes into our stay and we have two major screw ups.   The next day I informed the staff that my wife and I would be gone for a certain time (I was specific about from when to when).  During the time when we were away I requested that they refresh/clean our room.  I was again assured it would be done with no problems.  Upon our return, of course, the room had not been touched.  When I went to the staff and complained they stated that they again were sorry for the failure and would rectify it quickly....  We had just a little time before our wine tour and needed back in our room to get ready.  So I politely went into the room and asked the maid how much longer she would need to finish our room.  The maid gave me attitude and disrespectfully said another five minutes.  Even after this insult I again was polite to the maid and thanked her for her efforts, she in turn ignored me.   This was a disaster of a three year anniversary celebration for me and my wife. I would give zero stars if I could.  For the amount of money I spent there, I expected far better customer service and professionalism.  I would certainly not recommend this place to anyone."

We arrived at 10pm and there was no light on the 75 yard flagstone walk to our cabin. The place was nice but the exterior deck with hot tub had over grown weeds all near the outdoor seating and bugs were crawling everywhere. The next day Saturday, I asked if they could cut the weeds back, they said no. Can you imagine?!? We paid $67.00 for a $20 brunch voucher on Sunday which was a joke. Place needs updating and needs to be more accommodated to people arriving at night. Refused to negotiate a partial refund. So bad service gets bad reviews. No excuse. Poor management and ownership. They said my expectations were too high????!!! Make sure everything is right because it won't get fixed the next day. Avoid this place"

The room was very comfortable, breakfast was tasty and the pool provided a welcome relief to the heat. It was also a pretty quick drive into downtown Wimberly where we found all kinds of things to do."

                "description": "We scrolled thru Facebook and Instagram pictures the days leading up to our stay, when we arrived, we immediately agreed that pictures did not do the Serenity Farmhouse Inn justice at all! The staff is friendly and very helpful. The layout of the grounds is perfect - everything is nearby but still far enough away so it's quiet outside. We stayed in the Farmers Market, and it was absolutely adorable, cozy and comfortable. Each morning a delicious breakfast was delivered to our door, and when we were done all we had to do was put the tray outside and the staff discreetly came out to pick it up. The sunset views were spectacular, and watching the deer walk around during the evenings was the perfect way to end our day. We cannot wait to visit again!"

                "description": "The place is nice. We went for my birthday. The place is a nice BandB and the property is large. Breakfast this morning was great and filing. I would have given it a Ten but the property is about 8 miles outside of town where all the happenings are. If you love the country and rural areas then this is the place. The cottage was very nice and a huge heart shaped tub for 2 people but no shower. There is a bunch of cats on the premises and my saw a pregnant fox. Hey Welcome to Wimberley Texas."

I was originally told it was okay, the manager called me back and said can't do it because there no one available to clean the rooms in a Sunday. My stay isn't till June 3rd surely there is a way to make an extra day happen in the beginning."

                "description": "We had a wonderful stay at Serenity Farm House Inn! They were so kind and welcoming to us. We stayed in the bungalow named, \"Merci Mimi\". It is an \"upgraded\" one with a hot tub! The property is located off of the busy highways, so it is always peaceful and relaxing out there!   When we arrived we were able to park near the cluster of bungalows and were welcomed with some fresh sangria wine! The hot tub was already up and running for us and they had a few coupons for certain shops/restaurants around the town for us!   As we explored around the grounds, we found they have a pen of a few rescue animals like donkeys, goats, and pigs which was a unique touch. The pool was also located near the houses and was small but had a beautiful view (as seen in pictures).   The houses were very nice and well kept. They had plenty of towels, kitchen supplies (everything you would need to cook), the kitchen appliances were in great shape and worked great! One thing we had some issues with is the ac unit, there was one in the bedroom, which I liked, and one in the living/kitchen area. They were just kind of complicated to use, we sat up late one night, with the handy manual they had laminated for us, trying to get it to keep the fan on while we slept. What I would suggest is having a ceiling fan in the bedroom or at least an easy setting on the ac to turn the fan on. We also were constantly adjusting the ac, it seemed like it would get really hot and then really cold. We also tested out the hot tub, it was really nice, but we couldn't go out there at night because there was hardly any lights out there. I also wish the hot tubs were a little more private, the house's windows next to us looked right down into our hot tub and people using the walk way by our bungalow could see straight into where the hot tub was. I noticed most of the other houses with hot tubs were more \"private\" than ours so it may just be the way the houses are laid out.   They also brought us delicious breakfast every morning complimentary! It was so good and fresh! So much better than any complimentary breakfast at regular hotels!   Overall it was a great stay and we will definitely want to come back in the future!"

We remarked every day on how quiet the place is although there were many other guests staying there at the same time. The drive to the inn is remote but it will be worth your while. Each morning we were greeted with eggs, bacon or sausage and bakery (I requested gluten free and was accommodated easily). We had champagne and chocolates in our room upon arrival. We couldn't have asked for a more perfect place to spend a week just to relax and get out of town."

                "description": "Nice stay, but could be improved.  We stayed 2 nights at the Rocky Creek Retreat in the resort village area, full price and not from a Groupon deal.   The grounds were nice and well maintained with cute decor.  The hot tub was clean and the cover looked brand new.  As we left Monday, I heard them cleaning other hot tubs.  We enjoyed our 2 kitty visitors that hung out and 'talked' to us.  We saw deer, a tarantula, and a fox roaming the property in the evening.  Lots of butterflies and birds, and wasps.  Breakfast was served promptly at 9:30 each morning, and it was divine.  Sunday we had chocolate covered strawberries atop a small bowl of fruit, with champagne and glasses of orange juice, a boiled egg, a cinnamon roll which I believe was made from croissant dough, and bacon.  Monday we had cheddar scrambled eggs, sausage links,  a blueberry lemon pound cake slice, peach jam, biscuits, and orange juice.  I wish it were served earlier, but we were aware of that at the time of booking.  Be forewarned - the roads that lead throughout the bandb are very rough with significant bumps and deep gouges for small cars, so drive slowly.  Another note on the vehicular aspect - you are not able to park directly in front of this particular cottage.  There is an area for you to park, then walk to your cottage. When lugging heavy luggage and in warm weather, it is a bit of a chore.  When we arrived and I mentioned this, the lady who greeted us offered to use her golf cart to tote our bags for us to our cottage, which was very kind.  The bungalows are pretty close together.  We arrived about 10 minutes before check in time, and our bungalow was still in the process of being cleaned, which was expected to take 30-45 minutes.  She offered us complimentary drinks and coupons to various restaurants in town if we would have liked to start there versus waiting, but having all of our things in the vehicle, we chose to wait for it to be cleaned.  It took only 30 minutes, and she prepared a fruit and cheese plate for us since we had to wait.  The very first thing I noticed about the bungalow was that it was very clean, from top to bottom.  The bathroom towels were clean, soft and thick.  Another thing, which I didn't think to ask about, was whether or not they stopped in while we were out to refresh towel supplies.  They didn't, and we used 3 towels on the first night, leaving us with 1 bath towel.  No fault on the bandb's part.  I wasn't going to call late in the evening for 1 bath towel when we'd already brought 4 of our own beach towels.  We had 2 a/c units, one in the kitchen area and one in the bedroom.  They got cold and stayed cold quickly.  The floorplan and furniture set up were odd and not necessarily conducive to what you would use a particular room for.  The TV was was mounted to a wall, that would you could a) watch from one wicker chair or b) watch with your head sideways from the couch.  In the bedroom, there was in fact a queen size bed as stated.  Unfortunately, it was set up sideways in order to make it fit in the bedroom.  Instead of sleeping with our heads against a headboard, we slept with our heads against a wall.  There were not blinds on the back door leading out from the bedroom, just a gauzy curtain.  No shielding from the morning sun.  There was little storage for our things - we had expected a dresser at least.  There was one tiny closet, from which we were able to hang some of our clothes, but it was stuffed with about 5 huge pillows on the raised part where you might set a bag or something.  Ultimately, we dug clothes and things from our bags daily rather than being able to stow them in a dresser.  When we booked, we were told that the grotto like setting of the hot tub was private.  Our 'grotto' was easily viewable from the two neighboring cottages.  Private in my mind means not in plain view - it should be described as personal hot tub, not private.  There needs to be some wasp patrol - we had an active wasp's nest on our back patio, so enjoying the back patio was a no go.  One of the back deck chairs was missing a cushion, and some old fencing like material was just laid against the back deck.  One of the cabinets had a window drape just randomly thrown in.  The shower door was completely off its railings. It has been this way awhile, as the linoleum is starting to pull away from the shower wall due to the long term leaking water.  Also missing were smoke detectors.  There were outlets, but no smoke detectors. There were 5 missing vertical slats from the sliding doors, which 1 or so would be okay, but that was a bit much.  The kitchen window was cracked as well. The lack of storage, odd layout and the lack of maintenance on some things detracted from our stay.  Overall, our stay at Serenity Farmhouse Inn was okay, but we intend to try elsewhere for the amount of money that we paid.  I hope that their maintenance improves as it is obvious that they put a lot into getting the cottage built and decorated."

                "description": "We arrived at 9:30 am in order to be there early for the 10:30 am Wine Tour pickup time.  The staff was so gracious and welcoming.  They informed us that the White Buffalo Bungalow was ready and we would be able to get settled in before leaving for the wine tour.   White Buffalo Bungalow was just breath taking from the private drive to the private jacuzzi.  The room has a full kitchen and had a bottle of welcome sangria to begin the pregaming before the wince tour.  The shower was amazing and the soaps, shampoo/conditioner smelled so good!   This was a Wednesday so we were lucky to be on the wine tour with only one other couple.  Jodi is such a pleasant and inviting soul. She got asked about each person's preferences as to be able to personalize the tour and pick which wineries she decided to take us too.  Jodi is so knowledgeable of the town and the wineries.  The lunch she provides is just amazing.   The pool area is so nice and calming.  Again it was the middle of the week and we had the pool to ourselves which was great.  Breakfast is brought to our room by about 9:45 each morning and was so good. (We were the last delivery.)  I was able to walk around the property 1  1/2 times and get a mile in each morning.   If you are not wanting to leave the property stop by HEB and pick up food to prepare in the room.  This was such a wonderful  experience I am already planning to go back next year."

                "description": "I am absolutely in love with the little Poets Cottage we stayed in last week. I really appreciate all of the attention to detail in the beautiful antique linens, fresh flowers, pillows, seating areas, bath tray etc. I could go on an on. It was a beautiful and relaxing retreat. It was in a wonderful central location for day trips to State Parks, great Texas BBQ, cute little towns and wonderful back roads. The view from the pool is spectacular. Nothing quite like a Hill Country sunset or sunrise either.   We really enjoyed the big Jacuzzi tub. It would have been nice to have a shower for quick mornings, but we made do. When the neighbors used theirs, their jets were so loud we could hear them. We could also hear the man's booming voice at times.   Their breakfast was amazing and presented in such a lovely way. I wish we could have gotten it a little earlier. I think 930 is probably perfect for a leisurely vacation where you sleep in, but we were up and hitting the roads early. We did wait around for it one day and I am so glad we did."

My favorite was their Russian River Valley Pinot and they had a special white from the green valley sub appellation I LOVED.

                "description": "Been wanting to check this place out for awhile now. Very close to our house in town and needed a nice Texas bottle of wine for a charcuterie board night.  Made reservations for 2... Very specific time slots available. We were arriving a tad early so I called first to make sure that was indeed ok and I actually got a call service... they weren't on site and first told me that they take walk ins and it was cool.... then he stopped me before hanging up telling me no... reservations required... he couldn't figure it out and didn't have access to the winery to check... that was odd. Walked in and got right in to a different table then I reserved since we were early.  You will feel like you're walking into a house.... lots of pictures and decor everywhere.... they are not minimalists :) Sat down and Ami took excellent care of us with the wine tastings and a couple snacks. We ended up grabbing a bottle of our favorite to go.  We were there for an hour. Felt kind of rushed. The owner was walking around the whole time we were there with an ipad scanning the room and tables... it kind of ruined the chill experience...  loved the nice friendly folks that were there drinking with their dogs... music in the background was nice. The wines were tasty too and Ami was super knowledgeable about them all. She was the best part of our time there.  I prefer outdoor wineries. There are no windows and it's all indoors in a strip center. I am very sensitive to floral air fresheners and strong chemical cleaners and they definitely use both. A lady was walking around spraying windex after people left very close to us and it was so strong it retuned the wine tasting experience trying to navigate the smell and taste the wine....  Overall the wines were good and the people were nice...  Windex spraying, calling a hot line instead of winery and Ipad guy walking around the whole time wasn't for me...  I like laid back relax and stay as long as you choose atmospheres with no strong cleaning smells while drinking wine. The bathroom is also very strong.... extremely blue toilet water... and fragrances... Doesn't mix well with food and wine..  Loved all the dogs and pics of dogs!  Ami gets 10 stars!!!"

I've been to plenty of wine tastings that I had to figure out one I liked. This dilemma was figuring out if there was one I didn't like. My friends all agreed, and we actually tried to figure out if we could get another time slot reservation because we enjoy ourselves that much. The staff were so welcoming and checked on us often enough but not too often. There were snack options, and apparently on the weekends they try to offer food specials if you come hungry. We really enjoyed ourselves and look forward to next time."

We easily made a reservation on the website and came in at 2pm on a Saturday. They took out temperatures at the door and we were seated quickly.   We decided to go for the wine tasting first, 5 samples for $15 plus a stemless logo glass to take home! We really enjoyed trying the wines and enjoyed all of them. Our favorite was the Blanc du Bois because it was light and crisp but had a unique fragrant flavor from the floral notes and the apricot.   My only gripe was the reservation was only 45 minutes. I wish it could've been around an hour, we didn't get a chance to finish our wine or our charcuterie but it's not too big of a deal since we just took it back home. We also got another bottle of the Blanc du Bois to take home and they gave us a cute wine bag for the two bottles.   We will definitely be back again to try the rest of the wines!!"

                "description": "What a wonderful discovery on a lazy pre-Xmas Sat afternoon. Who would have thought you could find a boutique winery that rivals any that I've visited in Sonoma.   Do not despair as you pull into the generic industrial park hard off of Anderson Mill Road in the CP. Walk-in past the small lobby area and step into their beautifully decorated tasting room.  Since we were the only patrons we received VIP treatment from start to finish.   We opted for their premium tasting menu and selected all reds. I'm not a TX wine fan but Dylan, our sommelier, expertly guided us through our tasting and as we concluded our wonderful stay my mind was changed.   My favorite was the Alexandar Valley Cab will more than suffice if you enjoy a big traditional Cab with a strong finish.   Their Spanish Mourvedre version is deep and rich and has a surprisingly strong finish,   There are a number of \"light\" reds as well. We were not fans but appreciated the flavor and balance of these wines.   Bent Oak does offer cheese plates and other small plates to accompany your tasting. Check their social media as they have live music on certain days.   Wonderful wine, an intimate setting, and passionate knowledgeable folks equals a 5 star experience."

                "description": "This was a real treat.  We looked for winery that was open before 4pm. We were staying in San Antonio and wanted to visit Austin TX. We found this place by searching best wineries near Austin. When we 1st arrived, it looked like a little store front in a strip mall. When we entered it was a whole different story. We were greeted by Debbie and Bryan who both turned out to be extremely gracious hosts.  They have wines grown in TX and CA. The TX grapes are grown in the High Plaines near New Mexico where it is warm during the day and cooler at night. I decided to do a tasting with only the TX wines.   The TX wine menu had 5 wines for the tasting menu. Started with the Chenon Blanc (quite nice with a buttery smoothness), proceeded to the Blanc de Bois, then the Roussanne (my least favorite), then switching to the reds starting with the Sangiovese and finally to the tempranillo.  The Tempranillo was my absolute favorite.    What really made this experience so nice was the wine Ambassador Debbie. She is just the nicest person who took good care of us. She also has a very nice sense of humor. Bryan was also very nice. He helped me pick out a few stainless steel wine stoppers. Bryan gave us great restaurant suggestions for Austin and San Antonio.  Do not be fooled with the entrance on the outside. It is misleading in the size and the value you receive on the inside."

Took two of my really good friends here today both who require wheelchair accessibility and felt very comfortable in the atmosphere. The reservation made ahead time was set up easily and the communication was quick and efficient through email. They were able to recommend a table that was best suited for us all to feel comfortable. It is very rare to actually be able to talk to the owners/wine makers about their products but they were the ones serving us the tasting! It really was a special experience not only for me but for my friends that have not gone out socially since the pandemic. Thank y'all so much for the inclusive atmosphere and making it such a memorable experience, we had a blast!"

                "description": "What a hidden gem! We were sitting at home on a Friday night, trying to find something to do. After a quick yelp search, we saw there was a winery up the street and open late. We decided to take a trip and check it out.  Driving up, you start to question if you are going the right direction but just keep going.   You walk in to this office center and are welcomed to the most friendly staff and environment.  Rarely do you get to sit down at a winery and speak to the head wine maker.   What really makes this place different is the fact that they have California and Texas wines. I'm no expert, but I've been told Texas grapes just don't compare.    The prices are great, and the options are plenty.  This will definitely be the family visit spot in the future."

                "description": "Wine: Only tried one wine, the tempranillo. It was fine, not as bold as they usually are. I smelled some of the whites, and they smelled very sweet so I passed. Didn't even look at pricing because of what the snacks cost.  Snacks: wow, expensive. Tried a bunch of them with a group, overall not worth the price. Particularly the truffles. It was $27 for a teensy box of 9 pieces of terrible chocolate. Waxy texture, did not melt when you eat it, chalky, bad flavor. Dark chocolate is my fave, so that's not the issue. Who knew chocolate could actually be yucky? It came from next door, glad we didn't go there after.   Service: very good, sweet ladies.  Ambience: not good. Outside it just looks like a store front, inside is super dark, no windows, and looks like a Kirkland's from the 90s.... everything is red, has fringe, pretty cheesy. Not eclectic, just ugly and full of stuff."

                "description": "Living in Austin, this winery is located in our backyard. It's nice to be able to drive just 20 minutes and enjoy a good glass of wine, and meet the people who made it. I now have a place for out of town guests just spending the weekend to take a sip of Texas wine.  They focus on creating quality wines sourced from Texas and California grapes.  They do not blend grapes sourced from the two states together.  When you drink a bottle of Texas sourced wine, it is 100% Texas, and vice versa. Bent Oak has been around for about 3 1/2 years, and from what I have heard they are starting to find their stride.   When you enter the space, you will walk through the front gift shop to the back tasting room and production area.  They have gone to amazing strides to make a warehouse space homey. It feels like a Texas hill country family home.  We were warmly welcomed, and they even let us take our three well behaved dogs into the back area to sit and enjoy a tasting with us.  Everyone here was friendly and knowledgeable.    I was pleasantly surprised by the consistent quality of all their wines available to taste.  You can taste up to five wines from their menu.  The Blanc Du Bois was one of my stand out favorites.  There wasn't anything I didn't like on the menu.  I am not a fan of Chardonnay's but their California sourced Chardonnay was good.  Their reds were a bit young, but the Mourvedre from the Texas High plains was tasty and my favorite of the current options.  Medium bodied but with spicy fruity rich tones.  The Sangiovese was satiny smooth, but just needed some time.  I actually enjoyed their Texas wines more than the California options.    Clearly there is a reason why their wine club membership has a waitlist.  It's just a great group of people to hang out with.  It felt like being with family, and enjoying a great conversation over a nice glass of wine.  They are located next to Delysia chocolates towards the back of a warehouse area.  Wine and chocolate neighbors?  Yep, it's an amazing pairing."

                "description": "Super friendly server and great location.  This is a fun winery that advertises a lot of events and offers \"wine cocktails\" which my wife really enjoyed.  It is keg wine so it comes out of spouts on the wall and they fill a bottle for you if you buy one.  This was different and I don't know enough about wine to know if it helps or not.   I really liked the laid back feel.  This doesn't have the pho-Tuscan Vegas facade that some of the bigger places have put up, but it is a fun lil hill country spot with a good sized deck, small indoor area and lots of shade to play corn hole or let kids run around.   The wine was good - we shared a tasting which is what we usually do before buying a glass - each was a good sized pour and I thought they were going to charge us for two but good sized pour is just how they roll.   Plan to return for sure!"

My wife and I have visited many of them since buying a house in the area over a year ago.  What I love about Vinovium are all the great events they put on.  From lounge takeovers, where winemakers give tastings of their wine, to stand-up comedy, to Trivia nights.   The owner and staff are all super welcoming and so knowledgeable about wine.  They've got a large selection of rotating wines on tap and you can get a bottle filled there to take home that can be brought back to reduce on waste, which is another plus in my book.   We'd only visited a couple times before we were sold on joining their membership club.  And since then we've enjoyed hanging out and feeling like we're part of the family.  Trivia night was such a blast.  And it's on the same night as their Prime rib dinner which was out of this world - check out my pictures.   For a change of pace from your ordinary winery/wine bar, I highly recommend a visit.  There's really no other place like this around here."

                "description": "This is a down to earth winery with great oak trees all around! We were greeted by two sweet dogs and the owner Daniel. He was very welcoming to us! This winery has a huge nice hand built outdoor deck with ceiling fans too! The bartender who had a really great name (last name Drake) ask her about it...shewas very knowledgeable and super sweet! The wine was really delicious too! They were the first to serve wine out of kegs we learned and I liked their white blend. If you are looking to cool off from the summer heat we recommend the white port served over ice or one of theirs cocktails. They also have wine bottle koozies too, added bonus for Texas!"

                "description": "Not worth the stop. We came as part of a wine tour and this was our worst stop. They were rude to my friends who paid for drinks and bottles of wine (separate from what was offered with the tour) and would not allow them to sit with us because we came as part of the tour and the table was for \"paying guests\". Additionally food was withheld from our group, but they explained it was because they could make $15 a plate off of other guests. It was just a bit tacky to explain it that way and made us uncomfortable.   On a more positive note, I thought a couple of wines were good, but given the competition in the area and the blatant price gouging, I would take my business elsewhere."

We got to meet the owner Barbara who was great, and loved our waitress Wendy who was very knowledgable and told some great stories. We're a very chatty group and loved that she took the time to chat along with us about her life and the region.  We each got a tasting and shared a charcuterie board which had a great variety of cheese and meats.  It's super new, so be sure to stop by and try it if you're in the area!"

We got to meet the very charming owners and taste some of their delicious wines. We also got to hear the wonderful story of how Siboney came to be; it's a love story so I won't spoil it for you.   If my friend and I didn't already have too many wine club memberships between us, we would have certainly signed up for this one; I hope to join in the future.   Siboney Cellars is definitely a place to visit and keep visiting. I plan to go every time I'm in the area and hope to see them grow and thrive.   Way to go Travis and Hot Shot!!"

Siboney Cellars is making phenomenal wines, has a charming story, a beautiful property and very welcoming owners/partners. Meaning lies in each thoughtful detail from the name of the winery, the naming of the wines, their symbol.. I won't share too much as it is such a treat to experience first hand! I am obsessed with their Coral Estrellas Sparkling Rosé made with 100% Sangiovese from the Texas High Plains. After this sabering I am certain I heard \"Come quickly, I am tasting the [Texas] stars!\"  We have visited @siboneycellars twice and truly enjoy hearing first hand the story of, which is truly a love story, Siboney from Winemaker Barbara Lecuona and Miguel Lecuona.   They welcome you to visit and experience their incredible wines, watch as their newly planted vines grow and also see their beautiful new facility in the hill overlooking the vines  just opened!"

                "description": "We finally ventured to the newest winery to open in Johnson City. We have patiently awaited it's opening and wanted to give it a few weeks before visiting. We shared a bottle of the Coral Estrellas Sparkling Rosé and a charcuterie tray that was better than anticipated. The sparkling wine was great and not overly sweet like a lot of Texas wines tend to be, and the charcuterie had a variety of meats and cheeses, olives, dried fruits and nuts and an added touch was the hot crusty bread served alongside the crackers to enjoy all. The view is beautiful! The terrace overlooking the vineyard is perfect especially on a day like yesterday! Wine, delicious. The owners and stories were delightful. My husband opted for a cigar and his day got even better. Miguel picked a cigar to his liking and when he found out he liked slightly sweet, he brought him some honey alongside. Scott was delightful with his deep voice, knowledge and charm. Barbara is the winemaker who also made her rounds. This is a hardworking woman, folks!! Miguel, Barbara's husband and co-owner, was a delight and told his stories charmingly and with ease. He beams with pride telling the work she has accomplished with the wine, and all of the work they and the other co-owners have put into the winery. We got to meet Mary Anne also, another owner of the property and apparently the reason their vision was able to come to life. I would HIGHLY suggest visiting this beautiful place and sampling their wines. You will walk away a member!!"

I had my service dog with me, however, there was only one table outside to sit at but there was another dog who tried to attack my dog nearby. So when we asked to sit inside, they refused to let us in with my service dog.  After a heated exchange, I was told \"F\" You\" belittled and verbally attacked by several customers and the owner.  I was very appalled and would never recommend this place that was so condescending and refused our service.  I have the right to take my service dog wherever I go.

This is the type of place that a group could enjoy, a wine beginner wouldn't find intimidating, and a wine snob could also find something to please their pallet. Good selection of all types, but not intimidating.  THE STAFF ARE ALL SO FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL! I was given a few suggestions from the owner, and they were all so spot on, I loved every one I tried.   Love the clean but welcoming decor, and how everything feels approachable and interactive (Glasses for sale, books, etc) and there's even some outdoor seating for those feeling a fire pit (if memory serves correctly, but the night I was here, the rain kept everyone inside).   Bring some girls, a group, or just stop by on your way home for a friendly wine bar with the coziness that makes you want to curl up and order an entire bottle and chat with folks."

It is obvious that this area needs something like this.  As a woman owned business, I am happy to see it thrive.  Deep into Steiner Ranch, I am not sure people who live outside of the area would be seeking it out but worth the trip if you are into wine and want to check out the space.  Could be a good place for a celebration.  Steiner probably has enough people to support.  Rose, white, red, bubbles and brews.  Cheese plates.  You can buy bottles to take with you with various mustards, jams, etc in their pantry. Glad I got to experience this location and wish them all the luck moving forward."

                "description": "Absolutely love Sloan + Parker. I'll admit that I'm pretty easy to please in the wine department, but I really do love all the wines I've tried! I appreciate that the wine list is ever changing and that the employees all do an amazing job with recommendations and descriptions. There is also a pretty large price range so you're able to choose a glass based on how much you'd like to spend, which is great for their range of customers. Now about the decor/atmosphere: I'd like to have my home designed to look similar to S+P. It's fun and new and modern but elegant and sophisticated at the same time. I wouldn't change a thing!   My favorite time to go is on a chilly evening. I love to be curled up by the fire on the patio with blankets (provided by S+P) and a big glass of cab with live music playing in the background. Come on! That's heaven!   Do yourself a favor and follow them on Facebook. They host great events, my favorite being Sip In SWEATS. You will not be disappointed!"

They also have some snacking plates (cheese, charcuterie) and some other treats. If you're feeling indecisive, you can taste a wine before buying a glass (I find their descriptions to be spot on and helpful), and there's usually a few wine flight options on rotation."

The sangria, Petit Verdot and Cabernet were good.  I didn't try too many it their sweet wines although there were quite a few. The ambiance is laid back and there is some artwork to take in as well as a small charcuterie plate and maybe something else, I'm not quite sure. Definitely swing by and check these guys out on your trek along 290. Plus it's close to 281 so it's an easy first. Happy tasting!!"

The lady, who we probably annoyed in the beginning, really helped us understand the process and gave us tips on wine tasting.  She was very accommodating and personable.  We tasted the entirety of the tasting menu.  We were also glad the place was not as busy.  There were 9 of us and enjoyed the place.  We were a little disappointed because we waited for the scheduled musician to come but cancelled last minute.  However, the rating is for the wine and the experience and the lady who gave us her time and patience. All deserve an A+."

The venue has great outdoor space. A lot of open area with seating. Also a great covered area for music acts and dancing. One thing I noticed right away while sitting outside was NO BUGS. The whole time we did not get bit by a single mosquito. The lawn is treated well. They also have a nice layout indoors. Great bar area for wine pouring and a large room that can be a private space.   Wine selections ranged from sweet to dry. I really enjoyed the Pink Sky Rose, it's sweet and easily my favorite. I mostly kept with that selection for the birthday party.   I will be coming back to experience as a customer and partake in the tasting and music acts. It's also important for me to celebrate and support Black woman owned businesses."

The owner is super sweet. She took the time to come to our table and greet us. Make sure to ask us how everything was going and how we liked things.  She took the time to recommend some wines and go over the different textures and flavors.  I'm not a wine person myself but my friend and her mom are. I definitely learned a lot from them.  We purchased a charcuterie board, it came with cheese , nuts and a super delicious olive jalapeños thing! MY GOD that was delicious.

On the other side, no one explained the different types of wines that we tasted like most wineries do: type of grapes, region, age of the wine, etc. The wine was served in shot glasses. I mean--this is a winery and wine should be served in wine glasses. Most of the wines I had were bitter. If the winery can make a few changes it would be a much better experience. Otherwise, I much more preferred the other wineries that provide the full wine  experience. Room for improvement here!!"

We did a 6 wine tasting and really enjoyed all the varieties of wine. The charcuterie board was perfect as well. The menu includes several options of charcuterie. We enjoyed our afternoon and returned for the live music in the evening. We appreciated the friendly atmosphere this winery offered. It is the perfect way to enjoy a beautiful autumn Saturday."

A friend wanted to go here to celebrate her birthday so two couples made the trek from San Antonio and we had a wonderful time. The staff was attentive, friendly and answered our questions  with a smile. We ordered the cheese and Italian meat  tray and the chicken skewers and everything was very tasty.   On the Sunday evening we were there, a gentleman was playing some very smooth jazz and adding to the relaxed atmosphere.  The owner came and offered us free samples of some Moscato that had just been finished. It was delicious.  Last but not least, since the owner is a veteran, she offers a military discount on the food."

                "description": "We were looking to try out a couple of new wineries over Labor Day Weekend. This popped up on a Google search. For the tasting, you can choose four wines for $15 or six wines for $20. They are doing all tastings outside so that social distancing can be maintained and they brought all six wines out as a flight. Service was attentive and friendly and all servers were wearing masks. The wines were on the sweet side for my taste (I prefer dry, bold reds). They had a small selection of small plates (charcuterie, dips with vegetables, and pizza). My only reason for giving four stars was the pizza was a cheap frozen pizza that they heated up. We enjoyed the experience and supporting a new winery that opened up during a pandemic."

Service was good. Set up makes it easy to socially distance from others. Easy to order snacks from menu.  The one thing that was the deal breaker for me is that their tasting menu offered 7 wines yet all were VERY dry. There was one sweet one listed but sold out. I scheduled a group tasting for 13. Most of the people in my group made it through 4-6 tastings w/o finishing and absolutely no one made a wine purchase and that says a lot."

                "description": "My granddaughters were in town from Houston.  We decided to do a local wine tour of three small wineries to help small businesses.  We were seated on the patio which was comfortable.  There isn't a vineyard onsite which detracted from the experience.  The Chardonnay was very good.  Smooth with just the right balance of dry to sweet.  We wanted to love this place as it is veteran owned and the owner was quite friendly.  The waitress was socially awkward at best.  She wasn't able to answer questions about the wine or small plates.  When we asked for more crackers for the artichoke dip and hummus we were told they're pre-packaged so we couldn't have more.  I was certainly willing to pay but that was not an option.  I hope this was a unique experience and they will be successful."

We were a bit skeptical because of its limited reviews on yelp but I'm so glad we went and tried it out. Their wine is great, their flights are customized to your individual pallet, and their charcuterie board is to die for. If you go during the summer be sure to try their peach/apricot wine. I thought it would be way too sweet for my liking but it was a great refreshing summer drink! They are located in a small development that also has a few shops, a bakery, and Nate's coffee and cocktails right next to it... and we can't forget, this place is only two blocks from Louies barbecue"

I can't speak to the wine, as I'm not really a wine drinker, but the others had multiple glasses and brought bottles home with them. Judith tried to find a wine for me and I ended up with a nice WHITE sangria. How great to find a white one as red unfortunately gives me headaches. We all sat around, drank, talked, ate and just had a great time. Those lemon almonds just melted in my mouth. Never had those before and want more. Judith had two nice nut, cheese and meat plates for us to nibble. So warm and welcoming like you were in the home of a friend. Look forward to stopping in once again."

                "description": "Blanco has many local, historic, and natural charms to this little town in the Hill Country.  Now, it has something people will talk about more when they go to Blanco...a charming winery! Opened since this past April, owner Judith Raven is no stranger to the Texas grape and wine world. For almost 20 years, she has been experimenting with grape growing in the Hill Country near Spring Branch.  The estate has about 6 acres of grape vines planted and is known for Sauvignon Blanc, Tempranillo, and Merlot. The logo on the bottles, a raven, is a nod to the owner's last name. When we visited, there were six wines featured on their tasting menu. The 2018 Sauvignon Blanc is sourced from Sierra Foothills AVA until the Texas Sauvignon Blanc grapes are ready. It is quite crisp with some distinct peach notes. The 2017 Hill Country Tannat is quite smooth with ripe strawberry and jam flavors. The 2017 Texas High Plains Tempranillo features more spice with a smooth finish. You'll be delighted and quite happy with the 2014 Petite Syrah/Sangiovese blend.  Sourced from Reddy Vineyards, it is still drinking quite well. It is bold with nice tannic structure and is well balanced.  The last Esperanza wine is a sweet Orange Muscat. Source from the Texas High Plains, it hits the spot when temperatures heat up during the last three months of the year!  There is also a wine from Fly Gap that you can try called Cowboy Way.  It is for those who enjoy something bold and strong in a red.  We enjoyed visiting with Judith's daughter and hearing how they came up with the name for the winery. The name Esperanza comes from Judith's childhood and relates to many good things that came with that name on her life's journey, starting with living on a street named such. Now, Blanco has more good things going for it with the addition of this winery in the area. Inside the tasting room one will find tables and assorted cozy areas to sit and sip and relax as they enjoy their visit. There are also tables and chairs outside to enjoy the lovely warm fall temperatures of late.  There is new artwork on the walls for sale by local artists making the space even more inviting and interesting. All in all, the space makes you feel right at home. Stop by and check it out for yourself. You just might find some new wines you enjoy and make sure to keep checking in from time to time, because there are more wines planned to be released.  Cheers!"

                "description": "My wife and I went to Bella Vista Ranch for a 4th of July tour with lunch, and we found it to be terrific value for the money. There was a nice lunch from a food truck (the name of which eludes me, unfortunately) followed by an interesting talk about the history of olive oil and the origins of the Italian family farm dating back to the second century BCE. The owner explained how he established Bella Vista on the ancient Roman model and described the modifications he has made to make olives grow in Texas. Then we toured the olive orchard and learned about the different varieties of grapes grown on the property. We saw the processing room containing the \"frantoio\" or olive press as well as the vats where this year's wines are aging. We then tasted several oils as well as four glasses of wine per person. All this for $25 (the regular tour without lunch is only $15).  Oils, vinegars, wines and soaps are available for sale. These are pretty expensive (e.g. $18+ for 250ml of their basic Texas Blend oil), but I don't mind paying those prices for high-quality locally produced specialty goods. This is a fascinating day out, which I recommend wholeheartedly.  Pro tip: If you're coming from San Antonio, take I-35 instead of US 281 and the back roads. We were expecting a relaxing drive in the country, but construction and traffic made it a stressful trip. Coming back on 35 was a joy by comparison!"

                "description": "So, so rude. The olive oil and vinegar are excellent, but the experience was ruined by the lady--the one everyone complains of here. The hours on Sunday are until 4. I get there at 3:25, and she walks past me with her whiny, demanding voice telling me that they close at 3:30. Uh, wanna put that on your website as your updated hours?  I went in anyway. The gentleman doing the oil tasting was knowledgeable and helpful. He told the lady to close the gate.  You know, what a non-stupid person would do should they slothfully decide to close early since they dont work for a living.  My mother was incredibly upset by this lady's rudeness. When you run a service like this, you stay open until you no longer have a good flow of customers. Closing is at 4? Hi, if a bunch of people are coming in at 3:30 thru 4:00, you keep working. Lazy Texas people who inherited their property and think they work hard by paying others to harvest their crop and bottle it. Meritocracy, right? They are the class of people who make this state an impoverished mess.    Don't run a customer service business dependent upon people stopping by on a lark like a fascist regime. You don't get to do that. Then again, when you dont have a legitimate concern about how you pay your bills, i guess you can just work until you get bored with the whole work thing.   Go sell wholesale if you hate customers. Working for yourself does not mean you get any more freedom. You have are dependent on good will. And you don't have mine.  The lady tried to make up for her garbage attitude when i made my purchase. You know what? Have a blessed day, lady. A.BLESSED.DAY.  Tl;dr. There are other puveyors of Texas olive oil, particularly in south Texas. Do not waste your wine tasting trip here. If you want to support local, consider others who are hard-working enough to sell their products in Central Market."

                "description": "We took the tour here three years ago and had a decent experience. Customer service was nothing special but not bad. The olive oil was excellent. Went back last weekend just to buy a few bottles and there was a group tasting inside. The lady who met us was terse and short with us, and the oil lacked the punch we're accustomed to from fresh oil. It was ironic to listen to the speaker discussing the peppery flavor of the oil when it was completely absent this year. Maybe it's an off year. But one thing was the same: it's not a welcoming place at all. They seem to be put out by visitors. They really don't seem to want kids there at all, even when they are standing still and quietly listening.   We've had far better experiences, and far better olive oil, in Dripping Springs at Texas Hill Country Olive Oil. Night and day difference."

The tour and history of olives was really interesting. Definitely try the balsamic and infused oils. The wine tasting was pretty brief compared to the olive portion but great none the less. The wines are dryer, not sweet. I thought they were great. A lot of the other local wineries wines are very sweet, but I really enjoyed these! You should absolutely plan to visit if in the area."

Before I could even ask a question about the wine or olives, an employee firmly told me as she was finishing up with another set of customers that \"I don't have time to answer your questions.\"  She then proceeded to hard sell our group to pay $10 for the \"last minute\" tour. And, to add insult to injury, as 2 of the 4 of us completed their purchases, both employees proceeded to exit the store and watch us walk to our vehicle and  drive off. I will never spend a dollar at your business.  Good luck to you."

He just didn't want to serve us so we left.   The second time we went there were 4 of us and it was in the middle of the day. While the wine is fine, the server was the single most rude person I've ever encountered at a winery. Just astounding how she could be that rude for the duration of the wine tasting. I will never go back and suggest no one ever go there. You cant drink the wine fast enough to over come they workers rudeness."

                "description": "We liked the olive oil a lot.  However... I think the \"thorn\" of this place is the owner.  He seems rather joyless in making something that could ideally fulfill the soul.  His 1 1/2 hour (yes, it's long) \"tour\" is mostly comprised of the history of the Olive, snarky political opinions, braggary of his past career in Silicone Valley, and a hatred for Texas AandM.   Not a place to take a kid. Seriously.  We sat and listened to him for well over an hour then briefly stood under two olive trees, looked at another one that was hurt in a storm, looked at the press machinery, and then did a \"tasting.\" Like I said, the oil was good. I got the impression that the lady helping in the gift shop/tasting room didn't want to be there either. Basically I was confused why this man (and his 5th wife...no lie) were running this business and opening it to the public.  I walked away a little sad that something so wonderful like successfully growing beautiful trees to make a solid product could be reduced to something so joyless."

                "description": "We were warned at great length that we could not even look at our cell phones during the tour which seemed odd when people might have a kid or babysitter or be waiting on something important from work to come through--I mean we are all adults...but I soon found out why.  Far less than an entertaining traditional tour, you sit and listen to someone talk more like a college class lecture, but with way too many rabbit trails of information that eventually make you tune out.  Like what a certain blizzard is called in different parts of the world, how accounting dates back to the Romans, etc.  I am passionate about olive oils and wine but learned too much about history and every other subject to even focus on what I wanted to know about olive oil. Or feel entertained.  The group I was with concurred.   There are 3 types of learners: auditory, visual, and tactile and the class is entirely sit and listen to one man talk for half of it then stand and listen by a tree then a press for the other half. So only appealing to auditory learners. And no audience engagement during the lecture.  At the end you actually get to see and touch. But they had no bread for us so we had to drink an olive oil and talk about it for 30 more minutes so I left before I tasted the other flavored oils as it had already been a full day of just listening to way too much info to retain.  In a very strict manner rather than entertaining with audience engagement.  And strict rules.  Obviously people tune out and begin looking at their cell phones so that's why they don't allow them.  Rather than making the tour entertaining so you dont' want to--It was in the hot sun as well so it was pretty miserable.  The olive oil was good but I've had better, it was a bit weak to me, we did the wine tasting as well and those were not acceptable to me.  I actually would recommend skipping the tour and talking to the staff as you taste the olive oil because they knew all of the information given on the tour without the lengthy side notes of things that should be shaved off for entertainment value.  And that's really the best part.    I don't think they like people very much though to be honest."

I have been back four times now and each time come away with a little more understanding of the narrative that is offered. While I purchased my typical bottles of olive oil - some for myself, some for holiday gifts - I did also indulge in some olive oil based soaps.   The olives and oil are fabulous. I am not as great a fan of their wines. They are not awful, just not with the properties I care for, typically. The in-laws found a favorite to take home, though.  The tour is still $10 and includes the wine tasting, which is a good deal.  Bottles of oil range from $16-$27 each, depending on size.  Soap is $6.99 a bar.  They also feature balsamic vinegars (not made there) and jars of olives, which are delightful as well."

                "description": "Do not judge a book by its cover. Take one look at Jack and the humble grounds here at Bella Vista, and you'd never guess that he has olive friends he emails with back in Italy or that he can tell you all you'd ever want to know about the science and technique behind growing and processing olives.  I would highly recommend the tour - while there isn't much walking involved in this tour, my husband and I found it to be highly informative. And with Jack's red-blooded Texan sense of humor, it was a very entertaining education. Be sure to note the times of the tour (Sat @ 10am and 1pm, and Sun @ noon) since it's a group setup.   After the tour comes a tasting of several types of olive oil produced on site along with some of their balsamic vinegar offerings. While they also have wine offered, I'd recommend sticking with the olive oil - clearly what they specialize in. If you're only interested in tasting the oils/wines (not the tour), it's probably good to avoid arriving at the tasting room about an hour after each tour start since the tasting room isn't overly large and tends to fill up easily with the folks coming off the tour."

                "description": "A hidden mecca of olives.  In central Texas.  The Bella Vista Ranch was designed as a traditional Italian family farm and features the first commercially grown olives in Texas.  And the olives I sampled are Texas size and Texas good.  Apparently the crowd favorite is the bleu cheese stuffed olive.  We sampled a garlic stuffed olive that was really good.  The ranch also offers delicious balsamic vinegars and olive oils which go for around $17 a bottle.  My lips slurped the Fig Vanilla Balsamic over and over again.  I am sure I was sample cheating but that stuff is incredible.     This is also a working winery that produces several red and white varieties plus a Natural Blackberry Wine!  Yum.  Wine tastings are $5/per person.  I think the owner has a great thing going for him and a beauty of a property. Tours of the orchard happen on the weekend and include a wine tasting for $10/per person."

                "description": "While I thought it was pretty interesting to learn about and taste boutique olive oil (as I'd never been to an olive ranch before) $15 per person does seem a little high when the actual tour is quite short and obviously the intention is that you're going to buy some stuff at the end, and all that stuff is small batch and quite pricey (understandably so.)  So it ends up  being more like $100 for two people when you include the olive oil you will want to buy plus the wine you might want to buy (some people seem to think it sucks, we liked some of it.)  But you will leave with a buzz on and some delicious olive oils!  The owners were away so their daughter gave the tour; I thought she was pretty funny and personable but there were some questions she couldn't answer but it was really no big deal (and she wasn't super long winded like the owner seems to be  but of course some people like that and some people don't.) It's also probably better when there are olives on the trees but it was still overall pretty interesting to see the different trees different olives grow up and hear some history and facts about olive oil production.  I liked hearing about the process and seeing the machinery. And of course I liked tasting the fresh olive oil, which was indeed super tasty and surprisingly spicy. Most of their oils are made from all different olives smushed together but they have one variety that's just made with one kind of olive which we got to try. They also had a blood orange infused oil that I'm now obsessed with; we bought some and later made some asparagus on the grill that had been rubbed with the oil, it was the most delicious asparagus ever! We also enjoyed the wine; we are not wine snobs in any way but we enjoyed what we had and bought a bottle just  because it's the polite thing to do. We sat out on the bench in front of the tasting room and enjoyed our wines and just had a lovely afternoon.   I will say that it gets a little hectic in the tasting room when people come in just for a tasting after a tour- I would say if you want just a tasting, don't come between 1:30-2:30 because it's going to get confusing!"

He worked in high-tech in Silicon Valley and moved out his last company to Austin in the early 90s, eventually leaving to grow olives and make wine.   it's not always the case that you visit a winery and the owners pour for you, so that was a treat. They are a very small production and a bit off the beaten path, so it was pretty quiet there too. A small group arrived just as we were leaving, but it was nothing like the bustling tasting rooms at nearby Driftwood Cellars.  The blackberry wine is actually good--you wouldn't necessarily guess that it's made of blackberry not grapes. And the other three reds we tasted were also nice."

Pretty much all venues were closed, which makes me believe it is a weekend spot. Unless you are there to eat, you will just be walking aimlessly around. Not a bad thing, but as I said, for some reason I was expecting more. They views, however, did not disappoint.   We didn't eat there and my review is solely on the grounds and whatever they offer outside the restaurant."

We were seated directly under the sun and I requested to be switched to shaded area its was 95 degrees out, I was asked to go downstairs and ask to switch table and was told I have to go back in line by Ashley. We waited for an hour to get our table.   The white people seated in the same spot and they just switched tables right away, with no trouble. We stayed where we are seated by the way. This place is a big joke. Food were also just ok and overpriced.   Thanks to Thomas our server, the only good thing that happened with our visit.   My mom were also visiting from Italy and found this place hilarious."

The tea is this, you wanna bring out of town guests here, have a group event etc, it's a restaurant that has a gift shop, so know what you're getting into here. It was fun and worth a visit.

We went with low expectations considering what we'd read about the food and cocktails, but we weren't disappointed. Is it great food? No, but there are decent options on the menu (beef fajitas and the chicken pecan salad were winners). The Beau's Plate salad and enchiladas weren't as good.

                "description": "ON LAKE TIME!   It was my last day in Austin and my brother wanted t show me something a little out of the ordinary. We had just been going shopping oh and drinking. I wanted to experience the nature side of Austin.   The Oasis on Lake Travis was the place for us to venture out too. My brother said he had not been to it before, but wanted to try it.   To my surprise it was something grand. Absolutely gorgeous views of the lake and the more upscale houses Austin has to offer.   My brother and my parents had had a bite to eat prior to coming here, but I had not. I went shopping a the Domain and they had gone eating. From what I have heard, The Oasis is good for drinking, but not so good for eating. Their food is honestly sub par at best.   We ordered some drinks and chips and guac for the table. But I wanted something a little more in my stomach. I got the grilled shrimp tacos. They were good. But I have definitely had better. The only thing was that they were super spicy. I was not expecting them to be that spicy. All of a sudden my tongue was sweating and I was uncomfortable with that.   This is a must stop for the views. The views are outstanding. But the food was not the best. The mojito I had was strong. It was like one sip and I was already feeling it."

It has always been amazing, and they have expanded it considerably since the fire. The outdoor decks are sprawling, so many places to take in that view. And y'all, it had the absolute most stunning view of Lake Travis.   I just lost my father and was in need of an escape and some fresh air. Today I brought my dad's convertible mustang out (I MAY have gone kinda fast) to have lunch on this perfect blue bird day. I definitely felt his presence out here with me.   My server was so friendly and had the best customer service. I really enjoyed her serving me. I ordered a swirl margarita and chips and queso which were delivered quickly. For lunch I had a mixed fajita with steak and shrimp, refried beans and the fixings. Food was delicious.   I love the art they have installed around the restaurant. Really gorgeous bronze sculptures and we'll appointed gardens.   Thank you for a perfect experience."

                "description": "Went for dinner here last night with a colleague! I was honestly kind of worried based off of the reviews that the food wasn't going to be good. The area has changed so much since I was here 20 years ago, it's almost like a little city around the restaurant of stores and even what looked like a little hotel and parking garage.    Anyways the view was of course amazing, known as the sunset capital of Texas, it def lives up to that, we even were able to see a plane land in the water to watch the sunset which was really cool!  As for the drink! I had the tropical depression which was sweet and fruity and perfect for the atmosphere! We both ordered the fajitas and I'm going to say they were some of the best fajitas I've had in years, quality meat like actually real skirt steak in nice sized strips with great quality thick chicken breast strips! Queso was great! Salsa was great! Chips were great! I really couldn't have asked for anything to be better.   Don't always go by the reviews is what my moral of the story was because you might be surprised!"

The restaurant is surrounded by shops like coffee, ice cream, clothes , candies, photo hub and a lot more. BUT the most magnetizing place here is the view of the lake and the sunset.   Food: The food was not that special but became one because of the view and people/person you are with. Honestly if only the food we rating here, I'll give 3 not bad but not good as well.   Also expect long wait/line for the restaurant. While waiting we roamed around so we didn't really got bored. There's lot of shops and artist that offer their services like, caricature drawing."

                "description": "The Oasis is great for outdoor dining and has an amazing view of Lake Travis, especially during a sunset.  A couple of weeks ago, I visited Austin for a quick weekend getaway.  A small group of us came out for lunch and we didn't have to wait long because it was an early lunch and the weather was a bit cold.    PROS:  Even though the water level was a bit low, the view of Lake Travis was AMAZING!  Make sure to sit outside to be able to enjoy the view.  During the summer, it's worth it to make reservations during the sunset to get the most out of your experience.  The wait staff are super friendly and are attentive to all your needs.  CONS:  I will echo some of the other reviews on here and say the food is mediocre Tex-Mex at best.  We ordered the shrimp tacos, fish tacos and beef fajitas.  The tacos are decently seasoned, but the rice and beans are a bit bland and the dish overall was a bit cold.  The fajitas did come out nice and hot and the meat was seasoned well.  I will definitely be ordering the fajitas for the next time.  The drinks and desserts we ordered:  an Irish coffee, the Fantasy Chocolate Cake (which is a flourless chocolate) and the flan.  The Chocolate cake was surprisingly delicious while the flan was a bit too thick for my liking, but the flavor is really good.  The area surrounding the restaurant also has eclectic artwork to look at as well as small retail shops to explore.  Due to Covid each store has limited hours so you may want to call ahead to see if they're open.  Overall, it's a great area to sight see in Austin.  Especially if it's your first time."

                "description": "The Oasis on Lake Travis is one of those tricky places where you have to average out the good with the bad to get a good idea of the place.  The good:  No question about it, the sunset is second to none, awesome views, awesome picturesque scene, and just about all of the outdoor seating has a great view of the scene. An additional positive, is the parking.  Easy to get to, plenty of free parking for the complex they are in, and even has valet parking if you prefer not to walk the 100 yards to the restaurant.  The not so good: I don't want to say the food was necessarily bad, it was just mediocre Mexican cuisine with a relatively small selection compared to your normal Mexican place.  To go along with the mediocre food is a price of about 1.5-2x what you would typically pay, but again you are here for the view not the food. The service also was not bad, but I think \"nonchalant\" would be the best way to describe it.  So the real question, would I recommend it? Yes I would but just go into it with the right mindset that you are going for the view, you are paying for the view and you will not be disappointed!  I would probably not go back if I am in Austin, but I am glad we went once."

Sat upstairs with a nice view of the lake, however b/c it was a square 4 top, only 2 people had the optimal view. I wish they had those half moon booths, so everyone could have a good view.   Ordered the salsa, queso, and fajitas (chicken and beef) for 2, which was plenty for 4. The food came out very quickly, but there were times we struggled to flag our server down for other requests. The salsa was very runny, and the chips were broken up. I wish there would have been more whole intact chips. The queso was tasty. The meat was a bit dry. Beans were good, but rice was a bit too \"cafeteria\" in terms of flavor and texture. The grilled veggies and guacamole that accompanied were good though.   Overall, you come here for the super touristy experience. I've heard the sunset views are unbeatable!"

My shrimp tacos were well flavored and a good (yet not overflowing) portion.

I recommend Kiss the Cook (souvenirs, kitchen gadgets, coffee, etc) and Wimberley Cafe (good burgers and pie). The courtyard is beautifully decorated and relaxing. Plenty of FREE breakfast and pre-packaged snacks available even during COVID (cereal, Nutri-grain and Nature Valley bars, Chewy bars, muffins, coffee, orange juice, apple juice, pudding packs, fruit cups, yogurt, chips, milk and water for $1).  Stayed in the Maeson room. You have to exit the home into the courtyard to access this room, but I liked the privacy. Very comfortable king size bed, fresh linens, very spacious room w/ mini fridge, microwave, and tv, not much counter space in the bathroom though. Hosts were incredibly nice and welcoming. I would return!"

                "description": "My sister got married last week in Wimberly, TX. Our family thought, \"this is so random\". Neither of the families lived there and most of us had never heard of Wimberly. Then my sister said she had booked us at The Square Inn and gave us room arrangements.   I had flown in leaving MD at 4 am then getting to Dallas and then drove an hour. It felt like it was 5 in the afternoon but in reality it was 11am.   We walk into the Square Inn and was greeted by the owners. It never even hit my mind from the crazy traveling, check in was at 3 PM. To be honest I didnt think about it till others said there hotels would not let them early check in.   When meeting the owners, it felt like family. It almost felt like we were all coming home. They were so great. They let us in early and was cool enough to say, \"we need to run out before the others come, you are in charge.\"   The whole place was beautiful and amazing. Every room was perfect for single friends, to my other sisters and my crazy, but loveable nephews. Mr. Loyd one of the owners was like a natural grandfather with letting the boys run around but also telling them to close the door to keep AC inside. Lol  My favorite spot was the court yard. It looks like something out of a movie. Plus when it rains you can sit and watch the rain hit the roof. It's so peaceful.   So on top of a friendly, welcoming, beautiful space to stay and socialize, they also cook breakfast. Let me tell you it was the best food I have ever had at a bed and breakfast place.   We could smell the bacon at 6 am. Yum yum   So hands down this is place to stay in Wimberly. Its walking distance of all the cool shops and places to eat in town."

                "description": "Cons: * There were mosquitoes CONSTANTLY flying around our room. We never left the door open, so I don't know how they kept coming in. (This was the biggest con) * When we placed the \"service our room\" card on our door, no one ever came to fix the bed or resupply fresh towels. We were gone for like the whole day, and no one came, so that wasn't nice * The water pressure in the shower was too hard * The bathroom floor would get soaking wet anytime we took a shower because the curtain wouldn't stay closed all the way to prevent the water from going outside the tub. * When they gave us the wifi password they spelled it with a capital T, but really it was all lowercase, so we had a hard time getting the WiFi to work until we called the front desk.   Pros: * it is within walking distance to all the little stores and Wimberley cafe. * the staff is friendly. * The price of the room is reasonable   They just need to fix all the cons listed, and I think they would have a fine place to stay. Very unique and quirky. Also, I do think it would be nice if they had cable television."

                "description": "Okay. We ended up in wimberley on the coldest days of the year for my wife's 50th birthday. We arrived on Thursday and joined by our two adult sons. We were lucky to have made reservations at the Square Inn.  This place is quaint and hip at the same time.  Our room/suite was large and clean and really comfy.  The staff and owners were great and accommodating. We had to leave early due to the weather so we really couldn't enjoy all of the amenities, but we r definitely going to return. The Square Inn is a great choice for being close to the Square. Lots of great places to walk to and enjoy. Can't wait to go back and we will absolutely b staying at the Square Inn. Thx for making our short stay so pleasurable."

                "description": "My man did very well finding this BandB for our short stay in Wimberley. I don't know which was better, the gracious hospitality of the owners' and their family or our very comfortable room. The breakfast, served from 0800-1000 is also awesome. We stayed in the \"Lauren\" room located by the back patio area. The entire establishment is quiet and clean and I loved having a mini fridge in the room. The Inn is centrally located and quaint shops and restaurants are right outside the door. We would definitely stay here again."

                "description": "Nice location just off the main square. Great location to explore the Wimberley area from.  Well kept, nicely appointed rooms. Owner is very attentive and courteous.  Excellent pricing, often lower than other BandB's in the area.  I stayed a night mid-week. If you want to stay over the weekend, make your reservations early. It often fills up on the weekend. My room was off the patio in the back, the patio was a nice place to relax."

                "description": "The Square Inn was perfect for my husband and I's Anniversary Getaway.  The staff was very helpful and welcoming.  Wonderful breakfast served every morning with plenty of shopping steps away. Our room was warm and quaint - bathrooms with recent update and decor.  We loved that the BandB had 24 hour come and go as you need as we were attending a wedding outside of town. Each room felt like it had it's own private oasis as it faced in to a beautiful courtyard area to sit and drink your morning coffee or a glass of wine. We can't wait to visit Wimberley again and stay at this adorable little BandB!"

                "description": "Fantastic! Feels just like Wimberley: quaint and welcoming! The room was spacious, very clean, and well cooled even during the hot summer sun. All the details were great: towels were fresh and soft, wifi was fast, bed was comfortable, shampoo was even great!   But the location was amazing! Right on the square, so my wife and I literally walked almost everywhere! If we needed to refresh our drink, we simply walked back to the room. No problem!   Now the food. Breakfast is served daily and is delicious! In addition, they have a great selection of coffees, teas, and cocoas! Snacks like chips, pound cake, muffins, granola bars, microwave popcorn, etc. were available all day.   Can't say enough good things about this gem! Wouldn't change a thing!"

                "description": "this is the worst service I've ever received at a bed and breakfast. They took 20 mins to show up at the front desk when we arrived. they are charging us for damages they refuse to show us documents of. i went back and forth emailing the so called staff there and she told me she didn't have time for my problems. when I asked for her bosses number she gave me her fiances number. which, big surprise was no help because he would only side with her. he said hes the gm and theirs no higher position then him which is a lit because every gm has a boss and while we were there a lady was talking to them about things they needed changed who i'm assuming is Marcilia B. the owner. also the couple who runs the place was arguing so loud while we were there we could hear it from our room, when i went to see what was going on i saw her yelling at him.There was NEVER anyone at the front desk the whole time we were there and they lied about their medicine variety they claim to have. I'm pregnant and can only have Tylenol which the claimed they had in their \"large variety\" which only consisted of off brand aspirin. when i emailed them asking for documents all they did was argue with me (a customer) instead of trying to resolve the problem. I don't recommend  to anyone to stay here or waste your money because you will only get horrible service. DO NOT GO HERE WASTE OF MONEY."

They were extremely accommodating even though we could only spend one night when they normally have a two night minimum. The room was very spacious,  decorated perfectly and very clean. The inn was fully booked but you wouldn't even know it because it was so nice and quiet. We felt as though we had the whole place to ourselves. The owners are so very nice and informative. The inn is walking distance to many shops and dining options. We weren't able to stay for breakfast but it smelled delicious. We will definitely be going back!!"

                "description": "Myself and my fiancee recently visited Square Inn, and were very pleased with our stay.  The Lauren Room was clean, with warm, rustic interiors and a fabulously comfortable king-size bed.  The patio located just a few steps from our door was spacious; nice place to hang out before venturing to either Marco's Italian or Cypress Creek for dinner (both restaurants, by the way..  wonderful).  Square Inn is walking distance from some truly amazing dining, along with quaint knick knack shops (soaps, candy, etc.)-- not to mention you're swimming the Blanco, or tasting at Wimberley Valley Winery, in just a few minutes' drive.  Can't beat that.  Which reminds me: amenities included a big-screen t.v. in the common area, a decent library of DVD'S, an Xbox 360 game console with games, and complimentary wine in the afternoon and evenings.  Really, really nice being able to wind down for the night with a movie, and a glass or two from Duchman Winery.   Marci, our innkeeper at Square Inn, was very friendly, and courteous, even during a fluke front-door locking mechanism malfunction which resulted in our having to wake her up."
