Our tour guide was incredibly knowledgeable and was able to answer all our questions. I felt like I got a lot out of the tour and now have a basic grasp of how whiskey is made.   The distillery is pretty small and they currently sell bourbon and gin as their bread and butter, both of which you'll get to sample at the end of the tour. Highly recommended to check it out as it's just a fun atmosphere."

When we arrived, the place didn't have electricity or AC due to an electrical issue in the area.   Rather than cancel, they treated us to some complementary drinks to make up for the electrical and AC issue.   The staff was very friendly, professional, and turned a bad situation into a very fun and amazing time. Couldn't have imagined it being any better!   The guide was very knowledgeable, the tour was insightful, and the tasting at the end was great! Go support this local Austin business!"

I'm a tequila girl so I wasn't too eager to learn how gin and bourbon are made, but she really had my attention the entire time!   We were in a group of 10 which was just right. Everyone could get a few questions in if they wanted...laid back...chill...ITS AUSTIN!  Now, to the best part....and boy I was a bit disappointed. I've been on several tours in distilleries and the tasting at the end could get you about 2 shots away from tipsy. Typically there are about 4 samples....1.5-2 ounces each.....  Here....there were 2 samples with 1.5 ounces TOTAL!  I know all they do is gin and bourbon but can a SISTA have a bit more?! The tour is around $15pp, but I'd be happy to pay the standard $30-$40 for a tad bit more licka.    The gin and bourbon are still yummy!  Get a cocktail.....The old fashioned will have you stumbling!"

Got an old fashioned for 6 bucks so that was a solid deal. Didn't get any good but it looked like a bunch of fried options which my friends seemed to enjoy. It was about 60% full on a Sunday afternoon. I will say that the music was way too loud during the bingo so that made it hard to talk. Outside of bingo, the volume was fine. Overall I'd recommend it. If not, St Elmo brewing is next door."

They don't have tasting flights, but they do have an option to order a taste of any of their liquors for $2 each. That's not bad at all. We were able to taste the whiskey and gin. The two year whiskey was the winner. I did see some yummy cocktails that I would love to try in the near future.   They have inside and outside seating. The outside patio has a cover for shade, but you do have areas where you can get sun   There's a food truck on site.   Parking is available on site, but shared with the other businesses. For those that want to make an afternoon or day out of your visit, the other businesses are all drink or food related."

Jason did an excellent job of showing us around the distillery, while providing great details of the distilling process. While Still Austin knows it isn't a mega distillery, it embraces that and makes the tour and experience feel personalized. We were able to sample several different whiskeys and one gin, and we even sampled a few unreleased items, which were all very good. My wife and I would recommend this tour to everyone. Thanks Still Austin for a great experience!"

However our experience today was really disappointing and it was simply based of the service provided. I wish I got the gentleman's name because he was awesome and his drinks were well balanced. There was a female bartender who made the drinks extremely sweet and when we asked to have them remade, she was extremely rude and confrontational in her demeanor. The other male bartender took it upon himself to remake our drinks and when he tasted what she had served us, he also agreed with the taste being off. Kindness goes a long way and I wish she adopted a more graceful attitude."

We drove up to a small manufactured building and the end of a street  with some questionable establishments nearby.  Just inside of the building is a simple bar and small seating area. The employees are friendly and offer us tastings. We try each of their three offerings: silver rum, Pecan Street Rum, and their whiskey. I can't say I have discerning taste when it comes to rum or whiskey but I enjoyed them.  We ordered three cocktails from their menu (drinks are $6 each or 3 for $15) and took them to their back seating area. It was very no frills and reminiscent of a garage or basement man cave, with old leather sofas and a dart board. The drinks were all really tasty and could definitely be dangerous. We saw that they included generous pours for the liquor yet we could barely taste the alcohol.  We only remained at the distillery for about a half hour because there wasn't much else to do there. No food and no outdoor seating.  Not a bad place to go if you want to grab a couple of drinks and patronize a local distillery but if they'd like to keep customers there longer, the owners will have to invest in helping create more of an experience."

It's a much better mixer whiskey than it is neat in my opinion. However, I did get about a 3oz pour so... Booya! (The picture is after I drank about 3/4's of it, lol)  Also tried their \"famous\" Pecan street rum, not a big fan of rum but this was actually decent. Given the choice I wouldn't buy it for myself but I would drink it if offered.  The distillery itself was tiny with not many places to sit. Even their tasting room was mostly a few couches with only a few tables. With that said, it was quite cute and had quazi sports bar vibe.   The staff was friendly and very happy to let us sample and make suggestions based on our tastes.   Overall, I'd come back."

                "description": "Honestly, I'm disappointed in this place. My hubs and I went for the first time here to see a comedy tour which the distillery hosted. The place itself is very small and decent enough- definitely no frills of any kind. They were hosting the comedy tour which was being held outside in their backyard space but they didn't have any of the tables and chairs set up for the patrons. Ppl were grabbing the picnic tables and moving them over to the stage...like shouldn't mngmt have done that ahead of time?? As far as their whiskey and rum, we did not care for it at all. After the reviews, I guess I just expected more. We kept trying it in different types of drinks and it just tasted like cheap stuff. Not to mention their prices! We had exactly 6 mixed drinks. Our tab was $70 before tip. That's $11.50 a drink! Y'all, this place is backwoods Pfluggerville not the dang Domain! I pay $11-$13 for my drinks at the Domain. So, $11.50 for this place was ridiculous. We will definitely not be back. And if you see an advertisement for the comedy tour- skip it. The first comedian was not very good (he had a whole table walk out and leave during his performance. Ouch.), the 2nd was decent but not in any way worth a $70 bar tab."

When we were walking up the steps we noticed that there was an open sign lite up and when we walked in the bar tender said they have to close for an hour because he is the only one there and needs to help the band setup..... sounds like poor planning on the managements side. He said someone keeps changing their hours on Yelp but not sure about that hmm. Anyways he invited us back to see the show at 7 as they open back up for that, but was looking to have a drink and not be drowned out by a loud band. Maybe we will try your place again some time ....."

                "description": "My rating only speaks to the liquor itself. My in-laws went in and were raving of their distillery experience when they walked into my house. My wife's uncle dropped a bottle of single-malt whiskey on my counter and I decided to pour a neat glass after I poured 3 others for my guests. I really let this whiskey sit on the back of my tongue and savored the flavor. This is hands down the best whiskey I have ever had. I am more of a blended whiskey guy but the sweetness of this whiskey is absolutely perfect. I have my mixing whiskey, but this is definitely my sipping whiskey. There is definitely a strong vanilla taste going on with chocolate, but finishes hard with a good wood. Since having it, I am trying to find a way to get in there and pay my respects, but his review will have to do for now."

Even if you're not buying a mixed drink or anything that requires work other than handing you a bottle and paying for it you have to stand in the line that's serving cocktails and drinks.   Further, when you do get service, it's been rather dismissive the last few times we went. Expect to spend time there- no way to quickly pop in, grab merch and a bottle and leave."

Treaty Oak is the kind of place that you want to spend the entire day at, and you totally can! What I love about it too is that it's a massive space with so much to do while on the grounds. It even has a playground where the kids can play, and an indoor space with plenty of TVs to watch football on game day.  We started off with a tasting, which you can either do Gin or Whiskey. I actually highly recommend the tasting, it's only $10 a person but gives some great background on how each different flavor/bottle is created and made. You also can put the $10 towards a bottle if you end up wanting to buy one to take home.  We then went into the bar area and got drinks, which is a huge variety of cocktails! They have plenty of picnic tables, and multiple boards for cornhole on the grounds. The restaurant on site it BBQ and was amazing! We got the brisket sandwich and pork sandwich and loved them both. What I also loved about it, was that there's multiple places where you can get drinks, foods, etc. on the grounds but your tab stays open for everything. Love this place and highly recommend making a day trip out of it if you haven't been!"

It has great covered patios and outdoor space throughout the property with a delicious restaurant- Alice's Restaurant, a tasting room, and a covered bar/lounge as well as an outdoor stage and small playground. We did the tour and tasting which allowed us to see the inner workings of the distillery. Cody was an excellent tour guide answering all our random questions as he showed us around the distillery.

We went last weekend on Sunday and there was a sign to scan the QR code the for menu, we waited in a long line to order food, once everyone got to the cashier she told us that only the brunch menu was being served (it was like 2pm or something).   So everyone had to quickly change their order!   Talk about poor communication!! It should say on the menu very clearly what's being served.   Then, I tried to order vegetarian nachos but my cashier told me they were sold out of beans and that I should just get chips and queso instead, so I did. THEN my brother in law who ordered after me got his nachos which were vegetarian bean nachos (not meat like he ordered). I said \"they told me they were sold out!\" Again, bad communication.  Then, my brother in law ordered sangria and got a big pitcher, my dad went to order the same thing and they gave him HALF the size. So weird and confusing.   This place seems very confused internally and each worker seems to have their own message.  Also nothing for gluten-free vegans on the menu."

So much space for you, your kids, and your dog! Bring the family! LoL  It was actually recommended to me at my last stop, and I love me some bourbon and whiskey so it was a no brainer. However, if bourbon isn't your thing they also have options for the gin, vodka and non alcoholic lovers in your group! Something for everyone I'd say!   That being said, I took off a star mostly because the line was stupid long. They definitely could have, and should have had more than just one single file line for us to get a drink, I spent half my time in line.   That being said though, once I got my drink and was able to enjoy the drink and the vibe it was great! They have live music and a restaurant if you get hungry and I ended up getting the day tripper drink! I loved it, it was so good. I will definitely be back!"

The food at the restaurant was pretty decent, if a little expensive. The staff inside the restaurant are very friendly, but it all seems very inefficient.  The reason for the 3 star review is really that both of the drinks we ordered were cocktails that are premade and then dispensed. They were....ok? A little too sweet and a lot too weak. I couldn't taste the whiskey/bourbon in either of them. For $9/drink at a distillery, I just expected better drinks made to order and I left feeling disappointed. If we had known the drinks we ordered were batch cocktails, we would have tried to order something else, but there was nothing on the menu to denote that."

I'd been invited out there for a friends birthday and the idea of heading all the way to Dripping Springs on a hot Saturday afternoon to try bourbon (which in general all tastes like burning to me) wasn't really my idea of a great time. Man, I was wrong. First off, they have a wide selection of spirits, everything from gin and vodka to wine and beer. The setting is bucolic with wide open spaces and clusters of shade trees. A friendly staff, great bbq (try the brisket nachos) and some tasty signature cocktails (try the Pineapple Express) made for a great afternoon that turned into a lovely evening.

Just about 30-40 minutes outside of Austin lies this beautiful distillery. There's so much space and more than enough seating but even on the weekends this place can get pretty busy. As for food you can expect Texas bbq from this place as I tried both the brisket and Turkey which were both very good. If your not a booze person they also have their own in house wines and beer but if you do like a good cocktail I'd recommend hill country dreaming. Im anticipating come back here to check this place out in the evening for some live music or Sunday brunch!"

Zach was our main server but they all work as a team so you were never once waiting around. The drinks were great, the bakery items were great and I think I've already said enough about the food. This is first on my list next time I'm in town!"

Parking was ample and so were the picnic tables! We didn't do a tour but put our name in for lunch at the restaurant, Alice's. It was about a thirty minute wait on a Saturday around 1, which really went unnoticed because we just grabbed drinks at the Cocktail Bar and sat in the open seating area until they called us saying it was ready. There was live music, lots of space and tables , cornhole, and you could go do a distillery tour too.   The bartenders were helpful in finding a gluten free drink option for me, as well as our waitress at Alice's. Our waitress was especially friendly and attentive--didn't get her name but a recent HS grad going to UT! She made sure to ask about gluten and dairy free options for me, and there were plentiful. Everyone devoured their food and were happily satisfied. I had a delicious club sandwich on gluten free bread with some salt and pepper chips. SO good. I also loved the white sangria.   All in all, I am so glad we found it and the bride said it was the perfect way to spend our day. We definitely will be back!"

There were unsupervised children running barefoot on tables, a bartender who gave me the worst drink in the books after I didn't ask for it, and a sorry excuse for aesthetic with old trucks and a fire pit. Also don't try the food, it's not good. Brisket tastes like it was smoked for 1 hour and nacho cheese was out of a can."

What's the big deal you ask? Let me offer a few reasons to stop in:  - whiskey tasting flights of 4 for only $11   - also offering other gin or vodka mixed drinks  - great tasting room with some cool, historical architectural elements   - wonderful deck under the shady oaks to enjoy the quiet Hill Country ambiance  - for beer or wine lovers, they also offer those (and snacks) in an adjacent  building  So this is simply a great stop off the beaten path if you are headed out to the Hill Country or just want something different that is just down 1826."

The scenic views are amazing. I recommend walking around and checking out the grounds.  Friendly service, great drinks and chill environment. I'll definitely be back."

Nor did the Black Walnut Cocktail mixed by the affable and amiable Richard.  I figured to spend about an hour or so but instead closed the joint down! The bourbon is delicious and as a Magnificent Bastard it was a real trip to find my name on the Wall of Magnificence.  The grounds are lovely and well worth wandering. If you get the chance to stop in and sample the whiskey you will NOT be disappointed! If you are a Magnificent Bastard, it is so much fun to see where our favorite videos are shot.  Alas, I couldn't finagle my way into the Vault! ;)"

The large glass doors open up to a spacious outdoor seating area. The drink menu is fairly priced with cocktails that allow you to taste their very own whiskey, gin, and rum. If you prefer straight whiskey, they have flights/tasting samplers you can ask about.  I loved the food truck parked in their lawn (Char ATX) with delicious yakitori (Japanese meat on skewers).  They have tours of their facilities which sound really interesting. I think those tours are about $15/person (please verify with Fierce Whiskers for most up-to-date pricing).  Good-sized parking lot  This place is a hidden gem. Drive past Meanwhile and head straight to Fierce Whiskers. ;-)"

We originally had the bus for 5 hours but Daniel was nice enough to let us add an additional hour to our trip for just a small charge. I would recommend ThunderDome Party Bus to anyone.   We definitely want to plan another trip in the summertime to go floating.  Thanks Daniel!!!"

The stereo system was bumping, and Daniel, our amazing driver, had no issue with us turning it up to 11.  Our group was most guys in their 30's and Daniel gave us good recommendations on spots to check out that were age appropriate.  In between spots, Daniel drove me to a gas station to help me restock on beer. He even came in and helped me carry and load beers into the coolers.  Great communicate from Daniel from beginning to end, and he someone found the perfect spot to pick us up on busy Rainey St at the end of the night.   Great value and great experience.  Highly recommend."

We sat outside in the lovely fall weather, enjoyed some acoustic tunes by a talented duo with a female vocalist, and tried several cocktails -- all of which we enjoyed. My friend tried the frozen Bartender's Choice which was like a frozen apple cinnamon cocktail, and I tried the Comanchero, the Yipping Coyote, and the Rugged Flower. Each were so smooth and well-balanced. This place not only makes a flavorful Sotol with a smooth, clean finish but transforms it into mouth-watering mixology masterpieces!   Aside from the bus loads of out-of-town tourists who looked like they were part of an Instagram filter for an \"Ashley/Ashleigh\" compilation (complete with brimmed hat, scarf, and boots), this place is a must-visit if you're in Austin. Couple it with a trip to nearby Fredericksburg and you've got yourself an amazing day!"

Very Instagramable location with the truck outside and the silo.   PARKING I went when it was pretty busy. I found parking but I did have to wait for like 5 minutes so cars could clear the road. It gets pretty tight once the parking spots are all full. It's all free. A lot of cars parked on the road. Just be careful crossing the road.   FOOD When I was here they only had one food truck. The options were limited. The prices were a bit too high for the food options available. I didn't try it out. My friends ordered a few things and they felt the food was just ok. I'm not sure on the current food status here.   AMBIANCE  They only had outdoor seating when I was here because of COVID. I sat on the covered outdoor seating which was great since it was around summertime. It was HOT! Really cute tables, friendly/helpful staff, and live music! I don't remember his name but there was a gentleman playing guitar and singing. He was fantastic!   DRINKS I ordered 3 drinks. The first two were the Comanchero and the third was The Copperhead. I'm glad I stopped there. They are strong!   I'm giving it four stars because I felt like the size of the drinks didn't coincide with their prices. I hope I get to stop by here again. It's a bit of a drive for me. It's a really beautiful drive though. Keep kicking butt y'all! I want to try everything!!"

I wish I could steal the décor and put it into my own home. Both the inside and out were so inviting, I don't know how someone could go and not spend hours enjoying the ambiance, food, and drinks. What I thought was so cool about Desert Door was that they educated you on what you were drinking and the history of Sotol. What I did not know, is that they are actually the only Sotol distillery in the US.  We started off with the Sotol flight, and two drinks. Although we did enjoy tasting the Sotol by itself, it was a lot to start the afternoon off with! We also ordered the The Copperhead (my personal favorite of the day), the River Rita, and the Sotol'd Fashioned. I loved each drink but the copperhead was definitely the star of the day, which was a Sotol version of an espresso martini. They also have a food truck on site serving out very unique food. We ordered the tacos and vegan \"queso\" and both really surprised us by how unique and amazing it was. We loved this trip out to Desert Door, and will definitely be back."

But every rule has its exception, or exceptional. Desert Door is a destination in itself. Beautiful southwestern interiors and stylish furniture. The space is cozy but didn't feel crowded, though every table was full. They do have a large patio for outdoor seating and bigger groups.   Now, the sotol. I had never heard of it and didn't know what to expect. The best way I can describe it is an agave spirit, clear, between a vodka and a tequila in its thickness/smoothness. In plain English, it's delicious.   We did the tasting flight, which was a great way to get introduced to a new spirit, followed by a round of cocktails. The cocktails were excellent and reasonably priced.   They also had a lovely food truck on site but we didn't have enough time to try it."

Had a difficult time deciding which one to get but our attentive and extremely friendly waitress, Nicole strayed me the right way with the Comanchero.

And they sure know how to do a cocktail, too! I got the River Rita and it legit blew my mind.   Sit and stay awhile, listen to the live music on the patio and if you need to cool down, the interior is a WHOLE mood.   Be sure to visit their gift shop to buy an adorable handmade clay shotglass (SO CUTE) and a bottle of their famous Sotol.   The staff was also astoundingly friendly and the kind of people you want to hang out with."

                "description": "Finally I was able to make it out to the distillery with my good friend early on a Saturday so that we could get some direct tasting vodka notes from Deep Eddy themselves rather than me taking shots at bars around Austin.  Parking was easy for us but do note that we showed up around 11:20AM on a Saturday so we didn't have any issues.  The later you arrive parking could be a thing and you may have to wait/stalk someone who is leaving to get a spot. Also as the day got later there were many buses and charter vans parked in the front and roundabout chilling out as the company they are driving around are inside getting down too.  Cocktails in a paper cup runs $8 with plenty to choose from the menu that is thoughtfully laid out in sweet, sours, spicy, etc. A nice mason jar with the Deep Eddy logo is $12 and slightly larger.  Do know that they will not refill your mason jar after you buy your first one so be prepared to be clanking around the distillery with your extra mason jars if you keep going the $12 route. Also be careful with your glass too - I saw many people let that mason jar slip out of their hands and the mason jar just crash on the concrete floor. So sad! Also frozen drinks / cocktails can only be purchased downstairs so be ready to wait in a little line if it is busy.   Loved the areas to sit inside the tasting room and even in the 2nd large downstairs area.  The pillows, decor, and the small touches around the sitting areas on the first floor are super cute and selfie-worthy.  I can imagine in the winter, with the large fireplace going, this space is cozy AF!  We didn't go outside at all as it was super hot in July but it looked like there are plenty of tables, shade, and seating for some large groups both in the front, side, and back areas.  After 2 cocktails in a mason jar we were feeling a good buzz and knowing we still had to trek back home (south Austin) we cut it off there. By the time we left around 2pm the place was buzzing with people, all 3 bars had 10+ waiting to be served, and I wasn't planning on waiting to close my tab in a long line.  I was super surprised to find out you can close your tab at the merch area with the cashier there so don't fret and add in that mug, stickers, shirts, bar additions, and Deep Eddy cool pool lady in red signage to your basket to check out while you close out your tab. You will save yourself some time and be out of there in a jiffy!  We plan to come back especially now knowing they are opened on Thursdays at 11am!!!!"

My favorite is probably the peach vodka and they have many cocktails to choose from. We went on a Sunday where there were local vendors there too as well as live music. Head to Dripping Springs for the great tasting room. Unfortunately, the distillery near Buda is not one that is open to the public, so the tasting room is where to go."

                "description": "Like I was saying earlier, I find tasting rooms gimmicky and this one is a perfect example of it.   We chose to come here because I have deep respect for Deep Eddy as a company for their commitment and contributions to the local community. They've gone above and beyond again and again. Respect!  The tasting room is a large hall, with flights consisting of tiny cups of flavored vodka. You don't taste the actual spirit because the fruity flavors are so sweet.   The \"Colombian\" food options on-site is a joke. It's an old school concession stand (movie theater of the 80s style) with heat lamps keeping nacho chips warm on a folding table. Don't expect tacos or empanadas.  The space, both indoors and outdoor, is quite large. And they have a cute performance stage inside.  We stayed a total of 15 minutes."

Bartenders are very friendly and fast but the drinks are simply made and during Covid they are all touching the mint in their hands by smacking it. Id rather a gentle crush/roll in a glass... felt a bit gross (others commented too).  Wish there was live music Saturday afternoon at 4  Games outside like giant connect 4 etc  Parking- gets full on weekends so a bit tight  The decor was cute  Sheriff at the door to handle anyone getting a little too cray"

The set-up is gorgeous and feels so clean when you walk in. You get a behind the scenes taste of where the best Texas vodka comes from. The staff was kind and knowledgeable. They answered any questions we had about the drinks. I ordered a $10 flight and my Husband got the Orange dreamcicle drink. You have the option to get your drink in a mason jar as a keep sake.  There is a great gift shop on site, so we got matching shirts because we are cheesy like that.  There was a delicious food truck out front that had Vegan and Meat Eater options available. I like that they cater to both.   There is so much to do in the surrounding area. We went thrifting and enjoyed the nature that Hill Country has to offer."

We are already big fans of Deep Eddy's vodka and all of their flavors, so we had no doubt we would enjoy our time there. The cocktails they serve at their bar are innovative and refreshing.

Other than drinking, there's not much else to do here, but it's definitely a lively place to enjoy a drink with friends!

The weather was perfect and they have a nice little patio area. The spot is family friendly meaning you can bring your kids, but there isn't a lot for them to do except run around in the patio area. I would have liked if the patio area was fenced off and not open to the parking so I could relax a bit more. I had to keep a close eye to make sure my kid didn't wander off. I enjoyed both of the drinks I tasted and would definitely stop in here to explore more of the tastings, but will likely leave the kid at home next time."

FINALLY this past weekend we got there when they were open! Oh we were so excited and the place lived up to the hype. The seating atmosphere both inside and out is very roomy and comfortable. All the staff is friendly and easy-going. Everywhere including the bathrooms were incredibly clean. The cocktails... the cocktails are downright amazing. They're inventive, delicious, and fresh. You're going to have a hard decision to make no matter what kind of drinks you like... I actually ended up ordering two at once because I couldn't decide! On the way out, we stopped at their little gift shop and man do they pack that area with goodies! Talk about variety and options. The shirts are awesome and made very well to boot, and they have tons of other merch. I left with a soft tanktop, a wicked fun tin can that I plan on using for a cactus or succulent vase, a magnet, and a collapsible dog bowl! We'll be back every chance we get. Loved it, loved everything, love the vodka."

The whole group willingly gave our ID's for inspection and the birthday girl's ID was \"questionable\", so she was taken to a cop car by a Sheriff, put in the back and questioned.  While Maddy was at the cop car getting her ID verified, the rest of the group had our full drinks/cups (that we paid for and were able to take home), snatched out of our hands. We all requested a refund for the drinks and were denied??  After the Sherriff verified that Maddy's ID was real, the manager proceeded to threaten tresspassing charges against us??   I have never experienced anything like this and would love to be contacted/reimbursed for the mistake that was clearly made."

I will preface that this whole COVID thing has still, for some reason, has some still on edge.  However, this place has taken it to new heights.  While the great state of Texas has opened to 100%, this place seems to have missed that memo.  We literally got yelled it for actually standing up at our tables and told that if we do stand to have a mask on.  Additionally, we got yelled at for moving a table.  The guys exact words were \"I'm picky where our furniture is placed.\"  Additionally, if you want to get a beverage, you actually have to MAKE A RESERVATION just to go in get one.  That is ridiculous!  By the way, the Hays County police are on site to enforce all of this over-the-top nonsense.  Most of us stayed for a single drink and then left for better and more fun pastures.  It's obvious that this place has forgotten all about who the consumer is and how we should be treated.  Not only will we never go back, but I am never going to purchase any of their products again.  By the way...the Jeep community here in Texas is very tight-knit and we will talk..."

The atmosphere is lively with board games and great decor inside, and a food truck and lots of picnic tables outside for large groups.   However, my group ordered 2 different red wines and 1 sparkling white wine and felt that the wines were lacking in flavor and very watery. Maybe this is how Austin wine is, but if you're looking for deeper, richer flavored wine, I would go somewhere else."

The menu selection for cheese variations are subpar. We did try some octopus and squid, which was an interesting discussion over some glasses of wine. You can only imagine how these convos went lol! All in all, I highly recommend stopping in for an interesting glass or two. Cheers to more wine!"

I was not going to get any snacks, but their cheese and charcuterie board was calling my name.  We both got the tasting. Each of us got different wines. Our favs were the Tempranillo, Grenache and spaghetti western. You can get all your wines at once or one at a time. I suggest getting them all at once because staff can get busy.  The cheese and charcuterie board paired well with our wines and it was definitely the perfect snack. Loved the cheese selection. The bread sprinkled with olive oil made my day cause who doesn't love bread They have inside and outside seating available. Parking is onsite, but shared with other businesses."

The first time we came here, they had a private event going on so that was sad. The second time, we got here a few hours early so they hadn't opened - that's our fault. Finally, our third attempt was fruitful!  The service here is super chill and on top of things. We 2 flights so we got to taste a good variety of samples. Great pours. We ended up leaving w one of their best bottles and now we're saving it for a special occasion.   We got (ranked from 'pour me another' to meh): *Violet Crown *Tempranillo Nuevo *Vermentino *Red-Nat *Picpoul *Piquette - this seems to be a star here but we personally hated it - tasted a bit like dilute pickle juice  A bottle we had before coming to this place was their Hill Country Rosso and that's still my favorite.  As far as COVID safety goes, the tables are super spread out, the staff wears masks at all times, and everything seems clean.   This place is super cool and what seems to be a hidden gem."

The Yard is the location and they have several business including this winery, a distillery, a brewery, and a few other places. The wine was good and the cheese and charcuterie board was a good size. I'd like to give 5 stars, but we had to ask for napkins, no plates given either. It was also a bit messy inside. Not sure if they were re-organizing or what. But friendly staff, good wine, and cute space! I recommend a stop in!"

During the 'rona, it is recommended to ensure you can get a spot.   My hubby and I did a wine flight a piece. We tried all the reds, the rose, and white wine (Vermentino). We ended up buying a bottle of Malbec to take home which we both had enjoyed. Note, the staff was very knowledgeable and helpful.   I really like the atmosphere of the winery as it is inside a warehouse where they make their own wine and buy their grapes. The winery has a few things to eat or you can buy pizza from Lil Nonna's. The pizza takes awhile but you can always purchase online and set a date. If you are done at the winery you can also bar hope in the area for beer, cocktails, and whiskey."

                "description": "Star service and a non-judgmental space. I dig you, Austin Winery!  We decided on Austin Winery after we had plans to go to Spokesman next door for some beers. Unfortunately, Spokesman had an event going on that looked a little noisy and full for our study date, hence the change in venues. The winery was very spacious and lofty--I love that in an industrial winery! We asked if we could move a table (to plug in to their only one outlet--score!) and do some computer work with their wifi. The gal at the tasting room was fantastically wonderful. She gave us a large smile and told us to do whatever we wanted. Wonderful service alone will get me to come back. That's for sure.  We each got a flight of wine to try, and got down to it until they closed. They have a good selection of whites, rose's and reds, so fret not friends. All is provided. They also have some light bites like cheeses and charcuteries, so you can definitely go with that if you're hungry. The tastings were a little pricey compared to what you might get at a wine tasting out in the vineyards (I used to work in the industry), but you're paying for the convenience of being in South Austin and lots of space to hold conversations, play board games and just be with your groups. They have loads of seating and an upstairs area (that a Bachelorette party was using). Restrooms are clean and wifi is strong. We also walked home with some Brose (a hilarious take on rose especially because it was a women-lead winery effort). Clean, classy and airy space."

There is now a wide selection of meads to taste, and you have to pay for a tasting.  There are different tasting flights you can select from on the menu, or you can try it all for $15.  The place is no longer quiet and sleepy, it is busy and buzzing.  They need to re-organize themselves to be able to better handle the traffic.  They need a separate line for those just coming in to fill growlers, and those enjoying a tasting experience and interested in learning about the different meads and the process.  The two staff members were friendly, but were rushed to serve others.    The mead is still as delicious as always, and they are planning to even start canning some of it! They are also re-branding and their growlers now have their new modern logo.  I just hope they keep the awesome art on their bottles.  I love the genius artistic bottle labels.  For the first time they also had a meat and cheese plate that you could order. Something new they were trying out.  It was tasty!  They should definitely keep it.   They also now have a loyalty program that earns you discounts. Also, be sure to check out the board as they have reoccurring monthly events like Friday board game night!!"

I called and asked if they were dog-friendly, they said yes. When we got there, I walked in and asked if they were dog-friendly, they said yes. My husband and our 2 pups walked in, grabbed a flight, and played a game. After an hour, I ordered another drink while he took the pups out for a bathroom break. He texts me \"They won't let me back in.\"  Apparently they weren't actually dog-friendly, and the bartender lied, or at best had mis-information. They offered us their outdoor picnic table, but there was broken glass everywhere. They comped the drink I had just ordered, but really should have comped everything. We wouldn't have gone if we would have known that we weren't welcome.   That said, this isn't a terrible place to spend a rainy afternoon if you're from Austin. They have games and flights. Their draft meads all kind of taste the same, but the recent elderflower LTO was pretty good. We're from Dallas, and I won't waste an afternoon here again."

                "description": "Meridian Hive Meadery is pretty cool! I hadn't tried mead until this year when I tried some of Meridian Hive's stuff at the Mueller Farmer's Market. We bought a growler from them and we were always determined to fill it back up, but we always seemed to go to the farmer's market when they weren't there. Darn.   No more worrying about that, though, because now they have a building for all your mead needs! I always seem to gravitate toward the Rhapsody, because it has blackberries in it, and I love anything and everything blackberry. Meridian Hive will let you try anything for free, which is great. Some day, I'm going to branch out and try all of their stuff instead of just getting the Rhapsody.   They also have several different kinds of honey for you to sample, which was really cool. You can purchase various things here, like growlers, glasses, and metal signs, if you're into those sorts of things. They sell their mead by the growler or by the bottle, depending on what you order and have much you want. There isn't a ton of seating, as they seem to be a newer operation, but I didn't find that to be a problem. They also have some board games out for anyone to play, which I thought was a nice touch. Unfortunately, they don't have any food here yet. I don't know if they allow you to bring food in, but it wouldn't hurt to ask if that's something you are dying to know. The ladies who were working the day I visited were very sweet and super willing to answer any and all questions.   Funny story: this place is basically right down the street from my old office. I bet a mead buzz would have made work more enjoyable, but now I never have to find out. No complaints here!"

I sampled a few different meads and ended up ordering one that was a blackberry flavor, it was absolutely delicious , not too sweet which had been my worry when it came to mead. All of the other flavors I tasted were yummy as well. The atmosphere is a open warehouse. They provide some board games to keep you entertained which made me and my friends quite happy . The employees were very knowledgeable and friendly as well."

Once we finally found the place, we were greeted quite quickly and taken back for sampling. Immediately we were treated to generous samples of *everything.* Samples just kept coming until we had tasted the entire lineup.   Evan ran us through everything with great explanations and loads of information. As any good teacher, he snuck in repeats of information in different ways to help cement it.   He took us on the grand tour. It doesn't look like much since it's small, but there's a lot of information and a lot to learn. Evan was great at tailoring his tour to our level of expertise: two of us with Mead and home brewing experience and two n00bs.   Apparently they distribute from San Antonio to DFW and they've only really been on the market for a year and a half! Their prices reflect their quickly growing popularity, but it's well worth it. They have a Mead for everyone and even honey to sample.  The staff was able to tell us about a lot of events as well. The Texas Mead Festival isn't too far away from Austin and it's in September. The world festival is in Longmont, Colorado. They also make appearances at local farmers markets as well."

Talon, our tour guide was so knowledgeable, engaging and witty. We started with drinks prior to the tour and Miley was so outgoing and welcoming. The follow up lunch and drinks topped off the afternoon. The food was delicious and our server Jake was so accommodating. Everyone enjoyed the beautiful grounds and tried their luck with the cornhole boards. It became a bit of a competition! The group said the day was superb and the quality of the gin rivaled the best from across the pond."

Seldom do you see such actions any more.  She took some time our of her busy day to let us sample the spirits and even gave us some great local restaurant recommendations for lunch and dinner!  Her gracious hospitality was very much appreciated.  This is now going to be my vodka of choice..."

                "description": "Dripping Springs Distilling is just now opening its spanking new tasting room, patios, entertainment venue and production facility, and it is splendid. I went there four years ago, when the tasting room was essentially the lobby to the distillery. While I great.y appreciated what they were doing with their gins and vodkas, the ambience was like drinking in the lobby of Atscott manufacturing in Pine City, Minnesota. This new facility reshuffles the entire deck.  It has taken them a while to complete, but it was worth it. The new venue is spectacular -- well designed, comfortably modern, spacious and welcoming. It's not only a tasting room, it's also a credible restaurant with an interesting menu, specials, and a exceptionally friendly staff.  We went on the second weekend of the 'soft 'opening', but they seemed to have already worked all the kinks out. They were welcoming and prompt and attentive. Our server, Jack, went out of his way to answer questions, including about plantings on the grounds and ingredients in the dishes, and to offer suggestions about cocktails.   I had the street taco daily special and an Electric Lady cocktail. My companion had the jalapeño cornbread muffins and a French 75. The street tacos were small but fully packed. The spice mix could have been spicier,  it then I like hot. The flavors though were indeed special. Nothing dominated, so you could appreciate the protein and still enjoy the comity cheese and the light drizzle of sour cream. The tortillas were a bit small, but you expect that in a street taco. My friends jalapeño corn muffins were excellent. A well constructed corn muffin with one slice of jalapeño that came up and kicked your butt on the after palate. There were plenty of them, so we took lots home for later. The regular entre menu is interesting enough (two different pot pies, additional comfort type foods) that I'll be back.  I should not forget the flight of spirits. I've always respected their two gins, and I often buy them as they are available at Twin and Specs. Very solid, unpretentious and well crafted. I'm not a vodka guy, but my friend liked their offerings. Their 1876 bourbon still needs some maturation and work though. But such is the case with whiskey.   The full grand opening is coming up, with all the hoopla expected. Once the noise is past, Dripping Springs Distilling, with its multiple brands and spirits, will be a destination you'll want to add to the itinerary."

It is worth stopping when going on a distillery tour. There is lots of parking and the staff is very friendly. However they do not have food."

                "description": "This was a fun way to kill an hour or so on a Saturday. The tour is very simple. You walk to see the stills and they do a quick run through on how they make their vodka and gin. You can see how they soak the herbs for the gin and how they do their bottling. It was interesting to learn how labor intensive their orange vodka is to make since they hand zest the orange rinds.   Obviously, the highlight is the tasting. You get to sample their vodkas, gins, and their brand new 1876 bourbon.   All in all a fun tour and tasting. I was super happy to get the last bottle of their first release batch of their 1876 bourbon after the tasting and the gal doing the tasting was great as well.   For $11 you get the tour, tasting, and a shot glass."

The vodka is so smooth.  You can tell they use high quality water!    My family is a Tito's family but after coming to the tasting, I bought 5 bottles for my family members. We'll be using Dripping Springs vodka from now on!"

                "description": "Decided to try this place out because it was a local distillery. we will be back time and time again. We wanted to buy a bottle for the upcoming 4th of July weekend. and we got to try 4 of their selections. The texagave, gin, triple session and whiskey. I was happy with all of them.  Texagave is their \"tequila\". I thought it had a great taste and would make a great margarita. My wife, who is a tequila drinker, wasnt too fond of it, but I loved it and it would make a great add to any bar.  Gin. It tasted twice as good as Tanqueray but with half the bite/harshness. we bought 2 bottles. Will be back for all the Gin needs.  Whiskey. If youre a fan of Gentleman Jack youll love this! super smooth and mellow. I thought it was good (im a bourbon drinker), just not the Super Oaky flavor that Im used to. too mellow for my taste.  Triple Session. This was by far the most impressive and different spirit I tried. Think of a triple sec (orange and sweet flavor) but with actual alcohol in it. I think it is 41% and it tastes fantastic over ice, not to harsh, not to sweet (by triple sec standards) but just right. Cant beat if for less than 15 bucks a bottle at total wine.  I cant wait till I try the rest of their spirits. Go in and try them, you will not be disappointed!"

Scott (the founder) was very welcoming and showed us the different spirits that they had to offer.   The TexAgave is perfect for people that like tequila, the 17 Whiskey is great for the bourbon drinker, and Whit's Gin is really tasty too.  I didn't have a chance to try all of them but I'm sure the others not mentioned are great.   Some of us ordered the Bill Pickett Bulldog which was made with their JavaGave Coffee Liqueur and it was like Kahlua and Milk but way better. Highly recommend that drink!  Most of their drinks are $4!"

                "description": "My wife and I stumbled across this place on a Sunday.  The owner,  Scott,  happened to be inside,  noticed us reading the stuff on the door and unlocked the door,  invited us in for a tour and taste of all their products.   We've been serious fans ever since.   I've had everything they make and all of their products are GREAT. My current favorite is 17, a bourbon,  but that is a limited run.    For Christmas, I got several people to go in for me and buy some 17 to give out as gifts.  I also bought their products available at participating liquor stores as gifts.  I distributed them to about 8 people total.  It was a mix of 17, Leanderthal Vodka, TexAgave, Triple Secession and Javagave.  Some recipients were serious liquor connisuer's,  others just liked a cocktail now and then.  All thoroughly enjoyed what they got and added it to their regular liquor rotations.  Leanderthal has since opened a tasting room where you can get cocktails made with all their products,  and are free to bring in outside food to munch on,  as they don't necessarily have food on site.  Although Scott has a creative work around with that by having a food truck occasionally.   They also give samples of all their products as well.   Their craft cocktails are GREAT!  And they are very affordable for top shelf cocktails.    If you like any type of liquor, Scott has a great version of it.  Everyone there are super friendly too.    Great place to go and hang out.   Only downside is you can only buy 2 bottles per adult every 30 days.   Awesome place!!"

Friends and I tried most of the menu between the four of us and every drink was great. Their liquors are unique and delicious. I love any drink that uses whole, natural ingredients- no mixers in this place, and who can beat $4-5 drinks that taste this good?!  Making it BYOFood is so great, I'm only worried that this spot will get so popular that it will outgrow its space. Can't wait to go back"

Great drinks, great staff, and tons of games to play with friends:) just wish they had paper straws. We loved Ashley the bartender on staff.

Special note: They also rescued a baby cow named Moonshine who is like a little puppy- she loves some pets and will lick your hands a few chickens running around too.   Drink suggestions: great bloody Mary's! I also really like their passion fruit vodka!  Food: mmmk they have the best Mac and cheese! This is a must here. It's super smokey I loved it. They have lots of meat options too.  They have fans blowing water/misting you in the heat and twinkle lights everywhere.  Kid friendly? Yup, although I didn't see any when I went they gave a big play structure behind the car!  Parking on site"

We got there for lunch time and to try a cocktail and eat BBQ as it's really near the local RV park. The vodka is delicious. They offer samples and have a broad selection of flavor profiles. We tried a good number of cocktails each of which was fantastic and flavorful. Jackie the bartender was wonderful to talk to and kept my wife ms drink full, my kids happy with mock tails and unsold me on a bottle of vodka, and a cinnamon vodka ( I hate cinnamon). Catfish, the master distiller came by the bar and had some awesome stories and insights into how Planet Rock became a thing.   If that's not enough to get you there for a taste, the BBQ truck does great food. Get the Texas Twinkie. The ribs were great as was the quesadilla and the stuffed potato but trust me, get yourself a Twinkie.   If you are anywhere nearby try this place. It's pet, child, and adult friendly. And they have live music. How can you go wrong?"

The demon vodka is a terrible mistress that can weaken your soul, lead you astray and give you many hangovers. The prices of vice, in its many forms.  But I ask, are we to avoid the rich experience of human vice, or is this pursuing human vice that gives us meaning?  Good vodka enables the philosopher that resides in each of us.  Many adventures await us as the consequences of our choices.  Vodka is a choice. Choose wisely."

Anthony and Logan were awesome hosts and made us really feel welcomed. Their vodka is incredibly smooth and definitely one of the most enjoyable whiskey's I've ever had. I highly recommend you make the trip to visit as you won't regret getting the chance to sample their alcohol and meet Anthony and Logan! Will definitely swing by again, next time I'm in town."

Very great backstory, and he was very generous with the sampling, just an enjoyable, fun, warm, gathering. The whiskey and vodka are top notch, I wish these guys the best of luck and hope to see their product everywhere. They really love what they do."

The distillery is down a small road off of 973 and once you reach there it is like an oasis. Both Anthony and Logan are great to talk with, and they share their story of the handcrafted vodka and wheat whiskey. Going to visit the Banner Distillary is like taking a little vacation during the day. Thanks guys !"

I had found them via some post on Instagram.  I am very happy we were able to spend time with them.  Anthony gave us the tour but Logan was there as well.  They give you a taste of both of their products while explaining their history and their process.  They have grand ideas on how to move forward as well.  Both men have full time day jobs.  They have done everything for this company.  Including building the building you are standing in.  Extremely interesting.  We have gone to a few distilleries and the tours can be a tad repetitive but this one was very enjoyable.  We are grateful they took the time to give us a tour.  Every minute they are with you they are not working on their business.  I wish them nothing but success. Worth your time if you are in the area and can get an appointment."

Grab an inside picnic table and enjoy the fresh air coming in through the open garage-style door. There is a oversized Connect Four game and cornhole for the kids to play. Plenty of fans mean the inside stays cool.   We tried the watermelon cucumber vodka drink, which was tasty. We also tried a classic cheese pizza and a pesto-sausage-olive pizza. Both were good, but could have used a little kick of flavor -- spice? Seasoning? Next time I would love to try the deep dish. Leave 30-45 mins for bake time."

I finally found a great bottle of red that I actually enjoy, sad that I can't get it shipped to me in California. Drippin' Sweet is also great, bought a bottle as well.

So we are there enjoying wine glasses, wine flights, food, the atmosphere. Everything about this place is so cute and amazing. But trying to get an Uber home seemed unlikely. Everyone kept cancelling on us and the bartender Ann or Annie (plus the last two customers) kept telling us that we were not gonna walk the 2 miles home. Annie made sure that we stayed till she closed and literally DROVE US BACK TO THE AIR BNB!!!. She was the sweetest thing and didn't even want to take any money from us. We had a back and forth of take it, no keep it, take it!! Haha I'm 80% sure I got the money in her cupholder before I left but I was the tipsy one so who knows haha. I really hope I did because driving us back to our Airbnb was above and beyond."

She let us try what we wanted before committing to our drink of choice. I ended up going to wine cocktail called the Texas Kiri and it fresh rosemary in it which I though was a nice touch! They also have live music outside and plenty of areas to sit and enjoy listening to it. Definitely try this place out!"

                "description": "We were in town for another winery quarterly wine pick up party.  That winery no longer allows you to open your bottles of wine at the party or allow dogs.  As such, it wasn't a great day.  We decided to go some place else.  We showed up around 4pm on a Sunday and had the entire place to ourselves. It is so cute.  I love the decorations and the vibe. We did the wine tasting which is $7 or waved if you buy a bottle of wine.  Megan was wonderful.  She was full of information and funny.  We had such a wonderful time we decided to join Bell Springs wine club.  Three bottles a quarter. No sign up fee. They have a wine pick up party that allows you to bring your dogs.  20% discount the first year and the discount increases every year you are a member.  Free wine tasting for you and four people either at Side Car or the winery itself. You also get to pick which three bottles you want. We signed up on the spot. What is NOT to like! We enjoyed many of their wines but really it was Megan.  She made us feel so welcomed and was so friendly.  Bell Spring treat her right, she is a HUGE asset to you.  We can't wait to attend our first wine pick up party.  Hope to make it to first Thursday soon and hang out at the Side Car.  If we lived in Dripping Springs this would be a weekly stop for us.  What a great place in this sleepy town.  We are so glad to part of their wine club and excited for the many cool events moving forward.  This should be a place to stop if you are in Dripping Springs."

I was also really intrigued by the damiana, and generally enjoyed the cocktails we tried. also, was pleasantly surprised that the kitchen food was also quite good. all in all if I lived here I'd hang out on the weekends."

Tried to go to Jester King down the road (and didn't get to, for the 2nd time in a row cause it's always so damn busy) so decided to go here instead. Glad we did! They were very attentive to us as soon as we came in, and we loved the complimentary tasting flight. Ended up buying a bottle of the coffee liquor we can't find at the liquor store. And I love the virgin pineapple drink they made for my toddler. Matt was fantastic! Very attentive, not pushy. Good vibes all around."

The tasting was free, while the cocktails were in the $8-10 range. The gin, coffee liqueur and pecan liqueur were amazing! However, because it was Sunday, we couldnt buy bottles, which was very disappointing. The cocktails were a bit of a let down that didnt let the spirits shine. The best was the gingery take on a White Russian. The service was very friendly and attentive, yet again, we were the only customers. I definitely recommend picking up a bottle of their gin and liqueurs if you can find them!"

When we answered no they immediately brought over for a tasting - no charge.  We enjoyed most of the different offerings.  Then we picked out some cocktails to enjoy - both with their gin.  Daughters was with grapefruit and mine with cucumber.  We also purchased a cheese plate which we were told was made up for them from the local grocery store.  Nonetheless, we enjoyed our cocktails out on the picnic tables and had quite a lovely time.    Not being from Texas we were unaware of the law prohibiting liquor sales on Sundays.  We certainly would have bought a bottle if  we could have."

If you're a fan of coffee, you must try their cafecito or chocolate cafecito spirit. My favorite was their gin. If you like mezcal, try to their gin reserve in mezcal barrel.

This place is really amazing!! There was quite a bit of crowd as it was saturday but we were still given a great deal of attention during our tasting! My favorite was the cafecito coffee liquer and the chocolate cafecito. They're so good, that I could probably drink an entire bottle all by myself!  The best part of this place is the amazing people who own/work here and they didn't even charge us for the tastings and also gave us a free cocktail made with their gin!! So as appreciation from our end for all that they did and shared with us, we gave a nice tip :)!! Definitely, going to look for Revolution on my next trip to Spec's!"

Best of all there was no need to pay $$ upfront for a tour--just walk in and start tasting and talking.   The gin was the standout here, but all the stuff we tried was excellent except for their own cherry-limeade mixer--that was kind of a letdown, but the alcohol itself was great.   Can easily walk from here to Last Stand Brewing and Argus Cidery. There was a food truck outside as well."

To elaborate, samples were provided for the different options of their distilled liquor while an explanation of the flavors was provided, which was particularly beneficial for the 100 proof gin such has notes of grapefruit, lavender, and juniper. They also have a coffee liquour which is 50 proof, so a bit stronger than the traditional but still very sweet and flavorful. Even after the tasting, it was a nice place to hang out and was well ventilated and shaded."

Had a delightful time talking with him about his distillery and spirits while sampling as well as general conversation later at our table.  We were given samples of gin, amaro, and two coffee liqueurs.  All were very good.  We then picked our cocktails, which he made and brought to our table.  Very tasty and reasonably priced.  We were not rushed out and time was not even mentioned by the owner.  I realized it was 15 min. after closing so we finished our drinks and bought some small size bottles.  We will be back!"

Upon visiting, we found their doors swung open to a single long room that had spirit-making equipment and two booths set up.  At the first booth, we had complimentary tastings and a saga-sharing session with their amiable bartender. The tastings were amazing: their hibiscus gin and tonic cocktail was incredible (the taste you crave days afterward). After the tasting, you can meander on to taste some of their specialty liquors (fruity ones too). We found their eau de vivre to be phenomenal, lovely aroma and as smooth as butter. Would highly recommend stashing oodles of their spirits away for safekeeping!"

The creams are out of this world and the elderflower liquor is perfect for a spritzer or to sweeten that mixed drink from Brad. I can just drink it on its own but I am tough like that."

                "description": "The place has great potential. Very cute and good drinks.  But they have a long way to go when it comes to customer service.  The bar tender seemed to be really put out that we were even there.  Didn't welcome us, when we asked if we needed to go to the register part of the bar to order,  he looked at his phone and rudely said, I'll be with you in a min. Then continued to be annoyed that he had to take our order. The place was empty only 1 pinter group of 4 so wasn't like he was super busy.  They even said he didn't really seem to want to be there and definitely didn't want to be taking our orders.  The AC was also very lacking we were all fanning ourselves with the menu which seemed to be the best use of the menu since he didn't want to serve us. The sink in the women's bathroom barley had water coming out if it and they were out of toliet paper but we dare not ask the 1 bar tender as that would have really put him over the top. I wouldn't recommend this place and if I was the owner I'd want to know how bad my employee is. No wonder there was no one inside."

It'll be a great space to spend an afternoon once the pandemic ends.  Call ahead if you want to pick up some of their fabulous Texas Holiday Nog, but remember, only 2 bottles per person per month.  Careful though and drink responsibly. This is not your father's Oldsmobile eggnog. It will sneak up on you and kicks you in the noggin like a freakin' mule."

The two female bartenders we have had in the past were amazing.   However I think they missed the mark on this expansion.  Sadly this is NOT the same place.  Total different vibe.  The new 'bar manager'  (a dude) made me a Mojito that I couldn't drink. He also told my husband that he is planning a lot of new drinks to put on the menu"

All the liquors were good, the cocktails were too. The gentlemen working were friendly and knowledgeable.

Original takes on standards like their take on the margarita: The Brandyrita.  Had a great time. But the star of the show was their Texas Brandy, and the Carajillo, which made me a fan.

My friend and I went on a whim after eating at the Salt Lick and seeing signs to this distillery. We hung out for an hour. We talked with the staff, drank a dram, and played some corn hole. Great little spot with awesome drinks. As a whiskey guy, that's what I wanted to try, but it wasn't ready. Nevertheless, brandy was good. Great time at an awesome location with good people.   Enjoy."

                "description": "We passed by this place heading to the Drip yesterday and since I'd never heard of it, I immediately yelped it.  A new distillary only about 10 minutes from my Casa?  Hell yes, I'm curious.  And I'll admit I became even more curiouser after reading Arian's review....I intended to ask them about this \"one of the best after-hours swingers hangouts in Austin!!!\" sitch.    The tasting room was a little hard to find as it's around the back of this little warehouse strip but it's open and spacious and we were only the 2nd couple there on a Friday evening.  We were warmly greeted and bellied up to the bar.  Our bartender (and all the staff I think) are in the Stinson family.  She was very friendly and gave us all the history of the place and explained each tasting in length.  They are currently offering a tasting of 4 of their liquors for $7 (these served quaintly in communion cups) and have cocktails they can serve as well.  We sampled everything (of course), the vodka, the white rum and dark rum, the elderflower liquor (think St Germaine) and the Holiday Nog.  She also threw in a sampling of their Bailey's style coffee liquor that's not quite \"ready\" yet.  I immediately fell in love with the Holiday Nog, which doesn't actually have any egg in it (thank goodness) and is made more with rum than whiskey (again, thank goodness).  This will go great with holiday gatherings.  I will keep an eye on their FB page for release of that coffee liquor!  All of their bottles run in the $25 range.  Hubby and I each had a cocktail, him the mojito and me the Citrus Fizz, and both were made well and were tasty.  We also bought several of their cocktail glasses as they are sturdy heavy glass, perfect for Bourbon.  Which, btw, they are still perfecting their whiskey recipe and will offer that in the future as well.    We really enjoyed talking to everyone and after getting a little liquid courage, I did ask about the swinger's parties.  She laughed and said that was just a friend making jokes....I wonder......"

I can't really comment on their beer other than to say, the three I tried were not to my liking, but what I can say is that I love this place!  I've been here twice now, with friends, and with my man and both times have been great!  The place is spacious and covered in tree canopies with a sprinkle of fire pits, Adirondack chairs and picnic tables. The service is good and the mules are divine. I love that they serve cocktails as well as beer so there is something that I like and something for the beer drinkers, like my boo.   We were lucky on both occasions to have great weather and this time around, live music. I've been to several of the breweries and distilleries along Fitzhugh and so far, this is my favorite."

He dishonors himself and his military service, having taken an oath to defend the constitution and then taking a big dump on it. I'd say shame on him, but people like him know no shame. There are much better places than this to spend your drinking money"

The Gold had a little bite to it, but all were delicious.   The wife's hurricane was potent but delicious.   I snagged a raddler which was a little different to a traditional one, but delicious and dangerous as you can probably down 6 before the Lord almighty gets the news.   The brew house and distillery are open and outside seating is abundant.   Bring your 4-legged friends for the ride as they are super dog friendly!!!!  You would have to be drunk and mad to pass this place when visiting Dripping Springs. Wait...they might be able to take care of that for you...responsibly of course.   So. Great drinks? Check. Great staff? Check. Great atmosphere? Check? VETERAN OWNED BUSINESS?!? Affirmative. God Bless y'all for your service.   Rock solid 5 stars."

Not only is the owner a super friendly fella, but the alcohol is legit on point. I don't remember the last time I had such a smooth vodka. And the hurricanes- wow. So. Freaking. Good. The place is adorable, by the way. Super super cute. Veteran owned is a huge plus. We'll be going back again and again."

Otherwise I probably would not come back here, the drink I got was literally all syrup and made me extremely sick to where we had to leave... Kind of completely ruined the day. My boyfriend enjoyed the drink he ordered, which I believe was the hurricane. They have a wing food truck that you can order from, unfortunately we didn't get to try it because the drink made me so sick. We plan to go back in try the wings and will review the wing food truck. Great location for the spot, nice and relaxing... Just be careful what you order and avoid anything that has syrup in it."

They are presently distilling rum and vodka and brewing several varieties of beer.  My spouse tried a Big Red One with salt -- a vodka drink -- and a Cuba Libre.  She was pleased with both. I had their amber and liked it so much I had another.  They have a clever solution to social distancing. The two young, friendly order takers are stationed under a canopy at the edge of the parking lot by their outside seating. You place your order with them, and one goes inside to fetch your drinks. There are plenty of shade trees and picnic benches so it's a pleasant experience. The owner , Phil, came out to say hi to a fellow vet (me). Nice, congenial guy.  The Dripping Wings food truck is stationed there now, so I went back for an order for dinner. Excellent wings, particularly the Asian sweet and spicy.  Glad to have a new convenient venue to enjoy."

Glad we stopped at this place after seeing a sign off the side of the road and following a winding path down to see this gem.  Very homey vibes with a great patio for outdoor seeing that just has a fantastic view of the hill country. Decently priced drinks consisting of either gin or vodka.  Seating is pretty limited inside, but the outdoor space is just amazing and honestly makes the experience really that much better. I'd highly recommend 'The Bullfrog' with vodka. Tasty drink, but not overpowering and has a nice kick (smooth vodka that doesn't burn like gasoline).  P.S. They have some cool looking merch! Make sure to take a look at their terrariums...they are wicked!"

However, this time I made a trip purposefully to stop in.  I am glad I did.  Frog Pond is a family-owned business and passion project. The entire family was behind the bar the day my friend and I stopped in except for mom and I think a daughter.  The family owns the land and has slowly overtime built the tasting room and production area themselves.  They currently make a vodka and gin.  They offered us a free sip of each to determine which we would prefer in one of their handcrafted cocktails.  Both had a nice flavor profile that blends well in cocktails.  Their cocktails were creative and they mentioned the family came up with the recipes together.  The cocktails were delicious and very reasonably priced.  Their space has a fun modern 50's theme.  They have an outdoor patio you can sit back and relax on a nice day."

It's very obvious that a lot of careful thought has gone into this place. The actual distillery is incredible. The whole place is just beautiful. Even on a scorching Texas Summer day, there's a strong breeze out on the porch.  It's a very \"Austin-esque\" type place, down-home and friendly. Although I don't drink, my wife enjoyed a cocktail very much and we bought a bottle to take home. They had some nice lemonade and infused water for me too.  Great design of the logo, bottles and everything. Really worth stopping in if you're in the area or just feel like a nice drive from Austin."

We started off at another well known distillery down the road and googled what else was close by and found this awesome little spot with a great view. They make small batches of vodka and gin at the distillery and make a few different drinks to try. Their porch was a great place to hang out while playing giant jenga and relaxing. I noticed cornhole as we walked in as well. We watched deer randomly wandering in the distance. The drink I had was great, a cranberry vodka fizz, so I had another. The indoor space is fairly small and the patio could fit maybe 30 people comfortably. It was not crowded at all when we were there on a Sunday afternoon. We'll go again next time we're in Austin!"

I am very happy to say that the product that they are offering, not only the liquor, is amazing. They couldn't have picked a better location to place their distillery. The hills of Texas, day or night, make relaxing on the patio with the variety of gin and vodka cocktails that much more relaxing. The bright pops of color when you venture inside of the distillery are such a delight and really made my girlfriend and I feel happy to be in such a welcoming place.   The gin was delicious and I plan to buy more bottles very soon. Don't think that my lack of praise for the vodka means that it isn't good (I am just not a fan of vodka..rough nights in college) but I definitely suggesting venturing out to this family run, local organization. You will not be disappointed."

The lady on the other end of the call was quite nice suggesting they had PLENTY of space for our cars to park.  Well, they weren't wrong. Quite possibly the best photo opportunity of the entire weekend. Our attendees overlooking 24 cars perched in the beautiful trees of Hays County overlooking some of Mazda's genius. Free samples of crafted rum too?   I'd call that a win! Owners were quite attentive as soon as we arrived. Telling us the story of the brand; walking us through each tasting. Some drinks were ordered; maybe a bottle or two bought. Not sure we were the most receptive group being on a car tour in the Hill Country. Service was excellent!"

They offer free samples of the three different whiskeys with one of them being bourbon barrel aged using Rebecca Creek barrels.   The staff was friendly and well informed on the products. Currently they are distributing to smaller local stores and will start distributing to more stores in the future.   As it is August right now we couldn't tour the distillery because it was too hot but we were informed that the tours would start in October when it cools off.   The bottles are decently priced for hand crafted rum like this.   There are plenty of tables and chairs for groups, drink cocktails were decently priced, and property is a great change from the city."

I didn't expect it to be at someone's home, though!  Not that it's a bad thing.  Rum, for me, is a take it or leave it type spirit.  I typically use it only in cocktails.  I don't think I've ever wanted to sit down with a glass of rum.  Now bourbon?  That's a different story.    On arrival, I just expected a tasting only, but they actually make cocktails.  They have a small menu, or you can request whatever you want from the mixers they have.  Mojito?  Of course.  Want to go dive with a great rum and just some Coke?  They won't judge you for that, either.  They make their own version of Rumchata in house and it was SO DELICIOUS.  For real.  And they'll give you the recipe.    Pick your favorite of the three varieties: Crystal, Gold, Vanilla and buy a bottle.  Then pick up a bottle of vanilla extract.  If you don't cook, make your mom very happy.  That stuff is fantastic.  In the hotter months, don't be a jerk and demand a tour of the actual distilling barn.  We all know how distilling works.  If not, the internet is your friend.  They don't want to be in the high temperatures, and neither do you.  Let them explain the process to you while you sip a nice, cool drink instead."

Make sure you try the vanilla rum and take a turn on the tree swing! My nephew loved it.   Wish they would have more signs.... the first was easy, then we were feeling lost."

I have been to other rum distilleries and have never stumbled upon such a \"harsh\" flavor that could never be drank alone. That being written we decided to have a drink on the patio...I'm glad alcohol kills germs because the guy serving us had the dirtiest hands and fingernails I have ever seen in my life and I have children. For example when he grabbed our glasses from the cabinet it left a dirty grip mark. I was pretty much grossed out. It's too bad because again the location is great."

Let's examine the facts:. -- He led us through a tour of his small but highly functional distillery. -- He answered all of our questions about the process he uses, and even showed us some of the machine parts he's made. -- His wife made us two (nicely sized) tasters: a mojito, and another thing I drank even faster than the mojito that tasted like a lemon drop.  $5 each later, we skipped right down to Wimberley Valley Spirits to get ourselves a bottle, because the law is mean and David can't sell any of the goods on the premises.  Stupid Republicans, or something.  Now we check out our unopened souvenir, plotting and planning, totally giddy that we pulled into that questionable-looking lot with the signage for rum.

I really liked the rosé wine, and my friends and I ordered truffle fries from the food truck. The only thing I would change about our experience is that I wish we had made a reservation 24 hours in advance because you can't order charcuterie boards and wine flights without one.   Everyone is really nice, and on a chilly day, they even have blankets. I highly recommend making the trek out here!"

There is a winery and a brewery on site so everyone likely has an option they'll like = Best of both worlds. They have plenty of outdoor seating, which you could choose to sit in the sun or under the trees in the shade. We split a glass of rose and their sweet white and I would recommend either one. The sommelier was super sweet and helped us choose our wines. Would definitely recommend a stop here to relax and enjoy nature with a glass of wine in hand!"

There is ample outdoor seating under big shade trees! It's a pretty place.  There is also a brewery on site, but I cannot speak to the quality of the beer. We stuck with wine on this trip. I would definitely come back and try other wines and the beers offered!"

                "description": "Completely unacceptable management. For about 2 hours a group of individuals where shouting at two tables, yelling sexually explicit language, swearing profusely, and were clearly unable to drive. At a place that prides itself in a family atmosphere, where kids are running around playing in the grass and trees, this is completely unacceptable. I am looking forward to management/ownership response to this review. In a region where wineries, breweries and distilleries are a dime a dozen, plenty of opportunities to take my business elsewhere when we come visit.  What should really concern the owners and management about what happened at Bell Springs is the fact that:  1) The Hays County sheriff was called after the incident because it was so egregious. Enough of these reviews and they will be lining up outside the parking lot for DWIs.  2) The staff (7:00 pm on 6/19) did absolutely nothing to cut off a clearly over-intoxicated group that was negatively impacting people around them  3) The staff's response (blonde and burnette hostesses), ver batim, to the vulgar language and rowdiness was \"free speech\" and \"you are the problem - I know those people\".  Fantastic - best of luck in your future endeavors . Your stellar response caused one of our group to cancel their wine membership."

However, they do have an outdoor patio, bar and high bar seating. The outdoor seating probably really nice in good weather.   Call ahead or make reservations online. It's very easy and they do allow you to amend reservations over the phone.   They produce really great wine and there's a great selection to choose from. The staff is very knowledgeable about their wines and answered all of our questions. Testing comes with a **small** array of cheeses, nuts and crackers."

We sat up on the patio with our dog and enjoyed a lovely wine tasting. We chose the solo tour which was $15 for 5 generous pours of delicious wine. All the staff we interacted with were very friendly and helpful. The one low point is the food truck. We got the currywurst for $10 which was good, but not a large enough serving for the price. The more upsetting part was the pretzel we got (also $10, which is very expensive). The prestel was small, hard (even though it was supposed to be a soft pretzel), and flavorless. The mustard cheese dip did its best to save it, but it wasn't enough."

I would recommend bringing your own snacks and food! Otherwise, awesome spot and I can't wait to go back!"

                "description": "I have been here numerous times and always had an awesome experience but today was the most unacceptable experience I have ever had ANYWHERE. I was here with my family, parents, and my brothers family with a total of 5 kids (not unusual to see kids here). While here, we became aware of a group that was likely overserved and using foul/vulgar language that we tried to ignore for a long time. Once we heard the phrase \"fat c*ck\" at a ridiculous volume my husband asked them to please keep it down, which resulted in a huge altercation with various threats/insults from their end. Despite their behavior management still allowed them to stay. What's worth noting is multiple people had already complained about this group and others joined my husband in attempting them to quiet down- so they were affecting loads of people at the winery. Eventually things calmed down and the argument broke, but as we were leaving they said loudly for us to hear \"I'm so glad that douchebag is leaving\" so I gave them the finger as I was walking away (I will concede this was adding fuel to the fire but I was so fed up at this point) and they screamed to me \"FUCK YOU MOM\" across the grass. Managements response? Free speech allows them to say whatever they want. Apparently this nice hill country spot is going for the dirty 6th vibe. Save your money and go somewhere with enough pride to expel those who can't keep it together while I use my own right to free speech to notify everyone this place doesn't care about their patrons."

                "description": "I am a resident of Dripping Springs and have been a frequent patron of Bell Springs Winery. I found this family-friendly venue to be welcoming and beautiful. It was for this reason that I suggested that my kids, with their families, join my husband and me for a Father's Day celebration on Saturday evening, June 19th. When we arrived just before 5 pm, we found a good picnic spot in the shade near the bag game. We all noticed, or rather heard, a very boisterous group of 12 to 15 people sitting near the brewery. As the evening progressed, and I am assuming more alcohol was consumed, the group became louder and more profane. We attempted to ignore them, but soon it was impossible due to the volume and the increasingly prevalent and disgusting language. At that point, and because we had 5 young children with us, my son-in-law went over to the group and respectfully asked them to turn down the volume so that my Grandchildren would no longer be exposed to words like \"F*ck and C*ck\". He was immediately met with a barrage of personal slurs and threats. 2 staff members (2 young ladies, one light-haired and the other dark-haired) working that evening came over to the group, however, incredibly, the inebriated party was allowed to remain on the premises. Shortly after, every family packed up and went home, including our group.  When walking to the parking lot to leave, a particularly vile young woman yelled obscenities at my son-in-law and daughter. I turned around and went over to the group. When I arrived, I was also barraged with a variety of slurs and called a \"C*nt\". Once again, the 2 female staff members came over to the table to intercede. At this point, the dark-haired staff member shared with me that she \"knew the group\" of offenders, which helped me understand why these folks had not been asked to leave. If you happen to know staff, you can act like filthy pigs, with the knowledge that your actions will have no repercussion, regardless of the profoundly negative impact on everyone else looking to enjoy wine and food with their families.  To add insult to injury, staff had the unmitigated gall to suggest that I was the problem, not the drunk and vulgar group. When I questioned staff (dark haired young lady) why they permitted such obnoxious behavior from any patron, she suggested that hurling profanity toward others was protected under free speech. Staff continually suggested that our \"conversation was over\", indicating that they wanted me to leave. Clearly, the privilege of free speech isn't applied equally to all patrons visiting Bell Springs.  In the past 15 months, I have recommended Bell Springs to dozens of family and friends. Now, I plan to exercise my right of free speech in every forum available to tell acquaintances and strangers alike about my experience, advising that Bell Springs is not worthy of anyone's patronage."

We were staying in the adorable town of Wimberley so I researched tours in the area.  Jodie's Taste of the Hills Tour got great reviews and went to wineries close to the Wimberley area. The day of the tour ended up being chilly and rainy. As soon as Jodie pulled up with her spectacular shuttle-like van she was out like a flash with pretty umbrellas for us! We went to 3 different wineries which we thoroughly enjoyed! After the first one, we returned to Jodie's vehicle and she had a gorgeous tray for us of cheese,  sausage,  crackers,  grapes,  olives, dips.....simply divine!!! The tour was also just the 2 of us and we loved that Jodie still did ALL of this for a tour that I believe takes up to 12 people! The next time we plan a trip to the Hill Country we are going to do one of Jodie's Beer tours!! We had such great conversations with Jodie too! Thank you sooooo much for the GREAT time! Sooooo much fun!"

Jodie made us all feel like we were old friends, even though we had never met anyone else on the bus.  She was very detailed with the stories of each winery, and explained all the different varietals, answering our every question along the way. The bus was very comfortable and clean, and she stored each bottle we purchased until the trip was over, but we could have had the bottles on the bus had we chosen to.  The wineries all seemed to know her, so they were expecting us and were incredibly friendly. We were not rushed anywhere, and still managed to make it back into town to enjoy shopping on the square.  My wife and I were pretty hungry by the time we had lunch, since we didn't have breakfast, but the tapas style lunch was perfect for the glass of wine we purchased to have with it. The lunch was delicious and filling.  Overall this was an amazing experience and I will be recommending this tour to everyone I know."

She has an extensive knowledge of wines, the wineries, the towns, etc. Our favorite part was lunch because of the views and the wonderful spread that was provided for us. I highly recommend this tour and in fact will probably we doing it again, soon, I hope."

                "description": "Perfect - the highlight of our trip!  Jodie was the best, most fun, knowledgeable and coordinator.  We went to Driftwood, Duchman and Fall Creek Vineyards.  We were fortunate enough to have great people touring with us, and it made the tour all the more fun.  She prepared the best picnic lunch I've ever had.  Sugar Shack cake balls, meats, cheeses, crackers, hummus, a goat cheese something served on crackers (that I LOVED, and I hate goat cheese), spinach feta rolls, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something.  She was fully prepared for everything.  Boxes for the wine we bought, umbrellas in case in rained (it didn't), plenty of water...this wine tour couldn't have been more perfect if she tried.  Thanks, Jodie!"

She provided an excellent variety of foods including a hot portion and gluten-free (just in time `cause I was lit after the 1st vineyard). The three vineyards for that day were selected based on the wine preferences of the tourists that day (A+ perk). We never felt pushed or obligated to buy wines, but we all did because they were very good (!), and Jodie kept our purchases organized and stored for us. She also gave a good background on each vineyard and on the Wimberley area in general. We learned a lot about Wimberley and wine and were able to get tipsy knowing Jodie was an excellent driver of her comfy bus. And have you been to Wimberley? That hilly countryside is beautiful!"

Our tour was originally scheduled for 10:30a, but got pushed back to 1:15p due to shuttle trouble (we had the option to receive our money back, but actually liked the later time).  We stopped at three wineries, including Driftwood Estate and Duchman Family Winery.  The views at all of the wineries varied, but each were unique to their locations.  Jodie provided an amazing picnic-style lunch, including a charcuterie (meat and cheese) board, chicken salad, nuts, walnut and feta salad, grapes, chocolate cake balls, bottled water, etc. At the second stop, Jodie was kind enough to call in people's orders to Salt Lick BBQ and had it all ready to take home by the third stop.  We can't wait to return again!"

She gave us a lot of background information on the wineries as well as the town of Wimberley. She had a delicious assortment of snacks for us to munch on while we rode to and from each winery. She helped package our wine purchases and brought us umbrellas as it started to rain. She even went the extra mile, literally, and drove us back to our hotel since it was raining as we had walked to our meeting spot earlier in the day. We had another couple on the tour with us which was really nice since we had people to mingle with. It was a very personal experience and I felt as though we were all just great friends spending an afternoon together. Who needs Napa, everything is better in Texas!!! We will definitely be repeat customers."

The club along with friends from Dallas and San Antonio headed east after the Texas Independence Day Parade. Libation education started at Derelict Airship AKA Violet Crown Spirits just west of Bastrop.   You've hear of strip mall chic? Think business park chic! Quite similar to my friends over at Desert Door in Driftwood. Matt was an excellent host explaining the history behind each of their offerings. Let's start with Absinthe. Banned for many years in the US and parts of Europe, small batch distilleries have been popping up in the US since 2007.   The anise flavor is quite strong and it's recommended you cut it with water. I've heard sugar cubes are common as well. Other in house offerings include an Elderflower and Jasmine Liqueur. Girlfriend and I's personal favorite was the Jasmine and we took home a bottle to pair up with other local spirits. A top notch experience from start to finish. Our group is excited to see this company grow. See y'all soon!"

                "description": "I'm pretty sure that you can't buy your vodka here but they definitely make it here. Hand-distilled and made in small batches with old-fashioned pot-stills. It's the bizness.  Interestingly, the vodka is made with yellow corn, rather than potatoes or wheat (or milk whey, in Vermont). The facility is the State of Texas' first legal distillery, they have gown quite a bit and crank out 500 cases an hour and dominate the US vodka market with 7.1% share.  May I suggest a TitoRita? 1.5 ounces Tito's Vodka, 0.5 ounces orange liqueur, 1.5 ounces fresh lime juice, 1.5 ounces fresh lemon juice and 0.5 ounces of simple syrup. Put it all into a shaker with ice, mix it up and pour into a martini glass.  That's probably too many carbs for me. My drink is called a \"Skinny Bitch\" and it's Tito's with club soda and a slice of lime. Delicious and cool.  [Review 13302 overall, 620 of 2020.]"

I don't know if the business has just gotten bigger than the owners can handle but communication was subpar. It took several calls and emails to get answers sometimes.   At our first tour, Kathie took tons of photos and would pose us at the wineries. This tour, we had to prompt her. It was a cloudy day so not the best for outdoor pics but I was disappointed we took most of them ourselves or had to ask her to take the pictures.   Our tour was April 11, it is now almost 2 mths later I haven't received the few pictures we took. I emailed twice and have finally heard back that the SD is apparently not working. I'm not sure why I had to email to find this out, seems like this info should have been divulged as soon as the problem presented itself.   I hate to downgrade the star review but my second time with this company just wasn't as epic as the initial tour I took with them. The wineries all seem to love this company though."

DTWT was very accommodating, scheduled the wineries we wanted to see, ordered the lunches, and then confirmed our selections a couple of days prior to our tour. At the last minute after visiting with a couple in our third stop, we changed our fourth stop to a different winery. Jason (our driver) was happy to accomodate us. My only regret is that we didn't choose a few wineries a little further out of town, so we could spend more time in the limo listening to our Willie Nelson songs. Jason was awesome, and I highly recommend this tour."

                "description": "We started researching half-day wine tours for my BFF's bachelorette party several months in advance and chose this company because of its good reviews and cancellation policy (full refund up to 7 days in advance).   First, the bad news. The booking process is way more arduous than it should be. My initial discussion about the tour plans happened over the phone, so I asked for a written, e-mail confirmation of what we had discussed - specifically how the deposit and refund policies work. It took me more than three weeks to get that first e-mail confirmation of our booking and deposit payment. I then went back and forth, back and forth, back and forth with the company, hammering out the details, like setting a pickup location and our choices for the winery stops. Many times, three weeks would pass and I'd have to make multiple attempts before I would get a response to my e-mails. Sometimes, the responses would be incomplete and we'd repeat the process of trying to get information confirmed. Seriously a pain for an experience that costs $129 per person.   Now, the good news. The online payment portal for each attendee was a breeze to use and eliminated the need to handle money all through one person. As for the actual tour itself, we couldn't have asked for a better experience. Our driver, Bobby, was on time and wonderful on the day of the tour. He was funny and polite and had good knowledge of the area. Also, very importantly, he was a good and safe driver! The Mercedes bus we took was very clean and spacious, and they provided water, cups and napkins. They also allowed us to bring our own food onto the bus. The three wineries we visited, Driftwood Estate, Duchman and Fall Creek, were all accommodating and fun. The views were lovely and we never felt rushed and made it back on time. It was raining when we got back to our car, and Bobby was so nice and helped us get our stuff back into our car in the pouring rain.   All in all, despite a wonderful wine tour, I'm not sure I would recommend this company, only because I spent way too much time hounding them throughout the booking process. While the wine was excellent, I NEEDED to drink after dealing with their horrible communication. Discover Texas Wines should strongly consider re-evaluating their communication practices and hire more people to keep up with the demand for their service. It's the only way they will stay competitive in the long-run!"

We did a half day and it was the perfect amount of time.   Couldn't have been any better! Thanks Roy!!!"

He picked us up on time, was incredibly friendly, and funny even though we were a bachelorette party and knowing the possibility of it getting crazy with 7 girls. Seriously, request Roy. He made the trip a blast. There was cold water for us in the bus. Oh did I mention it's a Mercedes bus? Super nice! An AUX cable was available to play our own music too. The selection of wineries was amazing, perfect mixture between red and whites/dry and sweet, so every one of us could have something tasty. The drive was beautiful and not too far out of Austin. Overall, I am very impressed with this tour and the wonderful employees. Would definitely go again."

I made the reservation back in January, gave my card for deposit and was told I'd be emailed a link for everyone to pay. Over the next two months I called and emailed asking about the link so my friends could pay their part and I was repeatedly told they were having issues. Okay fine, no big deal- I also emailed again saying we can just pay the day of if the link wasnt working and never received a response. The day before our tour, as I was driving from Dallas to Fredericksburg I get a call from Some guy at the company and he seemed very annoyed with me saying no one had paid yet. Um.. I'm sorry I didn't realize you finally sent it after months of my asking. (He had sent it the day before calling me to tell me no one had paid) The vehicle I requested was not the one that showed up. The driver Julia was late bc she did not write the address down correctly. We also had 3 girls cancel last minute, so we were down to 5 instead of 8. Considering there minimum is 5 I wasn't expecting that to be a problem but Julia felt the need to bring it up multiple Times as if it caused some inconvenience for her. Rude people, horrible communication."

Organizing a full day wine tour for 50 people in the Texas Hill Country may not sound like an easy task, but Noel at Discover Texas Wine Tours made it smooth and most importantly, unforgettable. His main goal is to make sure everyone is comfortable and has a good time! Most companies were not able to host a group this size, but Noel made it happen. He made sure our bus was the best he could find, worked to have a lunch catered for us at one of the stops, set up private tastings with many of the wineries to accommodate a group our size, even stopped to let one of the guys who didn't drink wine buy some beer. I can't say enough good things about Noel and how hard he worked for our group. I highly recommend him and look forward to another tour with him soon!!"

On the day of, I got a heads-up call to confirm the time and pickup location. We had a larger, rowdy group of gals on a bachelorette trip and our driver Song took SUCH good care of us! She immediately asked us what music we wanted to crank and encouraged all the \"wooing\" from the back of the van. She also offered to take pictures of us, scouted out the best locations for group photos and even took TONS of candid pics of us while we enjoyed the winery and distillery we went to. She helped with all of the logistics of checking in at each stop and making sure we were taken care of. She also let us make a pee stop on the way home...and overall she was just SUPER nice and was basically hyping us up the entire day, making sure the bride felt special and making sure we all had fun. By the end of the day we all felt like she was part of the crew. Thank you again Song!!"

I even received a call back in May while on a business trip from the shuttle service company asking if we would pay the overtime for Hugo because AWT had not paid them yet. We even tipped Hugo an additional amount for his extra time spent with us.   The response just posted (almost 4 months later) is also extremely unprofessional and misleading. We were promised a great time for a bachelorette party and were let down. Plain and simple. Those employed by AWT that we spoke with were rude as well. Secondly, I never said that AWT hosted prom events/transportation. I was told that the company that is usually utilized was completely full (by Brad) and that prom happened to be a priority and the school bus that was sent was all they could get us even though we were promised a party bus.   At the end of the day we were completely dissatisfied with the services offered by AWT. Calling a client a bridezilla (who in fact actually never spoke to any AWT employee), claiming your company has gotten PTSD from our group and falsely accusing our group to be racist by saying we told \"blackie to leave\" is unprofessional and disrespectful amongst other things said in response to our reviews. All of those involved would be happy to discuss this event again in a professional manner since you mentioned that we were offered a full refund when that in fact was not true. We were offered maybe $350 (I could be wrong on this amount since we haven't heard/spoken to anyone from AWT for several months) in return if we removed our reviews.  As a company you should take responsibility instead of blaming others for your mistakes that way you can fix the problem and do better for future patrons. Especially since there has been no money refunded at this point."

Sara was very informative and laid everything out, giving us a doable timeline for the afternoon we wanted. The itinerary we received gave us a good idea of how long to spend at each venue. There were only 4 people in our group, so we were able to do a very flexible hourly option, with appointments at the wineries.  Since we had less than 5 passengers, our tastings weren't included (informed that going in) however, that did not deter our experience... it was awesome! Buying a bottle of wine at each venue was very affordable when we split the cost among us.  George, our driver, was professional and friendly; and the limo experience was awesome! You might want to bring snacks just in case someone gets a bit tipsy, but most wineries offer food of some kind. Thanks Austin Wine Tours, for making me look like a champ with my high maintenance friends... I'll be back!"

We started at William Chris, headed to Pedernales and ended at Augusta Vin. The 15 passenger van was great for our group of 11. They offered water and took care of checking us in at each winery. David was a complete gentleman and carried all of our purchases and secured them in the van while we enjoyed our time tasting the different wines. He even dropped us off downtown so we would be on time for our dinner reservation."

A 15 passenger VAN showed up with a dent in the side and ripped seats. We were told we could bring coolers. We were only able to fit 8 adults in the van with our two coolers- no way we could've had another person in the van. None of the wineries had been scheduled yet and the ONE we had specifically requested was not available. We had to scramble ourselves to find wineries, in which we were promised everything would be done ahead of time. The meat and cheese tray that was promised was a small tray that was bought during the tour at a convenient store to feed 2 people. Our driver was great, however the owner did not deliver what was promised and we were highly disappointed. There are plenty of companies to choose from, and I would NOT recommend Open Range."

He picked us up from San Antonio, drove us up to Hill Country and around to 3 wineries.  As this was my first Texas wine tour, he did an AMAZING job of helping us select which wineries would be a good fit for the group.  As we had a decent amount of guys with us- he suggest Garrison Brother's Distillery which ended up being a HUGE hit!  He was extremely professional, courteous and just an absolute delight to spend the day with!  He also has a wicked funny sense of humor.  He was also very accommodating and ordered and picked up lunch for us so we could continue to enjoy beautiful Hill Country.  I would use him again in heartbeat and highly, highly recommend him to anyone wanting to enjoy Texas Hill Country!  Thanks David!"

D'Ann was extremely responsive and gave me several suggestions of where to go. Since I'm a wine club member at quite a few wineries in the Hill Country, I opted to do a custom tour and made my own reservations. Greg, the owner (and D'Ann's husband) arrived on time and drove us to 3 wineries where we were able to enjoy a nice, relaxing afternoon. Greg was so friendly, helpful and accommodating. I would highly recommend Open Range Tours...thanks, D'Ann and Greg!!!"

They know a lot about the wineries and have personal relationships with the owners/managers/tasting staff.  David also went above and beyond by making an extra stop for shopping/pie-indulging and by dropping us off at our dinner restaurant so we didn't have to walk from the visitor center where he picked us up.

                "description": "We went to Fredericksburg for a girls trip and wanted to spend a day at the distilleries and breweries. David was fantastic to work with planning everything out. I wouldn't have changed any of that part. But, once the day rolled around we were met with a hiccup. The driver, not David like I was anticipating after multiple conversations, arrived in a mustang for 5 of us. Obviously that wasn't going to work so I was offered by the driver only to cancel or reschedule. Our trip was planned around spending our day out and about so cancelling wasn't an option for us. After a phone call to David, we were assured our day wasn't ruined just a bit delayed. The driver left and showed back up with an SUV and away we went. The driver wasn't interactive and she didn't seem to even be having a good day... It happens I get it but come on. Anyway, we made the best of our day and enjoyed ourselves. When we were dropped off, I tried to pay but she said to get with David. No problem but I did have a problem with her then saying that she'd go ahead and take the gratuity and that the standard is 20%. I didn't even know what our total cost was to figure 20% but asking for the gratuity before I even paid for the day was in poor taste. We did go ahead and tip, and well mind you, because that's the kind of people we are. I ended up calling David and finishing out the transaction and once again, he was a pleasure to deal with. Overall, we'll use them again because I appreciated David that much. But, I'll definitely make sure we don't have the same driver. 5 stars for David but 4 stars overall for the above mentioned."

He would check in on us during the winery to see if we needed anything or have any questions, and he would offer to help us take multiple pictures. He also got one of the wineries to allow us to explore their cellars!   On our last day in Austin, he drove by our airbnb to pick up someone else and honked at us as we waited for our uber.

From the minute I called to book to the minute I said goodbye to our driver the day of the tour they were fantastic.   So when I called there actually weren't any times available. They worked with me to make sure they had a tour time and sprinter available for our group of 6. I had a million questions; they were patient and kind.   Our group was 6 but one of my friends asked if we could add an additional person. Reached out to TTT and they said sure no problem. Literally 3 HOURS LATER I got a call that another girl tested positive with covid and wouldn't be able to come with us obviously- they were so nice and made the switch back to 6. Very grateful for their exceptional customer service.   Day of our driver Bryant was early which was great! Got on the bus and let us have free range of the radio, answered any wine questions we had or any questions about Fredericksburg. He was a fantastic host. Always texted 15 minutes till our time at the winery was up and took as many pictures as we wanted. He was so sweet! He also made sure we were never thirsty or hungry. Which for a group of girls is very important- smart man! Haha   I've heard things about other companies having hidden fees and people getting charges after leaving Fredericksburg and we had none of that. Texas Tipsy Tours was very transparent with all of their pricing and they had no hidden fees.   Thank you TTT for making our trip perfect. You won't regret booking with them."

When I initially started inquiring about a tour a few months ago, many of the companies only offered private tours for a minimum of 4 people. However, Texas Tipsy Tours offers small group private tours (i.e. 2-3 people). This was perfect for me. She also made planning our trip so easy, and she promptly answered all of the questions I had.   On the day of the tour, she picked us up from our hotel in Austin in an Infiniti SUV (it was very clean too)! She even made a pit stop for me at a CVS on the way to our first winery. Throughout the 6 hour tour, she made sure we stayed on schedule. She even let us change a stop last minute because we wanted to check out a brewery!  One thing that was amazing was the comfort she provided! She allowed us to pick the music, provided phone chargers, and let us control the AC! She even opened our doors for us AND dropped us off/picked us up right in front of each place we went!  Overall, I highly recommend Texas Tipsy Tours, and I will definitely be back!"

                "description": "We booked Texas Tipsy Tours twice in one weekend. I have taken quite a few van tours around the hill country and Texas Tipsy Tours sets themselves apart by not just being drivers but they truly host you the entire day. I will ALWAYS use this company going forward. We did a private charter from Driftwood to Austin, TX and back and Keaton our driver was a delight. He made sure we were picked up on time and each of our stops were easy and flexible. We did a mixed tour around Driftwood and Dripping springs the next day and our guide Eric executed the BEST DAY for us. He even picked up on what we were liking and recommended a change to our final stop to Vista Brewing and we were SO glad he did. At each stop he made sure we had plenty of water, snacks and chairs to enjoy the gorgeous venues. This is totally above and beyond what we would have expected from a driver. Courtney was so easy to work with and she helped make recommendations for our group ultimately making our weekend get away FLAWLESS. I promise if you don't use this company, you're wrong."

                "description": "AWESOME! I worked with Courtney at TTT to plan my Husband's 30th birthday brewery tour. It was as easy as getting on the phone, explaining what I wanted, and Courtney took care of literally everything else. We picked the breweries we wanted and even included a food stop. She coordinated the bus pick up, drop offs, schedule, and even reserved tables for us at each stop. I love that we had our own bus (very nice one, by the way!), and had the flexibility to create our own tour based on beers and food my husband liked. It was the perfect Saturday in Austin! Payment was very easy as well - they sent me an invoice to my email and I was able to pay directly online for everything. Highly recommend, and thank you Texas Tipsy Tours!"

Courtney and Eric are just the sweetest people! Would highly recommend if you're looking for a relaxed tasting without the hubbub of big party buses, AND if you're looking for a more personalized experience with people who can really throw a party. Fredericksburg can be confusing because of the many, many options, so Courtney's expertise in the wineries proved incredibly helpful. Highly recommend!!"

                "description": "This was my first, and sad to say, my last time doing this festival. A friend who had been a few times before highly recommended it and when I balked at the $40 (plus a $3.50 processing fee) \"pre-event discount price\" with the at the door price being $50, he assured me it was well worth it because there were so many great food and wine vendors, you get your money's worth.  This was absolutely NOT the case! Firstly, this whole thing just seemed disorganized at best and I am sorry, but for $50 ($40) they could have gotten a much nicer location than a dusty, stiflingly hot cattle stockyard!   As for what you get for $40, 6 drink tickets and 10 food tickets when drinks and food run you anywhere from 1 ticket for a meager barely 1oz pour for most of the wines to several tickets for very small portions of the food, you barely get $10 worth of food and drink! You can purchase ticket for $1 a piece, which is most definitely not worth the portions or pours you receive.   As for the vendors/vintners at the festival, there were not nearly as many as you would expect for the price point and the layout was just haphazard. Also, there were several vendors that were out of food by the time we got there just after 2pm...the \"festival\" was supposed to go until 6pm...so how the heck were vendors running out of things w/4hrs left!?!   The only highlight, for me at least, was the grape stomp, but even then, they ran out of tshirts to \"stamp\" with your grape-soaked footprints.   In any case, my $43.50 would have been better spent and enjoyed at an actual local restaurant where I could have gotten multiple full pours of wine and actual food instead of leaving this joke of a festival hungry, overheated, more sober than when I arrived, and feeling like I had just been scammed somehow. Lesson. Learned.   I am honestly shocked this \"festival\" has lasted 10yrs let alone one!"

                "description": "I had a lovely time as the guest of a coworker. However, I felt like the overall value wasn't quite there for this event. Drink and food tickets went way too fast when some places asked for multiple tickets for less than an ounce of wine or a small sample of food. The actual value was about $1 per ticket. There were also some vendors that were somewhat rude or rushing. The whole point is to get business by having people try your product, right? Well there's some wineries I'd think twice about giving my money to after their lack of friendliness.   The options for food was more limited than I expected and many ran out of food even though we got there just an hour after the event started. There are lots of raffles going on and free koozies and pens galore. The arena was stuffy inside and though fresh near the doors you ran the risk of also eating dirt.   The music was good but there needed to be more sitting areas to relax and open a bottle of wine. I will definitely go back next year, but I do hope to see more offerings."

                "description": "This was by far the most awful \"festival\" I have ever had the misfortune of wasting money on.   First of all, in 2012 it was held at the Texas Hill Country Olive Company. So all advertisements this year were of a gorgeous event at this lovely vineyard - The photos were of a classy event, surrounded by olive trees and rolling hills, adorable art booths scattered about the lovely property, smiling faces holding wine glasses. I was so excited based on what I was reading of the Olive Company event that I had my mother travel up 3 hours on the morning of Saturday the 14th to accompany me. Then I convinced another girlfriend of mine to join. We had our tickets in advance, $40.00 online purchase, and my girlfriend paid at the door - $50.00.   Now, regardless of where the ACTUAL event for 2013 was advertised as being held - between the advertisements on Yelp, on Facebook and scattered about Dripping Springs, it was VERY unclear to anyone coming from outside of town where the hell this event actually was.   So we arrived at the Texas Hill Country Olive Company to find no tents, no events, no nothing but a beautiful building surrounded by beautiful land. Inside there were very few customers. But we were greeted warmly, given amazing samples (DO go there and DO try their olive oils and balsamic vinegars and DO check out their $55.00 romantic date night packages).   Making the best of what was already frustrating, we had a few samples and they sent us on to the Dripping Springs Park Ranch - or something like that, up Ranch Road Twelve.   We were still optimistic until we saw the HUGE metal pavilion looming ahead, situated in the midst of probably two square miles of plowed up red dirt which will eventually be a parking lot. As we navigated in, driving through dirt among hundreds of cars, we noticed piles of dirt, bull dozers, caution tape... this entire venue was a.) an agricultural fair pavilion and b.) UTTERLY UNFINISHED.   I was mortified. I brought guests, I paid money, and we were supposed to be in the midst of lush, rolling hill country sipping wine and sampling cheese. Not walking through 300 yards of dirt to get to an unfinished metal building. This was already so embarrassing and already not worth the money.   We had to enter at the back of this enormous, godawful construction, walk through the art vendors, then across MORE dirt on the rodeo floor (where the paying guests tables were and the music) where we were given six drink tickets and ten food tickets. When we reached the one interior part of the building, we were encountered by swarms of casually dressed, generally rude, pushy guests who were buzzing around a square room with no proper traffic flow. There we found out that each drink ticket gave us ONE OUNCE of wine, which was poured by rude and distracted vendors. We also found that each food ticket did not entitle us to a sample - samples cost anywhere from 2 to 5 tickets. One ticket got you the likes of ONE chip with a dollop of something on it.   I was blocked and almost run over by a RUDE and completely OBLIVIOUS staff member who was blocking the only entrance to the tasting room. Other guests were hogging the only FIVE standing tables in the are, they'd put their purses up there and stand around and send other guests to get them samples, so there was no where to set down your things and you had to juggle a glass of wine, your tickets, your purse, and a plate of food and in order to eat it, back through the ONE door you went, down the stairs to the dirt on the rodeo arena floor.   We left without even using the tickets we had - not worth the paltry return for what we'd spent and what we had to endure to get there.   I will never return to this event. I want my money back from this event. The Dripping Springs Chamber of Commerce should be ashamed of the overall mess and disappointment this fiasco was - they don't deserve a dime of the money they raised from it.   TERRIBLE."

I enjoyed the wide variety of beer, wine, and liquor to choose from, but I wish there were a few more food options. What made it worth the price of admission was the sommelier talk at 3:30 where there was no-ticket-required wine comparison tasting, and I learned a few things. Take advantage of those demos if you go next year. Also there were a few food stands with free samples no tickets required (pecans were a favorite, olive oil, chips and salsa, etc). I wish I had hit the liquor area sooner, they seemed to have generous pours. I may hit this event again next year, or I may not, but I definitely had a good time."

For that money you receive a twin Iiquors reusable bag, some goodies inside the bag including a wine glass, 10 food tickets and 6 wine tickets.  Each wine ticket was good for a 1oz pour.  And the food tickets could be used at more than 10 food vendors for various amounts.  It is called Dripping with Taste because it is supposed to be a \"taste\" not a full glass or full meal.  I will tell you that I had plenty of food for my 10 tickets!  And got to try 6 different wines!    I will say that a previous post about volunteers having to work 2 hours and then getting unlimited food and drinks is absolutely false.  Volunteers had to work a minimum of 3 hour shifts but most worked many, many more hours not only the day of the event but also prior to the event and they got the same 10 food tickets and 6 alcohol tickets.  I learned a lot about local wineries, breweries, and distilleries and tasted some awesome food from some local restaurants that I had not yet eaten at."

So you pay $40 for a single glass of wine. HEB gave away 2 chips with salsa for 1 ticket, empanadas were 5 tickets. I was denied BUYING a bottle of water, so that the volunteers could have them.   This brings me to the point, if you want to go to dripping with taste, volunteer. They treat the volunteers far better than paying guests. They do their jobs for 2 hours then get to enjoy UNLIMITED drinks and food and get cool shirts that aren't available to buy to us regulars.   I was very unimpressed Dripping Springs."

Get there and see that almost every vendor is charging 2-5 tickets for food tasting and the wine tastings are  only 1 oz pours. What??! What did my $40 pay for?? A couple sample size appetizers and a few gargle-worth 's wine samples! Furthermore, it was inside and stifling!! I'd much rather pay a little more and get unlimited tastings, at least I'd feel like I got my money's worth. Sorry Dripping, won't be back. Huge disappointment."

Everyone parking had no idea where to go. Other than that, the new Ranch/event center is nice. There were lots of vendors and lots to choose from.

It was raining when we arrived, I know that no one can help that, but we were one of the first to arrive and we directed to park at the back end of a mud field. Instead of filling up the lot nearest the event, we had to walk though a water logged muddy field.   Then the signing up volunteers, one of the online register volunteers, was the rudest person I have met in a long time. She reminded me of one of the Orks from Lord of the Rings.   So you get 10 food tickets and 6 drink tickets. What you fail to learn until you have paid ($50) is that 10 food tickets doesn't mean 10 small samples, all of the samples were multiple tickets. Essentially, your $50 gets you two tacos and the six drink tickets equal about one glass of wine.   A truly crap festival."

I have attended literally dozens of wine festivals, mostly in California. Believe me that the Dripping with Taste Festival is, by far, the best value on the market. Spending $40 for the initial tickets is next to nothing compared to the analogous events in California. AND purchasing additional tickets for a buck each is very cheap compared to other such events.   I have attended the last two Dripping with Taste festivals and plan to continue to attend every year. I look forward to this event based on the quality of the event and the very, very low cost. Both years I have come away with the feeling that I got more than my money's worth and found several Texas wines to add to my wine cellar!"

I live in Drippings and saw this massive structure being erected.  Its quite the eye sore.  That'd be fine if it wasn't so expensive.  Worse, it is actually held in a tiny closed off indoor part of the complex that's maybe a 1/8th the size of the whole place.  Needless to say, it was over crowded, people packed in like sardines.  My family wanted to leave rather quickly because it just flat out sucked.  Some the vendors were generous some were stingy and acted like it was a chore to deal with you.  Stay away from this event."

I decided to try it again this year since it sounded like a great venue but I was very disappointed here as well. The place was nice and large but very hot and had a messy, red dirt floor. Really, I spent $40 on a cattle pen?  The wineries were nice but there were not enough food vendors and most were over-priced. My legs and feet were disgustingly dirty by the time we left. It also made me wonder how much of that dirt ended up on the food.  That's two out of two disappointments with that event and I will not be going back until a better location is used. If it happens a third time, well it will be third time and your out. There are plenty of nicer wine events around Texas that don't charge that much for entry and are much more fun."

We sampled food from most of the vendors, the quality was outstanding and we found everyone to be warm, friendly and knowledgable. As always, great wines, loved the beer garden, and glad to see the addition of spirits. The music added a nice ambience. We enjoyed our beer, wine and food sitting comfortably watching the shows.

Sam, the owner and driver, was unbelievable. Very accommodating, great driver, and super chill.   We planned to hit up the Salt Lick on the party bus and then venture around to some breweries afterwards. Sam made sure that the group got where we needed to be on time, had great suggestions for breweries, and made sure we were having as much fun as possible.  The bus is great. Fit everyone comfortably with enough room for a cooler in between all of us. Sam had her playlist turned up or she would hand over the AUX cord and we could play our tracks as loud as we wanted. The whole experience was incredibly laid back and worry free. I would absolutely recommend Cool bus ATX to anyone that wants to have a great time with a big group in Austin.   On a side note, if it is Sunday, make sure that you buy beer on Saturday because they don't sell it on Sunday before noon.   Thanks again, Sam!"

My driver clearly had everything under control, so I was able to relax with my friends and start the party as soon as we got on the bus!  Our kids were so jealous when they saw the cool bus their moms' were leaving them in!  Honestly, the bus could have driven us anywhere and we would have had a good time, but Santos' attention to picking great vineyards and James' attnetion to keeping us on schedule made everything perfect!  Our group was different than most -- in that we wanted to take it slow and just relax and were not too concerned about whether we made it to all three destinations.  We also had some nursing moms and wanted to be sure everyone was accomodated.  James was very accomodating and once I conveyed that we were more relaxed he made sure we had all the time we needed.  I also felt like the driving was very safe and overall the attention to safety was as it should be.  The price was reasonable, as well.  All in All, Keep Austin Wet made our vineyard tour perfect!"

Santos was so enthusiastic about hosting our party, which was a welcome relief as that is not always the response you get from tour companies when you tell them you're a bachelorette party--no matter how well-behaved you may be! Our driver, James, was wonderful and so helpful the entire day, especially at the end when we elected to add another hour and an extra stop; he catered his recommendation to our needs (gluten intolerant guests + casual interest in beer and liquor) and we had an amazing experience. You can't beat the pricing, but for what we paid our experience definitely exceeded every expectation. Thank you so much for everything, and we look forward to using you again in the future!"

Throwing a surprise weekend is stressful enough but Woody was SUPER accommodating especially for being so last minute.  There were many tours that I could've chosen to stick with but Woody was so authentic about his services and was a person of integrity when it came to what he offered.  He personally picked us up from our little hotel we were staying at and drove us to all three of our tours. His tour bus was super clean and we all had a blast! He even offered to pick up some cheese and snacks at the HEB close by to have on the bus if we wanted! I really appreciated Woody taking the time to answer my numerous phone calls with questions I had as this is my first Bachelorette party I threw.  I HIGHLY recommend using Woody if anyone wants to have a great time and looking for someone to trust. I will be booking with you again Woody, thank you so much for everything!"

If you come across Fredericksburg Uncorked Wine Tours, stop your search and make the booking.

Woody was incredibly patient during the lead up to our tour, and then was a funny, gracious, and attentive guide during our wine tasting experience.   Our tour was fantastic from start to finish, and I can't recommend Woody and the rest of the Fredericksburg Uncorked team highly enough. All (18) of us had the greatest time!"

He was very friendly, informative and kept us entertained. We learned so much about the area, got recommendations on places to go and heard some great stories along the way! He also made sure to take plenty of photos for everyone in the group. I highly recommend using his services for a great tour of wine country!"

I called him Friday morning at 8:50 hoping I'd get a call back before the 10 am tour and I did ten min later and I was able to get on his first tour . I honestly called three or 4 more tours throughout the week and left messages and he is the only one that called me back. Not only did woody come through, he came through at the last minute when I thought We weren't going to make a tour.  He was funny , knowledgeable and overall a great guide. He even recommended a few things that weren't apart of the tour (Alamo Springs Cafe) which we ended up going to and was delicious.  Lunch was not included but the place we went to was pretty great for a sandwich . I'd hang out and grab a beer with woody any night !  Thank you for making my boyfriends birthday a good one !!"

I was upset and apparently he was too so he threw customer service out the window. I never agreed to Woody keeping my credit card information on file after he charged the wine tour for 11 girls (almost $1,300).   The driver Tommy was nice but he did nothing special and didn't know the basics of Woody's business. Had he known even a little bit about Uncorked Tours, there wouldn't have been confusion about lunch.   As far as the wine tour: William Chris and Lost Draw were my favorite wineries. Hye Market pretended we weren't there half of the time. Pontotoc was greedy with their pours.   Woody was very unprofessional and difficult to work with at the end. I would not recommend him. Book early to get the highest rated wine tours (2-3 months prior)!"

It was a really great and memorable experience and I would definitely consider doing it again! We had our own spacious limo that we could sip on wine we brought with us, as well as some we purchased at the wineries we visited, while driving from one vineyard to the next (drive time between each location was max. 15 minutes). Overall a great experience!"

                "description": "So first....let me say that our group totally dropped the ball on planning.  We reached out to Carla 3-4 weeks before but did not confirm until the week of the wine tour.   By the grace of the \"wine\" Gods, Carla could fit us in her schedule!  She is completely open to letting you choose your places or you can follow her lead!   She picked us up at our accommodations which were several miles outside of Fredricksburg.  We did introductions and she laid out the things that were already scheduled for the day.  On our way to the first winery, we decided to \"reroute\" the tour to hit some lesser known spots.  TBH, we were excited for Carla's recommendations.    Our first stop was Six Shooter because of their variety of dry wines, sweet wines and meads.  You have to try the Jalapeno shooter!!!  SO GOOD!   Second, we made our tour time at Real Ale and did a beer tasting. Third, she realized the majority of our groups like Whiskey, so we stopped at Andalusia Whiskey in Blanco!  This place met the needs of our entire group (even the non-whiskey drinker) and was by far the most unique stop of their day!  If you go here, try the Cherry Cola cocktail!   We stopped for lunch at Pecan Street Brewing in Johnson City, where we drank lots of water and had really great food.   Our last stop of the tour was Zero815 Winery which had a cool mix of wines and friendly staff.   At the end of the day, Carla made sure that we made it back to our accommodations safe and sound.  We had the very best time and she knows some of the coolest places that you might miss without her expertise.  She was extremely professional and very down to earth.  She was always around to help with recommendations or just to snap photos of the group!     We highly recommend doing a tour with Carla and Texas Wine and Spirit Tours!   You won't be disappointed!   We'll be booking with her again the next time we are in the area!"

The weather was pretty bad that morning, so we started a little late, but the van that they have is really, really nice, clean, and spacious. She even has a little stool in case you need help getting into the van, and she helps everyone get in and get out. We went to three places around the Johnson City area. The first one was a quick tasting, the second one we learned A LOT about wine and got a lesson in how to properly drink wine, and at the third winery we got the most interesting history lesson about President Johnson and Lady Bird Johnson from the winemaker himself. Leslee personally knows the places and owners and was just the best tour guide. One of the places on the tour where we were supposed to also eat dinner at cancelled due to the weather, but Leslee was quick to find a different place for us to go to. She took us to a cute cafe in downtown Johnson City where we ate a ridiculously good dinner. We even went to Leslee and her husband's bar at the end of the day for one last drink and got a chance to meet her sweet daughter as well. I thoroughly enjoyed the tour with Leslee and highly recommend D'Vine Tours!"

Done tours previously, but not had as much fun as this trip.  They have access to the good and interesting vineyards, in an area where new places pop up daily it seems.  The bus was comfortable, the ride was smooth, and the mood was great.  They have earned our business."

She made sure everything was perfect for us and we got the experience we were looking for. She even went out of her way to give me a list of fun things to do in the area since we aren't local. Jaston, our driver, was awesome! He was our photographer, server, driver, anything we needed he made sure we got it. We definitely will be using Winding Road Wine Tours in the future!"

                "description": "Looking to experience great Hill Country wines and barbecue - we had both taking Winding Road Wine Tours Salt Lick Sunday Wine Tour.  The tour picked us up in Gruene in a new luxury bus at 10:30. We were greeted by the tour owner Billy Martin.  The bus was very comfortable with a u shaped seating arrangement and a table in the aisle.  Should seat around 12 people comfortably. The bus has a great sound system that is Bluetooth enabled - Billy played whatever we wanted from sources such as Pandora and Napster music service. First stop was Driftwood Estate Winery. Driftwood has perhaps the best winery views in the Hill Country.  I really enjoyed the reds and came away with a bottle of Longhorn Red to enjoy at our next stop Salt Lick Barbecue. Yes, Salt Lick is byob. It was beginning to rain and Billy dropped us off near the check in stand. He's thought of his customer's needs providing us large golf umbrellas. It was busy with people waiting to be seated. However, he got us seated right away. Our final two wineries were Fall Creek right across the street from Salt Lick and then Wimberley Valley Winery. Fall Creek has solid wines and the service for our group was outstanding. Wimberley Valley Winery was an unexpected pleasure. Their tasting room is roomy and comfortable with plenty room at the tasting bars and a comfortable seating area facing a large stone fireplace. They have a variety of wines bottled on site along with other wines from around the world. The grounds were spectacular with numerous large shaded decks to enjoy a glass or bottle as you wrap up your tour.  What a great Sunday drinking Texas wines, eating Texas barbecue and meeting new friends!"

                "description": "I rented a party bus through this company a couple weeks ago. In the beginning, Robert was extremely accommodating and friendly. And our driver, Terrell, was great. We got dropped off at COTA for a show and had a great time!  But where it turned south was at the end of the night. I texted our driver 30 minutes before we needed to be picked up (like he requested) and he said no problem. Then we left the concert and were walking to the pickup spot where I gave him a call. He said he got in an accident but would only be 20 minutes and I said that's fine. 20 minutes roll by and I gave him a call again, no answer, but texted and said it would be another 20 minutes. We ended up waiting in the cold for almost an hour and well after most people had left COTA. Multiple people in our party ended up just taking ubers because they didn't want to wait. The whole point of a bus is so you don't have to wait.  The next day, I texted Robert saying we would like a refund for the extra hour we paid for waiting that we wouldn't have used if we had been picked up on time. He said he would call to discuss but never did. I've now sent him multiple emails - mind you, being incredibly nice about it. All I asked for was an hour refunded back - not the whole thing, not even half. But still no response.  The customer service level of this company is terrible should anything go wrong. So hire them at your own risk."

We had rented a party bus on pretty short notice to take a Bachelor Party to and from Lake Travis and Robert and team were amazing.   It was also Prom weekend so the schedule was packed for them but they still took care of us and worked with our schedule.   Our boat ended up staying out on the water longer than scheduled which through our plans all over the place and Robert was there waiting on time. Given his packed schedule, the driver did have to leave without us but Robert made sure to get me in contact with another service and they sent a bus over right away.   All in all, it was an incredible experience!"

                "description": "I'm incredibly frustrated with this business.  We had spoken a couple times in the months before I decided to book and I initially felt great about potentially booking with these friendly people.  When it came time to book I called them and was told, once again, that our requested date was open and we talked out an agreement.  The owner tells me we're good to go, and that all he needed me to do now was to send him my information so that he could get a contract sent that same day.  I'd explained to him that I was booking this bus ride to and from a party boat, and that I would be booking with them that day as well.   SO, I get off the phone and send my info.  I call my party boat folks to let them know I've just confirmed my bus, and I'm ready for a boat.  I book with them based on my discussion with these guys and put down $400 to hold our reservation.  It's been two weeks since I last spoke with this company and they have ignored my calls, texts, voicemails trying to figure out why the contract hasn't come through.  Our event is next month, and at this point I've been researching new solutions, and unfortunately the new solution means I can't use the same boat company, and therefore I've lost my $400 deposit.  I did not have this money to lose, but after being ghosted by this company I guess I have to take the loss and move on.  They seem like nice people, and it takes A LOT to get on here and write a negative review, but this has caused me a lot of stress and I want to prevent this from happening to anyone else.  I hope at some point I find out a reasonable explanation and can revise this review, but not counting on it.  We'll see I guess."

                "description": "BOOK WITH THIS COMPANY!  Robert did a solid job taking me and a bunch of my friends to Lake Travis and back on July 4th. His price was WAY lower than other companies I called, being the ONLY one that actually sticked to his regular prices during this busy day. He arrived early and was 100% responsive to my emails and phone calls. He arrive early to pick us up and was extremely friendly and professional. He helped us carry our coolers and accommodate everything on the bus.  The bus itself is amazing. Seats are stacked in two rows facing each other, which is great for dancing and socializing, since you are actually facing half of the crowd. The sound system is also very good. I almost feel that the bus trip was even more fun that the boat.   In summary, Austin Nites Ent. is the best on price/quality, Robert and his wife are responsive, professional and friendly, and the whole experience I had with them is positive. Would highly recommend anyone to use it, and will definitely consider using them again if I ever need to.  Thank you guys!!!!!"

                "description": "We rented a party bus from Robert for my brother's 30th birthday. They were one of the only companies I found that didn't increase their rates because of prom season. I called about 10 other companies looking for fun and safe travels with almost all of them being ridiculously overpriced to take advantage of the prom goers. Robert was very accommodating, professional, and had awesome rates. He called two days before the scheduled time of arrival to check in and verify everything was still good to go. He asked if there were any changes in the amount of people and offered a bigger bus just in case. Our drivers, Patrick and Joe were awesome! Patrick called me early the day of to verify everything and let me know he'd be there at 8 and then called again when they were almost to our pickup location. They arrived right on time with an awesome bus just for us. He had coolers with ice, a flat screen tv, music system, AC and even a bathroom in the back. What more could you ask for? Part of the evening was spent at Graham's Central Station in Pville. We didn't realize prior that Graham's doesn't serve food anymore and had to order pizza to the bus. Patrick gladly retrieved our pizza and brought it to us when it arrived. We all had a blast, felt safe and were taken care of. Highly recommend Austin NItes and shout out to Patty PartyWagon, if you had a Yelp page, I'd write a review for you too."

As a bachelorette \"day party,\" we gathered together and hopped in the super roomy and comfortable All About Central Texas SUV and headed out on our journey.   Kim is extremely knowledgeable about each winery; the history, the best wines to try, the \"wine club\" or other bonus things each winery has.   We stopped in on 3 different wineries and Kim had made superb choices in each spot; from the wines to the view to the suggestions on what to try and how to make the most of our samples so everyone could try as many as possible (thanks for that tip, Kim!).   Be it an afternoon with a group of friends, or a romantic day for two, All About Central Texas is an outstanding choice.  Thanks for everything, Kim!"

I did the Fredericksburg tour and based on my wine preferences she had some great suggestions on which ones to stop in, there are so many! I even joined a wine club, the tastings were informative and she is just a lot of fun and I didn't have to worry about driving or directions and could enjoy the pours and some snacks.  I highly recommend All abt Central Texas tours, they are personable, you can really get to meet the others in these small groups- Thanks so much!"

I filled out an inquiry form and then was contacted right away. We booked a private tour for a couples trip. Alee was great in providing suggestions and making sure to fit what we wanted as part of the tour. We got to tour Hawk's Shadow, then had a tasting at Duchman and ended our tour with some delicious BBQ from Salt Lick, next to Salt Lick Cellars. Tom, our driver was so nice and flexible with our schedule. He reminded us of how much time we had but did not feel rushed at all. We'll definitely be booking Slowpokes for any future trips!"

Our day included several of the high country wineries, one brewery and a visit to the quaint town of Wimberly. We highly recommend this group over  other Austin wine tour groups as they create a very personalized day and made sure everyone enjoyed the stops.

Lindsey chose our wineries very wisely; we started with lunch at Crowson (whose owner will drop incredible knowledge on you), enjoyed a rainstorm and a glass of red at the beautiful Ron Yates, and ended with cheese and BOOOOM wine at Hye Meadow Winery. It was lovely day of booze, conversation, and sisterhood. And, yes, we loved Lindsey so much she became a part of our wolfpack. Lindsey was fun, energetic, and knowledgeable about the area.

She made a wine bottle with me and my moms photo on it with a sweet birthday message and quote.  She took so many photos of us, and really made us feel special. We were able to choose our wineries and she even picked us up and dropped us off at our BNB. She had the most amazing tapas tray, with cheese, mixed nuts, her special dip, crackers, breads and meats. She had this prepared and sat out for us at Wimberly winery,  halfway through the tour. At the end of this stop, she even had cupcakes for my moms birthday. I had actually called around different wine tours in the area and Slow Poke Wine tours offered the best value and I can tell you now, the best service. We wouldn't hesitate to do it again. This trip with my mom was priceless and so special. I thank you Linda for making an amazing memory for my mom and I."

My now fiancée and I rode in the Model T Ford, which was all-original except for the brakes. I contacted Linda with any questions, concerns, and booking, and Linda picked up my fiancée in a Mercedes van.  We went to a great breakfast, and then David drove us around in the Model T Ford. The route was scenic, breathe taking, and beautiful.  The wineries we stopped at were great, and, the customer service from Linda and David was unbeatable.  They have a unique business that is more than just a van or limo driving you around to distilleries, breweries, or wineries (although they also have a Mercedes van option).  I am now going on another tour with them for a bachelor party, and they could not have provided more prompt replies to my requests for information related to travel, pick up at different locations, types of tours they offer, and pricing.  What a great business run by some truly nice and professional people who offer very reasonable pricing.  I plan to use their services again in the future."

                "description": "First I would like to start with the facts.  1. We booked this tour months ago but unfortunately had to reschedule to a later date. (due to Covid19) This was not an issue for anyone attending the tour and the company got all $2800 paid for in full. 2. Yes $2800. We had 28 people in our group, It required two buses that were at their max capacity.  3. I would give a HUGE ZERO if I could.   The buses arrived at the pick up location 25 minutes early and expected us (all 28) to load up. Not all 28 people were even there yet. The male driver already seemed annoyed at this point.  We ended up pulling out at the agreed on time. When trying to leave the 2nd winery we couldn't. The drivers HAD LEFT and weren't there to pick us up. We waited outside in the sun outside for 30 minutes before they even got back.  But that unfortunately is not why I am writing this review   As we were loading the bus to go home the male driver said that would be charging us for a cleaning fee ($300) because someone spilt something on the floorboard. Pretty steep for a small spill that could be wiped up with a Clorox wipe but she agreed to pay it she sat down. Comments started to be exchanged about the steep fee and how the day had been complete chaos up until this point. The man began to get pretty heated and slammed the door. When he opened the door to his seat he said \"who the f**k spilt something in my seat.\" Nobody had spilled something on his seat. Upon looking at the \"spill\" it appeared to be sweat from Him. He continued to cuss and yell and eventually told us to \"get off his bus.\" We all piled off and the other bus also unloaded.  Now it is important to note the other driver said we didn't do anything wrong and that she didn't agree with how he was handling things. He told her he was in charge and that he would make the call. She became quiet after that. They ultimately left us there to find our own rides.  The male driver was rude and didn't speak unless spoken to the entire day. A beautiful day with amazing company was RUINED by this company and I will not recommend them to anyone!"

                "description": "I booked a birthday trip for 6 people, hoping to add 2 more. Dale told me I could book the trip for 6 and then add the 2. When I called to add the 2 he told me he would have to see if that was even possible. I didn't understand why after he assured me it would be fine and a sprinter van hold more than that. He had given the sprinter van to a larger crowd and downgraded us to an SUV without asking me (same price). I asked him when I would hear back and he said whenever he located another vehicle. I made some calls and found a better business who really wanted to host me and our guests. I called again to cancel with Dale and was told I am not the type of customer he would want. I guess a customer who wants to pay more money to add more people isn't good... very strange. Talking to a woman like that is not ok. I hope that he was having a bad few days and that he doesn't always behave like this, but I was really shocked how rude and unprofessional he was. Pros: I got my money back."

                "description": "One of the WORST experiences I have ever had with a \"wine tour\" company. I have been on many wine tours in my days, across different parts of Texas, and their unprofessionalism and lack of customer service and just blatant disrespect was appalling.   This \"wine tour\" had a total of two buses and a party consisting of 28 people. A group of people that I have known for years that have the utmost of respect and common courtesy for any company that they hire or work with.   From the start of our experience, both drivers were incredibly rude and unfriendly. The bus lacked any amenities one would think this \"Premier Hill Country Wine Tasting Experience\" would consist of.  The first winery.  * We arrived at the first winery at 10:48am to learn that the winery doesn't even open until 11:00am and that they WEREN'T expecting us at all... * Not the wineries fault. They were fantastic.  The second winery.  * Again, wasn't expecting us, causing us to have to sit at a tent down a road from the winery. Again, not the wineries fault, they handled it incredibly.  * When trying to leave the second winery, we couldn't. The drivers HAD LEFT and weren't there to pick us up. We waited outside in the sun outside for 30 minutes before they even got back.  The third winery.  * As we were loading the bus to go home, the male driver said that they would be charging us for a cleaning fee ($300) because someone spilled something on the floorboard. Pretty steep for a small spill that could be wiped up with a Clorox wipe, but she agreed to pay it. (*To clarify, open containers were allowed as stated on their website: \"Consumption of alcohol on the bus is allowed unless there are minors present.\") Minor spills like this are inevitable when providing a service as they do. Comments started to be exchanged about the steep fee and how the day had been complete chaos up until this point. The man began to get pretty heated and slammed the door. When he opened the door to his seat he said \"who the f**k spilt something in my seat.\" Nobody had spilled something on his seat. Upon looking at the \"spill\" it appeared to be sweat from him. He continued to cuss and yell and eventually told us to \"get off his bus.\" We all piled off, and the other bus also unloaded.  I know these times are hard, especially for small and locally owned businesses, and by no means and am I trying to make it harder for them; in fact, I am going above and beyond to support them. After yesterday, I do think that they need to take a step back and re-evaluate their actions and really think long and hard about what they do and why they do it. In the end, when providing a service, the client always comes first."

To be honest, the cost seemed a bit high at first but having never been on a wine tour before and I really had no idea. Afterward I realize it was worth every bit of it. Dale picked us up at our BnB along with everyone else on the tour that day and we were off to the first tasting.  He seem to know everyone along the tour and at each place they were very welcoming and grateful to have our group. It really was a fun time and we had the chance to try many different wines that we would not have normally picked.  Lucky for us it was a beautiful day and everything was just perfect. I would definitely recommend this tour to anyone interested in checking out some Texas wines, for a nice weekend getaway, or just to try something different.  It definitely helped that we had a good group of people who were also on the tour that day as well. It was a blast...I just wish we had taken more pictures."

First off, Dale is a pretentious, \"underpaid monkey\" as he likes to be called. He is rude, unprofessional, and has the audacity to 'hate mail' potential clients and I know I'm not the first one because I've seen the reviews! I don't have much else to say but be careful and do your research before spending any money on this place! The owner seems to not have a care in the world if it's not benefitting him. Also, be ready for rude phone calls and emails from Dale if he doesn't get his way. He was hard to get ahold of from the jump, not to mention I live out of town and couldn't wait for days in between responses. After not being able to make it to my appointment because he had failed to get back to me promptly, I proceeded on with my day. The next morning I wake up to the most rude, despicable email I've ever received. Just be careful and read reviews because from what I've read, if you want a beautiful wedding with NICE, FRIENDLY people, this isn't the place. I'll attach one of many emails. STAY AWAY FROM THE HEART OF TEXAS RANCH ALL TOGETHER!!!"

Picked us up at our hotel in Fredericksburg, went to pick up lunch, and then on to first of 4 wineries. She took care of everything. Even loaded up our bottles/goodies in the back of the bus and kept the AC on to keep it all cool.  Christy went above and beyond to keep everything organized, she set up our lunch, picked up our trash, offered to take us anywhere we wanted to go, and she kept us on time to all of our tastings. We bought a bottle of wine at the 3rd winery and drank in the bus on the way to the 4th. Lunch was a boxed lunch bought at local deli (very good). Everything was included. Everything was professional. The bus was large and comfy. Highly recommend this tour company!"

We went to Fat Ass, Six Shooter and Fiesta Vineyards which were a blast and everyone enjoyed the tastings. Our driver Rick was funny and a true gentleman. It was raining that day and he had an umbrella to escort everyone in and out of the tasting rooms so no one got soaked.

                "description": "We paid nearly four hundred dollars and it was a joke. What was supposed to be a winery tour was a tour of places that sold wine. We went to a store in downtown marble falls, an art studio, a grocery store and at the very end an actual winery. This constituted our day.   This is NOT a day of going to wineries in the hill country. Everyone was disappointed on Valentine's day.   The guy who led the tour was nice but they clearly got kickbacks where we went.   When we went to lunch no one got their order and right when we were leaving this sandwich shop the tour guide asked, \"everyone went to the tasting room, right?\" We're talking about a sandwich place being a stop on the wine tour people.   Horribly disappointed. Considering tastings were at most $10 for each of the four \"wineries\" we went to, it was a rip off in value.  The company clearly avoided going to respectable wineries and instead went to dead end places where they could maximize their profit margin.   Avoid at all costs!!"

We originally had 5 ladies who were going on the tour with us and one backed out. We didn't ask for a private tour and John (who I'm guessing is the owner) didn't tell us until we were already at the first location that he would stop the tour until we paid for a fifth person that wasn't there. No wonder he kept pushing cash, it was a complete rip off. It was either go home after that tour paying $125 a person..Or have two more tours while paying for a person who wasn't there. PS it's about $15 for the wine tastings. ($15x3=$45) It was not worth it. On a positive note, Gary at Hanhe Estates winery was amazing. Highly recommend this guy and his wine."

He was 30 minutes late then forgot what the schedule was supposed to be and tried to keep us at the 2nd winery until 30 minutes after we were supposed to be home.

We got to play our own music on the ride from Austin and he picked amazing Texas barbecue for our lunch. Every winery we went to was delicious. I would highly recommend it to anyone!"

Come hungry on your tour because the barbecue lunch provided was spectacular! We were appreciative that Brandon was flexible with our tour schedule and ensured that we had a phenomenal time while on our tour! The tour had a nice mix of small, quaint wineries with an individualized experience, as well as more popular spots with an equally enjoyable guest experience."

                "description": "Brayden and Deb are an amazing duo. Very personable and easy to work with. They aim to exceed your wildest wine tour expectations! The transportation (van) was very clean and well-taken care of. We had the van to ourselves on the couple's tour but it can easily fit a big party!  Booking a couple's wine tour on their website was super easy (and I'm sure it would be for big groups too)! The date availability, cost estimate, and customizability is spot-on. The moment you book, they send you a comprehensive list of wineries and distilleries (!!!) with rankings of the view + wine. They also have great options for add-ons, such as a charcuterie board or stopping by for lunch mid-wine tour. Love that.  There's no doubt I would choose and recommend 830 Elevated again for any future wine excursions in Hill Country. Thanks again, Brayden and Deb :)"

Deb (co-owner and our tour guide) was absolutely AMAZING and she made sure that we had everything we needed!!!  Seriously can't wait to book again next time we are in Fredericksburg and we have already decided it needs to be a yearly trip for us!   They were so informative and helpful with picking out which vineyards would be best for us and answered all of my questions quickly and with helpful details and suggestions!!"

From start to finish everything was so easy and customizable to what we were looking for while planning our annual girls trip. Prices are incomparable with Five Star treatment on a PRIVATE tour. Right after booking we got an email with a list of the area wineries and restaurants that had notes and ratings so we could choose where we wanted to go. This is a private tour so Brayden picked us up right in front of our Airbnb and we were off. We toured four wineries and he kept us on schedule but never rushing us. After the tours we opted for the night service so he dropped us off on Main Street so we could grab dinner, sing some karaoke and when ready to be picked up to end the evening just had to shoot him a text and he was there. We just cannot say enough good things about this company. Do not second guess - book with Brayden and Deb"

They were on time and very accommodating, went as far as going to buy a stool for my friend who has trouble getting up and down the steps to the van. The wineries they took us to were exactly what we asked for. We never felt rushed and they handled everything for us and we never had to lift a finger to do anything. I would 100% recommend them and will definitely be using them again!"

They made the trip so easy, worry-free, and fun! Brayden and Deb were super communicative and gave us a wide variety of wineries to choose from. We ended up going to Baron's Creek, Signor, and Augusta Vin. Deb was our tour guide and took care of absolutely everything and was such a joy to be around. If you are headed to Fredericksburg and wanting to visit the wineries, you won't regret choosing to book through 830 Elevated!!"

                "description": "I came across 830 when our bed and breakfast cancelled our room and wine tour reservation (due to remodeling) a month before our 10 year anniversary trip to Fredericksburg. I believe they were on the city website as a recommended tour, but also Google directed me to them. Either way, I am so glad it happened this way - our experience with 830 was indeed elevated!!! The customized tour that Deb set up with me over the phone was exactly what my husband and I wanted - a distillery, a brewery, and a winery that made you feel like you were in Napa. Without even knowing us, Deb helped picked the perfect places for us to enjoy. Communication up until the tour and the day of the tour was prompt and courteous, always with our best intentions in mind (example: Deb texted us and offered to pick us up even earlier than planned due to the heat at one of the outdoor locations). The drive in between locations was full of great conversation, and we were thankful they provided cold water for us. The van was immaculate and the drive was very comfortable - I didn't know the luxury that a private vs public tour would offer! Deb was so knowledgeable (she's a local, of course!) and so sweet with helping us newbies figure out what to do. Her service went above and beyond, and she made us feel like celebrities. It was an absolute pleasure to work with them - do yourself the best favor and book with them!!"

We were able to customize our winery stops which was not the experience we had previously with a different wine tour company. We spent the day with our group of four instead of getting shuttled around with strangers to fill seats (which I really prefer)! We requested a charcuterie board in the vehicle and Brayden picked it up while we were at one of our stops. We will definitely be back and use 830 Elevated for all of our future trips!"

But the best we could find was a limo driver that would charge us almost what it would for 4 people. Then we found 830 Elevated. They're filling a niche most tour companies aren't by providing an affordable private tour option for couples. They were great. Small, young company. They don't have deep knowledge on wine like veteran companies but they are personable in that they also tour wineries themselves and can share their inputs."

Here's my story-   I booked with this company over a month in advance prior to my trip to Fredericksburg for my fiancé and I's anniversary, as well as his birthday. After booking, the company was very communicative for the first few days. After the first few days, I did not hear a word from them until the week of our trip. I had told them a month in advance which places we wanted to go. The week of, they inform us that Augusta vin is not taking people for reservations. Which was fine, we went ahead with the other vineyard they had suggested. We had booked for a Saturday. That Friday at 3:00AM, they had informed us of a change of driver due to a family emergency which we completely understood, and now that our pickup time had changed to 11:30AM instead of 1:30PM. I wake up to that email Saturday still understanding, and we changed our plans to be at the pickup destination by 11:30AM. We are waiting there over 15 minutes for them to show, and no one does. We call, leave voicemails, and still hear from no one. 30 minutes passed, they send a TEXT MESSAGE informing us they aren't showing up for the entire time and that we are on our own for the entire day. LEAVING OUR PLANS FOR THE ENTIRE DAY RUINED. Incredibly horrid communication from this company. DO NOT BOOK WITH THIS COMPANY!!!! I seriously am understanding that situations happen in life, but they had guaranteed us a driver for the day regardless of what had happened. I was truly heartbroken to have not received a personal phone call from the company, instead they just send us a text that they are not coming. I have NEVER written a review for a company before, but this needed to be shared. We discussed the situation with multiple locals in the town, no one had ever heard of this company. Whatever you do, save your money and time."

You get a card that's tied to your credit card to swipe or tap and then you have access to the wine you swiped for. Then you can get as much or as little as you want. It's a great way to try and explore new wines (and mead and some margarita inspired wines). Then you can load up on your favorite (what I did), or continue exploring. Really, two great options. Also, the guy working there was nice and very helpful. I've been telling people about how much I enjoyed coming here and recommending it.  Don't park in the paid parking next to Wanderlust if you can avoid it because it's stupidly expensive. Use that money on a Lyft or more wine."

Wine on tap is such a great idea.   They give you a card that you use to get your wine. You get charged by the ounce. They do have happy hour. They have a good selection of wines. For those that don't like wine, they have a handful options (margarita, old fashioned)   The place is cute and they have a nice outdoor patio. They had a food truck the day we went.   Con:  - the wine comes out pretty fast, so you have to be careful as it can add up quick. If you want to taste first, be quick at closing it.  - there's no way to figure out how many ounces you are serving yourself."

You could tell they were glad we were new.  They truly have great enthusiasm for their jobs and this business.  A new product even arrived and we were informed we came at a terrific time!   It was so easy to tap my Wanderlust card and release the wine. There's a great variety of wines to choose from, including wines from France, Spain, some sangrias and hard lemonade. Warning: make sure all the taps are closed before you insert your card. I didn't see that one was turned a bit and wine started trickling and money ringing up on my card.  Because it's not very bright, I didn't see the wine flowing. Lesson learned!   There's an interesting room off the patio for private events.  I'm jealous I couldn't pop in!   Happy to see the food truck. Mmm: truffle fries and bruschetta!  You MUST come visit this location!"

Came here during happy hour last weekend with some friends and was overall impressed with the wine tasting here. There whole gimmick is you you can try any of the wines on the wall tap and your charged by the ounces you drink. I will warn you use a light touch on the taps as I learned the hard way the first try. Most of the wines were half off during happy hour which makes for a great deal and I also liked that there was a range of wines from across the globe and wasn't specific to one region. They also had patio seating an Italian food truck in case you get hungry. The only downside like most places downtown is the parking but I heard that's less of an issue at their east side location which I'm excited to try next!"

                "description": "I love a serve yourself wine bar! Wanderlust charges by the ounce and although it adds up pretty quickly, if you're able to pace yourself, you can have a whole evening of fun. I got out of there spending well under $50 for two people, so we really didn't go all that crazy.  Try a million different wines and mixed drinks! they give you a card at the entrance and it just rings up your total, then they charge you on the way out. We had an issue with a bunch of cork settling into one of our glasses and they were able to remove that pour from our tab. The only thing is that it's hard to keep track of your favorite pours because there are so many options.  There is also a ton of space to sit. They have inside seating/lounge tables, there is outdoor seating and there's also an additional event space which you can sit in. We sat in the event space with a large group and it was so comfy. I would love to return!"

The downtown location is the perfect spot to hit up if you're transitioning your night from the east side to hanging out downtown. If you haven't been to the new Eastside location, it is seriously one of the coolest buildings in Austin. There is so much local art there!"

I also really like their cocktails on tap, especially the lemonade seltzer that they have. Every time I have come in, Blake has always provided excellent customer service and understanding of the wine offerings. Overall, I will be back many more times to this place for their superb wine and service!  2 pro tips: Come in on Wednesdays for half off and make sure to try heal of the boot food truck."

                "description": "I love the wine on tap concept and enjoyed choosing between all of the different wines at Wanderlust! When you walk in, they give you a separate card that you swipe before each one of your pours. I liked it because you could pour as much or as little as you wanted and it gave you the opportunity to try different wines without being committed to a full glass. Honestly, it reminded me of those self-serve frozen yogurt places. I also really liked the outdoor area - it was a great place to hang out with friends and we had a great time taking photos at the photo booth.  The only downside was that it was more expensive than I was expecting. They give you the price per ounce on the screen, but once you start pouring, it adds up VERY quickly. I could have spent the same amount of money on a way nicer and fuller glass of wine.  Overall, I enjoyed the concept and fun vibes. Would love to come back during their happy hour or something when things are half-priced!"

                "description": "\"Froyo for wine\"; Fun idea, smooth process, nice spot, bit pricey.   It's a charge by oz place, like Froyo with all of the taps requiring an RFID card that you get by associating with a credit card at the front desk. Place the card on the reader and pour what you want into your glass. They have over 50 different styles, including mead, white, red, dry/sweet, and some wine-based cocktail style drinks.  They typically range from $1-3+ per oz so you'll probably come out with a $5-10 glass (4 oz) which is pretty comparable to most places.  There is both indoor and outdoor seating; interior is mostly couch seating and outdoor is patio/bench with faux grass. You can also bring dogs. The outdoor is a bit noisy, especially since it backs to another bar and is right under 35 so it was nicer indoors than out.  I don't usually drink wine because it gives me headaches and I certainly felt it the next day even after just 2 small glasses; possibly because of tasting so many different kind, so beware! Nice for trying something new but possible to get sick if you're mixing so much."

                "description": "Stopped into this downtown location after already visiting the location on Shady ln earlier in the week. I definitely enjoyed both locations for different reasons. I appreciate the way the wines are labeled in clear groupings so it's easier to just walk up and find what I'm wanting more quickly. They also have an Italian food truck in the back patio area. The truffle Parmesan fries were great and the pasta dish was a good portion. Lots of cute photo ops and decent areas of seating. I will say this location is much smaller and literally off the busy highway but still the experience they offer is worth checking out."

When you come in you get a card with your name on it that unlocks the tap. As you fill your glass it shows you how many ounces and the cost in real time. I loved this idea because I got to try many wines before committing. You're allowed as many glasses as you want at a time so I recommend doing a flight! There's indoor and outdoor seating with a food truck out back. I signed up for their rewards program and will definitely be back!"

Red blends, dry white blends, bubbly, mead, etc. You name it, they have it!  When you arrive they swipe your card and give you another card, something like a hotel key card. You use this key card and swipe it before each self serve wine glass pour. The screen next to the tap will show you how many ounces you've filled up your glass and how much for the whole glass. The screen also shows how much each ounce of wine costs. Maybe I'm getting old and outdated but this was some cool technology! Probably the coolest, unique payment system I've ever seen!   There is a food truck on site with some seriously good pasta and appetizer types.   I can't speak to the parking situation since I walked from my location but I do believe there was a small parking lot."

The fun part is you get to see how much you are spend at the same time! The funny part is if you're focusing on your glass pour (just to get it just right) you might look up after a while and notice your tab is $$$ after many many \"maybe just a little\" drinks. I love everything about this small space as well. It is very cozy and perfect for a girls night or a date night. We will 100% be back."

It really does not look like much from the outside but my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try based on the reviews and we were not disappointed! We easily made a reservation on the website and came in at 2pm on a Saturday. They took out temperatures at the door and we were seated quickly.   We decided to go for the wine tasting first, 5 samples for $15 plus a stemless logo glass to take home! We really enjoyed trying the wines and enjoyed all of them. Our favorite was the Blanc du Bois because it was light and crisp but had a unique fragrant flavor from the floral notes and the apricot.   My only gripe was the reservation was only 45 minutes. I wish it could've been around an hour, we didn't get a chance to finish our wine or our charcuterie but it's not too big of a deal since we just took it back home. We also got another bottle of the Blanc du Bois to take home and they gave us a cute wine bag for the two bottles.   We will definitely be back again to try the rest of the wines!!"

                "description": "What a wonderful discovery on a lazy pre-Xmas Sat afternoon. Who would have thought you could find a boutique winery that rivals any that I've visited in Sonoma.   Do not despair as you pull into the generic industrial park hard off of Anderson Mill Road in the CP. Walk-in past the small lobby area and step into their beautifully decorated tasting room.  Since we were the only patrons we received VIP treatment from start to finish.   We opted for their premium tasting menu and selected all reds. I'm not a TX wine fan but Dylan, our sommelier, expertly guided us through our tasting and as we concluded our wonderful stay my mind was changed.   My favorite was the Alexandar Valley Cab will more than suffice if you enjoy a big traditional Cab with a strong finish.   Their Spanish Mourvedre version is deep and rich and has a surprisingly strong finish,   There are a number of \"light\" reds as well. We were not fans but appreciated the flavor and balance of these wines.   Bent Oak does offer cheese plates and other small plates to accompany your tasting. Check their social media as they have live music on certain days.   Wonderful wine, an intimate setting, and passionate knowledgeable folks equals a 5 star experience."

                "description": "This was a real treat.  We looked for winery that was open before 4pm. We were staying in San Antonio and wanted to visit Austin TX. We found this place by searching best wineries near Austin. When we 1st arrived, it looked like a little store front in a strip mall. When we entered it was a whole different story. We were greeted by Debbie and Bryan who both turned out to be extremely gracious hosts.  They have wines grown in TX and CA. The TX grapes are grown in the High Plaines near New Mexico where it is warm during the day and cooler at night. I decided to do a tasting with only the TX wines.   The TX wine menu had 5 wines for the tasting menu. Started with the Chenon Blanc (quite nice with a buttery smoothness), proceeded to the Blanc de Bois, then the Roussanne (my least favorite), then switching to the reds starting with the Sangiovese and finally to the tempranillo.  The Tempranillo was my absolute favorite.    What really made this experience so nice was the wine Ambassador Debbie. She is just the nicest person who took good care of us. She also has a very nice sense of humor. Bryan was also very nice. He helped me pick out a few stainless steel wine stoppers. Bryan gave us great restaurant suggestions for Austin and San Antonio.  Do not be fooled with the entrance on the outside. It is misleading in the size and the value you receive on the inside."

Took two of my really good friends here today both who require wheelchair accessibility and felt very comfortable in the atmosphere. The reservation made ahead time was set up easily and the communication was quick and efficient through email. They were able to recommend a table that was best suited for us all to feel comfortable. It is very rare to actually be able to talk to the owners/wine makers about their products but they were the ones serving us the tasting! It really was a special experience not only for me but for my friends that have not gone out socially since the pandemic. Thank y'all so much for the inclusive atmosphere and making it such a memorable experience, we had a blast!"

After a quick yelp search, we saw there was a winery up the street and open late. We decided to take a trip and check it out.  Driving up, you start to question if you are going the right direction but just keep going.   You walk in to this office center and are welcomed to the most friendly staff and environment.  Rarely do you get to sit down at a winery and speak to the head wine maker.   What really makes this place different is the fact that they have California and Texas wines. I'm no expert, but I've been told Texas grapes just don't compare.    The prices are great, and the options are plenty.  This will definitely be the family visit spot in the future."

Didn't even look at pricing because of what the snacks cost.  Snacks: wow, expensive. Tried a bunch of them with a group, overall not worth the price. Particularly the truffles. It was $27 for a teensy box of 9 pieces of terrible chocolate. Waxy texture, did not melt when you eat it, chalky, bad flavor. Dark chocolate is my fave, so that's not the issue. Who knew chocolate could actually be yucky? It came from next door, glad we didn't go there after.   Service: very good, sweet ladies.  Ambience: not good. Outside it just looks like a store front, inside is super dark, no windows, and looks like a Kirkland's from the 90s.... everything is red, has fringe, pretty cheesy. Not eclectic, just ugly and full of stuff."

                "description": "Living in Austin, this winery is located in our backyard. It's nice to be able to drive just 20 minutes and enjoy a good glass of wine, and meet the people who made it. I now have a place for out of town guests just spending the weekend to take a sip of Texas wine.  They focus on creating quality wines sourced from Texas and California grapes.  They do not blend grapes sourced from the two states together.  When you drink a bottle of Texas sourced wine, it is 100% Texas, and vice versa. Bent Oak has been around for about 3 1/2 years, and from what I have heard they are starting to find their stride.   When you enter the space, you will walk through the front gift shop to the back tasting room and production area.  They have gone to amazing strides to make a warehouse space homey. It feels like a Texas hill country family home.  We were warmly welcomed, and they even let us take our three well behaved dogs into the back area to sit and enjoy a tasting with us.  Everyone here was friendly and knowledgeable.    I was pleasantly surprised by the consistent quality of all their wines available to taste.  You can taste up to five wines from their menu.  The Blanc Du Bois was one of my stand out favorites.  There wasn't anything I didn't like on the menu.  I am not a fan of Chardonnay's but their California sourced Chardonnay was good.  Their reds were a bit young, but the Mourvedre from the Texas High plains was tasty and my favorite of the current options.  Medium bodied but with spicy fruity rich tones.  The Sangiovese was satiny smooth, but just needed some time.  I actually enjoyed their Texas wines more than the California options.    Clearly there is a reason why their wine club membership has a waitlist.  It's just a great group of people to hang out with.  It felt like being with family, and enjoying a great conversation over a nice glass of wine.  They are located next to Delysia chocolates towards the back of a warehouse area.  Wine and chocolate neighbors?  Yep, it's an amazing pairing."

We finally mustered the courage to go have a look inside this warehouse looking building.  What an incredible surprise!  We were warmly greeted and led into the tasting room where our eyes grew wide with wonder.  Themed tables, lounging areas, decor and a scuttle of people enjoying some of the most spectacular wine ever!    Everyone in there was so nice and the server we had was very knowledgeable.  My daughter promptly made sure everyone knew I was celebrating the 20th anniversary of my 30th birthday!  Our wine expert quickly informed the wine maker \"John\" and he came over to wish me a happy birthday and give me a taste of a special \"not on the menu\" wine.  All I can say is every single wine we sampled (8 in total) was superb!  I walked out after buying 4 bottles and was extremely happy!"

Unfortunately, they do not allow dogs inside. As a dog owner who lives in the brewery district, this establishment is simply off my list anytime I go out with my little gal.   I do love this place but it's hard to give a perfect score to a place I can't frequent. Especially when they have ~10 competitors in a 5 minute radius and none of them share the same policy. As a result, I am updating my review from 5 to 4 stars."

I only discovered this place after the pandemic it started so I've never really spent time inside.

The neat thing is that they have artwork that's for sale on the walls. The art adds character and is a large variety of different themes all from local artists.   No good is served inside the brewery but there is a really good food truck on the outside.   The beers are amazing and you can sample before you buy.  Liked this brewery and beers are very creative."

They have a Nintendo Wii with Mario kart and two old-school arcade games they also have a Foos ball table and darts.

They have an outdoors area that's shaded for those with doggos or who want to enjoy the heat and eat from their food truck. I had the Triple B, which was surprisingly crisp and floral for a belgian. They had a variety of beers which I wanted to taste, but we arrived late with one hour to spare before closing. That just means I need to pay another visit to truly enjoy the place.  They have a private parking area shared with neighboring businesses and strong wifi. The best part is the indoors games like 4-player Mario Kart (WHAT!), darts, and a bunch of board games. They also give free stickers, plus our lady taptender that day was so kind and welcoming."

However I checked out their site, saw they had some wine options and a food truck--so I happily tagged along. The bartender who greeted us gave us the rundown of everything. Served us with a smile and was very informative about the beers, of course. I had a great bottle of pinot grigio while my friends enjoyed the various beers available. I had a great time checking out the art that they have on the walls for sale. We also played a game of jumbo sized connect four and Mario Kart on the big screen. A large collection of board games are also available to borrow while hanging out enjoying your drink in the taproom. Very cool place, warm vibes. Great food truck on site as well.  Definitely will return soon and bring my beer drinking friends."

They also have great food truck options during Taproom hours.    $14 for 6 half pours and a free pint glass is a pretty amazing deal, especially due to the quality and content of the beer.  If you're into light, crisper beers, try the Naked Nun or the Philosophizer.  If you like the darker stuff, the Black Rhino is your friend.  They also have some great sours!"

                "description": "Three words: Belgium style brews! Oh my goodness, where have you been hiding from me Adelbert's?! This is by far one of my most favorite craft breweries in all of Austin, if not in the United States. For those of you that really know me, you know that I L.O.V.E. Belgian beers...so much so that, yes, I traveled to Belgium JUST for the beers (okay, I ate some mussels and saw some pretty cool stuff too, but...). For those of you not in the know (no insult meant for those who are), Belgian style beers are pretty high in ABV, so amateurs enter gently. Just looking out for my Yeeps! :D  Adelbert's doesn't look like much at all from the outside. Tucked away in a warehouse district, it can a tad difficult to find, particularly at night - just look for the little white lights and the picnic tables outside. Park, walk through the plastic flat \"doors\" and you will discover a beautiful huge space with stacks and stacks of barrels, merchandise for sale, lots of local art hanging on the walls to purchase adds to the ambiance; plus games to play such as giant Jenga, foosball, and darts and that's one fine outing.   But the beer! Oh my gosh - the beer. Handcrafted at its best. So amazingly fantastic and such a great deal. On your first visit be certain to buy the 6 half pour (really close to full pours - yay) tastings for $13. You get to keep the glass and get $2 off beers when you bring it back on your next visit. Regular prices range from $4-6 a glass, which is phenominal in the first place for such high quality ale.   ALL great, two personal standouts for me were: *Flyin' Monks Quadrupel: 10.9%ABV, aged in rum barrels with hints of spice, deep, dark, and lovely. *Philosophizer Saison: An easy choice. 7.8% ABV, very mild carbonation with a hint of pepper. Fantastic.     To add some icing to this already oh so sweet find, the founder and brewmaster Scott and staff cannot be any more friendly or knowledgeable about the beers and brewery.   Highly highly highly recommend. Simply doesn't get better than this IMHO. Cheers!  TIPS:  *The brewery has a license so you can take a large bottle home for a reasonable price of about $9 to $12, which is average. They also sell retail at area Austin locations (visit their website for exact locations).  *Tours are available (see website for details).   *They typically have a food truck on site on Saturdays.  *Fido friendly pergola area - not allowed inside."

                "description": "Ya'll are probably already aware of my latest and greatest obsession with collecting pint glasses from assorted breweries. For our first stop in Austin, we stopped by this unassuming warehouse. As we walked in, the live jazz band was jammin' and the beer taps were flowin'.   Michael and his bearded friend were fantastic bartenders. I really appreciated their hospitality. Michael instantly could tell I was new to this particular brewery and proceeded to explain the process to tasting their beer samples. He even noted that I had a minor with me and offered a brewed hibiscus tea for him. They really cater to all ages! We paid $13 for six half poured samples from a souvenir Belgian tasting glass. One yellow wristband later, my siblings and I were playing ping-pong and giant Jenga in the back of the warehouse.  The stringed lights on the ceiling made it feel welcome and homey. They had a wall of local art for sale ranging from $30-$300! I had my eye on a Sinatra painting, and as luck would have it, it was indeed the $300 piece lol. I stared at it longingly for most of the night, but couldn't bring myself to throw down on it. My favorite craft brews of the night were the Naked Nun and the Philosophizer. Brilliant names and great hoppy flavors.  Once it got too muggy in the taproom, we ventured out to get some grub. The food truck of the night was Emoji Grilled Cheese. (See their yelp site for my review) It was mouthwatering and delicious. We visited a couple other breweries throughout our trip, but Adelbert's was my all-time favorite.   Thanks for a great time!   -xoxoxo"

They had a two ban band which was perfect for the setting! Great outside seating!!! We got their at 3 and stayed for a few hours because of how it was nested in the hills with plenty of trees and shade.   Great place for a date, family, kids, dogs or a glass of wine for the day. We will be coming back and hopefully have traditional Argentine bbq next time.   Suggestion: serve espresso and/or coffee"

The wines are tasty and the winery has some great indoor and outdoor seating with fantastic views, way up on a hill. Definitely go check them out!  I've also reached out to the management to see if I can get wines shipped back to my home state of Georgia!!!"

                "description": "When we first arrived here, it was a bit confusing on where we were allowed to park as there were to signs indicating a designated place for cars - we ended up just driving all the way up the hill and parking alongside the roundabout next to the entrance of the winery cabin.   We had a reservation for right when they opened, and luckily so - it became extremely busy later on in our visit, so be mindful if you're planning on coming here that it's popular!   Staff is extremely friendly and attentive - they accommodated our group and let us even switch some tables around since we were the first there.   El Gaucho has a smaller wine list than other wineries I've been to, but they also had a food menu that was unique to others.   Provoleta ($12.50, +prosciutto $2.00): Comes out on a hot skillet plate with some slices of bread on the side. Really flavorful in provolone, obviously, but the chimichurri gives a nice addition to the dish. Felt like the addition of prosciutto wasn't worth, however.   Empanadas (2pc - $12.50): They have an option between beef empanadas, or a black bean and plantain empanada. I tried both and they were delicious in their own ways. Some people may stray away from the non-meat option, but I quite liked it! I believe they served this with the same chimichurri that was on top of the Provoleta.   Light Flight  1. Chardonnay: Their description is 100% correct, if you don't prefer Chardonnay, you might change your mind after trying this! Super light and refreshing, really easy finish. 2. Chardonnay Reserve: Huge jump from the Chardonnay - seemed to taste more full.  3. Malbec Rose: Really great end to tie the first two together, the sweetness is subtle but still noticeable.  They have a lovely outdoor courtyard/backyard patio where more seating is available, but unfortunately the day we went, it had just rained meaning most chairs were wet. I would highly recommend trying to come on a sunny day as I think it'd be beautiful!"

Honestly, I wouldn't spend the money on it, nor ever come here  again. There was only one lady working and no one helped us out at all.  They were originally going to set up something \"special\" since it was our honeymoon and it was not special at all. They were charging us $175 for literally a bottle of cheap champagne and a bowl of crackers and cheese. For what we paid for and what we got I don't recommend it at all."

With out-of-town guests, no rain date, florals, and catering coming hell or high water, we had to roll with it.  I can't say enough good things about the team and how we worked together over a couple of weeks.  Everything from planning to last-minute setup changes (from the outdoor patio to the covered patio) and serving exceeded my expectations. Their willingness to do whatever they could to make our rainy day 25 person event a success and smile while they were doing it was phenomenal and refreshing. Our guests had a good time and loved the wine!"

This is the type of place that a group could enjoy, a wine beginner wouldn't find intimidating, and a wine snob could also find something to please their pallet. Good selection of all types, but not intimidating.  THE STAFF ARE ALL SO FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL! I was given a few suggestions from the owner, and they were all so spot on, I loved every one I tried.   Love the clean but welcoming decor, and how everything feels approachable and interactive (Glasses for sale, books, etc) and there's even some outdoor seating for those feeling a fire pit (if memory serves correctly, but the night I was here, the rain kept everyone inside).   Bring some girls, a group, or just stop by on your way home for a friendly wine bar with the coziness that makes you want to curl up and order an entire bottle and chat with folks."

It is obvious that this area needs something like this.  As a woman owned business, I am happy to see it thrive.  Deep into Steiner Ranch, I am not sure people who live outside of the area would be seeking it out but worth the trip if you are into wine and want to check out the space.  Could be a good place for a celebration.  Steiner probably has enough people to support.  Rose, white, red, bubbles and brews.  Cheese plates.  You can buy bottles to take with you with various mustards, jams, etc in their pantry. Glad I got to experience this location and wish them all the luck moving forward."

I appreciate that the wine list is ever changing and that the employees all do an amazing job with recommendations and descriptions. There is also a pretty large price range so you're able to choose a glass based on how much you'd like to spend, which is great for their range of customers. Now about the decor/atmosphere: I'd like to have my home designed to look similar to S+P. It's fun and new and modern but elegant and sophisticated at the same time. I wouldn't change a thing!   My favorite time to go is on a chilly evening. I love to be curled up by the fire on the patio with blankets (provided by S+P) and a big glass of cab with live music playing in the background. Come on! That's heaven!   Do yourself a favor and follow them on Facebook. They host great events, my favorite being Sip In SWEATS. You will not be disappointed!"

Also, there was a kid camp going on and children threw water guns at our table while we dined as well as crawled around by our table. Not the experience we'd hoped for. Our server ghosted during our meal and left us waiting over 30 minutes to pay so we could leave. Wanted to love this place, as it is a beautiful property with so much potential. With a few tweaks, it could be so much more."

Everyone is exceptionally helpful, they have a very comfortable tasting room, but I felt the tasting was way overpriced, so I decided to just buy a bottle of the Fall Creek Vineyards Tempranillo to drink while the rest of the group had their tasting.   They have an impressive operation and make some wonderful wines, definitely worth the stop. Cheers!"

                "description": "TLDR: relaxing atmosphere with nice white wines. Good on the spectrum of Texas wines but not on the level of French or Napa wines.  This is a great spot right across the street from salt lick. Parking lot is gravel but there's plenty of parking available. Hostess was extremely friendly and great conversation.  The wines themselves are good- we especially loved the Chardonnay and reserve wines. Based on Texas wineries, I have to say this is hands down one of the better vineyards. That being said, I have a deep love for Russian river valley wines (especially green valley pinots and Chardonnay's) and Texas grapes just don't measure up. Is that an unfair comparison? Probably.  Overall highly recommend visiting and supporting local. You'll want this on your wine tasting list of stops for sure, and best of all it's fairly close to Austin."

                "description": "Fall Creek Vineyards totally exceeded our expectations! We have been super strict about staying home during COVID-19, but my #1 birthday wish was to get out ... in a safe way. With young children. My husband called Fall Creek ahead of time and was told that kids were allowed and that there was plenty of outdoor space.   We arrived around 2pm on a Wednesday afternoon and were greeted by a super friendly and knowledgeable gentleman. I wish I had grabbed his name, because he was seriously amazing. He let us know that a food purchase was required to be served on premise, which was not a problem at all because everything looked delicious (we chose a cheese platter), and gave us a wine menu as well.   We selected our own seats and were able to stay away from the party that came in after us. Our sommelier was so knowledgeable and provided everything in a COVID-19 safe way. He was also super sweet to our kids, even though our three year old was crushing crackers on the table (we cleaned up after him before we left but it was still so embarrassing).   All of the wines were delicious. We ended up leaving with their Tempranillo, their Sauvignon-blanc (vintners-selection) and two souvenir glasses.   We spent about an hour at Fall Creek, which ended up being the total highlight of my birthday, but could have spent more time there exploring their beautiful grounds  had we not had a dinner reservation."

From the quite good inexpensive wines to award-winning bottles for people who really know their reds. I am a fan of their Tempranillo.  If you are in Austin, it's worth a visit!"

My mom's in town so I wanted to take her to a winery semi-close to Austin but not too far away. ENTER: Fall Creek. It's been recommended to me by several friends so figured I'd check it out for myself:  PROS: Seriously the nicest staff in the world. Thank you Daniel! Plenty of socially distanced tables and chairs in LOTS of different areas of the winery A bottle of their amazing Sauvignon Blanc - $22! Great snacks to accompany (I got Pimento cheese) They had live music on a Saturday with a full band. swoon! Across the street from Salt Lick if you want foods  CONS: Seriously none. Couldn't have asked for a more perfect day. Can't wait to visit again!   Pro tip: go to Desert Door nearby for more fun. :)"

As a personal recommendation, if you're trying to social distance, I would suggest visiting here only during the weekdays when it's less busy, otherwise it may seem too crowded since the place is on the smaller side.  The food menu mainly consists of cheese and snacks that go well with wine but it's a little overpriced. The staff was nice but they were just there for the most part, nothing more to enhance our experience.   3/5 staff/service 4/5 nicely decorated interior and exterior 5/5 with the right company"

We opted for two full glasses of their most standout wines and although it was much more expensive wine than I'm used to, we did get a generous pour. The backyard terrace is peaceful and has many seating options. I would've loved to see an option where you could do a wine tasting outdoors, perhaps the same way you order a beer flight. I saw this because wine tastings are only offered inside."

Our 2nd stop was Falls Creek....it was so pretty with perfect sunny weather and enough seating inside and out. Covid is still among us so they offer hand santizers but you bring your own mask. Most patrons didn't have on of course once they had their wine in hand.   We opted to sit outdoors. Tables are 3-4 ft apart in some spots so choose within your comfort zone for social distancing. We grabbed a quick glass of wine and made our way to the next stop.   Looking forward to returning with the hubby this summer."

                "description": "Went to Fall Creek for a wine tasting prior to dinner at Salt Lick.  We were seated in the indoor patio which was extremely warm.  No water was offered.  We requested the tasting - 5 wines that are pre-selected, you aren't able to choose.  After the second (extremely small) pour, we had to request water.  Decided to order a couple of apps for the group..we were brought store made hummus and pimento cheese - still in the plastic container, propped on a plate with a wrapped package of crackers.  Had to request small plates, which seemed to surprise our server.  By the end of the tasting we were all sweating as the sun was beating down on us and there seemed to be no AC. The wines were okay, but the experience and service could have been much better.  I wouldn't return."

                "description": "Wine tasting was $20 for 5 small pours.  Can't select wines to try, only had 5 bottles open and only one was what I would have wanted.  Food prices were also high.  Place was fairly full but I don't know why.  Wines we tasted were fair at best.  Too many good one in the area to waste your time here."

The wine picked by my group was light , refreshing and the perfect compliment to have after we had made a lunch stop at a brisket place. We had been feeling stuffed but this wine was so light and enjoyable to help digest our food while we enjoyed their peaceful tranquil outdoor seating area near a cute little pond. We also took advantage of their photo opportunity landscapes."

                "description": "I've had my fair share of vineyards from local like Grape Creek in Fredericksburg then to Castello di Amorosa in Napa Valley. I was embarrassed after taking my family to experience the wine tasting here. Although, some of the wine were fairly tasty, but the serving was small compared to the vineyards I mentioned in the beginning. I had never been to a wine tasting with a pour stopper that was new to me. Mind you they charge $20 per person for wine tasting. We were observing a table near us that was getting extra pour from the pour stopper technique. We decided to order 2 cheese plates ($25/plate) that came in this container after we finished it, which was a small portion by the way. We noticed that the container said \"Best By: 2/12\" we visited 2/13. So we alerted our server she politely checked with the back she was told that it meant Arrived By, which to me was odd. If it was \"Arrived By\" I think that's what they would've put on the container but I guess just to shut us up.  As to COVID capacity the patio was full we couldn't wait to leave. This is my family and I's experience I wish it could've been better."

He was very unwelcoming. We had to ask him questions he just didn't give us any information about the winery at all or the wine club. Must have been a bad friday for him.   I passed on getting a flight b/c of the wine guy. I got a glass of a red blend to go so I could shop around the square. The wine was fantastic. I was going to buy a bottle but found another place on the other side of the square."

                "description": "Barons Creek was our first stop on a planned wine tasting adventure around the square. We were greeted by our sommelier Tom, seated, and the tasting process explained. Tom provided a charming mixture of highbrow wine knowledge and light humor as he took us through our tasting journey of 5 red wines. The wife liked all of the wines, and I liked all but one (a tempranillo). Never fear! Tom is here! Tom saved the day (and the Tres Primos reputation) by pouring us an extra taste, but instructing us to first chew a chocolate-covered coffee bean before pouring the wine across that bean in our mouths. This somehow transformed the flavour into something amazingly pleasing for us both!  We also ordered chicken empanadas, which were surprisingly delicious! For some reason we did not expect such flavor and complexity from a wine bar's kitchen. The empanada crust was crispy and flaky, with a filling of chopped chicken, onions and seasonings that burst into the mouth with each bite. This was no Tex-Mex kitchen empanada. Hats off Barons! Hats off!"

They said they were open but neglected to tell us that their services were limited without reservations because of it being Valentine's weekend. We are new wine club members and felt like we were treated very rudely when we arrived. We loved our experience at Barons in Fredericksburg but would not recommend the Georgetown location. Our plan was to buy a case of the Boots wine but after they way were treated, we left our Boots behind."

Barons had more of an uppity vibe to it, so maybe I wasn't picking up what they were putting down from the jump as I tend gravitate toward a more casual atmosphere... especially when it comes to wine tasting.   They were nice and helpful here and poured us a cup of Tempranillo and Crazy Train on our way out, to drink while we walked around the square. Both good wines but did not justify the price tag for us."

                "description": "My daughter gave me the gift of her time, along with a 3-course meal and wine tasting, to honor a special occasion. We decided to make this a weekday outing, to minimize traffic and the possibility of large groups being at the winery.  We were promptly greeted and seated upon arrival. The dining room was largely empty, and we had superb service. This was our second visit to the winery, and we plan to return.   We tasted 7 wines in all, 3 of which were paired with the November menu of panzanella (a bread salad), fennel-crusted pork tenderloin, and cannoli. The wine pairings were excellent.   We were not big fans of the panzanella. It seemed to need additional ingredients to make it more interesting and less dry. The main course, however, was fabulous. The pork medallions were crusty and flavorful. The linguine accompaniment was wonderfully garlicky, making it almost possible to ignore that the pasta was overcooked. And the cannoli was excellent. I think of cannoli as a finger food; these mini cannoli were made pretty with their presentation but more messy to eat because of the chocolate sauce. The cannoli were served with a very good port wine.   All in all, we had a very nice meal and enjoyed the wines... which we drank. No spitting for us! We are not connoisseurs, but certainly enjoy good quality wine. Some of Flat Creek's are very good indeed.   This was not a cheap excursion, but the 2 hours we spent there were worth it. This would be a great place for a romantic date, and also worked well as a mother-daughter excursion. Flat Creek has other dining options that include pizza, and there's a disc golf course on the premises. Do make advance reservations for your visit, as this isn't a large establishment and can be a long (but pretty) drive from the Austin area."

In addition your apology seems very condescending and not genuine at all.  How do you know that what we were envisioning? We just wanted to have a nice time with our grands, and we were talked down to, and you're still talking down to us...."

I really liked how Our host gave each different wines that fit us, therefore we weren't all forced to test the same stuff. We also got the opportunity to step outside and watch the sunset. Would definitely go back."

My girlfriend and I made our first trip to Marble falls this past weekend and are very happy to say we started the weekend off here at Flat Creek Estate.   We enjoyed the \"Chef's 3 course experience\" which was one of the best dining experiences we've ever had! 6 glasses of wine and a 3 course meal that took us on a  flavorful journey. At one point we felt like Remy in that scene from Ratatouille, the one where he pairs the strawberry with some cheese and feels fireworks... yes, it was really that good!  Carmen was a priceless part of the already amazing experience, she was so friendly, enthusiastic and helpful! Ask for her to be your server if you can!  We can't wait to come back to marble falls and visit here again, looking forward to next seasons wines and Chef's 3-course! Thank you guys!"

                "description": "It hurts me to write this review. We truly want every small business to thrive. My family and I went to the Vineyard on a Friday afternoon for an intimate celebration of my husband's birthday with our mom, dad and children, it ended in my 5-year old little one being verbally attacked by a man in the pavilion, who identified himself as 'the owner'.   We decided to try the disc golf course, and we loved our experience with Casey, he is a gem! Very knowledgeable about disc golf, and very accommodating. We let him and Madelyn (the owner's wife) know we were celebrating a birthday. The course was fun, but ridden with fire ants, red ants, sticker burs and bull nettle. It was not the polished experience we were expecting. But still fun for our family.   We finished disc golf, and returned to the pavilion around 6:00pm.  We ordered a large dinner, but since we were not offered to sit in the main seating area, we sat under the outdoor pavilion. We were in the pavilion for less than 5 minutes, and the adults arranged tables so our family could sit together (there is no waiter in the pavilion so we had to move tables on our own). During those few minutes my two small children were playing under the pavilion, not causing any harm or damage, just laughing and trotting around like kids do outside (he is 5 and she is 7).   Out of no where a man started verbally attacking my 5-year old. This man who looked to be in his 70s, was sitting at a table drinking bottles of wine with 2 other people. He continued to yell at the top of his lungs scaring me and my babies. They came running to me asking me why the man was yelling and whistling at them. It broke my heart. A complete stranger was attacking them for no apparent reason.   After protecting them, my dad and husband approached the man who was yelling the obscenities. This is when he identified himself as 'the owner'. He told us our children were 'out of control' and we needed to get them under control. I asked them what they were doing to display out of control behavior, and he didn't say a thing, besides he had guests with him and they were disrupting his evening. My father let the man know if we were going to be patrons of his business, we would not tolerate his verbal abuse of our 5 and 7 year old children. My father also told him, \"We don't yell at our kids like that and if he had a problem with the way our children were behaving he could have stood up and walked over while we were arranging our own tables and told us in a normal tone of voice the problem he saw.\"  After the incident, the man sat at his table continuing to drink wine for 45 minutes, and sadly never came back to our table to apologize to our children for scaring them because of his obscene behavior. As we left, both of my children continued to asked why he was so angry.   We now understand this pavilion is in 'the owners' front yard. On this evening Rick (the owner) had been drinking with friends and our family was interrupting their evening. His behavior not only made us feel the most unwelcome as paying customers, but was abusive and completely out of control, especially as 'the owner'.  We should have been able to have this conversation with the business owner. Unfortunately, he left the pavilion to go back to his house, and did not return or offer an apology.  ***Update in Response to Owners Apology Below***  Your apology ends with 'resolve any confusion or fears the children had regarding why they were reprimanded'. The main point of why this experience was so horrifying: No one should ever reprimand a 5-year old child, except that child's guardians. If there was an issue with a child's safety, that concern should have been directed to the guardians who were standing between the children and the owner. Never should a stranger, much less a 70-year old man who is consuming alcohol ever 'reprimand' a child, ever! Of course of case the outcome was severe harm to the child, in this case, our 5-year old was not in severe danger.  Regarding the excuse that you 'witnessed dangerous behavior, and you had to immediately intervene': If there are components of your business that are dangerous to patrons, you should immediately remove these hazards, so that they don't become a safety issue. If you feel your deck boxes are not safe, you should store them in a storage facility where patrons do not have access.   Regarding your comment that 'you wish to leave discipling to parents but are forced to intervene when there is a safety concern': We were a party of 4 adults, and we were less than 10 feet away from our children. While we were bussing our own tables and arranging furniture, we were not aware my 5- year old sat on the 'deck box' and got down by jumping off. This type of 'danger' (i.e. sitting on a sitting area, and jumping off something that is no more than 2 feet off the ground) should not elicit the response of 'discipline' by a stranger, or 'immediate' intervention."

We started with wine tasting followed by a spectacular wine pairing with each course. We hadn't really considered Texas wine as equivalent to Calif wines but we were wrong. All of the wines we sampled were great and because of that we ended up heading home with 14 bottles! The owner even stopped by to ask us about our experience which we gladly shared. Definitely worth experiencing this adventure."

The inside seating was small and very loud so we chose to sit outside.  There was only one guy taking orders.  He was very nice and tried his best.  But, he needed help. My husband and I each chose wine tasting (we got 4 samples, but we didn't get to choose what we wanted to try), a glass of wine, and a pizza. We got our wine tasting and glass of wine immediately. We waited about 45 minutes before we got our pizza.  The pizza was delicious, but our wine was already gone.  Probably will not go back."

Beautiful location and building. Plenty of parking.   Inside tables by reservation only. Nicely separated, no issues being close to other guests. Not the same for reception or table service.  Server was pleasant, but had zero concept of social distancing, no mask and was right in our faces each time we had an interaction.   Menu/tasting a little confusing. Basically you prepay $40 each and get whatever you want from the menu, including wine to drink there or to go. Most wines were available for tasting pours, but not all. Some wines good, some not so much. Liked the primitivo the most of the many we tried.   Very nice for the setting and service. Great set up for limited capacity, but they really need to work on wait staff protection."

During a weekend getaway to the Marble Fallas area from Dallas, we planned a day of wineries in Hill Country and Flat Creek was at the top of our list based on recommendations from friends. We wanted to experience the 3-course lunch but due to social distancing rules, reservations were hard to come by. We figured we'd take our chances and arrive as soon as they opened, and we were in lunch! We were able to be seated indoors right away by Madeleine who was just a delight! There was just one other party enjoying lunch, so we felt very catered to. Our server, David was also wonderful.  Even after our lunch, Madeleine brought us over to the outdoor patio area and gave us a couple of complimentary tastings of her a few of her fave white wines.  Hands down, our best winery experience. We bought two bottles and will be back soon!"

                "description": "We have been members at Flat Creek Estate for several years now and have been very pleased with their many offerings. However this past Friday, the owner and staff went way over and above! Our son wanted to propose to his girlfriend and he wanted it to be a surprise! She loves pizza and wine so we \"planned\" that day to have a late lunch at the winery. It had been inclement out the previous few days and the day of the weather was looking iffy. The staff worked with us on a variety of scenarios just in case. The afternoon turned up sunny and warm! We were to \"meet up\" them a little later so they headed to the winery for lunch. The chef made a heart-shaped pizza (one of the surprises) and the staff came up with the idea of putting the ring into a small to-go box so he could bring it to the table without her knowing. I had also dropped off a bouquet of flowers for staff to bring out after he had proposed to her. The photographer found a great vantage point, the pizza was made, he picked it up along with the ring, he set the pizza down on the table and opened it, got on his knee and proposed to her! After she said yes and they hugged and cried a bit, the staff brought out the bouquet, we showed up and the photographer took more photos, onlookers awww'd and cheered! It was really an over and above day for everyone working at Flat Creek Estate! Thank you for helping to make my son's proposal so special!"

Flat Creek is a special place for us as we saw the sign for it during our Miata club drive back in 2007. I contacted them a few days later, set up a tasting for the club, a bunch of us drove out there and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The vineyard itself and the architecture are fantastic, and it has grown a lot since they opened.   Everyone who works there is extremely friendly and helpful, the food was always tasty, they have a lot of fun events, and the wines are truly delicious.   We enjoyed it so much that we kept going back, became friends with the owners, and got married there in 2011. Flat Creek was very accommodating as we wanted it to be on a specific date that was the Sunday after Thanksgiving, and they made it work.  Our wedding video showcases the vineyard extremely well so if you want to watch it, you can click here. https://vimeo.com/34645652 We are biased of course, but our friend did an amazing job on it and we love to revisit it."

The Cafe is small so get your food to go and enjoy one of the many cozy spots to view the vineyards.   The staff were very friendly and the store was very clean.  They have gifts as well.

Everyone of the varietals lacked depth, character and complexity.  Everyone of the reds tasted blah, and I mean blah. They all lacked the distinctive aroma and notes that each of the grapes are known for.  The Rose  lacked any minerality that one would expect, and was as bad as the others.  The tasting room experience was as bad as the wines. The server had zero personality or character either.  We came away with the same thoughts as we have from other Hill Country Wineries.  They should not, nor should they be attempting to produce well known wines, and in fact do a terrible version of Cabs, Merlots, and Chards.  They should stick to Italian varietals, as well as a few others that might be better suited to the Texas climate, even though most people have no idea about those varietals. I suppose its just marketing to attract people in to the tasting room, and once they get toasted enough it no longer matters, since once the minds fogs, its just pour me another."

Strict 21+ policy (many signs warning you to turn back if you aren't 21!) but the servers were so nice and kind. We did a wine tasting which was $20 for 6 samples of white, red, and sweet wine. You can also split the sampling between people, which I shared with a friend. Server (I think her name was Julie) was so sweet and knowledgeable about the wine flavors and gave us recommendations and some history of the flavors. Our favorite was the Starry Night, or the Orange Muscat wine! A bit disappointed they didn't give chocolates or nuts during a wine tasting and overall felt a bit rushed through the process as more people showed up, but it was still a unique experience.   The patio has a beautiful view of the orchard, which is why we came here versus other wineries in the area. Outdoor seating is plentiful, many round tables for larger groups too. Definitely would've spent a good half of day out here sipping wine if it wasn't for the rain. The Bistro (food/restaurant area) was closed because of Covid so eat before you arrive so you don't get hangry or wine drunk! ;)"

The ambiance is fantastic and is worth the visit to just get a bottle and enjoy the panoramic views.   Pro tip: they do not allow children, so know that before you go. I believe most of the poor reviews are about this fact, but if you are prepared beforehand it will help with the planning."

Bring a few friends and drink a bottle outside under the tree shade. They have a nice bistro menu to pair with your wine.   Prices are really reasonable $25-50 a bottle. Nice selection of whites, reds, sweets. Enjoy."

                "description": "This was the best winery of the 8 1/2 I made it to in Texas. All of the wines had a, well let's just say, flavor I am more accustomed to tasting. Prior to this place, everything I tasted was a mixture of sour fermented grapes. Not knocking Texas wines but they are just not my style. Maybe it needs an ice cube. Every wine here, ones that I tasted, is 100% Texan and done the way I think it is suppose to taste. Also, the view from the estate is beautiful. Very worth a stop for tasting and buying."

They wipe down tables in between people and staff are all wearing mask. Plenty of space outside for proper social distancing and enjoying some wine. We grabbed a bottle and ate at the small restaurant they have there. Would recommend you make reservations if you want a view. Service was great and food was amazing. My favorite was the pizza, don't remember the name of it but it had honey on it and it was the perfect amount of sweetness. Never thought I would like a pizza with honey on it, now I can't wait to go back."

They have an outdoor sitting area where you can admire the views and the bottle that you order is brought to you by a server who wears a face shield and gloves.    My group ordered a bottle of the 2017 Newsom Cabernet Sauvignon and we were pleased with our choice. It was not dry like a Merlot but just right. This winery does not allow you to bring outside food only the food offered in their bistro outdoor facility. This was not an issue for us.   Overall, it was a pleasant experience."

                "description": "We have been club members here in the past, and really loved it. We went an 75 minutes out of our way to stop in for a tasting to see what peaked our interest in their current offerings. We loved that they have so much beautiful outdoor space. That is something that was always a major draw for us at Driftwood.   We called ahead, let them know we had a pup with us, and wanted to do a tasting. They told us to come on in. (It was a Monday and the place was very slow)  Upon arrival they told us they will only to tastings inside? What? In the era of COVID? As for the dog, they said one of us could do a tasting.   Between the lack of customer service, unfriendly attitude, and most importantly lack of outdoor tastings we will never bother to come back. WAY too many options with just as beautiful of grounds, equally great wines, safe tasting environment, and more importantly good customer service."

                "description": "Good wine, good scenery, but the lady checking us in made it bad. First, I'm 21 and so is my best friend. We went with her parents, and her dad likes to joke around. We shared our ID's (after already confirming with someone else that we are at least 21 and allowed to enter), and he made a joke about us having fake ID's. Obviously we don't have fake ID's, this lady could've scanned them and checked. Anyways, she then proceeded to yell at all of us about how we can't allow anyone under 21 in the winery, she even yelled \"NO ONE IS ALLOWED IN HERE UNLESS THEY ARE TWENTY ONE, PERIOD,\" she really did say \"period\" which immediately made my friend and I annoyed. Just very mean and disrespectful. I understand that she was trying to enforce the rules but we are over 21 and she did not have to explain the rules in such a rude way. Even her coworkers seem to not like her that much, they gave her the side eye, like she's THAT lady at work.  Then we did the wine tasting and the lady who poured us our wine was absolutely lovely. So sweet, gentle, kind, and even in the wine tasting area we had a great view of the hills and nature around us. The wine was very good. we liked almost everything, and even bought a few bottles.  After this, we went to buy some bottles and a glass of wine, again meeting the lady from earlier. A hand washing towel that my friend bought wasn't scanning correctly snd she got VERY mad at my friend for it. She took out her frustration from the computer on my friend. She was basically yelling at her and telling her to get another hand towel of the same price, she was interrupting us, I was ready to snap at this lady. She was VERY rude the whole time. She got the entire room of customers quiet from her yelling at my friend. She was just clearly very frustrated but should not have taken it out on my friend, family and I. This winery is incredible, but her attitude, frustration, and behavior knocked my rating down from 5 to 3. I was gonna put a 2 because of her, but the winery was amazing, it deserved a 5, but this woman made a serene and calming experience a bad one. My friend and I are both 21 and it isn't our fault the computer messed up scanning a hand towel. There were a few more negative experiences we had with her but these were the worst ones. Even the other customers in the room who were complete strangers to us saw her being this rude, controlling, and mean and visibly for uncomfortable. This company would be a 5 star place without her ruining everyone's experiences.  EDIT: Her name is Aileen. I don't know how it's spelled but my friend that I mentioned remembered her name because we were planning to call the company and inform them about her rudeness to customers."

The woman on the phone said no reservations needed and the last tasting was at 5:30pm (winery closes at 6pm). We walked up to the check in host at 5:31pm for him to say in a smug tone, \"Oooh we just closed up\".  I told him what the lady on the phone said and he said, \"yeah sorry\". I was surprised at the lack of hospitality as we would have been out of their way by closing time and were looking forward to supporting a local winery during these difficult Covid times.  Better luck next time I suppose but left a less than wonderful taste in my mouth. I'll wash that taste down with wine from another winery!"

The views are breathtaking, and the main house is absolutely impressive, I was so impressed with the property I had to explore it further on my own.   They have been operating since 2004 and turned the former residence into a tasting, event and sales space. The sunroom and patio are perfect for enjoying a tasing or a bottle of wine among friends.   I actually sampled all of the wines on my visit to the vineyard, of course my preference is red, but I found many of the whites quite refreshing. Although the pool is no longer used for swimming, it makes an excellent backdrop, stop in and set a spell! Cheers!"

I'm not weeping with joy from any of the wines but they're easy enough to drink.  It's particularly lovely for violet crown sunsets, so save it for your last stop if you're making the rounds in this neck of the woods.  They don't have any ice, which I find supremely odd being that it's Texas and they serve white wine! If you want to keep your wine chilled while sitting outside (they've got plenty of gorgeous trees to provide shade but shade is not a wine bucket!) the only way to do so is to drink it real fast while thinking cold thoughts."

We were a little disappointed to hear that, as of our visit in May, they weren't doing tastings due to Covid because I do think it can be done safely and would've made for a better experience. Otherwise, you either have to buy a full bottle or multiple bottles if you'd like a well-rounded understanding of their wines. We opted for a blend that we absolutely loved, described on the bottle as a \"patchwork quilt of grapes.\" It was honestly worth every penny--so delicious!   We took our bottle and glasses outside onto the expansive lawn which is just perfect for picnics. They have lots of shaded tables under the old growth trees.   Perhaps for safer tastings they could serve them \"beer flight\" style with the informational flyer and direct you to sit outdoors so that you can still experience a handful of their wines without breaking the bank? That would make it a 5-star experience for me!"

I've done the tasting before and also just purchased wine by glass. Both are delightful. Tasting is nice for first timers to explore a variety of wines Duchman produces. Because of the tasting, I was able to find my favorite red and white wine of theirs. And for $10/tasting, it is such a steal!! (Price may have changed. This was based off of 2018). After my first visit, I just opt to get a bottle or glass of my favorite red and sip it on the patio taking in good wine, views, and company.   My friends and I always love to end our Hill Country winery trek at Duchman and drive over to Salt Lick after for good ol Texas BBQ."

This particular winery has outdoor picnics for groups and benches for smaller groups for one to buy a bottle , bring some of your own food and enjoy their wines. During this pandemic time, this is the perfect scenario to drink wine while still practicing social distancing.   They do allow you to use the restroom with mask wearing enforced for you to go inside the building.   Their wine was light and refreshing. We chose  a white wine.   If you go near the end of the day you enjoy a nice sunset followed by lighted trees giving you a Christmas vibe. Up until that day , I never knew that Texas had a winery side like Driftwood but places like Duchman Family Winery proved to me that they do exist and they have really good wine too. Highly recommend you make a stop at this winery."

                "description": "Over priced tasting . $17 tasting for very small pours of 6 wines . No water in tasting room. Had to go get it yourself . No crackers or palate cleansers . If it was a free tasting I wouldn't care as much . When I made reservation I was specific about food and was not given accurate info. You are not able to order food or eat during the tasting. Food only available to purchase after tasting was over. Servers poured wine on top of previous tasting . Missed poured twice . Server changed frequently and not consistent. They obviously are not organized to keep track of what wine we should be on . Huge red wine fan( live in Europe for 6 years ) was not a fan of  any of the reds . Surprisingly liked 2 of the whites, Beautiful atmosphere and building . A shame the tasting experience doesn't match . Could be so much better!!"

                "description": "Nice stop just outside Austin for a wine tasting! The outside setting is very cool, spacious front lawn and some tables/chairs for hanging out. Dropped into this place for a quick wine tasting, consisting of 6 small pours of wine. The whites we tasted were all very smooth, not overly sweet but just the right amount of smooth and dry. Definitely recommend sampling all the whites if you have time, you won't be disappointed!  We didn't go check out Trattoria next door for food, but have been there in the past and pretty good Italian food, pairs well with the winery.  If you come here and the weather is looking good, you can expect a very scenic, picturesque spot to spend some time at!"

                "description": "I live in California and only an hour away from Napa. I wasn't expecting anything close to what one would experience in Napa. However, I still wasn't fully pleased.   The only way I can imagine that someone would really enjoy it, is to bring your own picnic and use their outdoor seating area. This is of course conditioned on the weather and also whether or not there is gonna be any bachelorette party there during your visit. (We saw two when we visited and they were so loud and they had overtaken all the outdoor seatings)  We tried their tasting. It was only $15 which is relatively cheap. In Napa you pay 2-3x more than that in a good winery. They let you choose your own 5 wines out of their selection or go with their recommendation. The tasting overall was okay, nothing that I disliked and at the same time nothing wowed me. I'm not sure if I'm gonna go back there, but it was worth to try it once."

                "description": "Duchman is a great winery to visit near Austin that makes great wines.  I've recently been on a kick to learn more about and try Texas wines.  I've tried wine from several different Texas wineries in the past couple months (all purchased from wine stores) and Duchman is so far my favorite.  I prefer red wines and my favorite Duchman wines are the Aglianico and Sangiovese. Since the winery is so close to Austin, my husband and I decided to visit.  The grounds are beautiful - the perfect place for a picnic.  I appreciate the precautions they've taken due to COVID-19 too.  You can't go into the building (though they will let you in if you need to use the restroom), so they are set up outside selling wine by the bottle and require everyone to wear a mask.  There is plenty of space to picnic and social distance.  They sell some picnic meals on-site, but we brought pizza from Pieous, bought a bottle of wine, and had a lovely time relaxing at a picnic table in the shade.  I highly recommend visiting Duchman.  I'm happy there is a winery that makes great wines so close to Austin.  Even if you can't do a tasting during COVID-19, it is still worth the drive to drink wine in a pretty setting!"

                "description": "Really beautiful property. We wanted to go to Salt Lick and wanted to find some other activities in the area so came here for a tasting before lunch. They do $15 for 6, which is pretty good, and was offering 5% off your total bill for following them on Instagram.   There's some beautiful benches set up outside to go with your glass of wine. It unfortunately seemed to be drought season when we visited so the actual grape plants were pretty bare. Once you step inside, there's a small room where the tastings happen and the shop where they sell bottles and all kinds of souvenirs. There unfortunately wasn't any seating indoors so we had to stand the entire time. If you walk in more, you can see barrels and label making rooms. Wish they had given us more history during our tasting but it was fun nonetheless.   It was pretty easy to get an uber out here from the city but be warned getting an uber out here may take a little while."

                "description": "We finally made it to the Wanderlust location on a Tuesday, ahead of leaving for a vacation, as were looking to spend a day just relaxing near home and day drinking. There are tons of choices of wine, and even more places to sit and relax! The staff explains the process to you, but after our first visit, we definitely realized there could have a little better thorough explanation, and notation made about the happy hour each day. My husband and I each received our own card for pours, even though we were on the same tab, so it's VERY easy to lose track of how much you are spending collectively, because your card only shows what YOU have spent so far. The choice to have small, medium and large pours is nice, because even though each wine has a description, you just don't know until you try it! There are several food truck options, but they don't open until later in the day. There are also some mead wines, and some non alcoholic options inside, as well as games to play! There are also dog-friendly areas and water bowls, which are always a plus for us!  Our only complaint was the staff; we arrived just after their posted opening time, but the door was locked. We walked around back, called out to anyone, and got no response. We left for a bit and came back and it was finally opened. We inquired about it with the long staff member after she finally appeared, after about 15 minutes of waiting, and she seemed to think we didn't know what we were talking about. And as I mentioned, the explanation was not very thorough, and we had to wait another 10 minutes to cash out because she kept disappearing. We chalked it up to an one-off thing, and let it go, but it was still quite strange. I would think busier times might be better!"

                "description": "This spot is like the original Wanderlust (put a credit card on file, and you get card to swipe for different wines on what is essentially as a pay per ounce buffet). With this buffet, you're paying more for the nice items, per ounce, though.  This location is larger, though, and more artistic both in the decor and the fact that they have performers there. Additionally, they have a larger selection at this location vs. the original location. That said, while it's a larger selection, there's less variety. At least when I went there they didn't have margarita-inspired wines or mead. If you loooove wine, then, this is the place for you (or if you're looking for a more creative atmosphere), but if not I'd recommend the other location."

Anyway, I am glad it is up back and running as Wanderlust.   Upon entering you can grab a glass of mead from the bar area or head into the winery to pay by the pour with your card. They have tons of wines to choose from to include sangrias. There are picnic tables inside and a small courtyard near the food trucks if you want to hang out outdoors.  They have a few food trucks on-site that will be opening soon. One of them was kind enough to pass out bread samples. I am gluten-free but my husband indulged in some delicious bread which he said was AMAZING.  Overall this is a cool little area with more to come to include a coffee place, brewery, and restaurant. I will be back for sure because the location is chill and the wine was good."

But yes - they can do all the vibes with all the great wines.   This location has a huge barn area for massive parties and events, a cozy interior, and another even cozier private room. The bathrooms are beautiful and the place, although huge, is still absolutely comfortable due to the layout."

First off, the space is fantastic - huge lofted ceilings, seamless indoor/outdoor (perfect for COVID), visually interesting seating and art. The indoor portion comes loaded with comfy couches and armchairs which I can appreciate! A fantastic venue that I'm sure would've been much more vibrant during peak hours.  The service is great, really enthusiastic and knowledgeable sommeliers accompany with a great playlist. The wine selection here is decent, definitely a more robust and diverse selection than the downtown location.   Great location for large groups or a birthday party. Would totally come again (albeit on a busier night)!"

Large room has many picnic tables with transistor radios and manual typewriters adorning them.   Excellent selection of wine and sangria. Provides a great opportunity to try a variety of regions of wines that you would be unable to do in a restaurant setting. However, it is expensive.  I had less than a glass and a half and spent over $20.   There are 3 food trucks, but they were closed when we were there (Sunday).  This would be a great place for a group event or just a large group attendance (that happy hour people forget to RSVP for--this is the place to accommodate them!). It is so spacious in the main room.   Parking is an issue.  It's only available on the street: so carpool or rideshare."

My boyfriend and I came in after dinner one night to see the new location and grab a few drinks and I can definitely say that we'll be back. The wine isn't on tap just yet since they're still finishing up construction but there's still plenty of options and the staff is eager to help. We spoke to Ashley at the bar and she was amazing, she told us all about the building, the wines, events, and what was to come with the space. Not only was the wine great but the atmosphere is just unmatched. The building is decorated floor to ceiling with murals and graffiti art from local Austin artists. I can't wait to come back when the whole package is together!   COVID Precautions: Masks are encouraged and hand sanitizer was provided."

They also play a lot of hip hop/ rap which is not only refreshing but gives this place an authentic feel! There is only street parking at the Shady ln location so keep that in mind! Once you arrive you receive a Pour card that you can use to access each tap. They have white wine (Chardonnay, resiling,etc) and red wine varieties. They don't have food but there are separately operated food trucks! Overall I think the wine is a bit over priced but love this space for studying, exploring a creative outlet or chilling with a few friends. It's a VERY quiet space. There's outdoor and indoor seating. I will be back sometime I hope they host comedy or spoken word here... seems like an appropriate venue!"

The interior space is luxurious, and the outside sitting space is reminds me of a barn. You get the best of both worlds. I come here for the sangria, usually on tap #61 and #63, but by the time you're reading this, they may have changed the drinks. This could seem a bit pricey unless you go during a happy hour. When it's not 50% off happy hour on certain days of the week, then an average day will have 30% off from 3pm to 6pm."

She even took the time to go find us outside while we enjoyed the view so our food wouldn't get cold! I will most definitely be visiting on my next Austin trip! Dishes we ate that were very tasty: Beef fajita quesadilla, shrimp quesadilla, the super nachos, and a cheese burger"

The restaurant is surrounded by shops like coffee, ice cream, clothes , candies, photo hub and a lot more. BUT the most magnetizing place here is the view of the lake and the sunset.   Food: The food was not that special but became one because of the view and people/person you are with. Honestly if only the food we rating here, I'll give 3 not bad but not good as well.   Also expect long wait/line for the restaurant. While waiting we roamed around so we didn't really got bored. There's lot of shops and artist that offer their services like, caricature drawing."

It has always been amazing, and they have expanded it considerably since the fire. The outdoor decks are sprawling, so many places to take in that view. And y'all, it had the absolute most stunning view of Lake Travis.   I just lost my father and was in need of an escape and some fresh air. Today I brought my dad's convertible mustang out (I MAY have gone kinda fast) to have lunch on this perfect blue bird day. I definitely felt his presence out here with me.   My server was so friendly and had the best customer service. I really enjoyed her serving me. I ordered a swirl margarita and chips and queso which were delivered quickly. For lunch I had a mixed fajita with steak and shrimp, refried beans and the fixings. Food was delicious.   I love the art they have installed around the restaurant. Really gorgeous bronze sculptures and we'll appointed gardens.   Thank you for a perfect experience."

                "description": "The Oasis is great for outdoor dining and has an amazing view of Lake Travis, especially during a sunset.  A couple of weeks ago, I visited Austin for a quick weekend getaway.  A small group of us came out for lunch and we didn't have to wait long because it was an early lunch and the weather was a bit cold.    PROS:  Even though the water level was a bit low, the view of Lake Travis was AMAZING!  Make sure to sit outside to be able to enjoy the view.  During the summer, it's worth it to make reservations during the sunset to get the most out of your experience.  The wait staff are super friendly and are attentive to all your needs.  CONS:  I will echo some of the other reviews on here and say the food is mediocre Tex-Mex at best.  We ordered the shrimp tacos, fish tacos and beef fajitas.  The tacos are decently seasoned, but the rice and beans are a bit bland and the dish overall was a bit cold.  The fajitas did come out nice and hot and the meat was seasoned well.  I will definitely be ordering the fajitas for the next time.  The drinks and desserts we ordered:  an Irish coffee, the Fantasy Chocolate Cake (which is a flourless chocolate) and the flan.  The Chocolate cake was surprisingly delicious while the flan was a bit too thick for my liking, but the flavor is really good.  The area surrounding the restaurant also has eclectic artwork to look at as well as small retail shops to explore.  Due to Covid each store has limited hours so you may want to call ahead to see if they're open.  Overall, it's a great area to sight see in Austin.  Especially if it's your first time."

                "description": "ON LAKE TIME!   It was my last day in Austin and my brother wanted t show me something a little out of the ordinary. We had just been going shopping oh and drinking. I wanted to experience the nature side of Austin.   The Oasis on Lake Travis was the place for us to venture out too. My brother said he had not been to it before, but wanted to try it.   To my surprise it was something grand. Absolutely gorgeous views of the lake and the more upscale houses Austin has to offer.   My brother and my parents had had a bite to eat prior to coming here, but I had not. I went shopping a the Domain and they had gone eating. From what I have heard, The Oasis is good for drinking, but not so good for eating. Their food is honestly sub par at best.   We ordered some drinks and chips and guac for the table. But I wanted something a little more in my stomach. I got the grilled shrimp tacos. They were good. But I have definitely had better. The only thing was that they were super spicy. I was not expecting them to be that spicy. All of a sudden my tongue was sweating and I was uncomfortable with that.   This is a must stop for the views. The views are outstanding. But the food was not the best. The mojito I had was strong. It was like one sip and I was already feeling it."

                "description": "The Oasis on Lake Travis is one of those tricky places where you have to average out the good with the bad to get a good idea of the place.  The good:  No question about it, the sunset is second to none, awesome views, awesome picturesque scene, and just about all of the outdoor seating has a great view of the scene. An additional positive, is the parking.  Easy to get to, plenty of free parking for the complex they are in, and even has valet parking if you prefer not to walk the 100 yards to the restaurant.  The not so good: I don't want to say the food was necessarily bad, it was just mediocre Mexican cuisine with a relatively small selection compared to your normal Mexican place.  To go along with the mediocre food is a price of about 1.5-2x what you would typically pay, but again you are here for the view not the food. The service also was not bad, but I think \"nonchalant\" would be the best way to describe it.  So the real question, would I recommend it? Yes I would but just go into it with the right mindset that you are going for the view, you are paying for the view and you will not be disappointed!  I would probably not go back if I am in Austin, but I am glad we went once."

Having said that, the food quality is pretty good and the service has always been good for me (though we are admittedly only there for weekend lunch service since we always have kids).   My shrimp tacos were well flavored and a good (yet not overflowing) portion. Menu wise they could definitely work on their beer selection - need more craft beers and some varied selection of beer styles."

                "description": "My friends and I wanted a nice dinner on one of our last nights in Austin. We got to Oasis on a Sunday night about 45 min before sunset and were told the wait would be about 30 min for outdoor seating. We ended up getting seated in like 15 min. The views here are truly unmatched and pictures don't do it justice.  We went to Oasis with the mindset that we were mostly going for the views and not really the food, given the reviews. However, we were actually pleasantly surprised that the food wasn't that bad - overpriced, yes, but not terrible if you get things other than the tacos.  We got quesadillas and burgers. The quesadilla was very tasty and came with some guac, salad, and even queso! My one friend got the burger which was good but a little overcooked. The fries it came with were perfectly crispy and seasoned.  Service was good - our server was running late initially, but sent someone over to give us some waters. Afterwards, they were attentive checking in on us.  Overall exceeded our expectations, especially on a busy weekend. Would definitely come again!"

                "description": "The views you get from this restaurant are incredible! I highly recommend sitting outside.  I've been here a couple of times, but for some reason today was extra tasty! I just ordered a cheese quesadilla, with all the toppings on the side, and some chips and queso. Both were delicious! Honestly, they were the best cheese quesadillas I've ever had, and this is coming from an extremely picky eater who lives off of things like cheese quesadillas and cheese pizza; I've tried a lot of different cheese quesadillas and these were THE best. Tons of cheese, and the blend of whatever cheeses they used work so well together. The queso was creamy and rich. I couldn't get enough of either!!  The service was super quick and I didn't have any issues with rude behavior, like I see a lot of in the reviews. I guess it just depends what day you go? I came on a Sunday at about 3pm, and there were plenty of tables along with fast and friendly service.  The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because I do agree with other Yelpers on the pricing being a little high. But only for certain items. (Check the menu out online beforehand if you're curious)  I definitely recommend you try this place at least once and judge for yourself on whether it's worth while or not; it definitely is to me!"

Our server was excellent despite the kitchen messing up our order and how hectic/busy it was even for a Thursday night. Food came out before the drinks, and the children's' food came out much later than the adults' food. The shrimp tacos were surprising good (4/5). The fajitas weren't bad (3/5) but due to the current onion recall, it was missing onions and just didn't feel the same. I had the frozen mango margarita which was strong and not too sweet.   Food: 3.5/5 Service: 5/5 Views: 5/5"

                "description": "At Oasis on Lake Travis the view is absolutely breathtaking and super relaxing to enjoy the Sun and view. First time here and this place is jam packed with people before dinner rush. I came here around 4:30pm and all of the outside tables were full. The wait was about 45 minutes. I went to get a strawberry margarita at the bar and walked down to the below deck to enjoy the view. It was so relaxing!!! (The strawberry margarita mixture was extremely sweet and over priced. Personally I wouldn't order that again.)   Skip forward to being seated to our outside table.... Everyone was packed in the area with tables and seats like sardines in a can. I had to be careful not to hit the person sitting behind me when fulling my chair out. It was not a comfortable setting at all. I ordered a cheese burger with fries and queso with chips and salsa. The salsa was pretty tasty and the chips were super crispy! The queso needed to be more cheesy. It's melty but oddly isn't cheesy enough. Very strange. The burger was a one star. Not well seasoned and lacking of everything. It was very very very sad. The fries were crispy but came out cold. Service was really great! Our waiter was top notched and provided excellent service. He was attentive and checked on us often. Five stars for service but the food was subpar for such a beautiful view. If you are a foodie and came here for the food.... You will be disappointed. If you don't care to eat and just want to get a over priced snack and drinks to enjoy the view ... this maybe your place."

The fries came cold which was surprising as they just opened less than an hour ago.

First and foremost a wine storage facility grown into a tasting lounge and concierge service.  Vine Vault staffs a fantastic sommelier, Nicole, who is hands on with personal service and planned events.  Even more interesting is that it happens to be located in the old vault of the Bank of America building.  Inside the facility is the actual bank vault and the exterior vault door is a key piece of the decor as you enter from the garage.  Think of a cigar lounge atmosphere (sans smoke) for wine drinkers....leather club chairs, cozy atmosphere, glassware and some snacking options.  Perfect spot to participate in one of their wine dinners, host a client social hour or simply enjoy a nice bottle before dinner downtown."

One of my wineries in Napa shipped a case of very expensive Cabs to me via Vine Vault.  It was shipped from Napa on 11/5/18 and received by Vine Vault in Austin on 11/6/18.  Vine Vault then proceeded to sit on the wine until I went searching for it. It was finally shipped to me via FedEx on 12/4/18, almost ONE MONTH later!  NO RESPONSE from company or managing partner, one Elton Potts. I have no guarantee that the wine was properly stored, as temperatures in Austin in November were frequently in the mid to upper 70's and into the 80's on a couple of days.  I intend to return the wine to the winery and will STRONGLY suggest that they cease using this poorly run company."

                "description": "In planning for our day trip, I thought about checking out an olive orchard. Years ago, I had read about Sandy Oaks olive orchard but never quite made it out to visit. On my search online, I found Texas Hill Country Olive Company in Dripping Springs. The timing might not have been the best since the arctic freeze affected the olive trees. We did see both mission and arbequina a year and a half old olive trees. Under the shade of the oak tree and a breeze, we sat to listen to Cara (one of the owners) share the history of how their family business started. With a brief visit with the resident chickens we headed indoors for the abridged version of the mill tour. Finally understood how extra virgin olive oil is made and not to ever buy light olive oil!  After the olive orchard and mill tour, we joined the tasting tour ($10). There were so many varieties of olive oil and balsamic vinegar and flavor profiles similar to wine tasting. I loved getting to combine the balsamic vinegar with the olive oil and tasting with the bread and apple.  It was fun shopping at the store. Goodness with making choices though! I knew I definitely wanted their olive-based products.  Next time we'll have to stay and enjoy some lunch."

                "description": "You know how back in the day folks had a milkman? Well, I wanted a piece of that nostalgia but don't drink milk. What I do consume a decent amount of, though, is olive oil, so I went about getting myself a mOOn (yes, I did just combine man and olive oil and no, I'm not ashamed of it).   Really, I was low on olive oil and missed my window for my grocery delivery so took the opportunity to support local and explore Texas Hill Country Olive Co.'s offerings.  The website is super easy to navigate and they have a wide variety of olive oil and vinegars, along with bundles of multiple if you don't know where to start. I received my order within a two-day window during the week from Xmas to NYE, without opting for any expedited shipment, so that was a lovely surprise.  I am a fan of anything chili or jalapeno, so I opted for their jalapeno-infused OO, along with two standard olive oils just to have on hand. The 100ml bottles run $12 each, not including shipping (my 250ml that I usually get from Imperfect Produce is $4.79), so a pretty stark contrast in price. I used the jalapeno on popcorn the other night, as well as toasted bread, and it didn't really have any kick to it, which was disappointing. I was hoping that for the price, it would be a boombastic flavor ball, so I could justify its purchase and continue to patronize from my mOOn.   I am so happy I could support local, and maybe if I visited the estate, I would have a better appreciation for the product, but as a stand alone, I most likely won't be ordering again."

                "description": "The place is really not worth visiting unless you're coming out for the tours. It's a gift shop where you can already buy mostly everything online to begin with. The restaurant menu is terribly overpriced for what you're getting on the plate. Think margherita pizza but at the size of a standard flour tortilla.  My recommendation is to save your money, go straight to the olive oil section in the store, buy in bulk, go home and create your own tray of olive oils and eat it however way you want to enjoy it.   The olive oils are exceptional by the way. Infused garlic, rosemary and sola stella were my favorite. If you're into balsamic, the strawberry infusion was a surprise crowd-pleaser in our house.   3/5 stars for the giftshop/restaurant location. If this was a review specifically for the olive oil, I would rate it much higher."

                "description": "I don't understand this place. It is basically a gift shop and a small restaurant. I wonder where the olives come from to make their myriad of products? Doest seem like the olive tree orchard is producing enough olives for more than a few martinis! We were greeted kindly at the door but there is really nothing to see here. We were expecting an opportunity to sample some of the products before purchasing but no tastings were offered or on display. So we are back to the fact that you drove here to enter a gift shop. Hmmm  p.s. I see after reading reviews thst perhaps large trees died last winter which is sad. It also appears that tastings are offered here but the kind lady who greeted us did not mention them sonperhaps they are scheduled or have been stopped for covid so check before you come so you aren't dissapointed like we were."

                "description": "I highly recommend trying their award winning olive oil set (my favorite is the verde) and different flavors of vinaigrettes: white lemon, prickly pear, fig, etc.! I bought several gift boxes for friends and colleagues; everyone was very excited to receive them. They also sell pesto artichokes in a glass jar packages with a cute wooden spreader. Shopping locally was a personal goal of mine this year. I thought this place was perfect! They gifted me a box of very delicious butter pecan cookies when they rang me up. I ate all of it in two mins... couldn't even remember what brand it was."

                "description": "Beautiful property although the olive trees look like they didn't survive the snowpocypse. You can walk around the property. Staff are very friendly. Supposedly the owner picks the grapes and they have a few types of wine that gets made somewhere else. Can't tell you how it is since I didn't feel like purchasing a glass or bottle. They don't do wine tastings anymore although there is a sign out front.   Their olive oil and balsamic vinegar was tasty on fresh bread. The flat bread was just that... flat. To a crisp. The margarita flavor meant some cheese and basil but not really any tomato flavor. Wouldn't recommend the flatbreads. It was a good idea but poorly executed."

I am in LOVE with this spot.  I went last week for my Birthday with Brother and Sister-in-law.  It was wonderful.  The olive oil is probably the best I have ever had, I ended up buying a bunch of olive oil after lunch.  We sat for two plus hours, eating, drinking and just enjoying the scenery.  We were so incredibly lucky because the weather was amazing, and there was a beautiful breeze so it was cool and comfortable.  We had a variety of different sandwiches and anti-pasta...everything was to die for!  I can't wait to go back.  What an incredible GEM."

We bought bread and olives and had a flight of olive oils to taste with small pieces of bread. They serve wine and beer too. The bistro had already closed but we will definitely be back. The staff was friendly and informative. We even walked into the olive grove to see the baby trees up close. The Sicialian olives with garlic are amazing. We also bough feta cheese olives. The caramel sauce we bought went great with Frederick peaches we bought on the way home. We also had some delicious Gelato which was cold enough to take to go."

                "description": "This was our first visit to Texas Hill Country Olive company. The employees were very friendly and explained the ordering process. We were able to snag a couple rocking chairs on their front patio and enjoy the beautiful weather. The Salumi plate was one of the more interesting charcuterie boards I've ever tried. The cheeses were on point, some sharp and others soft with herbs and spices. It could have used a bit more jam and crackers overall. The view off the porch was worth the stop itself. Would definitely recommend trying when in the area and I'm sure a tour would be fun when the trees are in season. I was disappointed they didn't have olive oil tastings going on due to Covid, but I also understand."

We've always wanted to do olive oil tastings and orchard tours in Italy, so were happy to find this until then. Unfortunately, due to the pandemic they aren't doing tastings at the moment. You can buy all the oils, as well as many other foodie items in their store. They also have a bistro with a nice menu, we came after eating lunch so didn't get to try anything. We tasted a few wines and thought they were okay, a little too acidic for our palates. The highlight was walking through the orchard and seeing the olive trees. I'd like to come back before the olives are harvested."

We did the orchard tour which was ~45min of walking around the olive trees and learning more about the process of growing and processing olive oil, as well as the different varieties. Our tour guide was great - very friendly and knowledgeable!  The tastings are cancelled due to the CORONA restrictions but we had a lovely lunch in their shaded outdoor patio. Highly recommend the olive oil and olives platter.  Speaking of COVID, great to see everyone wearing masks and the business itself enforcing the regulations. Felt very safe walking around and eating there.  And, of course, we couldn't leave without purchasing some of the delicious extra virgin olive oil and balsamic (which is not made there but commissioned from the special region in Italy).  Would highly recommend, especially if you have friends or family visiting in town. It's a short 40-50min drive from Austin."

We arrived for an early lunch and got their charcuterie board to split along with an egg salad sandwich that came with a salad. It was a cold day out, so I ordered a cup of the tomato basil soup as well. OH EM GEE this is the best egg salad I've ever had!! It was Mayo-free and used their garlic olive oil instead. I got a bottle to try and recreate it at home. The grounds were beautiful. There was a pumpkin patch along with all the vegetables they grow on site. The employees were all so friendly as well. If you're ever in the area, swing by and give them a visit! It's definitely worth the trip."

The view of olive trees covered in fruits for an upcoming harvest, the cute shop with must-buy oils and breads and cookies and the super friendly staff set us up for great expectations. And they surpassed them. The focaccia was light and airy and flavorful- a combo of traits i wasn't expecting in bread. The side salad with its basil olive oil lightly coating the freshest greens left me longing for more. So i bought the oil. We split some Flatbread and a muffuletta and both were scrumptious. I tried to talk my husband in going back the next day but we had to get on the road. Make this place a stop. It is kid friendly too. I never knew how beautiful olive trees were but it made me want to grow"

The staff present were quite nice, just busy. We were allowed to buy wine to self serve on the back porch and were welcomed to be inside the tasting room or outside which was near the vineyard - very nice out there.  Their vineyard was planted in 1999. That may be a little unusual for the immediate Austin area. The vines and the grounds are very well maintained.   As far as the place, it is beautiful. It has the feeling of Napa but with Austin-area live oak trees.  The property borders Lake Travis though it is barely visible from the tasting room area. There's an exclusive members only area that is on the lake.  We purchased the Claros Reserve which is a Norton grape (hybrid) and is the grape grown on the estate. The wine was surprisingly excellent and cost $35.   I think that, with a reservation, this would've been a superior experience."

The property is absolutely gorgeous - I mean you can truly just sit and relax for hours while you take in the stunning view. I had made reservations but we arrived a tad bit early and Liz was happy to accommodate us sooner. I'd like to take a moment to offer my sincerest appreciation for Liz as she made this experience so memorable for us. It was our first proper wine tasting and she truly took the time to explain every single wine to us - notes/scents to look for, best food pairings, explaining the difference in textures, where the grapes are from - I mean the whole nine yards. She even showed us the safer, beginner way to swirl the wine to really delight your senses before tasting. I had added a cheese board to our reservation which we thoroughly enjoyed! Liz was patient with all of our questions on the wine (and cheese), had a wonderful sense of humor, and just a lovely personality to deliver a phenomenal package of customer service. Every single wine we tried was delicious! We took home a bottle of Claros but we seriously wanted to take home one of each. If we weren't relocating soon, we would 100% have signed up for their membership. If we get to visit the area again, we will definitely stop in. I highly recommend visiting!"

The wines were excellent with a lot of variety and worth the cost for the tasting. The property is stunning and did I mention the view of Lake Travis? They graciously let us sit in the members area and explore the property after our tasting and I'm seriously considering joining the club. Highly recommend!"

Disappointing, because we drove out of our way and had our young daughter with us. Were hoping to have a nice little picnic. Waste of time. It would have been nice if it were posted on the website. It was a beautiful vineyard!"

We were staying at Horseshoe Bay Resort and were deciding between several vineyards to try in the area. I'm really glad we ended up trying Stone House. We decided to sit on the patio for our tasting. I tried the classic tasting and my dad tried the reserve tasting. The wines were mostly from Australia. They had one of their house wines on my menu. I thought the quality of wines was very average. We also got a cheese board which was really good.  The area was picturesque and we were allowed to go down to an area for wine club members. They had an enclosed outdoor area for members only with a view of the lake.  Overall, if you want to go to a vineyard with great views, this is the place to go."

She welcomed us and gave us a nice toast of something bubbly and told us about the vineyard and its owner, Angela. The wine of the month was Angela's Wish. I was having a particularly emotional time with it at this point because my beloved grandmother, Angela, passed away recently and had wanted to visit this area. I, of course, had to get the wine of the month so I could keep that bottle. I told Jaramy of my grandmother and the significance of the name of the bottle and she listened with an open heart. My group also got a nice charcuterie board and sat outside. Though it was pouring down rain, we still had a lovely time conversing with others and enjoying the view."

Have been to both the Grape Creek Vineyards near Fredericksburg and to the Georgetown tasting room.

You know Grape Creek's wine is good: they earned almost 2 dozen medals, including three Double Golds, this year at the prestigious San Francisco Wine Competition. And their wins encompass all styles, with Double Gold wins for red, white and Port. My Tasting Ambassador, Sandy, was exceptional! As we talked, she discerned my tastes and made a couple of recommendations that turned out to be spot on. She was knowledgeable and responsive, and a delight to talk with. Having been to many tasting rooms and wineries in the Texas Hill Country as well as from the California wine regions to the New York Finger Lakes, my experience at Grape Creek exceeded my expectations. Highly recommended!"

Since they made us split up our party of six we got two tables that were close together. Apparently management had a problem with my girlfriend and I orienting our chairs towards our friends table so we could all talk to each other and came and got in our faces to tell us we have to turn our chairs around and face forward. What is this kindergarten? The wine was alright, but definitely not good enough to justify the $40 per bottle price tag. I've found better bottles at HEB for under $20. Don't waste your time or money. There are plenty of other wineries in the area of the same quality that are more affordable and less rude"

It is absolutely delish and my go to red for my collection and for gifting to friends.   While the main building itself is somewhat small and doesnt offer the option to sit downstairs (GC....this is overdue), there is a members only room available upstaird with views of the Gtown Square.  The patio however is the reason people gravitate towards this winery. There is live music, nice fans to keep you cool in summer and heaters for the winter.  My only dislike is the changes hours...it closes at 6:30. Far too early and down the street are alternatives that stay open til 9 or later."

Although... standing in line when you first walk-in did seem a bit off, it was merely just a way to help usher traffic through more efficiently. Luckily, the line went quickly or this would probably be a different type of review, as someone * wink wink* who doesn't do well with lines for absolutely anything, except that one Prince concert 30 years ago.   Needless to say, we came, we tasted, we joined the wine club and now we are big fans. Especially of their Rose of Malbec. That deliciously tasting watermelon jolly rancher (without the sugar) wine has changed wine drinking for me and completely justifies the $30 price tag."

We had previously been sitting there calmly, not being loud or offensive in any way - it felt very abrupt and extremely rude.

I decided to join the wine club because of her level of service. However, it's hard to get a hold of someone on the phone. I have a simple question to ask but no one will ever pick up the phone. When select the button to speak to the tasting room, their automated service starts all over again. Yes, I can email, but for a simple question, picking up the phone should be an easy option as well.  Also, the times on yelp versus their times on the phone are inconsistent. That needs to be updated.  Bottomline, they lack communication.  It's really annoying and frustrating. I plan on canceling my wine club membership and going elsewhere due to the experience that I've had."

I also like how EVERY time you come to the winery, you get a complimentary glass of wine! Of course, you need a membership.  I don't live in the area so I have a trek to make to receive my complimentary glass of wine for me and a guest. However, when I am in the area you better believe I am here. I just started my membership last visit but failed to write a review after a couple of bottles. My apologies. I was informed that my three bottles qill be mailed to my residence in Harker Heights, Texas. I will be sure to post how that goes. You can cancel the membership at anytime.

My sorority sisters came to Georgetown for Austin's ACL Fest and added on extra days to sightsee.   Grape Creek was a wonderful respite.  You stand in line, describe your likes to the salesperson, and taste. Then, you get wine by the glass (I think it was 10$/glass) to enjoy on their relaxing patio, and bottles to go.   My BF is a frequent member and has a card to get 2 free glasses of wine a month.   A very nice spot to relax and enjoy good wine and good conversation.   Thank you Grape Creek Vineyards!"

We went on a Saturday around 5:00 and it was busy! The wait for the tasting was only a few minutes since they fully staffed the counter. I think I saw them doing 5 couples or groups at a time.  She told us that we can order delivery from Gumbo's around the corner or bring in any food that we want! The offer live music on the weekends on the patio and dogs are welcome out there. The member only area was packed with people, so it was a bit hot, but had comfortable couches and chairs, many windows overlooking the courthouse and town square, and some salespeople offering tastes of the Owner's Club wines. I only took off a star because the member's area was hot and could use some more seating and a server would be great since it takes a while to get another glass or make a purchase by standing in line more than once.  The had quite a bit of wine related merchandise, cheese, olive oils and vinegars, and cookbooks downstairs."

                "description": "Stopped by here because I am a member and had never been to this location and was in the neighborhood.  It is a nice storefront on the square in Georgetown, which is a terribly cute area if you haven't been.  Got my free member glass and took it out on the back patio to enjoy.  Plenty of tables and shade there and some light classic rock, which made for a nice relaxing atmosphere.  Also I went upstairs to check out the members only lounge.  There was nothing free being handed out there food or sipping wise, but it was a comfortable place with lots of leather chairs, and if the winery was crowded, I could see escaping up here.  The wine itself is very good, something for every palate, even the dry red drinkers like myself.  If you are into wine at all, stop by and do a tasting, and I think you will be happy you did.  I plan to come back anytime I'm in the Georgetown area again."

People everywhere with no special lines for members Or any direction other than a sign that said everyone get in line.  Not sure the value of paying to be a member for this space.  Also a 21 and over rule in the tasting room. Most serious wine folks have kids.  Seriously reconsidering our membership and if it's with it. My suggestion would be to expand as quick as possible if you're that popular. Otherwise, do away with memberships benefits and just open to the public.  4 stars because the wine is amazing."

                "description": "Happy to find this little gem of a tasting room! We've enjoyed CL Butaud wines for a couple of years after discovering it at Antonelli's Cheese Shop. It's a shared space with Wine for the People, just off Fitzhugh Road, which is quickly becoming a brewery/distellery/winery Mecca.   Whether you like white, rosé, or red, CL Butaud has what you want. Light and clean white wines. Crisp, but not sweet rosés. Love the BIG, BOLD reds. The Grenache and Tempranillo are both awesome! My favorite is the Cease and Desist, a 50/50 blend of Syrah and Tempranillo.   We've been tasting wine for years near and far. This is the way it should be done. Best experience ever. Reservations encouraged. Get your own picnic table outside and enjoy your stay. The sommeliers are friendly and knowledgeable. The winemaker, Randy Hester, will likely visit with you and share his philosophy and insight into the process. 100% Texas grown grapes.   Dog friendly. Outdoor games and food trucks forthcoming. Did I mention I'm so happy they've opened a tasting room!"

                "description": "I soooo enjoyed my wine tasting at Texas AVA, which is a shared tasting room with CL Butaud and Wine for the People.    First, the outdoor space is great.  There are about nine picnic benches, well distanced, and most of them are covered/in the shade so you aren't baking in the Texas sun.  There were also nice design touches and little decorations, such as  tablecloths and flowers on the table, so the space felt very picturesque.  Next, there are three options for tasting: all CL Butaud wines, all Wine for the People wines, or a \"duo flight\" so you can try wines from both winemakers.  I brought my mother with me to the tasting and we decided to both get the duo flight.  I enjoyed all the wines we tasted, but my favorites were the Sparkling Chenin Blanc (Wine For The People), the Pa Pa French Rose (CL Butaud), and the Carbonic Petite Sirah (Wine For The People) (we added that last one on to our wine tasting, even though it wasn't included in the flight we chose).  What made the tasting even more special, beyond the outdoor space and the wines themselves, is that both winemakers were on site and pouring the wines.  We had the opportunity to talk to each of them, which made our afternoon feel like a very special experience.  You can tell they both have such passion for their wines and their passion is infectious.  We ended up buying five bottles of wine and I'm seriously considering joining one or both of their wine clubs.  If you are looking for a spot to hang out with friends and family and taste great Texas wines, I highly recommend visiting the Texas AVA tasting room.  I've already told my friends about it and I am planning another visit very soon!"

We learned a ton and our visit here will be too short to take in all the cool places he spoke about and recommended.  I would highly recommend this tour.  Take it on your first day here so you'll have ideas of where to eat, what to see and venues to check out live music!!   Kudos Jason!"

The only downside was most of the people in the group (we were the only minority) weren't really talking to us and we felt excluded in their conversations, I guess they weren't aware of their racial biases. But overall it was a great experience plus love the BBQ!"

Our experience with Jax, Ruben and Evan was great. They all know so much (interesting things) about Austin and their enthusiasm left me wanting to stay longer to learn more about this great \"weird\" city that I've grown to love. We rode around for two hours with 2 other couples in a van and it was perfect. The time flew by. I didn't want it to end. I would've loved hanging out with Jax, Ruben and Evan all day. Jax even treated us to gelato at one of her favorite food trucks in Barton Springs. How sweet was that!! We definitely will return someday to Austin to enjoy all there is to enjoy. Thank you, Jax, Ruben and Evan. It was a great pleasure meeting you all...truly!!!"

One employee (MJ) traveled ahead of group just to order food  and block tables.  This was worth the price of admission by itself.   The sprinter van was very well kept and new.

Jason loves what he does and he is a real people person. A trip down South Congress finished out our day with all the fun facts from our personable guide. We had the best day ever!!!

If others are saying good things about them, then it's probably worth trying. I signed up  the Real Austin Tour the night before and got an immediate confirmation. Their website says \"a city overview in just 2 hours\" which was perfect, but with a little mishap and trouble with parking, it ended up being around 2.5 hours. The van was roomy and clean, and a nice component of the tour, well, because less walking. I can imagine during the hot summer, the van with a/c would be the preferred way to tour around the city.   The tour took us through many neighborhoods and major sights around Austin. Enough that, I went back to many of the stops to explore further. There were many interesting facts pointed out and of course, the scary stories and legends make it all very fun and a bit silly. Stopped off at one of the cupcakes food trucks for a tasty treat, all included with the tour. If you're in Austin, this is a great little tour to see many sites in a short span of time."

Wonderful areas for kids to play and adults to chill. Lots of great beer options for everyone no matter what your taste is. I tried the Everything is Aussome - an Aussie sparkling ale. It tasted a lot like an IPA to me. I may have expected it to be a bit lighter in taste but still a great bold flavor. Great for groups, family picnics, or just a fun day out to relax. Definitely worth the stop in the area."

Stopped here on Friday night and caught the tail end of their acoustic live music set which they happen to do every Friday night. They stage by far is the best set up I've seen In the area under a natural oak tree with twinkling lights scattered above. Could easily see this place being a great wedding venue. They also had a nice little hiking trail where there's additional seating and a kids playground located further down. Now let's talk about the beer and the brewery. The brewery is huge and has a nice modern approach with a little Texas flare. As far as beers I ended up trying a flight and by far definitely grab a Barton creek gold on a hot summer day. If your looking more of a full bodied beer destination ipa would be my choice. Can't wait to come back here once the weather starts to cool down."

It has a great location right by Deep Eddys and Salt Lick BBQ, which allows you to make a nice day trip out of it.  Starting with the service, my party and I were seated immediately and were served. For drinks, we ordered  1. Adair 2. Zwickled  All the beers were excellent, especially the Adair.  For food, we ordered  1. Pretzel  2. Brisket Sandwich   The food was also great and a lot better tasting than other breweries, for sure. I did think it was interesting to have brisket pastrami cold, but it was still solid.   Overall, I will definitely come back to the spot because they have great food and even better beer."

They did a great job of enforcing masks when people aren't seated at their table and made it easy for us to keep distance while in line.   Their beer selection is very diverse, so I opted for a flight in my first round. I was pleasantly surprised they allowed you to include their more expensive barrel series in the flight which made the 4 4oz pours for $12 a great deal. While those were tasty my favorite was the dark Pilsner, for such a dark beer it had a more mellow, malty flavor than you would expect.   Food wise it was fairly typical brewery fare, but the $1 hunks of watermelon really hit the spot on a hot August evening.   If you're looking for a brewery a little outside of Austin to escape the city for an evening I'd definitely recommend checking them out!"

                "description": "Vista Brewing is one of the Breweries exempt from the new closed bar order (during Covid19) because of their food to alcohol  sales ratio.  We were excited to make a reservation for a special occasion and were assured (by way of Facebook messenger) that their \"kitchen was open and ready for business\".   We arrived, ready for some good beer and food.  First disappointment:  Their reservation check in system.  A chalkboard sign indicated a table for to-go order pick ups and simply an arrow for reservations.  No employee to greet, direct or be helpful.  2 employees filling to go orders as we stood in what we estimated to be the 'reservation' line.  Several people were behind us when 2 young women cut in front of us and said loudly \"Will you take walk ins\" and to our astonishment they got an employee's attention who completely ignored us and helped them get a table.   Very rude!  Once we were checked in we found a table in the shade and went to get our  beers and food.   Disappointment #2:   No food.  Only popcorn and a cheese plate.  That was it.  We told them we had been assured over messenger that their kitchen was open and they shrugged and said  \"Don't know what to tell you.  It's being renovated.\"     I can't understand how they are allowed to stay open with beer and POPCORN sales as food, under the Governor's new restriction.   At this point we already had our beer so we went back to the table to make the best of it.  Disappointment #3:   the amount of flies and mosquitoes. We go out to another \"farm style brewery\" frequently and have never had an issue with flies or mosquitoes like we did here.   Maybe it's one brewery using a spray service vs. not?  Maybe it's dog poop from being a dog friendly brewery (although, so is the other farm Brewery we go to...)  We had 4 mosquito bites while sitting there and this was at 5:00.  Flies were insane.  It was a disappointment all the way around as we had really been looking forward to several hours of relaxation, beer and food out under the trees.  Added on 7/11:  I have not changed a word of my original review, however I am adding a Star based upon the great communication I have had with one of the owners, Kent, who wrote to me after my original review.  He seemed genuinely interested in my feedback and responded in a very thorough manner."

                "description": "First time ever at Vista! Also first draft beer (not Crowley/growler) since beginning of lockdown. Such a great spot.   COVID: Vista has a GREAT outdoor area with plenty of tables distanced from one another. The ordering process specifies 6 ft of distance in line. Hand sanitizer is everywhere. Beers are delivered in single use cups. They have also started their live music Fridays again where you can venmo the artist tips. Masks are required everywhere but at your table.  You can make a reservation on Open Table for their outdoor area. Currently, they are open until 8PM.  We brought our own chairs and a blanket to use as a tablecloth. We also brought our own glasses to pour the beers into. I love beer out of a glass so this was a need for me.   Overall: This brewery has a ton of good stuff going for it. It's a little out of the way for Austinites (40 minutes), so you've got to make a night out of it. We're generally bigger IPA fans, so there are a few breweries we would check out ahead of this one. BUT they still have a ton of great beers on tap, and it is so worth checking out."

We love sitting indoors and outdoors depending on the weather and like that we have that option. They have live music on weekends and the beer/wine selection is good. Pre-covid their food was farm to table and delicious. We're anxiously awaiting the return on their standard food items. Definitely a great place to check out!"

I didn't realize the current menu is because of covid. The sandwiches were all cold. The pimento cheese dip was good but hard because it's also cold. Literally everything came out of the fridge as they handed it to us.   It was a terrible first impression. I understand it's covid, but I think they could've at least heated the sandwiches or tried to make some better food that can be packaged.   Great venue. Not sure I'll come back."

                "description": "Big fan of Vista. We didn't get to experience their food as they are doing snacks only for now. I recommend bringing food as the snacks aren't great, but I recognize they're doing their best given COVID.   The beer is pretty good though and they have a good variety with their more evergreen beers like kolsch, pilsners, steam beer, IPAs, etc. The other half of the beer selection are collaborations they'll do with a lot of ales and they have a saison on top as well.   You can't beat the environment either. You're in a beautiful forest with a ton of outdoor seating. Great for kids; there's a playground way in the back too. They'll bring in good live music on a few days. Looking forward to trying to food when things open back up."

Plenty of seating in and out.  lots of room for the kids to run about and having a great staff about was wonderful.   only ding was the coordination / distribution of food.  Basically they ran out for our guests, and well, there is nothing you can do about it.   Events are hard to plan for, especially with family and kids, so we will work with them next time to better handle the food service / serving.   The beer was good, the wine selection was pretty good.   What i liked the most was the atmosphere. on a cool evening, with the stars out, it was a great place to be to unwind and chill with friends / family.    Plenty of parking..   Finding the place...well, thats tricky.  See punch in the address in Google Maps, you will be ok, just know that when you get close, slow down, and know the entrance is on top of a hill ... so you can miss it if you are not paying attention.   will I go back: of course, and I would recommend you go and visit."

                "description": "The pop up location at Bee Cave Galleria refused service to me because I have a health condition that prevents me from wearing a mask. Congress passed Public Law 88-352 (78 Stat. 241). The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or health condition.   Violating my civil rights is illegal and immoral and no public business can make a rule that overrides states and federal law. Imagine if Vista Brewing company refused service to a black or gay persons. This is exactly the same situation and they deserve a lawsuit.   There is no law in Texas or the USA that enforces a mask wearing policy. None. Period. No law allows a business  to ignore The Civil Rights Act of 1964. That is federal civil rights legislation that prohibits discrimination in numerous settings including: employment, education, voting, and public accommodations.  No law exists in Texas or USA that enforces mask wearing. No business may ignore SEC. 201. (a) All persons shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, and privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation, as defined in this section, without discrimination or segregation.   Corporate lawyers of Starbucks, Whole Foods, HEB, Home Depot, Lowe's and others allow those of us who are medically exempt. They know the law and don't want to be sued for civil rights violations. I shop there all the time maskless and have no issues.   Places of public accommodation are forbidden to violate state and federal law. Not obeying the laws from ignorance or self righteousness doesn't change the law. Businesses can't make laws.   My suggestion is - get educated on your legal responsibilities if you own or run a business of public accommodation. Wanting to have your costumer's safety is admirable but when that crosses the line to breaking the law, that's a line nobody may cross."

I came across it while searching on Reddit and made the best deduction of having dinner there for my 28th birthday!  Our waitress was the NICEST person I've ever met. Super kind, didn't rush, had great recommendations and allowed my boyfriend to surprise me with two little cakes.   Everything on their menu hits the spot but I got the fettuccine dish and my boyfriend got the penne vodka (which he claims is the best he's ever had). The drive is a bit long from ATX but 100000% worth it.  I will be visiting back when the weather is nicer to also enjoy the vineyard next door"

The driveway was hard to see coming off the road but I suppose this is due to the \"dark sky\" community. Albeit, Some extra signage would be nice.   We ordered meatballs as an appetizer and these were delicious! The garlic toast that comes with this dish is soooo tasty!   Focaccia and oil is complimentary, wish the bread was softer and less greasy but it was free..   We split the taglierini portofino. It was the right amount! The scallops in the dish was perfectly cooked, the shrimp may have been over seasoned but the lemon butter slightly cuts the seasoning.   Over all, We spent about $80 for our meal and 3 drinks.  We were pretty satisfied! Thanks for the great service and delicious Italian!"

I think this is your best bet if you're looking to eat and be away from crowds (for COVID).  I have to say all the food was good. The linguini was my favorite, followed closely by the mashed potatoes. The breads (focaccia and garlic) were each tasty, i could eat that focaccia all dayyy.  The lasagna was good, a bit heavy for me, though.. but what do you expect with lasagna!  I'd probably skip the Caesar salad next time..  While not my favorite Italian food ever, the grounds are beautiful, and it's a great place to bring a date or some friends and have a picnic style meal with some wine ;)"

While it is not easy to get to, it is the only gourmet restaurant I know of that accommodates helicopters.  (We arrived by car.)  We have met Austin friends here several times and the food has always been excellent, but we all agreed that it is now even better than we had remembered it from pre-covid days.  Warm bread came early with a plate of olive oil and herbs for dipping.  The antipasto plate and the fried calamari were both excellent, with a spicy dipping sauce.  Our friend loved the pasta dish with sautéed scallops, and the 8 ounce filet that my wife and I shared  was the best of our eight decade lifetime.  We will be back again and again."

We drove 45min today (Sunday) and arrived before 11 AM - the place was completely empty.  We took a walk around the property and upon return checked in with the hostess for a party of 6.    We were shocked when she asked if we had a reservation.  Looking at the empty restaurant we politely asked if she was sure we needed one?  She mentioned they were short staffed and completely booked, but we could order take out.  Confused, considering the place still only had one table occupied, we left and went to a different venue."

She knew the menu perfectly and made great recommendations. We started with the asparagus salad and prosciutto pizza (upside down as Morgan recommended). The asparagus was grilled perfectly with a slight char to it. The pestos on the salad were amazing. The pizza was crisp and delicious. Honestly, it couldn't have been better. I then had the duck breast with cranberries and my dining partner had the ribeye.  Both were cooked perfectly and seasoned just right.  For dessert we got tiramisu.  It was light and delicious. The mascarpone was airy and lady fingers had just the right bit of liquor. The decor was a bit \"overdone\" for my taste, but I can't dare take away any points for my view on that. Really a solid 5."

                "description": "First ever dining experience at Trattoria Lisina.  We we did for a special occasion, a \"mile stone birthday.\"  We drove 1-1/2 hours to get there!  Let's start with negatives (which I don't normally do!).  The most expensive menu item, aside from the bottle of wine, was a pistachio encrusted red snapper filet.  The fish was 2x over cooked, and was tough as leather.  The main problem was it's a filet, skin on, blood line still intact.  As a seasoned Gulf fisherman and chef, I know you need the blood line cut out of the filet, even the fishing guys on YouTube get that.  Great piece of fish, tough to cut even with the knife provided.  It's not all about presentation.  Issue raised with waiter (Joseph S), and \"he could have the manager come over to discuss.\"  As a waiter, when the dish is bad, take it away and redo!  The craft cocktails were OK, not worth the $14-$15 price tag.  The star of the evening was the calamari fritti, which was great!  Fresh, hot, tartar and marinara sauces were on point, terrific.  The veal osso buco, the best in TX, by far!  There's something about fresh bone marrow!  Dessert was the tiramisu, which was awesome, until James S added to the bill.  Overall, Trattoria Lisina is a \"destination\" restaurant, but for the $$, it's not worth the hype.  Enjoy one of the Mandola locations in ATX, the food is better and the price tag is 80% less ..."

                "description": "Driving to Trattoria Lisina from Austin is always a fun field trip out into a totally different part of Texas. No traffic, windy two lane roads and there you are, in a vineyard in the middle of nowhere. I'd have never guessed a place the size and class of Trattoria Lisina would be nestled in hill country like this.  The inside felt distinctly Houston/Dallas vibes: much more corporate and big scale than a little mom-and-pop, but in a good way. Nice and air conditioned with plenty of space too. Now for the food:  The focaccia they serve with garlic/herb olive oil is OUTSTANDING. I could have eaten it all night, so so good. Like fools we ALSO ordered garlic bread. The garlic bread was toasted baguette slices that were burnt and dried. No bueno. Also: how is one bread item the best thing on the menu and the other maybe the worst? Strange, but anyway, don't get the garlic bread when you have garlic oil and bread in your lap, overflowing. The calamari was ok but the entrees were amazing. The osso buco was SO TENDER and so full of flavor. It came with a little marrow spoon and was a huge portion. My husband got the crispy duck with polenta cakes and cranberry salsa and he was a big fan too.   The service was so nice and sweet and the setting was beyond stunning. I really liked my time here and would definitely take guests when they visit too!"

                "description": "This restaurant came highly recommended to us so we had high expectations.   First off, the free focaccia they give you is the bomb. Best item we ate all night.   We ordered garlic toast and it was BURNT. We were told that is how it normally is but we asked for it to be taken off of our ticket. All we could taste was char.   I had the fettuccine con prosciutto. It was ok. I would've preferred thinner prosciutto. I also added chicken and it seemed like it was frozen not fresh. Would I order it again,no.   We did also order the garlic potatoes and they were really good. They really only tasted like the cheese in them but they were great.   We ordered the tiramisu and chocolate caramel cake. Tiramisu is rum HEAVY and I mean it. The chocolate caramel cake was overly salty. I couldn't even eat it. I do normally like \"salty\" desserts so this was a bummer.   Service was ok. Took awhile for refills. Would I come back, probably not. Great ambiance but based on what we ordered we wouldn't come back."

Great to order a glass or three of wine and sit outside in the gorgeous venue. Everything tastes amazing and the service has a high level of attention. Been here 4-5 times with family and date night. Just love it!"

                "description": "A second (or maybe third) run at Trattoria Lisina. Owned by the Mandola family, it's a nicely isolated property with vineyards along the drive, play structures and other outside amenities, a pretty outdoor dining area with umbrellas for the tables and a vine covered facade that demands to be Italian. The inside if modern rustic upscale Italian. They are obscenely popular, so plan to make reservations well in advance. Don't expect to walk in and get a table.  Service today by Jeremy was impeccable. He was hyper attentive and considerate. One of our party has a citrus allergy, and he adapted wonderfully to that.  We started with fried calamari and some artichoke frittatas from the antipasti menu. The calamari was tasty and not over cooked, and the serving was the size of Cleveland. We never finished it. The frittelle al carciofi (artichoke fritters) were scrumptious and unique. What an interesting and creative use of artichoke. The spicey Mayo and marinara sauces were ordinary but fitting.  As it was brunch time, I had a Bloody Mary while she had their Sicilian margarita. Both were well executed. I chose the grilled asparagus salad for my main course. Nearly to die for. The asparagus was grilled just enough, crisp not mushy, beautifully presented, and the mixed greens were fresh, and the dried tomato pesto spiraled outside was rich. She had the Insalata Mista, a mixed greens salad with shrimp added. And she loved it. Since we'd indulged pretty heavily on the calamari and their incredible bread, Jeremy accommodated with a half size salad for her.  We'd intended to have a desert, but, since we'd been such greedy swine with the bread and artichoke fritters and calamari, we had to forego.   Trattoria Lisina lived up to their billing. Actually, they exceeded it. Well done, folks."

                "description": "I made reservations for a girls day lunch and  was disappointed.  I've been here on several other occasion with food and waitstaff being spot on.  Today wasn't one of those days.   We were seated and immediately greeted by our waitress.  She left us with our menus  and within 2 minutes came back to as if we were ready to order.  We shared we hadn't had a chance to view the menu.  She returned within another few minutes, we had decided to order calamari to start with.  We ordered wine after the 4th time she stopped at our table.  We ordered our entree, she came by and asked if she could remove our plates as we're eating some of their delicious focaccia bread.  We let her know we were still working on it.  Another five minutes passed and she picked up the plates.  After about 10 minutes she came to see what plates she could remove.  This was how the rest of our lunch went. As for the food, the calamari was rubbery.  I had ordered pasta alla nino and the chicken seemed like it was a precooked fillet that been microwaved for too long with the pasta being hard on the ends.  They did right by taking it back and not charging me for it.  However, the waitress didn't ask if I'd prefer something else."

                "description": "Lovely location for a date for anyone coming to Driftwood or living close by in the Buda/Kyle/S. ATX area. My wife and I came here for our anniversary a few months ago and loved it. Came back and brought some out of state guests and they loved it as well. Beautiful location, great food, and wonderful views if you're seated by a window. Service is always on point, and the staff is wonderful. Yes.. it is from the founder of Carrabba's, but this feels much more personable and more of a \"pet project\" on a winery - so don't go in with the mindset your getting chain Italian. Hint: the later you go, the fewer kids that are around, which lends itself to a more intimate dinner with less iPads.  As for the food - the lasagna is a favorite, and the artichoke fritters were excellent this go around. We always get the caprese and it's always so fresh, with wonderful burrata."

I called ahead to see if there were any open appointments on a Friday afternoon and Jenny answered. She has a very fun, bubbly personality and told us to swing by anytime. We were able to taste several different wines before we decided what we wanted to make. We spent about 1-1.5 hours there. We look forward to designing our own wine bottle labels and returning in 6-8 weeks to bottle the wine."

The wine making process is really fun from tasting and selecting the wine you want, to making it and, the  funnest part, bottling. You can customize your wine label and they print it for you to put on the bottles.   You can bring your own snacks and get a bottle to enjoy.   I would highly recommend everyone to try making a batch of wine at water to wine. They make great Xmas gifts too."

                "description": "Water 2 Wine is perfect for so many occasions... date night, girls night, happy hour, a pop-in for a glass of wine, or a night of wine making/bottling with friends. We were sad when the Round Rock location closed down, but found this place to be a million times better. The decor is cute and thematic, with tons of inviting spots for seating, whether you're looking for a romantic spot for two, or some couches for a larger gathering. The best part is the staff - super friendly and helpful while we try to make the tough decision of what to drink or take home. The free samples help too!   Making our own batch of wine is a yearly tradition for us. We get together with friends to start the wine (which of course involves a good time trying the different wines first), design our own labels (or get help from W2W), throw a gathering to bottle the wine, then have bottles to hand out as wedding favors, Christmas gifts, or generic gifts.   We are club members, so we stop by at least monthly for a couple glasses of wine and to pick up our bottles to enjoy at home. Whether you're joining wine club, making a batch, or just stopping in for a glass or two, Water 2 Wine is a fantastic neighborhood gem. I only wish they were in my neighborhood!"

Actually, they also provide services as your own personal vintner and label maker, where you can taste, create, and label your own wine!  While I have yet to try this full service out, the staff was very friendly, the wine (tried the whites only) was excellent, and you can palpably feel how fun the process is.  Definitely coming back to celebrate good times with a custom-made wine!"

What a fun tradition we want to continue!  The staff here is outstanding, they have great thought, and make you feel comfortable.  We had some neighbors at a different table order food in and  thought that was hilariously brilliant!  You are definitely recommended to buy a bottle as all winery's usually do, but this spot doesn't make you feel pushed to - which makes me want to buy another bottle.  I love that this is tucked away in the city and you don't have to go to the city limits to do a wine tasting.  I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this to any and all of you!"

                "description": "If you are a young couple, or an old couple, or an odd couple, and you decide you want a wine baby, you may be a bit worried about where, when and how to do that.  It's a big step and you should have nothing but the best for your Vino Bambino, so please look no further than Water 2 Wine, and Jenny in particular.  She is the BEST midwife for your wine labor.    We just had the best experience making, bottling and labeling our wine baby.  It was smoooooth sailing and immediately made me want another :)  When you decide to make your own wine, first, you'll get to sample the wines, ALL of them if you so wish.  I spent two afternoons sampling bunches of them and all the staff were generous and enthusiastic in helping me find which wine I wanted.  Then, you make an appt for conception.  It's fairly simple  and pleasurable.  Again, you can grab a glass of wine as you work, mixing the juice and water and yeast in a giant white bucket (Carboy), churning away for about 10 minutes and then your part is done for about 6 weeks!  The rest of the staff will ensure that your baby gestates comfortably and appropriately, testing its ph and sugars until its ready to be born.  Then the magic happens.  As the parent, you'll have full creativity in naming your baby.  In which case, you can pick any 3 images you like, decide the wording and color scheme and font of the label, email all that to Jenny and she'll print out the most perfect labels.  You can then invite a bunch of friends to witness and help in the birthing.  You can bring in all kinds of snack ems and the fine ladies at Water 2 Wine will immediately ply your guests with tastings of their wine and you can buy bottles (and bottles) to facilitate in the birthing process.  Everyone in your party can try their hand at filling bottles, corking bottles, melting the lid foils, and sticking on labels.  In the end, you'll have about 30 bottles of fantastic wine ( I recommend the Gruner!) to share and take home.    They make for fantastic house warming, business, wedding, new baby, Christmas, Hanukkah, etc gifts.  In fact, if you decide last minute you'd like to adopt a wine baby for Christmas, they keep a bunch already made and ready to label for your Christmas party or gifts.    Best thing was, our friends had so much fun and it was such a new experience for all of us that we WIN again as the hostess with the mostest.  And, even though I had grand plans of using this wine at our housewarming party, I doubt it'll last another 8-10 months so we may indeed make another baby next year.    Jenny and the rest of the staff really made this so much fun and interesting with all their cool contraptions and accomodated me with the music I wanted (got to have appropriate Edith Piaf wine birthing music!) and never left a wine glass dry in my group.    So grab your partner, in life, in business, in crime, and get to makin that baby! They're the best kind of babies, they don't puke or shit or cry and instead of causing you stress, they relieve it.  And in the end you'll have the coolest collectible bottles."

                "description": "Water 2 Wine has taken your normal wine drinking experience and given it a unique spin by providing you the keys to the winery and letting you become the vintner. You make your own batch of wine, create custom labels, bottle it, and best of all, taste the fruits of your labor. By having you do this work on site they are able circumvent certain regulations resulting in less sulfites and other chemicals than store bought wines.  I have been visiting Water 2 Wine for about five years and actually created a batch with my wife and we gave the custom bottles of wine away as gifts at our wedding. The gifts were a hit.   Water 2 Wine imports their grapes and juices from other vineyards. This is not uncommon for vineyards in Texas as most don't grow enough grapes, if any, to meet their own demand. When you decide to make a batch this is where you will start. You will mix the juice, and depending on the type of wine you are making will add flavors like oak.  After you make the wine it will go in the back room for fermentation where the staff will guide the wine along over the next six to eight weeks changing containers around six times.  About two months later you will come back and bottle your wine. You add your label, fill the bottle, cork it and shrink wrap foil around the top. Like a good chef test tasting food a lot of quality assurance goes on during this process. This is a perfect event to bring along a group of friends. Hopefully you end up bottling more wine than you drink.   You don't have to make wine. Water 2 Wine is also a spacious wine bar, with a large selection of wine, where you can stop in just to drink some wine. All of the wine is made on site by the employees. They don't sell food but you are welcome to bring in food to eat with your wine. There are plenty of tasting options or you can buy by the glass or bottle. The staff is very friendly and have been one of my favorite aspects of every visit."

Whether it's a glass of vino after work, a place to gather on weekends with friends or a fun place to work remote during the week W2W has it all.   I always thought you could only make wine here and was surprised to learn it's also a wine bar and retail destination.   Stop by and challenge the team to find you the perfect glass- they won't disappoint."

The spinach and mushrooms were well seasoned and delicious.  The Caesar salad was amazing. The dressing was delicious and the chicken on top was perfectly grilled. The flavor tasted like it has been brined for a while--perfectly salty and tender.  The brown butter cake was not very good and the fries were just alright.  Overall, food: 4.5/5 Service: 4/5  Very pricey but you pay for high quality ingredients."

                "description": "I was seriously disappointed by my experience here at salt and time which had been highly recommended to me by a friend. They missed pretty much every mark in terms of a good dinner experience. Let me elaborate.  We got there an hour before closing around 8pm, and were going to try to get in and out quick and didn't want to make them stay too late after closing. Well, we didn't have a choice because right off the bat we had to wait for menus for probably five minutes, waited another 10 for the waiter to come take our order, and when we finally placed our order probably 20 minutes had gone by so we put our whole order in at once.  We ordered the little gem Caesar-type salad, a ribeye (MR) and Teres Major (mr).  We waited (literally) 45 minutes for our salad!!! Waiter kept telling us it was coming and at the 40-min mark he asked \"you guys still haven't gotten your salad?\" Seriously!!!? It's your job to bring it to us and we've asked you about it three times now!  Keep in mind the restaurant was nearly empty by now. When we finally got it there was minimal apology and he seemed very nonchalant like it wasn't a big deal and turns out it wasn't even little gems. I grow little gems and serve them at the restaurant where I work and was super excited for them but this was just a regular iceberg wedge. After 1.5hrs of waiting at this point, steaks came out. Sauces were all wrong and not what we ordered and my steak was over cooked! Clearly medium and not medium rare since my partners was cooked correctly, there was an obvious difference. But at this point, being checked on by our waiter was a ten minute affair so we just shut up and ate it because it was getting late. There were no apologies, no comps, and the waiter kept trying to push us on dessert when we clearly were ready to leave. Dropped the check and proceeded to say \"there's no rush!\" ... yeah no sh*t I can tell that's definitely a motto here. And on top of that there was automatic 20% gratuity. I usually don't mind that, because most restaurant that do auto-grat have good service where I would've tipped 20% anyways. but it should not be a motivator for the servers to not give a crap about their tables like it is here.   The steaks tasted good but for the price, the horrible service and the inability to get orders right, this place was a total wash. You can get better steaks elsewhere for a cheaper price, where you actually enjoy your dining experience. Maybe in the future if they got new staff or management this place could be a really nice restaurant but for now, I can't recommend it."

                "description": "Pretty miserable experience. There were at least 5 open tables when we sat down so they were not busy. It took 10 minutes for the waitress to give us a menu and immediately ask for our drink orders. 20 minutes later we get them. We've been here for 30 minutes and haven't gotten to place our order yet.   I order the $52 filet as did my friend. I ordered mine medium rare, he ordered his medium. His looked well done but he likes his meat well done so he didn't care. Mine however was completely raw on the inside. Not \"cooked rare\" raw. This thing was seared for maybe 10 seconds. It was also very tough. The waitress just dropped off our food and we were waiting for steak knives for 10 minutes until I walked to the hostess and asked for them.   I sent the steak back and it took at least 25 minutes to get it back. At this point so did not want to pay $52 for a reheated steak so I asked another waitress to grab me a burger instead so I could get the hell out of here. They come back with my steak, which was missing a piece, that had clearly been thrown into an oven or microwave to increase the internal temperature.   If you're coming here expecting an artisan or holistic steakhouse experience, go somewhere else. If you're looking for some $15 cocktails to drink in a gentrified strip mall butcher shop, this is the place for you!   My experience was so bad that I considered contacting my credit card for a refund. It was that bad."

                "description": "Came here on a burger recommendation. It was a nice little place for brunch. I don't if I was just bad at finding it, but apparently they only have the brunch and dinner menu on the weekend. The lunch menu is only offered on weekdays so if you're wanting to come here for the lunch menu on the weekend, you are out of luck.   But their brunch menu still does offer a burger, the Butcher's Breakfast burger to be exact. It's pretty much the normal Butcher burger but with eggs and bacon added on, and i think cheaper too. I got it medium and it was a nice, hearty burger. It was a juicy, steak-y patty and the brioche bun was quite soft. I probably should've just taken the bacon and eggs out and eaten it separately though. It got a little to big for me.   Beef fat fries are a must try though. Nice soft potato filling, with a slight crisp. I might be wrong, but I tasted a hint of cinnamon and it had a quiet deep fried donut flavor that I am all too familiar with. Very addicting.   Came here on a 1PM Saturday and there was no wait, but I do here it does get crazy busy during dinner times so make sure you have a reservation. Our server was really sweet. The place overall had a calm and chill atmosphere and felt very clean."

                "description": "Best burger in town without a doubt. My friend was singing it's praises for a while and so a group of us showed up all ordering it. Go figure. But it lives up to the hype for sure. It's basically made from trimmings from the butcher shop, so it's ground pretty fresh, seasoned well and honestly tastes almost steak like from the cuts, so highly recommend medium rare or medium on the burger. It's also massive, so no chance you'll leave hungry. Some fresh veg and a nicely toasted bun round off the sandwich. I would also recommend adding some bacon at least to your burger, as it's crisp contrast and who doesn't like bacon.  As if that's not enough, the sides there are also A+. The beef fat fries have a lot of flavor, but also thick enough that you can appreciate the pillowy potato inside. The what I assume house made ketchup adds some needed acidity to all the food but jives well with everything. The shishito pepper app is also really good if you can tolerate a little bit of burn.  Service is a bit on the slow side at the restaurant, so I would definitely recommend getting a reservation if you can but also being patient and just enjoy the decor and conversations with people. The appetizers came out same time as the food too, so waiting an hour for food at 1pm on a Monday afternoon sounds a bit long, but good thing we had good company at least."

                "description": "Brunch today allowed me to check another big name off my list. I heard their Butcher's Burger is the best in Austin, so with nothing else calling to me off the menu, I had to try it. It was ok, I think? It was so tall and hard to eat that it was hard to really process and appreciate the flavor. They cooked it right, but the runny egg made the bun slide everywhere and mayo seemed like overkill. The Beef Fat Fries were pretty good, but not so good that I felt compelled to eat the whole serving. My favorite thing was the Charcuterie Plate that we split before the meal, especially the summer sausage, mortadella, and unidentifiable pink pickles. My friends loved their Steak and Eggs. I tried a bite of a friend's French Toast and would have gladly eaten more! While we were waiting for our food, browsing the butcher shop was interesting, and I liked seeing what products exist even if I wasn't in the market to buy anything. Service was attentive. I'm already planning on coming back again sometime because I know other carnivorous friends will love it. But now it's time for an afternoon nap!"

The reviews don't lie. GET THE BURGER. Oh and the fries were bomb too.   My wife got the BBLT (beef bacon), and I have to say, it was the best BLT I've ever had. On top of favor, the portion was ginormous. Though, it didn't hold up as well as a leftover.   All in all, highly highly recommend, especially once they open dine in.

First and foremost the Beef Tartare is probably one of the best beef tartares I have ever eaten in my life - the mix of flavor was just incredible, and the steak was perfectly diced! I could eat this everyday. Absolutely superb.  We also got the Cesar salad to start which was another hit. For the main we shared the Wagyu NY Strip, side of fries and broccolini, and the sweet corn agnolotti. My ONLY complaint was that there wasn't a larger portion of the agnolotti, delicious stuffed pillows of creamy sweet corn. Service was friendly and hospitable, will definitely be back!"

Covid brought the addition of the upscale butcher shop, complete with many house-made items, terrines and fine meats...very impressive selections.   During Covid they also expanded into a new patio for dining, complete with large overhead fans, which made a very pleasant setting on a warm evening.   My daughter and I enjoyed a really great Charcuterie Board, that included 4 wonderful house-made meats, accoutrements and sauces. We shared it and both loved it.  We also shared their absolutely delicious Butcher Burger, made from steak trimmings. It was cooked perfectly and served on a brioche bun with all the trimmings, and the best French fries we've had in a long time.    We will definitely return to this east side neighborhood gem!!"

                "description": "I love this quiet oasis away from the chaos of other places! The Barolo is really good and I grabbed another bottle today and also picked up a Pinot Grigio.  The wines do not have the chemicals that I don't think should be added. A wine should stand on its own!  \"Custom wine without the chemicals\"  Supremely good! I'm a wine snob as I was raised with it and also living and working around the world I was able to have some of the best wines in the world. No, I am not rich . Wines that are sent to the states are really jacked up in price and I was able to get what I wanted and bring it back. One thing I did learn is that you don't drink an expensive wine as a part of the meals but enjoy it on its own. I bought 2 bottles of Barolo to have with an Italian meal. It was a great fit. This little place has fulfilled the perfect fit! The lady who owns the place and makes the wine is quite nice and understand all of the above. I will be back!"

Then this woman walks in and we made cordial small talk.  I asked if they were open because she seemed quite perturbed that we were inside. Confused because I had seen the open sign. I asked \"Are you open?\"  She said annoyed \"We are getting there....\"  We quickly walked out and will not grace those doors again!  Rudeness doesn't win! Love and kindness wins!!"

                "description": "I'm not a drinker.  I have a low tolerance for alcohol, and wine hits me particularly hard.  But I attended a group wine tasting here with a friend yesterday, and thus our tale begins...  I got there as the second serving of a six-wine tasting was progressing, and I was immediately struck by the smoothness of the wine that was being served at the moment, a Gewurtraminer.  Shortly after sipping that wine, I mentioned that I had almost no tolerance for alcohol.  Steve, the master of ceremonies for the tasting, told the group that Austin Custom Wineries did not add sulphites, the major cause of wine intolerance, into their wine as most wineries do for preservative purposes.  As a result, though the wines should be drunk within five years, the wines are eminently drinkable for even the lightest of weight drinkers like me.  Seriously, I can't even finish a bottle of beer (Shiner).  So I was able to partake in the tasting!  I didn't drink all of each of the wines, but I had more than I normally would have felt comfortable with (to avoid headaches), and I suffered absolutely zero ill effects.  It was amazing.    Also amazing: ACW's selection of dessert wines--ports and ice wines.  Maybe I'm just not a fancy wine connoisseur, but those dessert wines are drinkable and tasty.  And since they have no added sulphites, all I have to worry about is the alcohol content!"

We tasted 6 wines for a $10 fee.  The grape juice is purchased and then the wine maker takes it from there to make several different wines.  The server gave generous pours to ensure we tasted the wines fully.  He used 6 separate wine glasses to ensure we tasted the different wines which I thought was nice.  Most wine places used the same wine glass to sample the wines.  We enjoyed visiting with the owner.  A very pleasant gentleman.  I really recommend visiting this winery with your friends.  If you don't know anything about wine, not to worry because the owner will make sure your wine tasting experience is a positive one."

While the recipes might have changed over the years, they never cease to bring a great selection out every year. The port wines have been some of our favorites, raspberry chocolate port in particular. My husband has always been a fan of their blackberry merlot. We moved north of Austin, but when ever we take a trip to south Austin area, this spot is a must stop! Don't forget to ask about their wine club too; it is a great way to sample the variety of flavors they bring out!"

And the great ciders they serve up certainly do not hurt the wallet or the ambience.  It's so relaxing sitting at the picnic tables out among the oaks listening to your favorite band. Strategically placed fans hidden among the trees aid in making the glade that doubles as a stage tolerable even on 90º days.  In these seemingly never-ending days of the pandemic, it's also refreshing to see the servers masking up indoors and out. I tend not to venture out too much for exactly that reason, but felt totally safe here even when ordering inside the tap room.  Maybe I should keep it a secret, but it's also one of those places you want to share exactly because it is so very special."

The only issue we ran into was that we ordered hummus, and the person taking our order didn't let us know that it didn't come with bread or anything else to eat it with. Considering we had just had a conversation with her about it being our first time there, we're about to present she didn't let us know that important bit of info. Not a big deal, and the person who brought us our food outside asked if we had ordered anything to eat it with and quickly brought us an order of a baguette.  Aside from the establishment itself, the vendors selling goods were all friendly and talented, and the other patrons of the establishment were friendly as well. We struck up several conversations with passers-by.  I would definitely go back!"

                "description": "I have been a long time fan of Texas Keeper Cider. I love the Tap Room, the grounds, the staff and especially the cider. The cider is dry and they make a wide variety of ciders to appeal to many palates.  They have successfully reopened the Tap Room and I decided to have my belated retirement party there. I was able to reserve a space for my large group and the staff was very attentive. If I had one criticism, it would be their food choices.  It's now a make your own picnic, and you choose cheeses, meats, and sides. It's not really a charcuterie tray, as they don't prep the plate.  The cheeses,  meats and bread all need to be sliced.  This made eating difficult with a large group. Most of my guests had to leave early so they could go eat somewhere else.  I know this new menu makes it easier for the staff, and they are a cidery, not a restaurant, but I miss their old menu.  I will still go to Texas Keeper Cider, but may not hang out as long.  (Or make sure I eat beforehand!) Overall, it's a beautiful South Austin gem."

Came on a rainy day with some girlfriends after dinner, and we LOVED it. It reminded me of Jester King Brewery because of the fact that it felt very off-road and secluded. If you're driving at night and a little too fast you might miss the entrance, so slow down as your GPS tells you you're near. The stone cobble walkway is so organic and lovely, that it felt like we were entering into a storytale cottage. Upon entering, everything screams wood and warm pinterest vibes. The three of us sat down at their tall barstool table, and started on our flight! What prices! Normally they do 5 for $9, but they tapped out of one of the selections so we did 4 for $7! Such a great price for the variety of ciders. I loved their hefeweizen + cider combo, and the first cider on their flight list (a name I forgot). Everything was so juicy and tasty, would highly recommend coming back.   The staff is very knowledgeable, and the lady doing the taptending that night was so sweet and helpful. She trusted that we knew which selection we were on during our flight. She also told us that there are five cideries in all of Austin! So for my cider lovers--let's hit all of them up."

                "description": "I don't know why it took me so long to get here but now that I've been, I'll be telling everyone about it and making return trips! If you're a fan of Argus Cidery, you'll like this place. I do think Texas Cider Keeper is making cleaner ciders than Argus (nothing was infected or had off-flavors).   It's easy to miss the entrance, but it's right next to the cemetery! The outdoor space is very quaint but all Texas and has tons of picnic tables. The tasting room is beautiful with butcher block tables and plenty of seating.   We opted for the tasting flight menu which is five 2 oz. pours for $9. Their mainstay Texas Keeper Cider No.1 is dry, refreshing and well balanced. I'm not a fan of sweet ciders, so this was perfect.  I also really liked their Grafter Rose -- which is made with Rome apples and some grapes, which gives it the beautiful rose hue. It's also on the drier side, which is nice.   Our least fave of the five had to be the Cider Weizen, which had a bit too much coriander (and this is coming from a girl who LOVES coriander and hefeweizen beers).   The bartenders were all knowledgeable and really try to give you an explanation of each cider they're pouring (a la a wine tasting).   They also have a tempranillo wine on tap because in Texas it all falls under a \"fruit fermentation\" permit. Apples, wines, it's all the same permit.   I'll be making it a point to come here more often, and I would if traffic getting through downtown and south Austin traffic weren't so bad."

                "description": "My new favorite place in Austin. Love everything about it.  It's basically the only Place I ever want to be. If you haven't been yet- get on the ball!  The cider is so delicious - nothing is overly sweet and they have a good assortment of dry and well-balanced choices. Their sampler is 9$ for 5 generous pours and is a great way to find the cider you like most. For us it's the rose, but the original is a close second. Your best bet is to purchase a bottle and drink affordably. You even get a discount when you purchase bottles to go (although I'm not sure if that's just at the end of the night - we've closed this place down a few times).   We are also big fans of the food. The carrots in a blanket are so yummy and very unique! A must-have. The curried egg salad is a go-to as well. It's made with eggs from their own chickens! They also add pickled veggies on the side which is always a win for me.   The location is so spacious and beautiful. Plenary of tables inside and out. Even a great view from one side where you can watch the sunset over the trees. I've enjoyed live music there and loved the tunes they were playing inside."

It's a beautiful place at night to sit out on the lawn under the string up lights with your dogs and enjoy some cider.  The bartender was awesome and more than glad to educate us on all the stuff that goes into making cider.  Our friends got this HUGE cheese board that was really well priced too."

                "description": "One year later I returned for their 1st Anniversary Party and release of The Grafter Blanc.  For $9.50 (w/fees) your ticket included your admission and 10 oz tulip glass (not the standard 12 oz tulip most breweries sell for $5-6). There were no drink tickets included; all cider and other offerings were for purchase only.  Certainly not the best deal in town....a town full of breweries with taproom festivities.  The Grafter Blanc is definitely my favorite of their ciders, with the perfect balance of acidity, tartness and dryness."

                "description": "Wow! So before coming here I always assumed ciders as overly sweet and flavored froo-froo drinks for those who don't like beer. I have never felt so mislead before! Cider is made from apples (no matter what the flavor), and real, legit cider is found here! It isn't overly sweet and there are many different kinds! Some reminded me of wine and a not-so-Sweet cider mixed together.  At Texas Keep there is room to bring a large group, or even the dogs or kids to run around. There is a small indoor area with games and a huge outdoor area with room to move about and enjoy the Texas sun (or stars).  The people here really enjoy and are PROUD of what they do. They are excited to tell you the story behind the names of the ciders and what they entail. They have seasonals and guest bottles and taps. Normally I would feel gross trying something out of a bottle opposed to tap, but the whole experience was so eye-opening, I didn't care. They told me their 1 bottle of (maybe a 750ml cider) has about 10mg of sugar in it as opposed to he \"cider\" I knew such as Angry Orchard that has upwards of 50mg PER BOTTLE! Yowza- no wonder they were too sweet!  I was definitely iffy about coming here since they didn't serve \"regular beer\", but I'm definitely glad I stepped out of my comfort zone- and you should, too!  Only reason it's not 5 stars- the food \"truck\" setup (not a truck just a station) was out of food by 6:30p on a Saturday night. We had ordered 1 of the 4 items on the menu for our group to try. When we went back to order our favorites, they claimed they were out of everything and turned around and took 1 more order. Annoying. So we ordered a pizza and left early to meet the delivery man at home. Maybe have more food or more options and we would've stayed until the 9p close."

We've been here during all seasons of the year and the property is always gorgeous and inviting. Staff is so knowledgeable and helpful. The kitchen is Now built in to the main tasting room. The fresh house made popcorn is absolutely awesome. This is a family friendly establishment as well and very nice of them to accommodate young children in a pretty adult setting! We are very thankful and grateful and it certainly keeps us as loyal customers."

We brought our dog too but he could not go inside which was challenging even for ordering. Our favorite cider is the No. 1! There was an event going on that sounded fun so we will definitely check out those options. We did not order food, just did a shared tasting. No one came outside to check on us or offer to pour and tell us about the cider which is common when visiting wineries with our dog and friends. It's a cute little spot for a weekend drive."

They had live music on Saturday when we ran into this cute spot.  We ordered a flight of cider and had some garlic kettle corn, but regretted not getting the cheese plate because it would have been perfect with the acidity of the cider.  Zach, who served us, made our experience more memorable.  Definitely a spot to visit when in Austin."

The ciders are dry dry dry and not gross apple soda tasting like Eastciders (barf). \"Stillage\" is amazing."

                "description": "I've been here four times and will keep coming back. The location itself is beautiful - plenty of outdoor space surrounded by forest and a valley. The ciders are so much better than what you find in the beer aisle at the grocery store, and they have a surprisingly large selection. During the week, this is a great place for a quiet, relaxing evening. During the weekends, especially when they are hosting a festival or band, it's a different atmosphere (but still great) - lively and fun, a good place for friends to hang out if they're tired of the usual bar scene.  The only negative preventing Texas Keeper from five stars is the new food menu. While the ciders are fairly priced, the food is anything but. We ordered a cheese and meat tray for $20 and got a platter with barely enough for one person. When we asked for more crackers, they charged us $2 more. Hopefully, this new menu is still a work in progress and they will make adjustments until it is reasonable."

                "description": "My family rode the North Pole Flyer, not so much for the Santa stuff since we have no children under 10, it was more for family fun. And it was a fantastic experience. The train was actually pretty cool, I've never been in a proper train before, I mean, it was old fashioned but still just a really really cool experience. We paid for the private suite and it was worth it, we also walked throughout the train which was a bit old west feeling. My favorite part was walking between cars to see the view unencumbered by windows.   We walked through all the cars (like most people on the train did) to see what the other cars were like. The giftshop car was the nicestest with big windows and plenty of room to walk around while balancing yourself on a rocking and rolling moving train.   Some of the private rooms give you an idea of what is was really like to ride a train across country with a sleeper car, teeny tiny shower, and narrow hallways. It was such a great experience.   Not sure why people complain about the views because mine were fantastic! I mean, c'mon. We live in Texas not Denver. I know what the hill country looks like. There's no mountains but where the hills meet the sky is expansive. It was beautiful."

We loved all the fun facts the volunteers had to share about the train cars and lifestyles of some of the riders back 100+ years. The sunset was magical and the night portion of the ride was really neat, having the moonlight illuminate the tracks in front of us. One of the cars is a dedicated gift shop/concession stand with a variety of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages to choose from. Everyone we came in contact with was so kind and made the experience that much more memorable. Overall such a great time - we would definitely book this experience again!"

Note that you have about 45 mins moving time, then 40 mins stopped for the engine to be brought from the back to the front and then 45 mins back again. You don't really see much of the sunset, and you aren't moving for 2.5 hours. They also assign seats ahead of time, some of the cars were nicer and louder than others, so just depends what you're looking for. The association was responsive on social media when I had questions, staff and crew on board were all very friendly. They dont really follow any of their own posted rules about masks, no personal coolers, etc. so just something to be aware of- but I think this also varied by car. Overall we had a great time and would go again!"

Fortunately for me the plague was in top form. Was in the area looking for sustenance and 'Steam Train Association' showed on the map so I figured to pop in for a quick viddy before lunch. pulled up on a nearly empty lot, a shackled gate, and a locked door, the sign had the now common 'Closed for Plague' message which softened the blow of discovering \"...that the train and rail yard are not open for public tours or photography\" which meant the entirety of the museum was contained in the double-wide corner space in the strip. There's nothing inherently wrong with scenic train rides on vintage rolling stock, I've done it before and it's OK but that's just not my cup of meat. I was here for a bit of museuming but there was no museum to be had - nor postcarding nor touchable cars nor engines :-( sad face"

The Train itself is quite impressive and was my first time on a real train not subway. The First Class Coach option was really nice and the seats were spread out along with social distancing, we felt really comfortable. My only complaint was it was VERY cold outside and though they are climate controlled, it was really cold the first half of the ride - coming back was much more comfortable. I also wished the lay over time perhaps had been 3 hours to provide a little more browsing time in Burnet. It would be cute to do music in each train car from the era the train was made. Ours was built in the late 30's so it would be a nice little touch that's simple to do! They had complimentary snacks and drinks which was a plus. Can't wait to do it again in a private suite!"

The staff was friendly and seemed very knowledgeable about the history of each train car. If you have a chance to walk to the very last car and look out the back, I definitely recommend taking in that view. I would have loved to take a longer trip and will look for other chances to ride.  The website is a little hard to use. We would have really liked a private cabin for our trip but didn't see how to book that on the website.   I wish the volunteer in our car would have been a little less Chatty Cathy when we weren't talking about the ride. It was a bit of a distraction from our enjoyment of the ride. Also, riding during COVID was a bit out of our comfort zone already so we were sad to see at least two volunteers wearing their masks covering only their mouth, not their mouth and nose. The website goes into great detail about precautions and that is a basic one not being taken. (That being said, they did a great job with social distancing and I felt like the train was very clean.)"

                "description": "Enjoyed my first ASTA experience today.  Here's my recap:  - Purchased a First Class Lounge ticket so I had my own room in Rippling Stream  - Train left the station on time, arrived at Burnet on time, and left for Cedar Park on time.   We were only an hour late reaching Cedar Park because a car thought it could outrun the train, but it could not.  Once the accident reporting was complete the train resumed.   - Personal note:  I am a train nerd and love riding trains, so my threshold of being annoyed on a train is higher than most.  This will affect my review below.    THE GOOD:  - clean cars, fun to walk in between them, and if you're without children, the adults only first class cars are a must - Rippling Stream and Nambe.   Otherwise with kids, I would recommend the Maurice Beckham or Eagle Cliff.    - the trip itself is smooth and the volunteers are friendly and helpful.  You can tell they enjoy being there, informing and helping others.     - Burnet has an abundance of antique shops if that's you're thing.  Also the soups at the downtown coffee shop are wonderful.     - The shootout show in Burnet, while not having a worry about winning any acting awards, is fun for the kids and has a good ending.  They could trim some of the fat from it, and make it a more concise / engaging story - there were a few too many awkward pauses.  But I applaud the folks who are likely doing this for free.  And the kids loved it.     THE NOT SO GOOD  - The scenic ride - if you're from the area this should not come as a shocker - is not that scenic.  There's a great bridge over the San Gab river but otherwise it's unremarkable trees, backyards, roads, and strip malls.    But again, none of this bothers me that much because I'm on a train relaxing.    - Burnet:  This is a sleepy, very conservative town.  One sign to deter thieves in a store said, \"We got an alarm.  We got video.  We got guns.  DON'T BE DUMB.\"    While the downtown is a short walk from the train station, 2.5 hours here is way too much time unless you love antiques.   There isn't much else.   And as far as lunch goes, I highly recommend walking a bit farther past the first couple restaurants or else you'll have long wait times.   I went to a deli just a couple blocks away and it had no line.      - Announcements:  there are few.  Nothing along the way to alert you to landmarks or scenic opportunities (there is really just one, the bridge over the river).   But it would be nice to hear more than the pre recorded departure / arrival ones.    - The warm soft drinks:  no one wants green tea or apple juice at room temp.  There was literally an ice bucket next to these (but for scoping ice).  A second one to put these beverages on ice would go a long way.    - Lack of variety in snacks:  for a first class experience, at least more than the mini lemon cakes and mini cinnamon rolls would be nice.  Some savory, perhaps?   - chairs in the RS lounge car are what you'd find at your local dentist's waiting room.  I expected something that would at least remain comfy for 1.5 hours at a time.      OVERALL. - for the price I paid, it's 4/5 stars.  I knew the scenery wasn't going to awe, so most of my ranking is based on the train experience inside.  The quibbles above are all minor; chill the drinks, add some pretzels, get someone to donate an old leather chair or 2, and be a bit more chatty with us.    Those who really ranked their train ride low usually fall into the following categories, so please take them with a grain of salt:  - a/c sucked because it was Austin in the summer (hopefully fixable but not all that surprising) - solution is to go when it's not hot, the 60 days out of the year it's under 99 degrees.  I also think they have ironed out most of the a/c issues by now.    - Burnet was terrible, Burnet food was terrible, etc.  It's Burnet.  There's a reason it's not as well known as Fredericksburg.  You walk a bit father to get away from the crowds, you cross check their list of lunch spots they give you when you board  with a quick glance of Yelp reviews and you roll the dice.    - scenery sucked, super ghetto, etc.   Maybe because I grew up in St Louis, but using the word ghetto here is laughable at best.  It's junky, yes.  Unkempt, sure.   And truly, if you live in the region, you should know better than to expect breathtaking views.  You've driven on 183 east of 35?.  Same views.   If you're from out of town I could see valid point here since the website pushes it hard that it's scenic - but us locals know how much lipstick you can put on this pig.   So go check it out!  But go First Class if possible.  And be flexible about being home on time; like with any train, delays can happen."

                "description": "We rode the Hill Country Flyer which departs from the Cedar Park station and goes to Burnet, Texas,  where there is a two-hour layover so that passengers can disembark, do some shopping or grab some lunch or both.   Before leaving, the Burnet Gunfighters put on a show which is free to passengers, although they do accept donations.   The scenery leaves a lot to be desired, however that is not something that the Steam Train Foundation can control, they have a designated track and can not control who builds subdivisions or places gravel pits along the route.   If you are looking for a beautiful scenic ride, this probably isn't for you.  However, if you want to experience riding on a passenger train, and learning about the history of the railroads, it is a great experience.     They are very careful with social distancing and we felt completely safe riding the train.  I spoke with a couple of families that had young children and they loved it!   All in all, I would recommend it as a very enjoyable way to spend the day."

                "description": "I rode the Sunset Express on 5-29-21 with my family, while on a trip to visit Austin. I'm from Southern California (this is important later). The scenery was certainly nice in some spots, but not enough. The sunset was awesome, but the experience wasn't that great. We paid for first class and rode aboard Eagle Cliff. Some basic drinks and snacks were provided, but the train was understaffed. No attendant for our car. One very sweet elderly volunteer was doing her best to handle two cars at once. I decided to offer to help, which she was very appreciative of. She said it was great that I wanted to help and so I did. I helped stock drinks and snacks as well as stocked ice to keep the drinks cold. Later on, a female volunteer who looked to be in her 40s came up to the counter said \"Sir, you cannot be back there, what do you need?\" I explained the situation, and she kind of had an attitude. I was informed in a rude tone that I had to be a member to help, and was given no thank you. Being that I live in Southern California, there's no way I could really be a member. While all this was happening, the AC in the car was doing a very poor job at keeping the car cold. It was unbearably hot in there, and everyone in the car was complaining. The excuse given was that the car is vintage and has a lot of runtime. The car was very original, and you could tell. That roughly translates to \"we don't have the money or people to keep this car in tip top shape, and we don't have the money to upgrade it\".  Eventually, my family was re-seated to the Rippling Stream. That was much better, but it didn't change the overall experience. Cherry on top was we were over an hour late returning to the Cedar Park station.   Not worth the money."

                "description": "We also did the Xmas Polar Express train ride. Tickets were about $50 each. We also went with a friend and their kids too.   I'll give this train ride 4 stars. The kids were excited to see Santa and the ride was slow at times.   To start, one of the first things was a balloon guy. Ours was awesome. He was funny and overall entertaining. He had me laughing my @ss off.   Next came hot chocolate... it's hot chocolate.   After that was, singing Christmas Carols. They had 2 girls from McNeil high school. I felt sorry for them. They were nice, but they couldn't just get our car interested in singing.  A few of us sang, but overall it was a failure. I'm sure adult beverages if allowed/served would help the spirit. Great job to them but our car was mostly interested. It probably didn't help that they gave us a cookie just before they arrived so everyone was stuffing their face.   After that was story time, the lady reading the Story was animated and funny. Kudos to her.   She visited just before Santa.   Then Santa came. We were in one of the last cars so his visit was a bit rushed. He was nice and gave everyone a wooden train whistle.   ***********The entire operation is run by volunteers. So I'd like to thank all of them for their time!*******  This was he first time my son was not afraid of Santa:-)"

Super We stayed in the Turquoise Room, which consisted of 2 tables, 8 chairs and two smaller windows. Staff was super friendly and knowledgeable...Once the train started the conductor came in to room to announce that there we several open seats in the main car...everyone got up and left leaving the wife and I in peace...Not that we are anti social, but it was peaceful to say the least...Good to catch up with each other, as we both work different hours...Truly not much to see on the way up...but it was a great ride....AC did work, not great but tolerable...I see in other reviews there were issues...You have freedom to roam Car to Car once the train gets rolling...and the train does turn around in Burnet...hard to explain, but it does...and we were able to see the other side of the tracks on the way home...Plenty to see and eat in Burnet...Our Car/cabin also came with free snacks and drinks...which is a great perk..as the snacks in the concession stand were quit expensive...The trip was worth it for us and will do it again next year with the granddaughter.."

                "description": "This review is based on my customer service experience with Zena, not the train ride itself (although I may come back and give an update!)  Zena is a lifesaver. Not literally, but she has made my train experience 2x as good. I bought a Groupon because I didn't even realize there was a train experience in Austin. After the headache of scheduling, our trip got canceled. Zena came in to save the day. She mailed me another gift certificate that expired in a year (vs the next week per my Groupon) AND she gifted us a little extra!  Sounds great, right? Unfortunately, the GC could not be redeemed online. After multiple tries of calling in (and getting a forever ring - no pick up), I was getting irritated.   I emailed Zena back asking for her advice. She wrote back in 24 hours and apologized for their phone service. She even offered to reserve me herself. After a few back-and-forth emails, she answered all my questions and got us all squared away.  Our train ride happens this weekend and I can only hope that the experience is similar to Zena's customer service."

                "description": "It's such an adorable idea - volunteers running a historic train line on weekends to give people an authentic experience. But the train is slow - really really slow. The view is simple and unmemorable. The FandB in the first class is simply a cinnamon roll and lemon cake with tea. They do have apples and oranges as well. The trip back was painful - we stood in the concession cart the entire time because the A/Cs didn't work and it was triple-digit hot on a September Saturday. Even my 5-year-old nephew, who is obsessed with trains and knows all there is to know about them, wasn't engaged in this ride much. Thankfully, we had carried board games and our own food so the ride to Burnet was okay but the ride back was really terrible."

                "description": "The most horrible rip off of an experience I have ever had. I bought 4 tickets for the VIP lounge which included treats and drinks and a nicer car, it was none of those things. The food offered were store bought generic cookies and the drinks were either warm apple juice or water. The car lost the A.C. capacity on the return from the small town with nothing to offer and did not even have the gun fight reenactment due to the extreme heat, now imagine that extreme heat inside a metal sardine box. I invited my 72 year old father and I was genuinely worried we would have to rush him to the emergency room upon arrival. I chewed the place out for their false advertisement and putting the elderly and children at risk in the extreme heat without AC.   In summation, do not buy tickets to any of the events this was a horrible experience. I got my money almost a month later, and I will never return and I will warn anyone thinking about ever going to one of these fiascos."

We booked tickets on the Sunset Express trip. The Staff was all very friendly and knowledgeable.   You are able to bring your own drinks (non alcoholic) and snacks which is a plus. They do have a concessions car which is nice.   To us the trip was not as much about the scenery as it was the experience of a mode of travel long since gone."

Just jump off the train, and there you are.  Each train car has it's own characteristics, but take my word, spend the extra money for the air conditioned cars.  We had a chance to walk through the other cars, and even on a beautiful spring day, you can tell a big difference walking into the cars without A/C.  We rode on the City of Chicago, in a table for two, which had great views.  There was complimentary water, tea and snacks on our car.  The volunteer, Barbara, was informative about the train, wildflowers, and announced points of interest on the route."

                "description": "My family and I took a ride on the Hill Country Flyer and this a brief overview of our experience and I recommend you heed this review well.  ----------------------------  I visited and rode the September 7th 10:00 am to 5:00 pm ride to Burnett going out of Cedar Park Wirth the Austin Steam Train Association and I'd like to share my experience that day.   To begin the train left 20 minutes late from the terminal when it was communicated the train would be leaving promptly and on time consistently. Which is fine although it did negatively impact the quality of time spent in Burnett and exploring the town which was a key experience in the advertised outing. Another large disappointment was the lack of the advertised western gun fight. We saw no mention of it, nor display of it. Apparently that was another misrepresentation of the trip. It was advertised we would have two hours to explore downtown Burnett and have lunch. This was barely enough time to visit a local restaurant flooding with business from both local lunchtime and other passengers. With barely an hour in Burnett without enough time to eat we actually had to leave the restaurant we were at in a manic frenzy without eating, apologize to the staff at the restaurant for our rush due to this,and return to the train. Then upon returning at the specified time we still not even begin the process of departing until nearly 30 minutes past the time we were told to return! The. On the return trip we didn't even get above 10 mph on the speed making for a grueling and arduous journey back creating an atmosphere on complete misery on the entire train. On top of all of that the trains expected time to return was 5:00 we did not return until after 5:30! This is insane it officially help derail our entire vacation plan and helped out more of a strain on our time off. Meaning we had to rush and adjust our original plans.   Another issue with the experience was there little to no a/c in rear car named Rippling Stream on a day with temperatures rising above 95 degrees! Although the next car over had perfect a/c with a lower priced ticket. Paying for six tickets @55 dollars to sit in the heat in pool of our own sweat was not the idea of a luxury car provided by marketing materials. We actually had to use the pamphlets provided to make fans in order to be comfortable during the ride and continuously go into the other cars for refuge from the sweltering heat. Upon informing staff of the issue we were told once the train is moving we can go to other cars and stand in the cool air to gain some reprise from the heat.This is insane as we bought out the entire private room to have a bonding family experience we certainly were unable to enjoy. Also this car represented itself as a purchase of an adults only car ticket and children were running through the car. We wanted an experience that would supply with a relaxing adult atmosphere that was negatively impacted by this not being enforced.   Another major concern of mine is lack of communication from staff with the private areas of the train. Announcements regarding safety, departure time, arrival, landmarks etc were unheard in the private room and no effort was made by train personnel to inform us of anything. We were left alone with no information about anything given without having to seek out an attendant regularly. To mention with sound there was also an almost constant excessively loud screeching noise as we moved along at a slugs pace that I feel each passenger will hear in their nightmares of this ride for years to come.   This experience wound up being more stressful due to the previously mentioned circumstances causing our trip to be unenjoyable. Due to the dishonest representation of a truly climate controlled car, and times for departure misrepresented. Unfortunately this is not an outing that we would attended again or recommend to others visiting the Austin/Hill Country area. This is not something we would recommend for anyone trying to relax or enjoy a vacation."

We barely heard from our waitress/hostess the whole time we were there.   The wine was just disgusting and overpriced. Of the bottles we purchased, the pinot grigio was the only decent one, which wasn't even made by this winery.

It was our first time there. Tasting was $20 per person. Seems like the price has gone up from recent years based on the prior reviews. Not a big deal. At the end of the tasting, I bought 3 bottles. The staff came over with an iPad, charged me the three bottles plus the tasting, told me to sign on an iPad and asked for my email. She said that she would email me the receipt. I never got the receipt. Saw the charge on my cc bill which did not seem to make sense. I emailed them and then called them requesting a receipt to be sent to my email. Apparently, when they charged me, a 20% tip was automatically added by default to the TOTAL (including the wine bottles that I purchased) . Not just to the tasting. I called and spoke to them Bc I felt that this was not appropriate. I don't mind tipping on the service but on the wine bottles that I am purchasing to take home?? I was pretty much told by the staff tough luck. I have been to many tastings in the past and this was definitely new for me. It's not the end of the world but it's the principles..you know. Definitely will not be back and would not recommend to anyone."

                "description": "Beautiful estate. The owner came over and talked to us and was so sweet and pleasant to talk to. The woman, Lauren, who walked us through our tasting was equally as sweet, friendly, and knowledgable of all their wines- which were delicious. Very light reds, European style. So if you're into more California/west coast style wines, it'll be a bit different for you. If you're looking to do a large party I'd recommend giving them a call in advance to help set up for your group to give you the best experience possible. Large space, beautiful building, yet feels very cozy. Definitely a great spot to hit on your day trip through wine country in the Hill Country. (Their Sangiovese and Cab 2015 were incredible.)"

                "description": "Nice little place but nothing to really write home about. We arrived on a Saturday afternoon and unfortunately there were at least 2 bridal parties there.  It was very loud in the tasting area and it appeared they had only 2-3 people working.  They mentioned they had not expected such a large influx of people.  They did their best, but it was very hard to hear and they were bouncing back and forth between a lot of people trying to pay and split checks and do pours, etc.  Yes, the pours were very small and it was $15 each which is kind of pricey for that size and the wines that to me were very light.  I like bold flavors, not fruity and these were not bad, but not worth the price for me.  If there had not been so many people and it be so loud it might have been a little better, but we will not go back- crowded or not."

The wines we tried were unique but not to justify paying 28-48 per bottle, yes it's \"small batch\" but if they're that much the tasting should be comped."

                "description": "Was out in the hill country this weekend with a friend just meandering around during our staycation. We stopped at Jester King before this and just looked for cool places nearby when Solaro Estate popped up on the map. Wine, closeby? Sold.   Since we'd never been there before, we each decided to do a tasting so we could try their 6 best wines. Their whites were crisp and refreshing, but I didn't fancy any of the reds. I usually love pretty much all reds and favor them much more than whites, so there's a good chance my tastebuds were just all out of whack this weekend.  When we finished our tastings, it was raining cats and dogs out, so we decided to have a full glass of white and sit outside to watch and listen to the rain fall on their tin roof patio. It was glorious, even when the rain got so intense that literally everyone else who was outside went inside to hide from the aggressive mist. Since my friend and I are classy AF, we were in workout clothing and makeup-less, so we didn't mind the rain one bit. It was extremely peaceful, and seeing the gorgeous rows of grape vines behind the veil of rain was a memory I won't soon forget.   I'll be back for sure!"

                "description": "I just recently moved from Switzerland, and was surrounded by fantastic wine tasting experiences.  I was nervous about trying Texan wine, but started my Texan wine experience at Solaro after having read many different experiences about the local vineyards around the Dripping Springs area.   The tasting room is located in the vineyard, which is great. I love that this is a small production place, with a family oriented feeling, and the staff are knowledgeable about the wine and production.  I guess the owners can often be found in the tasting room, but just happened to be away the Saturday we went.  They often have events, and we were enjoying one of their Saturday live music events from 2-4pm.  They have a great indoor and outdoor seating area full of charm.    For $10 per person you can enjoy a tasting of their varietals.  There was nothing that was bad, but from the tasting list, I enjoyed the Miscela Bianco the best. After enjoying all their selections, I signed up for their annual wine club, which was a great deal, and then was able to taste some of their higher quality more expensive wines, which were great.  I look forward to going back and touring the vineyard, as a benefit of being a member.  We also signed up for the grape stomping that will be taking place in the next couple of weeks as they need a bunch of people.  What a great opportunity to be part of a grape harvest!  I could have spent several hours just hanging out here. I only wish they had some food to enjoy with the wine and music.  Next time I will remember to bring my own picnic.    I am very happy to have been proven wrong regarding my concerns about Texan wine! Thank you Solaro!"

I would come back again but not to fast for many wineries are available in the area. Very expensive for average wine. I felt my husband and I were having to hear a full explosive bragging about the winery and we didn't have the time to sit and enjoy our wine. We ordered the small plate of cheese and breads very tiny late serving us and felt they are money hungry and desperate to sell you anything over inflated and sadly I have to tell it like it is reason for my review to tell all what is happening at this winery.SO if you feel compelled to come to this winery visit and try to enjoy your wine over a not so interesting view. Furthermore the owner learning I write reviews on Yelp made it clear we are not taken seriously. Wow what a blow."

At first glance, this place looks promising, but by the end of the day my party of six all felt robbed by the service and awful wine tasting we endured.  We spent less than 10 minutes at the winery and at $16.50 each for five tiny pours, we all wondered if we would have been better off going to Walmart and buying a bottle of $16.00 Yellow Tail. So disappointing. Don't waste your time."

We were a bit skeptical because of its limited reviews on yelp but I'm so glad we went and tried it out. Their wine is great, their flights are customized to your individual pallet, and their charcuterie board is to die for. If you go during the summer be sure to try their peach/apricot wine. I thought it would be way too sweet for my liking but it was a great refreshing summer drink! They are located in a small development that also has a few shops, a bakery, and Nate's coffee and cocktails right next to it... and we can't forget, this place is only two blocks from Louies barbecue"

If your hungry they don't have a full menu but they do at least sell finger food snack items. They also sell great local spices, maple syrup, olive oil, and other great items.  Great stop at Georgetown square!!"

We landed in this wine room and ended up sitting for a wine flight, good conversation, and lots of laughs. While we didn't get a wine membership we did buy 2 bottles and cigars for Dad. The staff was lovely and their COVID practices made us feel safe."

You can do the wine tasting but have to be seated. I had a red blend and my husband had cranberry. They both were sweet and light, which is just what we were in the mood for. I didn't want to carry bottles around the square but next time I'll take a few home."

My friend and I were greeted promptly and given an overview of the wines for our flight-sampler. We scored a small table. This was a huge win as there are limited seats, I believe up to 25 seats. The staff checked in on us as we tasted our way thru the wines. When we finished tasting, we bought a glass of our fave wine and continued to walk through market days on the square.  Anywho, if your walking the Georgetown Square, stop in for a tasting and or a glass or 2. Cheers."

                "description": "The wife and I visited Georgetown Winery for our second tasting of the day on the square. After a more upscale experience in a different tasting room on the square, it was pleasant to ease into this more relaxed space. We were promptly greeted by the hostess, who became our server, and perused the menu of wines. $10 each for a sampling of 4 wines. Nice price, and fitting to the setting which would have been appropriate for beer as well. Neither of us remembers which wines we ordered, except for my two port samplings, but neither of us was overly impressed either. My ports were good, if extremely sweet and fruity, and the wife liked 2 of hers. She was disappointed in her first choice, which was the most expensive wine on the menu as priced by the bottle.  We didn't buy a bottle, nor would we return if we ever visit Georgetown again, but the ambience and carefree environment did add to an overall relaxing day on the square."

Lots of fun wine related plaques, signs, wine toppers, shelves full of bottles and every imaginable gift item for wine lovers. Nice indoor garden feel from the string lights lining above your head. Very rustic and cozy feel with all of the wood from wall to wall shelves to tables and chairs and floors. They serve wine in plastic cups. In the back there are olive oils to try out."

                "description": "Georgetown Winery is an adorable little handout in the heart of Georgetown. This is a great spot for a date night, girls night, or just an afternoon with a small group of friends or family. The actual vineyard is located in Rockdale Texas- this is just a small tasting room right on the Georgetown Square.   For $10, you can taste 4 wines. My spouse also got 4 tasting, so in total- I got to sample 8 wines. My favorite was the Big Tex which is aged for 9 months in oak. A full bottle will set you back only $24. Create price for the quality.  I also love their Viognier, I love white wines- and this was so light. I would casually sip this on any warm summer day. One thing I didn't love their fruity wines. The Blueberry and Blackberry wines tasted like they used artificial flavoring. The couple next to use was absolutely loving the blackberry, so maybe it just wasn't for me. Totally fair.   They also have cheese and crackers available. I feel like any wine tasting isn't complete without a good cheese plate. Unfortunately, we had dinner plans right after, so I enjoyed my wine cheese-free.   I absolutely plan on coming back here soon for some wine + cheese."

We are wine club members and LOVE this place ($50 per quarter gets you 2 tastings, 6 full glasses, and 2 whole bottles of wine). The perfect spot to enjoy some quality wine and some quality time with friends and family. We always bring cards or a board game and have a blast."

Will not return. Will continue to visit  the other Georgetown in South Carolina where people are more welcoming to all."

My friends and I have only been members of this winery for about a year, but this is honestly one of our favorite locations to consistently come and visit when we're all together. They have sweeter drinks and wineritas for people who aren't fond of dry wines and their wine club memberships are literally built to be shared. There is table seating inside where you can sit for hours and catch up. Laurie and Heather in particular are so sweet with their service and their recommendations. I can't think of where else I would rather spend my weekend."

My partner liked two of the reds so much she bought a bottle of each.  This is a long narrow shop that has lots of knick-knack items displayed so we did not move around much, but it was fun to read all the funny quotes on the signs and towels and glasses, etc. The folks at the bar were helpful and friendly, and we enjoyed this visit much more than our first."

Any day of the week. And I know from experience.   I don't bother doing the tastings here - I know exactly what I like. Their unoaked chardonnay is butter and smooth. After that I move over to their pinot noir - which isn't too sweet but not so dry that I need to carry in my own water bottle. I do not drink fruit wines but my sweet lil granny does and she swears by the pomegranate and blueberry.   You can buy gifts and chochskies here. I always like to pick up a few bottles of wine before I had home to visit family. Their wine club is probably the best you can be apart of in terms of benefits.   I would really like if they would provide bread so that we can try the olive oils. Probably smart that they don't do that or else all of us winos would use that as food. :)"

Never knew anything about Georgetown except that it was an annoying mile marker on Interstate Hell-35 indicating after driving north for an hour you have gone nowhere.  Low and behold there is actually an ancient town square buried in there somewhere. So what else to do but gravitate like a bee to flower and find the alcohol. It's here and it's called wine.  The place is filled full on a steamy June Saturday afternoon. Saddle up to the bar and start in on the tasting. I was in a red mood and took 4 tastes.  The chambourcin was an interesting new grape for me and it was deeply dark in color yet light on the tannins. It was nice but I like tannin and the Tempranillo delivered on all counts.  It was a nice pit stop and I recommend it if you accidentally end up touring the square of Georgetown."

There was no menu with the prices/wine choices listed, and only one red wine available.  We were served a taste, and it admittedly was not the best red wine we've ever tasted, but decided to go for a glass since that was all they had.  When we were told our total was $27 for 2 glasses of wine, I almost hit the floor.  A bit on the spot, as we had already been served and did't want to be rude, we reluctantly paid for it,  however we did not enjoy the wine nor time there because we felt like we had been seriously ripped off.   She was apologetic while ringing us up, but it would have been nice to have been informed the price, or at least charge us for a \"normal\" glass of wine seeing that was the only option for red.  In looking at the photo of the menu on this page, there isn't even a glass over $12, so wondering what we were served?!?!"

                "description": "My friends and I went on a wine tour for our friend's birthday party the first weekend in August and it was great!   From the beginning stages of planning, Francesca, (the owner, planner, driver, etc.) worked her hardest to make sure the event was personalized for our group. Fran was also very quick with correspondence and letting me know important information and what she needed from me.   We decided that the Wimberly/Dripping Springs tour was the best route for us since a lot of people had already been to Fredericksburg wineries. Fran picked us up at 9am in Round Rock (she'll work with you on your pick up/drop off site) and she drove us around in an air conditioned mini tour bus! Did I mention that the bus is BYOB?! We brought on our own ice chests and bags for snacks which was great for the 45 minute trip we had! Fran also has a DVD/CD player on the bus but we brought our own speakers for our iPod. She also had tips on wine tasting and a map of the wine country for us to take a look at on the road.   We went to three wineries and an olive oil orchard. It was so hot outside for the olive oil orchard that our group decided to leave early but the rest of the wineries were all inside and all of the staff at the wineries were so nice and informative. One of our friends even bought a case of wine from one of them! Remember to bring money with you in case you fall in love with one or more of the delicious Texas wines that you have to buy a bottle or two!   Fran also arranged for our group to have Saltlick bbq plates for us at one of the wineries! Our group pre-ordered either turkey, chopped beef, sliced beef, etc. We had our sandwich with potato salad, coleslaw, beans (the best beans I've had in awhile), extra delicious seasame seed bread, extra bbq sauce, Tiff's Treats cookies, Sweet Leaf Tea, water, etc. etc.! It was a lovely lunch outside at the winery. We were all so full! But all of that came in the price of the tour! Fran even got us a deal with a cake-maker and we had a birthday cake waiting for our friend along with candles to surprise her!  Fran and her business associate, Melinda, were with us during every tour and let us know when we needed to move on to the next winery. They really made sure we that were ok and having a great time. They even had patience to take pictures of us with our multiple cameras.   We all headed back around 4pm and returned safe and sound (and still pumped up from the awesome day) around 5pm. All in all, it was a great day! Fran really has a great business and will personalize tours for all types of groups. She's very professional and you can tell she takes pride in what she does and will go the extra mile to make you feel your group is top priority! We'll definitely be going back to try more tours with L'Avventura Dolce, especially when the weather cools down! Great job!"

The experience was everything I would want in a day trip - fun, relaxing and informative. Francesca is the outfit's owner, and is also the engaging tour guide. Her commitment to customer service is stellar. She also donated a portion of the day's proceeds to Love-A-Bull, which made the trip extra special. The experience was so positive, I wrote a review about it here: https://chantellewallace.com/2014/02/12/hill-country-wine-tours-with-lavventura-dolce"

                "description": "I'm torn writing this review.  We booked their bus for a winery tour for my bachelorette party, and they unfortunately ruined it (really by no fault of theirs...but still).  We were scheduled for pick up at 1.  At 12:30, they called to say that their bus broke down and that they would be an hour and a half late.  At 2:30, they finally showed up in an old, dirty van.  My group and I were squished together with all our things, and what's worse is that we couldn't really see or talk to one another.  The speaker system rattled and was distracting.  Also, since the wineries close at 6, our tour was cut drastically short, and we had to rush.  We also had someone who had to leave early, so in turn, had to miss the entire tour.    The only redeeming quality was the excellent customer service of the company.  Both the driver and the owner were truly wonderful and apologetic.  I know that these things happen, but I do think that having an acceptable backup vehicle is important."

Our host guided us on a tour of the Christmas lights in Wimberley, TX (at the EmilyAnn Theatre which was 9 acres of amazing holidays lights - one of the best light displays I've ever seen in my life) and in Johnson City, TX.  My friends and I had an amazing time, as did the rest of the bus based on the jovial environment (laughter, singer, and a showing of \"The Christmas Story\") created by our host and bus driver.  L'Avventura Dolce's Christmas Light tour will definitely be one of my new Christmas traditions.  Hopefully, other special events are in store for the future.   Cheers!"

Our tour guide, Ray, went above and beyond to make sure we had the best experience possible.  We stopped at both the birthplace and childhood homes of LBJ before visiting the Ranch, where we toured the home he and Lady Bird resided, we then spent a couple hours in the quaint German town of Fredericksburg where we enjoyed lunch and a little shopping.  Then a quick stop at Luckenbach Texas, where they were having a food truck festival and live music.  We were impressed with this tour and encourage others to give it a try.  Thank you again Ray for making it a great day!"

However, I'm giving this a one star because on the shuttle while performing karaoke the staff allowed a white passenger to say various racial slurs on the mic without immediately removing the woman away from the microphone, they didn't even attend to condemn or stop her. At the very least they could have stoped karaoke or stopped playing songs that allowed people to say those slurs so loudly and confidently. As the only black person on the bus it was extremely uncomfortable and dealt with inappropriately. Don't plan on ever using their services again."

We ended up being forced to wait until 5 PM before departing and missed a good portion of the concert we were being shuttled to.  Additionally, we were separated from the rest of our group who had boarded the 3:30 shuttle seconds earlier. The concert began at 5 PM. It was clear that passengers who had booked later ticket times were given our seats on the 3:30 PM shuttle instead of us.   Upon departure from the concert, the bus location changed several times which caused a ton of confusion amongst the passengers.   To top it off, repeated attempts to reach out to Tour Austin to remedy the situation have failed.  They have continued to ignore my emails regarding the issues but seem to be able to still send me emails asking for a Yelp rating, so here it is...

When we booked the trip no one said there would be an extra cost once you got to the shuttle in Fredericksburg so that was a lil confusing, but ok, disappointed but we can still enjoy ourselves. Wait 1st off, We left a little late but no big deal, then we get there and there is the extra \"no tell\" charge issues, no big deal. We walk the district have a great time back on the bus we'll within the time frame. However, the tour guide not only made us wait and extra 30 mins for 2 other ppl, but we had to sit through CONSTANT arguing about it. We finally leave and THE MOST repulsive individual strung together profanity from Fredericksburg to Austin in a non-stop fashion. The tour guide never asked him to calm down, or to show a little respect for other people in such close quarters....noooo he joined in. They talked about everything from carrying a knife to giving away 15 different types of \"weed!!\" I nor my friends and everybody we can tell in AUSTIN will EVER take Austin Tours again. I know we keep Austin \"weird\" but the amount of $ we paid for this trip should allow a certain amount of customer service. So sad- we are still PISSED!"

I'm not too familiar with wine, so Nancy made a fabulous suggestion. The sparkling wine Naveran hit the spot!   The ambiance is chill, so you want to stay awhile. She has beautiful local art decorating the indoors and plenty of outdoor seating. There is also lovely music playing in the background, and just a friendly place! Will definitely make it a must visit spot on trips to Wimberley!"

It turned out to be the best decision; there was a huge event (and beautiful weather) so the heart of Wimberley was PACKED. This place is a bit outside of the main part of town and had plenty of parking, and the best part was it was not crowded. :) They've got minimal seating inside, but plenty of outdoor seating. They also have a nice selection of both beer and wine, plus some yummy snacks (like edamame and hummus!). My friend and I both opted for the wine flight: 4 tasters of wine ranging from red to white to bubbly, all great, and the staff was attentive and ready with the next pour in order to keep the cold ones cold. We had a lovely experience. I definitely recommend if you're near the area!"

This little house is full of rooms and nooks that give it a very intimate feel where you and your friends and family can congregate and feel at home. The bar is loaded full of wines and the staff here isn't shy in regards to providing you with samples and information on each of them.  I don't know very much about wine, but was able to follow along and still get an enjoyable experience out of what they had to offer here. We came on a Sunday afternoon so you know I had to try the mimosa out. Crisp, clean, and refreshing!  Be prepared to shell out some $$ as this place isn't the cheapest option, but you do get a high quality and a large amount of variety which is hard to find in Texas.  Support this local business and lets keep their doors open! Spots like this are hard to come by."

Today I did wine tasting for six dollars a for several wine tastings plus you get a cute small wine glass for free. Delightful place to take your spouse or date.  The host is very smart about the wines they sell here and enjoyed the smooth wines tastings I received. It located downtown Wimberly so you can't miss it. I certainly will visit again soon. It does cost a few dollars more but worth the fun you have visiting such a cute cosy wine store. So stop in and see what I mean .....happy wine hunting!!!"

We had ~50 people with an outside catered buffet dinner, and the venue was the perfect size - it still felt intimate during the speeches, but there was enough room for everyone to sit, eat, and mingle. The layout worked really well for us - for dinner, people could sit and eat on both the ground floor and mezzanine, and for speeches people mingled on the ground floor while the speeches were held on the landing. We love the atmosphere there - a combination of industrial, rustic, and chic that totally matched the vibe we were going for!  Planning was a breeze too - first Lindsey and then Deepa were both so accommodating and answered all our questions. Especially compared to some of the other venues I was talking to, Hill Country Tasting Room responded so quickly, kindly, and didn't mind when I asked a bunch of questions! I would definitely recommend them for hosting an event.  The drinks themselves were also amazing. We loved that it was all Texas beverages, and there were so many options! We were so glad to find a place that offered such a wide variety.  On the actual night of the rehearsal dinner, the bartenders were so helpful - I even got comments back from a couple of guests stating how nice they were! I can't wait until our next visit to the Dripping Springs area - we are definitely going back!"

The staff were very friendly and knowledgeable about the selections they were carrying and they were able to make great recommendations based on our tastes. They have reasonable prices, they were in line with the other tasting rooms we had visited during the day. Their concept was awesome! Their selection is from local craft breweries and wineries and rotates between different companies. They also had the beverages available to take home if you found one, or more, you enjoyed."

                "description": "Two friends and I went to Driftwood Tasting Room and asked to do a wine tasting. The only employee there, Antonio, said the tasting would be $8 for four tastings. The menu had a long list of beer, mead, and cider as well as wine. We asked if we could mix and match the tastings between these drinks, and the employee said yes. We then asked, several times, if this would still be $8 for the tasting. He again said yes. When we went to pay, we discovered that our bill came out to more than twice that amount. Apparently, the tasting was not $8. He told my friends that we received full pours, and that's why it was more. Here's the thing, WE DIDNT ASK FOR FULL POURS; we asked for a tasting. The employee took it upon himself to give us the full pours, which we did not ask for and shouldn't have had to pay for. We left upset and confused as to what happened. One of my friends went back into the establishment to discuss a refund. We didn't want to all three go in and cause a scene, since the man was kind to us, we just wanted to remedy the situation. Apparently, he reexplained the full pours THAT WE DIDNT ASK FOR and then offered my friend $10 out of his pocket. She felt guilty about this and didn't ask for compensation for the other two of us that did a tasting. I repeat, tasting and not full pour. I'm not sure why he would offer us his own money instead of trying to correct the problem initially. Maybe he knew he was wrong? Or maybe he just wanted us to go away and not complain? I really don't know why he would do that. We discussed it more and felt upset about the whole situation and how it was awkwardly handled. It was a damper on what was supposed to be a nice day out. I decided to contact management through the Driftwood Tasting Room's Facebook page the next day to see if we could be fully refunded for the employee's mistake. I explained everything to the manager, Lindsey Pierce, who, of course defended the employee. I understand this, and I have nothing against the employee, but a mistake was made and I wanted it corrected. I didn't mention the $10, since it went to my friend who spoke to the employee. Apparently, this gave the manager reason to believe that I was lying. She said that my friends could contact her for a refund and I could get one after I returned the $10 cash, which I didn't even get, but ok. I mentioned how she was treating me like I was lying and like I was a criminal for complaining about what happened. Lindsey Pierce then THREATENED to take me to SMALL CLAIMS COURT for SLANDER for writing this negative review. All I tried to do was express my dissatisfaction and try to get a refund, and the manager treated me so impolitely and with such disrespect. I would never want to go to a place where the management treats a customer so rudely. There are better places down the road where the servers charge you what you expect to be charged and the managers are polite and genuinely care about your experience at the winery. I'd avoid this place at all costs simply because of how the management treated me when I tried to explain what happened."

                "description": "This place is a hidden gem and definitely a much needed place for the growing area. It has huge potential and I hope they get enough business to stay in business! I live nearby and it's a nice place to grab a drink. Beautiful interior! The glasses of wine were a little pricey compared to the nearby vineyards but everything else seemed reasonable. The guy serving my friend and I was super friendly and helpful I hope they continue to have great service. The only things I would recommend would be to maybe add a couple TVs without sound on to keep some of the guys happy should there be UT games or golf on. The bar is a beautiful spot to hang out. I'd also recommend having some nice big glass jars with some pub mix or nuts in that folks could purchase by the scoop and maybe even a cheese/meat plate or some olives. It's a great hidden gem for us who live nearby to be able to have an upscale bar with great local beer and wines. And sometimes someone in a group doesn't want wine so it's nice to have the options! Something for everyone. Hopefully eventually a food truck or some dinner pairing event would be fun. I have seen some really cool events advertised on fb but haven't had a Chance to make it in to one yet. I will add as I have two kids I wouldn't recommend this a place for kids as there isn't really an outdoor space. A great date spot or place to meet friends for a small birthday. Bonus would be to add a happy hour or special pricing for driftwood locals!!"

                "description": "My wife and I went to Bella Vista Ranch for a 4th of July tour with lunch, and we found it to be terrific value for the money. There was a nice lunch from a food truck (the name of which eludes me, unfortunately) followed by an interesting talk about the history of olive oil and the origins of the Italian family farm dating back to the second century BCE. The owner explained how he established Bella Vista on the ancient Roman model and described the modifications he has made to make olives grow in Texas. Then we toured the olive orchard and learned about the different varieties of grapes grown on the property. We saw the processing room containing the \"frantoio\" or olive press as well as the vats where this year's wines are aging. We then tasted several oils as well as four glasses of wine per person. All this for $25 (the regular tour without lunch is only $15).  Oils, vinegars, wines and soaps are available for sale. These are pretty expensive (e.g. $18+ for 250ml of their basic Texas Blend oil), but I don't mind paying those prices for high-quality locally produced specialty goods. This is a fascinating day out, which I recommend wholeheartedly.  Pro tip: If you're coming from San Antonio, take I-35 instead of US 281 and the back roads. We were expecting a relaxing drive in the country, but construction and traffic made it a stressful trip. Coming back on 35 was a joy by comparison!"

                "description": "So, so rude. The olive oil and vinegar are excellent, but the experience was ruined by the lady--the one everyone complains of here. The hours on Sunday are until 4. I get there at 3:25, and she walks past me with her whiny, demanding voice telling me that they close at 3:30. Uh, wanna put that on your website as your updated hours?  I went in anyway. The gentleman doing the oil tasting was knowledgeable and helpful. He told the lady to close the gate.  You know, what a non-stupid person would do should they slothfully decide to close early since they dont work for a living.  My mother was incredibly upset by this lady's rudeness. When you run a service like this, you stay open until you no longer have a good flow of customers. Closing is at 4? Hi, if a bunch of people are coming in at 3:30 thru 4:00, you keep working. Lazy Texas people who inherited their property and think they work hard by paying others to harvest their crop and bottle it. Meritocracy, right? They are the class of people who make this state an impoverished mess.    Don't run a customer service business dependent upon people stopping by on a lark like a fascist regime. You don't get to do that. Then again, when you dont have a legitimate concern about how you pay your bills, i guess you can just work until you get bored with the whole work thing.   Go sell wholesale if you hate customers. Working for yourself does not mean you get any more freedom. You have are dependent on good will. And you don't have mine.  The lady tried to make up for her garbage attitude when i made my purchase. You know what? Have a blessed day, lady. A.BLESSED.DAY.  Tl;dr. There are other puveyors of Texas olive oil, particularly in south Texas. Do not waste your wine tasting trip here. If you want to support local, consider others who are hard-working enough to sell their products in Central Market."

Before I could even ask a question about the wine or olives, an employee firmly told me as she was finishing up with another set of customers that \"I don't have time to answer your questions.\"  She then proceeded to hard sell our group to pay $10 for the \"last minute\" tour. And, to add insult to injury, as 2 of the 4 of us completed their purchases, both employees proceeded to exit the store and watch us walk to our vehicle and  drive off. I will never spend a dollar at your business.  Good luck to you."

The tour and history of olives was really interesting. Definitely try the balsamic and infused oils. The wine tasting was pretty brief compared to the olive portion but great none the less. The wines are dryer, not sweet. I thought they were great. A lot of the other local wineries wines are very sweet, but I really enjoyed these! You should absolutely plan to visit if in the area."

He just didn't want to serve us so we left.   The second time we went there were 4 of us and it was in the middle of the day. While the wine is fine, the server was the single most rude person I've ever encountered at a winery. Just astounding how she could be that rude for the duration of the wine tasting. I will never go back and suggest no one ever go there. You cant drink the wine fast enough to over come they workers rudeness."

                "description": "We liked the olive oil a lot.  However... I think the \"thorn\" of this place is the owner.  He seems rather joyless in making something that could ideally fulfill the soul.  His 1 1/2 hour (yes, it's long) \"tour\" is mostly comprised of the history of the Olive, snarky political opinions, braggary of his past career in Silicone Valley, and a hatred for Texas AandM.   Not a place to take a kid. Seriously.  We sat and listened to him for well over an hour then briefly stood under two olive trees, looked at another one that was hurt in a storm, looked at the press machinery, and then did a \"tasting.\" Like I said, the oil was good. I got the impression that the lady helping in the gift shop/tasting room didn't want to be there either. Basically I was confused why this man (and his 5th wife...no lie) were running this business and opening it to the public.  I walked away a little sad that something so wonderful like successfully growing beautiful trees to make a solid product could be reduced to something so joyless."

                "description": "We were warned at great length that we could not even look at our cell phones during the tour which seemed odd when people might have a kid or babysitter or be waiting on something important from work to come through--I mean we are all adults...but I soon found out why.  Far less than an entertaining traditional tour, you sit and listen to someone talk more like a college class lecture, but with way too many rabbit trails of information that eventually make you tune out.  Like what a certain blizzard is called in different parts of the world, how accounting dates back to the Romans, etc.  I am passionate about olive oils and wine but learned too much about history and every other subject to even focus on what I wanted to know about olive oil. Or feel entertained.  The group I was with concurred.   There are 3 types of learners: auditory, visual, and tactile and the class is entirely sit and listen to one man talk for half of it then stand and listen by a tree then a press for the other half. So only appealing to auditory learners. And no audience engagement during the lecture.  At the end you actually get to see and touch. But they had no bread for us so we had to drink an olive oil and talk about it for 30 more minutes so I left before I tasted the other flavored oils as it had already been a full day of just listening to way too much info to retain.  In a very strict manner rather than entertaining with audience engagement.  And strict rules.  Obviously people tune out and begin looking at their cell phones so that's why they don't allow them.  Rather than making the tour entertaining so you dont' want to--It was in the hot sun as well so it was pretty miserable.  The olive oil was good but I've had better, it was a bit weak to me, we did the wine tasting as well and those were not acceptable to me.  I actually would recommend skipping the tour and talking to the staff as you taste the olive oil because they knew all of the information given on the tour without the lengthy side notes of things that should be shaved off for entertainment value.  And that's really the best part.    I don't think they like people very much though to be honest."

                "description": "A hidden mecca of olives.  In central Texas.  The Bella Vista Ranch was designed as a traditional Italian family farm and features the first commercially grown olives in Texas.  And the olives I sampled are Texas size and Texas good.  Apparently the crowd favorite is the bleu cheese stuffed olive.  We sampled a garlic stuffed olive that was really good.  The ranch also offers delicious balsamic vinegars and olive oils which go for around $17 a bottle.  My lips slurped the Fig Vanilla Balsamic over and over again.  I am sure I was sample cheating but that stuff is incredible.     This is also a working winery that produces several red and white varieties plus a Natural Blackberry Wine!  Yum.  Wine tastings are $5/per person.  I think the owner has a great thing going for him and a beauty of a property. Tours of the orchard happen on the weekend and include a wine tasting for $10/per person."

I have been back four times now and each time come away with a little more understanding of the narrative that is offered. While I purchased my typical bottles of olive oil - some for myself, some for holiday gifts - I did also indulge in some olive oil based soaps.   The olives and oil are fabulous. I am not as great a fan of their wines. They are not awful, just not with the properties I care for, typically. The in-laws found a favorite to take home, though.  The tour is still $10 and includes the wine tasting, which is a good deal.  Bottles of oil range from $16-$27 each, depending on size.  Soap is $6.99 a bar.  They also feature balsamic vinegars (not made there) and jars of olives, which are delightful as well."

Take one look at Jack and the humble grounds here at Bella Vista, and you'd never guess that he has olive friends he emails with back in Italy or that he can tell you all you'd ever want to know about the science and technique behind growing and processing olives.  I would highly recommend the tour - while there isn't much walking involved in this tour, my husband and I found it to be highly informative. And with Jack's red-blooded Texan sense of humor, it was a very entertaining education. Be sure to note the times of the tour (Sat @ 10am and 1pm, and Sun @ noon) since it's a group setup.   After the tour comes a tasting of several types of olive oil produced on site along with some of their balsamic vinegar offerings. While they also have wine offered, I'd recommend sticking with the olive oil - clearly what they specialize in. If you're only interested in tasting the oils/wines (not the tour), it's probably good to avoid arriving at the tasting room about an hour after each tour start since the tasting room isn't overly large and tends to fill up easily with the folks coming off the tour."

                "description": "While I thought it was pretty interesting to learn about and taste boutique olive oil (as I'd never been to an olive ranch before) $15 per person does seem a little high when the actual tour is quite short and obviously the intention is that you're going to buy some stuff at the end, and all that stuff is small batch and quite pricey (understandably so.)  So it ends up  being more like $100 for two people when you include the olive oil you will want to buy plus the wine you might want to buy (some people seem to think it sucks, we liked some of it.)  But you will leave with a buzz on and some delicious olive oils!  The owners were away so their daughter gave the tour; I thought she was pretty funny and personable but there were some questions she couldn't answer but it was really no big deal (and she wasn't super long winded like the owner seems to be  but of course some people like that and some people don't.) It's also probably better when there are olives on the trees but it was still overall pretty interesting to see the different trees different olives grow up and hear some history and facts about olive oil production.  I liked hearing about the process and seeing the machinery. And of course I liked tasting the fresh olive oil, which was indeed super tasty and surprisingly spicy. Most of their oils are made from all different olives smushed together but they have one variety that's just made with one kind of olive which we got to try. They also had a blood orange infused oil that I'm now obsessed with; we bought some and later made some asparagus on the grill that had been rubbed with the oil, it was the most delicious asparagus ever! We also enjoyed the wine; we are not wine snobs in any way but we enjoyed what we had and bought a bottle just  because it's the polite thing to do. We sat out on the bench in front of the tasting room and enjoyed our wines and just had a lovely afternoon.   I will say that it gets a little hectic in the tasting room when people come in just for a tasting after a tour- I would say if you want just a tasting, don't come between 1:30-2:30 because it's going to get confusing!"

Also the lady that did our tasting was really rude to us. Then, she basically berated a guy when he politely asked where he could dispose of his child's diaper. She was an older lady. I didn't catch her name, but I have a feeling she receives a lot of complaints. It was very awkward and so unprofessional. Never ever going back."

She was delighted to hear that we moved out here from San Francisco (that's where she grew up but couldn't  stand the fog). The husband is an old curmudgeon, but delightfully so. He worked in high-tech in Silicon Valley and moved out his last company to Austin in the early 90s, eventually leaving to grow olives and make wine.   it's not always the case that you visit a winery and the owners pour for you, so that was a treat. They are a very small production and a bit off the beaten path, so it was pretty quiet there too. A small group arrived just as we were leaving, but it was nothing like the bustling tasting rooms at nearby Driftwood Cellars.  The blackberry wine is actually good--you wouldn't necessarily guess that it's made of blackberry not grapes. And the other three reds we tasted were also nice."

They do offer some beers and wines, but my biggest interest is the hot sauces, salsa's, and pickles.

Understanding how chaotic it can be parking and then leaving when the event is over, we decided to hire a car service. We secured a nice Suburban with Watson Limousines of Austin. I briefly mentioned to George what we were celebrating. When he showed up to pick us up he rolled up in the Party Bus with flowers and sparkling cider along with champagne glasses for my daughter, with Imagine Dragons playing and lights going. It was so Awesome. It made my daughter's 13th Birthday something she will never forget. For anyone that has ever been to COTA, it is extremely chaotic getting to the stage and especially leaving. Normally, walking very long distances. George took all of that away for us. He dropped us off and picked us up at places that most services are unable to which put are walking to a minimum. He made our whole experience PERFECT!!! Thank you so much to George and Watson Limousines of Austin."

                "description": "Gotta bump em up due to the fun and educational grand wine tasting they had yesterday!  Folks, me and my senior friend sampled twenty.five. wines!  Two outta three of their pourers really knew their stuff and gave us background on the wines.  They provided a \"score sheet\" for notes and I ended up buying 5 bottles, all in the $15 range.  My only complaint about the tasting was there were no palate cleansers offered.  No crackers, chocolates, no nothing and after about half they all start to run together.  So we ordered a cheese plate and took a break.  For $12, not too impressed with the cheese plate.  Four smallish chunks and a few bread slices.  Meh.  But we really enjoyed killing a coupla rainy day hours here.  Get on their email list so you won't miss the next one!"

We were able to see all the main attractions for the city, as well as quite a few hidden gems we normally would have missed on our own. Our tour guide, Ike, was very knowledgeable about the city and had a wicked sense of humor. He was able to get everyone on the tour engaged and even remembered a few things about our home states to tie in to whatever attraction we were visiting. I would highly recommend this tour for anyone visiting Austin for the first time. Well worth the money!!"

We met Marty and Tray at the visitor center and instantly felt welcomed for our BBQ and wine tasting tour!  Our group was small and Marty was very accommodating with getting us back to downtown to catch our flight home.  On the drive, Marty shared stories and knowledge of the bats under Congress bridge and the history of Salt Lick.  After our delicious meal at Salt Lick, Marty was able to get us access to the pit for photos.  Our 2 wine tasting stops were awesome.  We had enough time to enjoy each sip and take pictures of the establishments.  Next time I'm in Austin, I'll book another tour!  Thanks for the memories!"

He explained the BBQ process for various Austin BBQ establishments, which was very interesting, and also explained the wine making process. He gave recommendations for some of his favorites at each venue we visited and also ensured we got pictures. From the moment we met Marty, he was enthusiastic and had a ton of energy, so we knew we were in good hands. After the tour, he took the time to mark events in a local paper which were of interest to us during our remaining time in Austin. Marty and Austin Detours helped start our trip off on the right foot. We highly recommend this company!"

It was actually Rose's first solo tour and she was amazing at including everyone, keeping it interactive, and maintaining interest even though it was freezing. Most tours in other places just kind of lecture you but she was definitely more of an inviting conversationalist :) with Chris i was actually the only person that signed up for the tour so I got a more personalized view of Austin street art haha. His passion is obvious when he explains the stories behind the art and i learned soo much. I definitely recommend both tours because not only was it super fun but a car is the best way to see all of the random spots throughout Austin. Thanks Rose and Chris!"

We took the tour on a Sunday morning and got to see the Capitol building without crowds and got around to many areas of the city with the ease of someone who knows the city inside and out.  Steven knows his stuff so well and adds his own professional level of humor to make the tour even more fun.  We found out about lots of places we will go on our next trip to Austin.  We took his recommendation for where to hear live music and enjoyed the afternoon at Saxon Pub.  After riding through various areas and get the lay of the land I was more comfortable driving around the city which was a big help for us.  I would recommend this tour to anyone traveling to Austin.  Take it early in your stay in Austin if possible.  Wonderful and worthwhile 2 hours."

The inside is small because it's in a cottage so there's a sign saying one group at a time. The wines are from California. You can do a flight for $15 or a glass. We all chose a glass (8oz pour) whereas a tasting is 6 oz. loved our reds. There's a sculpture garden to stroll. Lovely place for convo.

                "description": "I keep meaning to post a review for this winery. My husband and I visited them a few weeks ago to celebrate a recent job interview. They have only recently opened up, so we had never heard of them before and were excited to try them out. They had a very cute tasting room with nice stone that also felt very homey. The tasting was $20 and you get to try 6 wines. $20 still feels a bit hefty for a tasting in Central Texas for me, but their pours were pretty generous and you're not being served by someone who looks like a teenager who couldn't care less about your experience (like what Becker has become). All of these wines are from Sonoma. Overall, we didn't love the tastings except for the Zinfandel and the Cabernet which were absolutely outstanding, but I don't typically love lighter-bodied red wines or most reds from Sonoma. The quality is great, but a few of the prices were just slightly higher than what we can personally justify - I absolutely loved the Cab but it was $60. The Zinfandel was more affordable at $39. Their Wine Club gives you 20% off purchases which is nice, but it is a 6-bottle quarterly shipment. The winemakers are the Parmesons themselves and we had the pleasure of getting to chat with them while we did our tasting. They are a wonderful couple who were very welcoming and lovely to chat with. We loved hearing their story of how they got into winemaking. I would highly recommend checking this place out!"

It's basically an outpost of the parent company in California. Based in Paso Robles, Graveyard Vineyards is a small producer. The wines offered are all grown and made in California.   We opted for the tasting. They offered 6 wines for $15. We enjoyed generous pours of 2 whites, 1 rose, 2 reds, and a dessert wine. All of them were very good! You can tell their not Texas wines (in a good way!).   The staff was incredibly helpful. They offered tastings outside and were very attentive!

The wineries prior, all staff wore masks which was nice since we had a couple high risk individuals in our group. When we arrived at Graveyard, the outside was not impressive, not exactly the winery ambience. Once we got inside, the male was not wearing a mask (ok... fine... mask mandate lifted.... ) but he then told me I could take off my mask standing about a foot away, and I told him no I can't, we have high risk individuals. He then said to go outside for the tasting which we did. But honestly, who tells people to take off their masks or suggest they take off their masks during a pandemic? He has noooo idea of our health conditions, concerns or even has the right to even suggest on the matter. I was definitely taken back.  Once we went outside the table was just covered in pollen and debris and leaves. We were all so itchy from all the leaves under the table. Just no grooming or landscaping or care given to the on-site property. It was not a relaxing atmosphere whatsoever, as mentioned prior, a parking lot view/feeling.  The female local staff member had superb customer service, but again, in our faces pouring wine with no mask on. Out of the wineries we went to that day, this is the ONLY place where they were mask free. Although the mask mandate was lifted, we're still in the midst of a major pandemic and felt other establishments honored that respectfully. We felt very safe at all the wineries prior.   Grapes not from Texas.   Pros: Wine was good."

Graveyard expects you to take three shipments and are unwilling to cancel your membership before you pay for, and receive three shipments.  I have received two shipments and did not want any more Graveyard wine.  When I reached out to the wine club, the response was \"you are asked to received three shipments; you've had two.  Your third one is coming up.\"  I am going to be candid here.  I just don't care for the wines.  I know others like them very much.  My sister, who lives near the tasting room in Dripping Springs, loves the wine.  There is nothing wrong with the wine; I just don't care for it and I think two shipments is enough to make up my mind.  I conveyed my feelings to the wine club manager and her solution was to downgrade me from a 12-bottle shipment to a 6-bottle shipment.  I really don't mean to knock Graveyard.  But my suggestion is to buy a case of wine and try it before you join the club.  I want to emphasize that there is nothing wrong with the wine; it just does not align with my tastes."

                "description": "Graveyard is a brand new addition to the winery community in Drip, having opened in late January. They are an offshoot of a parent winery in Paso Robles, CA. The wines they sell are all produced, bottled and shipped here from that operation. They do yet carry the entire CA inventory but do plan to increase the Texas offerings.   The wines available include a couple of Graveyard's more affordable blends - Paso Tombstone White and the red blend from that line. Both are pleasant, sippable blends at a very reasonable price point. The red was light slightly complex mix of common reds produced at the parent vineyard. They also stock Ascender, a credible Brut. Their estate Cab is actually very good- a lighter Cab with a nice effect on the palate.   The lounge itself is pleasant and airy without being pretentious. The staff, especially manager Adam, are all personable and informative."

It was a relaxing time playing checkers and sipping wine under the trees, though. Our server was wonderful and covid-safe. Unfortunately, one staff wasn't wearing a mask, even inside, but we didn't have to deal with him much. We really enjoyed the wines. I know they are based out of Cali, but it was still nice to get a decent sparkling wine at a Texas vineyard. They were all good, but that was a nice surprise."

We were given a room temperature bottle of Rose and were told by the staff it was \"the usual temperature they sold Rose.\" I don't know about you, but I crave a cold Rose in this Texas heat. They ship in all of their wines from California so you won't find any Texas wines here either. Without good customer service or outstanding wine, we won't be back."

Our tour guide was great and interactive with everyone on the tour and made sure we all enjoyed ourselves.

Our truck 4WD barely made it down, I do not recommend going any further if you have a small vehicle because the lot is NOT paved.   The wait wasn't too bad. If you get stuck at the end of the line I recommend taking umbrellas!! There is limited seating on the bottom, so if you get stuck sitting at the top it's better to be safe.

Bus ride smooth and seamless. Tour guide was awesome and energetic. I left this first tour thinking \"I'll definitely come back!\"  2021: This second tour was ROUGH. We went for my Bachelorette party for a wine tour out to Fredericksburg with a timeline of 11:30 - 6:30. Within the tour we were supposed to to visit 3 wineries, and Luckenbach.   Sadly, the bus driver ruined the experience by getting lost almost the entire day. Not only was she directionally challenged, but she drove like a NASCAR driver trying to make up for lost time; causing many people to become motion sick.   She somehow took a wrong turn in the morning, then we hit traffic from a wreck up ahead (I understand second part not her fault) we did not arrive at the first winery until 1:30pm. Stayed for about 40 minutes, then onto the next.   Second winery was great, had a BBQ lunch, atmosphere awesome and laid back. Stayed for about 1hr 15 minutes.  Third stop was to Luckenbach, we visited for about 35 minutes, then it was back on the bus at 5:15pm.   This is were it got a little crazy. Bus driver took a wrong turn and started going South, somehow ended 10 minutes North of San Antonio, then we were lost out in the middle of nowhere with no cell service.   It started to buzz around the bus that we were lost, and it took an 1 hr and 15 minutes before our tour guide even said anything over the intercom about us being lost!! Everyone was so annoyed because the tour guide proceed to say we could make it to the third winery even though the winery was about to close. (We would only be able to stay for 10 minutes) At this point it was 6:45pm already well past when we were supposed to be back in Austin.   Get ahold of this, we did not reach our drop off location in Austin until 7:50pm. At that point we were on the bus for 2 hrs a 15 minutes just riding around Texas.   Out of 8 hrs with them only 2.5 were spent outside.  It was sad to spend my whole Bachelorette party (especially on a beautiful day) on a Bus with terrible old music on replay, travelers in a bad mood, and everyone wanting to go home. :("

(On Groupon, they write: \"Wine tastings not included but available for an additional fee\", so this is misleading.) In total, that comes out to about $85/person, which is MORE than they are currently charging per person on their website ($73 during their \"summer sale\"). Let me save you some time!"

We spent the last warm October day on a two-story party barge out on Lake Travis. On this tour we were able to sit back and soak in the sun.  This tour is BYOB so there was no shortage of beverages that my crew and I enjoyed. The vast majority of this boat tour, we were docked, which I did not expect.   Boat Facts:  This is a 4 hour boat excursion.  This boat offered a slide at the top of the boat for those who wished to slip and slide into the waters of Lake Austin. Float Noodles are afforded. The boat is Bluetooth compatible so you can bring your own music to be played on the boat speaker system. Burgers are made on the boat (albeit greasy ones).  At the end of the tour, you and your crew are given Texas Winos Schwag.   Synopsis:  My crew and I had a good time but I would not recommend this tour if you are looking to go around Lake Travis as the tour is fairly stationary. In addition, if you have an aversion to greasy or heavy foods (like the burgers prepared on the boat), bring your own eats like I did. Total spent for this outing (not including tip) $29.00. This tour is what YOU make it."

They grill up some food for you and you're on the boat having fun for 4hrs. You can bring your own drinks and cooler with whatever you want to bring in but try not to bring glass. Richard is very thorough with his planning and provides you with all and any info you may need to make sure you have nothing to worry and have everything you need.   This is not the first time I have been to one of his events. I have been to a wine tour that I loved and those that joined me as well. Ive also been to a wino fest which was held at the sterling event venue and that offered so many wineries to taste from along with what you can pair them with. They have so many different events and tours that you cant go wrong with any of them. It depends on what you're looking for and what vibe you want plus you always get some kind of swag/souvenirs.   I definitely recommend you try one of his events. You'll enjoy it all."

We asked to be put on aux and they refused even though we sold out the entire boat....playing old songs and nothing we could vibe to and just being rude because we already paid. Just bad customer service in general. The other boat next to us had their music so loud we couldn't even hear our music and winos didn't care to help us make our music louder or even accommodate us. They don't believe in playing swear words or music before the 2000's it just was kinda a bummer bc we had 40 people who paid $29 each for just a burger and a bag of chips and crappy music?????? Idk 10/10 don't recommend"

                "description": "Do not recomment and will not return.  I had an amazing experience with Texas Winos in 2014. At that time, the tour was on a nice bus with friendly driver and tour guide. Based on this experience, I had recommended Texas Winos to many people.   Recently (2021) we were looking to do Fredericksburg winery tour so I again recommended to do it with Texas Winos.   The transportion was in a very uncomfortable van with water leaking/dropping out of AC unit that was attached at the back of the van.   The three wineries we visited weren't in Fredericksburg. Two were in Johnson city and one was in a location in between Fredericksburg and Johnson city. Other than the first winery in Johnson City we visitied, the other two wineries we visited didn't have vineyards in sight. They were just two big container area that seemed like where they store wine (so there wasn't any ambience of winery or vineyard. It was just a wine tasting). We didn't even take pictures at those two locations as there really weren't anything pretty or nice to take picture.  The lunch option provided was not the same as what was shown on the web site (there was no salad and the options were different). The lunch was provided at the second winery, which had a dog walking around table to table (begging for food).   Before the third winery, we were informed we will be visiting the brewery since there weren't many people joinning the tour (hence the small van like a super shuttle, the airport transportation van). However, we were only given 20min at the brewery although we were running early.   At the third winery, the driver decided to leave us (and note, there was no guide. So we were all by ourselves without anyone from Texas Winos) to pick up his neighbors from other winery (hence why we were given only 20min at the brewery). We were stranded at the 3rd location (which again didn't have any vineyard in sight to walk around or take pictures while we were waiting) just waiting for the driver to return long after the wine tasting was over. This eventually led us to get back to Austin later than expected.   I regret not checking reviews online before recommending this place. I had an amazing time couple years ago but it was the worst experience this time around. We were all just wanting to get back to Austin. There were many vineyards around that had nice ambience and pretty views but the second and thirs winery we went to were the ones that we honestly wouldn't have gone ourselves as they weren't really vineyards but just container area providing wine tasting.    Overall, not worth it."

He then refused to take us home from the second winery which was an hour and a half away from where we live?? He said we were drunk even though 1. We hadn't even had 2 regular sized glasses of wine total and 2. Isn't that why you hire a driver?? So you don't drink and drive? He put his finger in my mom's face so close it was basically touching her nose. When my brother tried to calmly speak to him, the driver dramatically told him to back up because he was \"dangerous\" and started filming. The video he took will clearly show that no one was threatening him. The other people at the winery came up to us after and could not believe how he acted and that he just left us in the middle of no where. He also called the cops on us and then drove away laughing. What if one of us had a medical condition and needed to get home to take medicine? We had to call all of our friends to see if one of our friends could pick us up since there were no ubers / Lyfts.

The driver was dismissive of us from the start, we needed help setting up the Bluetooth speakers but he was clearly trying to rush us from the moment we got in the bus. At what was supposed to be the halfway point of our trip, the driver came into the winery and told the owner we were 'running late' and they needed to rush us out. This company had over booked themselves and instead of calmly talking to us to resolve the situation, they decided that abandoning a group of people - an hour and a half away from our destination - was the best course of action. The driver had also called the police after escalating the situation himself which was both unprofessional and a waste of the officers time. To add insult to injury, the driver was laughing while he drove away without us. We were lucky enough to have friends drive out and get us, but it was a terrible end to what was supposed to a fun experience. I would not recommend this company if you expect transport to be completed both to and from your destination."

It was a last-minute decision to book a bus so we ended up having two drivers, because they had to scheduled something at the last minute, and both were entirely friendly, professional and helpful. We wanted to find a bar with a mechanical bull and they helped us track one down. There communication was perfect, it was always easy to reach them and they were super flexible at the end of the night, allowing us to extend our trip for as many hours as we wanted for an hourly rate. In the end we only stayed out another hour, and they gave us the extra hour for free. Also, because it was a late booking, they offered us their 25 person bus for the 20 person bus rate.  The sound system was enough to give everyone permanent hearing loss and the dancing pole and hand holds proved to be incredibly robust and secure!  These guys are AWESOME, and I would DEFINITELY book from them again in a heartbeat."

The bus itself was roomy and nice. They also provided ice, cups and water for the bus ride. Overall - everyone in my party was extremely pleased with our trip and experience with Austin Party Bus. We will definitely be using this company again next time we are in Austin! Thanks for making our Labor Day weekend an unforgettable one!"

When I started to ask general questions, the man on the phone (unfortunately I did not get his name), kept telling me to refer to the website. When i asked him if he could please tell me his thoughts on how long the bus was needed for, etc over the phone because it was easier for me to do as I could not look at my phone at the time, he very rudely said \"I just don't understand why you can't just look this up on our website.\"   I do not think it is too much to ask to provide basic information over the phone, and the snarky, rude comment was completely uncalled for and one of the more unprofessional customer service experiences I have had. Needless to say, I will not be using Austin Party Bus for my transportation."

                "description": "Booked a limo bus to take 23 people to float the Guadalupe River in New Braunfels, six hours round trip.    Bus: The rate was so much better than every other place I found that I worried the bus would be shabby.  Not so.  Bench-style limo seating, hardwood floors, good sound system, and a pole for dancing.  My birthday guests were all impressed.   Service: Our driver Mike quickly answered every question I had in the weeks leading up to the event (and I had a lot).  He gave us an excellent rate, arrived on time, and was very polite and accommodating.  We were a loud, rowdy birthday crew, but he never seemed to mind.  The first toob place we visited was sold out, so he called another and even got us a group rate!    Overall: Very happy, no complaints.  I plan a few different party buses every year, and I will be using Sixth Street Rides from now on."

The deal was supposed to end before we were able to get the group together but Sixth Street Rides was very accommodating on extending our deal to March (2 months after the deal was supposed to expire).  Mike handled our requests including moving the date and giving us suggestions on where to go with complete respect and professionalism.  I received a confirmation the day before as well as our driver, Chris,  called us 20 mins before our pick up time.  We had a couple hiccups (including running late - as 15 girls tend to do - as well as running late at our last winery stop) but Chris handled it with the utmost patience and ease.    Honestly I couldn't have asked for a better company to use for our wine tour.  I highly recommend Chris and Matt over at Sixth Street Rides."

They all want party busses for their birthdays/graduation parties. My only complaint was the A/C did not work from the get go of the ride, my birthday was in May so it was pretty hot on that 22 person bus, but no one had a stroke so it was still a good time. Just make sure you get a bus with an A/C. Other than that, no complaints about this company. Driver was on time (11:00), and took us wherever we wanted to go. We had the bus for 4 hours which was more than enough time. Spent an hour or so on the bus, got dropped off down town for 2 hours, then rode it for the last hour and dropped people off back in west campus. It was perfect!\""

Very reasonable tasting price at$7 for 6 wines. You can order the dry red flight, the white flight or the sweet flight. Most all the wines from the Escondido Valley in west Texas. This is were most of the grapes are grown in Texas anyway although not widely publicized. Lost Draw Cellars and William-Chris are two of our favorites. Really enjoyed both the red and white flights. The sweet flight is VERY sweet and all about fruit. One exception is the Choco-wine. Sounds really awful- chocolate wine!? I am NOT a sweet eater and don't really like chocolate but this is a perfect combination similar to non-dairy Baileys.   So enjoyed the owner-host that helped navigate the wine. Super personable and great to talk to. We'll return here again!"

                "description": "This little shop offers tastings from various Texas and other wineries, organized by a preset menu of either whites, dry reds, or sweet wines. You pay $7 for an etched glass promoting Wimberley as a Little Taste of Heaven (well, why not?), and that includes the tasting of all the wines from the menu of your choice.  There's room for about 6 or 7 people at a time to belly up to the antique bar (standing room only), and the sommelier/host pours for each group separately, explaining each wine and its history as he/she goes.   The afternoon my friend and I were there, we both tried the dry reds, and our host was knowledgeable and entertaining. There was not a bad wine in the bunch, although we each had our separate favorites. A lot of these wines are served by the glass or bottle in the local and regional restaurants, and you can buy them here more reasonably (about $22-36/bottle for the reds we tried) without having to visit each winery. They also have an entire wall of wine-related gift items and cute bar accouterments.  Definitely a place to put on your list to stop by during an afternoon of shopping in Wimberley. Be aware that like most of the shops, they close up for the day at 5PM."

                "description": "The old bar is beautiful and from an old Willie Nelson movie, \"Red Headed Stranger.\" Their \"dry\" red wines were not dry. They were all very fruit forward compared to the traditional tasting notes of the types they are serving. It's a cheap tasting at $7, and comes with a glass that is etched with \"taste of heaven\" and Wimberley on it.  Now, it's more of a shop, than a winery. So, don't expect to have a few glasses, sit down, or to use a restroom. The girl that was waiting on us was very young and knew very little about wine, and seemed to care very little. That's not the best wine experience! If I came back, it would be to show my boyfriend the bar. Overall, the wine was mediocre! So, it's kind of a one time thing!"

The lady serving us that day was very knowledgeable and even gave us a history of each wine and winery with each pour. The tasting room is small and can get crowded. There's no sitting, but it's not a bother. They do sell some cute wine associated items. I ended up leaving with wine and extras. I can see myself going back when in Wimberley."

It is a very small place with a bar that has no seating. They hand you a menu with with 3 lists of wine (Red, White andSweet) and tell you to pick one and they go down the list and give you a sample of each one off the list you chose. There was only 1 gentleman working at the time we myself and 2 friends went and he was too busy to even acknowledge us. We waited while he finished up with other customers then started the tasting. The man told us what we were drinking, which we read from the list, but other than that, seemed to have no other wine knowledge. A few times he told us about the wine maker who was featured in a magazine, or gave us facts about the prizes a wine had won, but no true wine knowledge about what we were drinking. I had to even ask for water to rinse my glass between tastings. He was just pouring wine after wine in my friends' glasses, even a white after a red! This was the strangest wine tasting I have ever done and to be honest, not something I would ever pay for. We had a gift certificate for a free tasting.   Bottom line, if you know anything about wine, I don't recommend it. If not, and you're just looking for a casual experience with a little wine involved, go for it."

                "description": "We regularly go wine tasting here.  They only stock wines from Texas wineries that make batches too small to distribute to stores, plus one red and one white wine from Italy for the Italian restaurant goers across the street.  It's like visiting half a dozen wineries in one stop.  The wine lists change minimally throughout the year, though, and sometimes they can't get a particular winery's top products (ex. Sistercreek won't sell them their best blends).  Wine tasting is $7 per wine list (red, white or sweet), and each list includes ~8 wines.  Purchase 3 bottles and the tasting is free.  Purchase 6 bottles and 1 tasting is free + 10% off.  My husband and I usually taste both the red and white lists and walk away with 3-4 bottles of wine.  Each bottle is only a few dollars more than if bought at the wineries.  If you want to taste more than 1-2 types of wine, please be respectful and purchase a wine tasting.  They get a lot of foot traffic and can't give all their wine away."

                "description": "Stopped by, last night.  The woman I was with asked for a sample of the Christmas Wine and was given a plastic goblet that held about an ounce, or more, of wine.  She ended up buying a bottle.  I asked about the blueberry wine and was asked if I'd like a sample.  I was given an ultra-mini, paper souffle cup to drink from.  I then asked for a sample of the mead.  Again, I got a mini-cup and, inexplicably, an extremely rude, \"That's the last sample I can give you\" from the owner.  Keep in mind that my friend got a sample, in a plastic goblet, that was five times the amount I received in the paper mini-cup.  She also bought a friggin' bottle of wine.  There was no excuse, ZERO, for the owner's rude way of treating me.  As I sipped the mead, groups of women came in and the owner was all over herself to serve them and strike up animated conversation.  I was amazed and angry.  Maybe there's more, here, than meets the eye, but that's not the point.  I should have been treated as well as the women customers.  I certainly wasn't.  I will never go back to this place.  You can count on that.  The reason I gave the two stars:  The owner was extremely knowledgeable about wines.  She did give me good information about sulfite content of the sweeter wines, comparing sulfite addition in wine to oatmeal addition in meatloaf.  Mitigating factor?: She did tell my friend that her store had been flooded by a broken refrigerator while she was visiting her husband in another state.  She struggled to reopen her store once she got back to town, just a day ago. Even so, her rude behavior cannot be excused.  FWIW, my friend told me that if this woman had responded to me, in the manner she did, before she, my friend, had purchased the bottle of Christmas Wine, she would not have completed the purchase."

                "description": "First, the Driftwood Bistro is on the grounds of Driftwood Estates winery, just off RR 12 south of Dripping Springs. There are several things to be said about that. First, be prepared for the rough, rocky driveway up the hill to the grounds. Once on top, though, the vista is splendid, especially as the sunset rolls across the hills beyond and the flats below. The grounds are lovely and spacious and pleasing. It is an exceedingly pleasing setting.  Beyond that, the Bistro is on one side of the hilltop and the wine house on the other. The Bistro doesn't have a liquor license, so you have to walk across the grounds to get a glass or bottle to go with your meal. An inconvenience. Their wines are middle of the road, and the selection of wines by the glass are very limited as far as whites go.  The Bistro has a pretty experimental and ambitious menu, with creative choices and options. We had the Caribbean Shrimp and Rice and the Open-faced Stuffed Avocado. The avocado dish was superb, with the featured avocado just the right level of ripeness, tender grilled chicken and a picante that was dynamite. The salsa Fresca and crema helped create a very satisfying entre. The flavors both blended and contrasted with each other. A very nice choice of a cool dish for a summer evening. The shrimp dish, on the other hand, was disappointing. It was tepid, to start with. And the shrimp had a very fishy flavor. The sautéed squash was credible, but overall it was disappointing.   Service was cordial. Lexi,our server, was very warm and welcoming and attentive. It was not her fault that the shrimp wasn't the proper temperature   The Bistro gets a 'maybe' on this visit, with hopes that they will improve on speed out of the kitchen and address that glitchy separation of wine bar and restaurant. The place has much going for it, and, if they can up their game, it will be a killer destination."

Alba was a delight to work with through the process- very responsive, friendly and professional. He made sure I understood what the timeline was and what to expect. He will also make a stop for you on the way if you need to pick up additional refreshments.  We actually stayed out past our projected return time and Alba was incredibly gracious and patient with us- I really appreciated that because it can be stressful planning large group outings and he really made it stress-free for me.

We needed rides for our Fredericksburg winery tour and Lake Travis boat party, and Jerral pulled through with punctual transportation at the best prices I could find!   Jerral was easy to coordinate with and even when there was a small hiccup with our ride back from the lake, he was communicative and very professional. He also went above and beyond with helping one of our group members re-park their car after we had already departed for the lake! The vehicles we rode in were also nice and clean.   Overall, our weekend wouldn't have been a success without 360 Transportation and I'll definitely be contacting them for any party bus/transportation needs in the future!!"

I had only scheduled two places to go but the owner recognized that we'd be very close to one of the best wineries in dripping springs and suggested we also go there as well. It was definitely the highlight of the evening and I'm so glad he recommended it. The driver was on time and courteous, he had no problem stopping for bathroom breaks to and from our destination. I'll be definitely using them for a upcoming business happy hour I have planned in two months. If you are looking for transportation at an excellent price they are a must in the Austin area."

My brother and I needed to get some alcohol for my parents before their arrival here tomorrow evening.   This store was very spread out and easy to find exactly what you are looking for. The staff is helpful too and they know where things are in the store too.   I have missed total wine as it is hard to come by when in AL due to liquidity laws. But we do have ABC stores.   I must say that they do card if you appear to be under 30. So myself, my brother and his girlfriend were all carded. But I am taking it as a compliment as yes I do look young.   I think my parent will be happy with what we got for them. :)   If you need an alcohol pick me up or a gift they have amazing gift sets too!   Wonderful experience here!"

Someone brought a wrong order in decent time to my house.  We noticed the erroneous bag together at my doorstep and she proceeded to take the delivery back to the store and my order is subsequently cancelled as I am informed by E-mail.  I wait an entire week and receive a refund 13 dollars less than my original payment.  I have spoken to customer service two weeks ago and they initiated a pass of my complaint to higher authority.  On my end, I have seen the same result as taking no action at all.  I am at a point now where it makes no more sense to spend any more time on getting my 13 dollars back as this as a fraction of what I can make spending that time actually working.  Total Wine online orders get all the thumbs down!"

I've only had need to use them for bottles of wine for special occasion during the pandemic. It's easy to shop online from their website to pickup curbside. Service is typically quick, accurate, and convenient. Curbside is free with a $35 order; otherwise a minimal service charge applies.  They were already my inside favorite based on the wonderful in-store atmosphere and experience. Being a solid citizen and not putting my health at risk to purchase adult beverages during the pandemic has won them a fan for life."

Total Wine is THE best place to come if you are like me - curious, excited to try something new, looking for some advice on what else I can try, etc then you have come to the right spot for your libations.  Ask any employee, I dare you, on what they suggest after telling them what you like. They will point you to some solid suggestions and even walk you over to that area where it is located. Total Wine has some very knowledgeable employees who are willing to walk you through the entire store if you requested that.   The prices are the best in the area for all of it - liquor, beer, wine, mixers, etc.  It's a one stop shop where you just might end up finding a cooler-than-the-one-you-have-at-home cocktail shaker or wine stoppers too.   Also, if you are looking to put together a gift last minute come here.  They have it all - bags, gift sets, tape, cute decor for bars, and whatnot here. It's super easy to roll up, park, and strut in to get a really cool and curated gift if you ask for some help."

My husband and I discovered Total Wine while living in California. Our store there was one that we went to every Saturday with our dog and we knew everyone who worked there. We were sad to be moving back to Austin because we didn't think there was a Total here. After a quick search, we found out there was this one on Brodie. We used to live north, but would make the trek down every weekend to see them. Now that we live south, we are there all the time.  We now have two dogs and they are the store mascots. Their picture is literally on the front door! When we walk in, us and the girls are welcomed with open arms.  Lisa is the best at working the wine tastings. She can tell you anything you want or need to know. Laurie is the sweetest and so helpful! Bob is always giving us the best recommendations. I wish I could name everyone, but will work on updating this review as I remember everyone's names. We feel like family when we are there. Total is the ONLY liquor store in my book. I have brought so many people to Total and they have nothing but nice things to say. They are helpful; if you can't find something they know exactly where it is. If they don't have it, they will see what they can do to get it in store. Their prices can't be beat! They are very knowledgeable; if you ask someone a question they don't know they will work endlessly to find the answer and store it for helping others in the future. I literally can't say enough about Total and their promise to hire amazing employees."

                "description": "I use to check out Total Wine and More a lot when I lived in the DC metro area. I even attended a sweet Yelp wine and beer tasting event there in Fairfax, VA about two years ago.Total Wine sold me at that event and I was able to get some of my favorite beers. I love the fact I could do a mix and match 6 pack of anything I wanted.   Anyway, I wasn't feeling like Spec's on this particular day and wanted to see how Texas does Total Wine and more. Texas does it right. I was in awe and bewilderment as I toured the store. I ended up with of course more than I needed but no worries there.   I will note I found something there called a pocket shot. A pocket shot is made of plastic and looks like a Capri Sun container. It would of have been great to take to ACL the other weekend. So if you want to sneak or smuggle booze in I recommend buying those pocket shots."

The staff is always friendly and I've never been steered wrong with a wine recommendation. I love that they have lots of tastings on the weekends and most recently, I went to one of their formal tastings with Orin Swift wines. It was more than works the $20 ticket price and I added to my wine knowledge base (and tasted delicious wines)."

No worries though, Bob came to the rescue. He asked me a few simple questions and then helped me find 3 great red wines all under $20 a bottle.   Had the first one last night and it did NOT disappoint!   Bob rocks. That is all"

                "description": "I feel conflicted giving a fairly low rating given I consistently think of ABW as one of the top handful of breweries in Austin, but I'm giving this as a rating of the taproom experience moreso than a rating of their beers. I've also only gone during Covid, so I'm looking forward to giving them a try in the future when I can comfortably get the full experience.   Compared to other patios in the area I find theirs to be pretty lacking. There were no fans in the summer and no heat lamps in the winter. Their space isn't particularly large so there are fewer tables than other locations. This leads it to be uncomfortably packed on weekends, both in terms of how close tables are and the lack of distancing enforced in lines.   One weird thing working against them is just how available their beer is around town. Every HEB and bar will have at least a couple of ABW's beers available, so they lose out on the necessity of going to the taproom to try their beers. Even their seasonals get around town pretty well both in stores and on tap elsewhere.   On that note, and to not make this review totally negative, their beer is absolutely phenomenal. All their flagships are good to great examples of the style, my personal favorites are the Sun Shovel (think blue moon but with some hop prescence) and Fire Eagle (leans more towards West Coast IPA, but has enough juiciness to be really refreshing in the summer time).   Their seasonals also absolutely knock it out of the park. Sputnik (Coffee Oatmeal Stout) is an absolute must if you're in Austin in December and is probably the best beer I've had since moving here. The Heisenberg (a combination of a Pilsner and Hef) and Black Thunder (Black Lager) are two other stand outs to me.  The food truck is good enough that if you need something to snack on while you're there you won't be totally dissatisfied, but I've usually felt compelled to go elsewhere for food.  Overall, can't recommend their beer enough, but you don't need to visit the taproom to get the full experience."

                "description": "After three months of sheltering at home, Austin Beer Works was a first outing.  They did an excellent job with social distancing, wiping down each table after guests left, and mask enforcement (when not seated at table) in a firm but polite way.    No inside seating right now and the outdoor tables are shaded and a good distance apart. It is reservations only. depending on the time you make the reservation for, you will either get an hour to enjoy your table or two hours.  They go over all the rules with you when you arrive.  They have some great beers, both on tap and in cans. You can purchase some to take home with you as well!  I ordered a sour raspberry-lemon Einhorn.  So summery and refreshing!  I ended up drinking two.  My husband had an Essential IPA and the Small Spoon session IPA.   We didn't care for the Heisenberg Heff-lager (a bit too banana-ish).  The only thing that would have made the difference from 4 stars to 5 would have been some kind of food! Even a bag of chips or pretzels to go with the beer would have been awesome! We saw a food truck parked there but unfortunately it was not open."

The interior is very spacious which makes it a perfect space for a casual happy hour with coworkers while the exterior has an abundance of seating. I'll definitely be returning if I am ever up that direction!"

We waited in line with a mask on and ordered. The man was helpful and recommend the cherry sour to me since they don't have ciders. My boyfriend got two different lagers, one was dark and one was light(I think it was called like the best ever or the most awesome) he liked both a lot but preferred the lighter one, and I really liked my cherry sour. It would be nice to see breweries trying to use class beer cups instead of plastic but with covid most places are doing single use plastic sadly. We took our dog and everyone was friendly. They even give you chips and salsa with your drinks. The ambiance was great, there was a food truck, and a cool courtyard with tables and a kids area. All around a cool place!"

I was a bit surprised with how sweet their double ipa was, but there are other selections of beer that were more on the bitter side and less on the sweet side.  The outdoor space is really nice and I'd definitely come back here again."

                "description": "Stopped by over here on an early Saturday afternoon before the crowds showed up. Large space with both inside and outdoor seating as well as a food truck parked to the side.  Decided to try a couple beers: Marco IPA ($6) and Friends with Benefits ($7). The Marco is well balanced but still had plenty of hops. Friends with benefits is more on the hazy side that sticks with you. The latter paired just fine alongside one of the sandwiches from the food truck.  Service was quick as there weren't many people at the brewery yet. A couple hours later the spot was packed, so best to come early."

They have indoor and outdoor seating and from my recent visit, I discovered they even sell wine here!  They had a food truck on the day they went so I'm certain there's food to wash down your IPA."

They have the best hazy IPAs and great sours and generally interesting seasonal drafts, friendly staff, and a super yummy food truck (Spicy Boys) right in the patio area. Only thing is it gets pretty busy on weekends so it can be tough to snag a table sometimes, but it's worth it."

                "description": "All the 4 and 5-star reviews are spot on. Zilker Brewing is a great venue to have a brew or two and people watch from their 6th St patio.  Their indoor taproom is closed and they are adhering to the social distancing guidelines. We had a large picnic table to ourselves and were very comfortable chilling out on a breezy Sat afternoon.   I really enjoyed their Lazy Daisy Hazy IPA. It's a wonderful IPA that has a hint of sweetness and a citrus finish. Plus 1 gave 5 stars to their LA Beer American Pilsner. This is a typical Pils that drinks lite and is a perfect brew for a warm day.   Hungry? Spicy Boys Chicken food truck is onsite and is producing wonderful spicy chicken (Duh). They offer a range of sauces from sweet to hot as hades. We went midrange spicy and felt the heat.   Not a beer drinker, they offer wine, water, soft drinks, and surprise a frose' .  Solid 5-stars!"

The space both indoors and out is perfect, and encourages coming together. Great for groups, but would be fine for a date night as well. A few bar stools but mostly community style seating. The food truck permanently stationed out front is great. The beer is excellent, focusing on IPAs but having many other interesting seasonals. Prices are more than fair, swag is cool. Zilker has it all, ipA to Z. Drink local!"

I've checked out several local breweries in the area and this one is at the top of my list right now. The beer is great and the service is awesome. The staff are welcoming and willing to help you select a beer if you're undecided. Spicy Boys food truck is in their parking lot, so grab a few beers and enjoy the awesome food. Plenty of seating outside with some seating inside. This place is popular, so the seating will always fill up quickly. Dog friendly as well"

The Midnight Voyage is also amazing if you like hazy IPAs.  We went on a Friday night and sat outside because of Covid. There was a line but we got lucky and got a table fairly quickly.  The stuff is super polite, and the merch is great. Spicy Boys Food Truck is on site with great Thai Fried Chicken."

I went there recently with my son and DIL to enjoy their beer and treat ourselves to some outstanding Laotian street for from the SXSE food truck. My favorite was the coffee stout but the amber ale was worthy of another taste.   Located in the obligatory warehouse area the facilities encourage family and pet attendance. Inside seating has a wide variety of games for those at  a loss for words. Outside seating is ample with umbrellaed picnic tables.   Also, it's within walking distance of Q2 Stadium.   Will I be back?  Youbetcha."

                "description": "First, I must profess.  As much as I love my hometown of San Antonio, Austin really has it going on regarding the microbrewery/brewpub scene.   There are so many options in the ATX and 4th Tap Brewing should NOT be overlooked. From their awesome craft beers, to their homemade pizzas, this place has it going on!  Beer - they have precanned beers, crowlers and growlers to go, as well as a handful of fresh beer on tap if you want to hang out in this cool joint/  On my visit, they had nine beers on tap, and I settled on the \"Can You Dig It\" amber ale.  It was definitely good, and I would get it again the next time I visit, but it was pretty similar to an amber ale you can find anywhere else. A little sweet, a little caramel taste to it, and just the right amount of hops - but not too much!  I didn't sample them, but they also have a could of IPAs, a sour, and a couple of different stout types.  Now, let's talk about the food! The pizza is SUPERB! They have several pizzas geared toward carnivores and herbivores alike.  If you don't see a prebuilt pizza that appeals to you, you can always build your own custom pizza.  They also have a handful of salads.  My friends from the ATX shared the 12\" \"Backdraft\" pizza for $12.99 with me.  It was LOADED with huge slices of pepperoni, jalapenos, and house made spicy Italian style sausage. The crust was thin and crispy.  Even if you don't like beer, I recommend stopping by here for a pizza - it.was.that.good!"

We booked a table a couple hours before we were planning to meet up.  Staff was super friendly. Beer was great...loved the Running Man, didn't really care for the gingerbread. Outdoor space was nice and spacious. Definitely felt safe during covid times. Food from the truck was delicious. Props to SXSE because their food is absolutely delicious. I had the beef skewers and upgraded to crispy rice. It was so flavorful and delicious.  Thanks 4th tap for the ease of booking a table, keeping things safe during covid, serving delicious beer and having such a great food truck."

They're so good you will want more.    2.) Great staff.  Really nice, accommodating, and they keep everyone's safety in mind by wearing masks and sanitizing ALL THE TIME!  So no CardiB, I won't get Corona virus here!   3.) Great vibe.  As a woman, I often think of, \"is it safe for me to drink here alone?\"  when out at bars.  I've never had this concern at 4th Tap.  4th Tap is open and bright and has lots of space to be alone or hang with guests.   As I mentioned the staff are great and wear masks and they look out for their guests in other ways, too.    4.) Great bar seats. Great bar seats are an unrated variable and let me tell y'all, I don't slide off these seats!  They're comfy and allow me to drink more beer.  Cause it's all about the beer!"

Very reasonably priced... and several little options for self entertainment including board games, a TV, and a piano.

                "description": "Solid brewery, but I wish there was more varieties of beer offered.  I opted for the flight, which is 5 for $12, but you have to go for the 3 core and can only choose 2 orbitals. It's a shame because I didn't care for 1 of the core items, a really fruity gluten-free beer. (I had a sample and didn't really like it).  Fortunately, I asked really nicely if I could swap it out for an orbital, and the employee said she could. But when my cousin tried the same, she was denied.  +2 Vitality (Core): Spring Ale-and their lightest beer they offer. Smooth and good flavor. Perfect for if you're looking for a light beer.  Zephyr (Core): American Pale Ale-A little more hop to it, but still a smooth and light option.   Long Walk-Grapefruit IPA-Light notes of citrus, hoppy, and refreshing. But in an increasingly crowded market of grapefruit beers, this one gets lost.  Mega-Citrus One-Double IPA-Basically a stronger version of Long Walk. To me, it tasted almost identical, which makes me wonder with such a limited menu, this one is offered. (But then again, why did I choose to sample it? Not too sure myself.)  Brick Top-Robust Porter. I'm not a porter drinker. At all. But once I started sipping, I really enjoyed it. This is a popular and enjoyable one.  Sample cup pours are generous and the prices are really good for the amount you get. (I couldn't finish my entire sample flight!). There indoor seating as well as seating 'outside' in the brewery area. There is a ping-pong table, plenty of board games, and apparently, rambunctious wrestling matches that happening quarterly that brings the whole neighborhood out.  I didn't get to see any wrestling happen this time around, so all in all 4th Tap offers good beer at good prices, but I'm looking for something more to wow."

The space is nice and the AC was turned up, so it was a great respite from the heat. Got a flight of their beers and not a bad one in the bunch! The bartenders were very friendly and knowledgeable and were able to make some solid and informed beer recs for my date who had no idea what beer he wanted.   There is even a piano randomly sitting amongst the tables and a random patron got up from his table, chugged the rest of his pint, waltzed over the piano, took a seat and then started playing and belting out Billy's Joel's \"Pianoman\". A pint w/free entertainment is always a plus!   Can see myself coming back in periodically to check out the new stuff on the rotation"

                "description": "Another unassuming microbrewery in a warehouse that opens into a glorious playground for adults. I wish I had gotten the names of the bartenders because they were so sweet to my mother, who is a lightweight and does not drink alcohol, but was feeling adventurous :) They even went out of their way to grab a beer they were out of on tap, but had a can of it in the back for her to try. She loved it, so she got it on the house. Incredible customer service.   There are plenty of large picnic tables in the taproom, and a whole shelf of board games to keep you and guests entertained. There is a grand piano off to the side of the room, so you know fun times are had here.   In the brew house, there is more seating, a wrestling ring (not sure I get it?), and a ping pong table! Game on.   I really enjoyed the grapefruit hints of the Longwalk as well as the tamarind acidity of the Renewal. Tasting is highly encouraged here as well. My family and I enjoyed ourselves immensely. At the end of the night, I paid a $12 tab! Great drinkin' to do on a budget!  Thanks for taking care of us and for being awesome at life!   -xoxo"

Their guacamole and tacos were good and so was their beer selection. I honestly don't remember which one we got, but just had whatever the servers recommended and they were all good.  The outdoor seating area was nice at night with the hanging lights and is dog friendly (always a bonus for us!).   Street parking is close to impossible to find in the area, but there's paid garage parking. It is pricey, but the only spot we were able to find that wasn't too far from Lazarus."

                "description": "Thursday late afternoon - stopped by here to check out yet another brewery on the street. Mostly packed with people working on laptops, but the open air setup doesn't make it feel too crowded.  Was able to quickly get a seat at the bar and order from the scannable menus. Decided on the Prodigal Pills ($6) to go along with a Breakfast Taco ($3.50). Pilsener is light and crushable, though not much flavor. Breakfast taco comes out fast - packed with eggs, cheese, pico de gallo, and bacon. Thankfully not a stale tortilla and even balance of ingredients. Finished the day off with the Double Predestination IPA ($7)- definitely more of a kick, possible some overkill on the hops.   Service is a bit hectic as the bartenders work off the many tables. Fine spot to relax, especially outside where there are tables available."

I got a Disco Prophet, a strawberry lemonade sour, and a Big Sky IPA - delicious and refreshing.  But the real star was the appetizers. We got chips and fresh guacamole, which paired excellently with the beer. But the real winner was the fried chickpeas, which were like seasoned corn nuts! I've never had anything like that, and it's enough for 3-4 people to share, despite only being $3.  The place was clean, staff was friendly, and there was plenty of seating.

Showed up on a Thursday evening for dinner and was impressed with the amount of people who were here. There is picnic table seating out back with tents in the front for additional seating. There is also plenty of seating inside. There is plenty of seating but the like to order may take some time to get through, so plan accordingly.   I went with the torta as my meal. The bread was authentic and the fillings inside were great. If I had to change one thing I would have asked to get the torta with chorizo although it isn't listed as a protein for the sandwich.   This is a great local spot to check out and a place I will most likely be a regular at."

                "description": "This place has plenty of outdoor seating with fans that keep the flies at bay mostly. The inside was nice and they have everything you'd need to hit the spot. Tacos and beer.   The beer was pretty good. The only sour beer they had at the time was a Rosé flavored one that unfortunately tasted a little too much like wine, but was still digestible. My hazy IPA was not hazy at all, but was still fine. I wish the beers were served a bit colder.   The fried chickpeas were a good deal for $3 we thought they could serve like 10 people. The 2 of us only made a dent in like 1/5 of the bowl. But hey, they're snacky so maybe someone could down the whole thing if they really wanted to!  The carnitas taco was really good. I highly recommend it. The al pastor was alright but didn't pack the flavor punch of the carnitas. I doused my tacos in the free salsa that was in a mini fridge nearby. The red salsa was so good and added a layer of light smokiness to my tacos. But then after a while I thought I sensed some heat? I assumed it was the green salsa so I continued to douse my tacos in the red. Idk it must have been the red salsa that was hot, because by the end of my meal I was feeling sick to my stomach. Never felt that way from spice but needless to say the beer didn't taste too good after that either. Luckily I recuperated by sipping 2 glasses of their Yeti water until I didn't want to vomit anymore.   I can't place my distaste after this meal on the restaurant since it was mostly my own doing . I assume they label their salsas and I just didn't see it."

I will say their tacos were really good, and the place is super huge.  For a Monday it was pretty packed at lunch, but still spacious enough to stay 6-feet away if desired.

                "description": "Hands down the best brewery experience we encountered in Austin. It's a little bit if everything and that's not at all a bad thing as without exception they are all done well. We saw they were open early so we went in on a weekday thinking we could knock this off our list of a full day planned. We weren't real clear on their hours entailed so there was a not so unwelcome idea of a little day / morning drinking to get the day started. We realized this was going to leave us with the opportunity to have a few small samples or perhaps one nice pour. Upon our arrival we were impressed at how the location spanned the corner of the street and had many \"compartments\" of seating areas. I'm no way were Amy of them on the smaller side. Street parking was easy enough and we headed on in.   Very impressed to be greeted with smiling faces along with plenty of good morning exchanges. We were very pleasantly surprised to see they offered an array of espresso drinks. What a welcome pivot to our plan. We ordered up and came to realize they had food as well. Pretty happy about that. There were the assorted pastry items and breakfast TACOS! I noticed there was also queso fondido on the menu and that was screaming please try me. I went to order and was told this item is generally served later in the day. I suspect my sadness to hear this news showed as there was a quick offer to fire up the required kitchen equipment to make this happen (the salamander for those curious).   The lattes were delicious. So much so we ordered up a second round. Near completion of those the awesome cheesy chorizo goodness arrived. Bubbly hot and looking superb. It was all I could do to keep myself from grabbing a chip and putting a scoop of this bubbling sub nuclear cheese in my mouth at the price of completely burning my entire mouth. With a little patience I snuck a few small bites being mindful to blow as to not scorch my mouth. OMG was this delicious in every aspect.   Right away we knew this was just fine with a latte but was screaming for a beer to accompany this perfect breakfast fast. Such an awesome selection of beers. The bartender was beyond sweet and gave us many short pull samples of the tappers. I landed on the one that worked for me. My wife found one that worked well for her. By the time the beers arrived it was clear this was not going to be a short stop. Instead it was clear this was our impromptu plan for the morning. Completely five star experience from the word go. So much so we took the liberty of an evening stop later that week. The vibe of this place was so cool with any hint of pretentiousness. I'm no expert on all the brew options in Austin but this was clearly number one for us based on all it included and the absolute outstanding hospitality from the coffee bar to the bartender to the cook who brought us the miraculously amazing queso. No matter you plans I would highly suggest  in fact nearly insist this is a stop not to be missed. This reviews has been locked in draft land fir a while but there is no doubt this place is still thriving and for all the right reasons."

                "description": "Beer was good. Staff was incredibly rude, un-welcoming and didn't bother at all to try to accompany our party of 6 when we came to see a friend's band. Instead of leading us to a new table or area, once we sat the staff told us we had to leave or we could stand outside in the 40* weather. We got our beers and were standing off to the side and the cashier told us move out of the way so people can order- we weren't in the way, people were not ordering. While I'm writing this we are witnessing more customers treated poorly in the line. Seems like a lot of non-Texans are working here and it shows. Never will I ever come back to this establishment.

I think the flavors they had when I was there were: paloma, rose, and cherry. I got the paloma and rose ciders, and they were so delicious! Paloma for its fruitiness, rose for its sweetness. I got the carnitas taco with avocado, and that was quite flavorful, hit the spot! :) Definitely recommend for grabbing drinks and bites with a friend!"

This has quickly become one of my favorite spots in Austin- whether you're there for coffee and tacos in the morning or high quality brews at night, you really can't go wrong at Lazarus.   I showed up on a Saturday afternoon and ended up staying until after dinner! The ambiance is fantastic- with ample seating both indoors and outdoors and picnic tables for groups of all sizes, Lazarus attracts all kinds, from people working from home to big parties.   The tacos were really great! We ordered the pollo verde and al pastor tacos and they were fantastic. They were a great portion to pair with drinks and while the line seemed long the service was really quick.   Overall, this is a great spot for regulars and I've found myself returning for a reliably good time."

Bumped a star bc of their limited seating (one barrel table) outside, the main bartender was not very helpful and some of the drafts we wanted to try were out.

Was so good we came back Monday to finish off the weekend.    There's a good variety of beers so we did eight tasters and ended up with three separate glasses.  They had a special when we were there called the Apple cinnamon sour; it tasted just like apple pie.  If they reproduce it, I highly recommend a glass.    The place itself is super posh, establishment clean, service was great and staff very friendly.  I would def recommend this brewery.  Oh, met Cooper...he's one of their brewers.  He's really nice."

Street parking is all around and there is a parking garage across the street at the hotel.  Experience: We came here to kill time before our flight, and I am sure glad we did. Their selection of beers were right up my alley. They had a variety of fruit flavored beers. The brewers were super friendly and inviting, I even let him choose my last flight choice. I loved the ambiance of the industrial rose gold with the green wall paint, and the live plant accents. It felt like a relaxing place to go work, study or just hang with friends."

Love any place that offers beer flights, as it's the best way to really know what you like and what your taste buds are in the mood for. I typically go for lagers or Belgian-style beers and personally loved the Lingering Sunshine and Wit-Tington.  The atmosphere is chill, laid-back, and the plants everywhere are totally my vibe. You can tell it's frequented by drinking tours as there was constantly small buses/vans waiting outside for parties drinking inside. Music also made for a nice ambiance and the girls who took care of our order upon arrival were very sweet and informative."

A no nonsense brewery where I genuinely enjoyed every beer I tried-- A gem!   We sat at one of the handful of the tables they have sprinkled in the sidewalk outside. The street was pretty low key for being to close to 6th, so it was enjoyable on the sidewalk! You still order at the bar which was no problem, and the service was quick and efficient!   Rhythm is a Dancer stole the show for me! It's a sour, but it is muted enough that I could drink multiple without my mouth being pursed from tartness! The Kolsch was great, as well. We also tried the soft pretzel which was SO airy which I loved. It also came with a garlic sauce so not your typical pub pretzel, but a very tasty take on one!  Employee's wore masks and maintained distancing, as well, which is great. We found this brewery on a list of spots still enforcing safety restrictions, and can confirm they were!"

You can get a crowler of any beer, which was great for us to take home! Can't recommend CDB enough!  Really enjoyed the indie 2000s playlist as well!!!"

Customer service and courtesy are typically top-notch because...well...it's a brewery.   First let me point out this rating is based more heavily on service than the wonderful beer they served( I'd give a solid \"B\" on that spectrum).  Walk in, bartender says \"hi\" and starts cleaning mugs. We look around trying to figure out when he'll actually approach us. Ok...oh look menus, guess I'll grab one. Standing there waiting for the \"what can I get ya?\" Or \"first time? Here's our menu, let me know if you have any questions.\" Bartender jargon. Nothing. My wife says \"yeah it's our first time here.\" \"Oh, ok\" responds bartender. Finally we decide on our own we'll do a flight and order a pretzel. I'm assuming they specialize in IPAs since they have 4! He takes the order.   I return a beer because a random fly fell in one. I tell the bartender I hate to waste good beer but can I get a new one, a fly fell in mine.\" No reaction, he just asks which beer and refills it.   Good craft beer, subpar service."

Not only was the staff rude, unhelpful and basically wanted us to leave at 2pm but the beer was ok at best. The bartender was so rude asking loudly why are there people here right now (during normal business hours) but anytime we asked about the beer he would say it's on the list. I get it might be busier than normal but there was no line other than our group, and all they did was pour beer no food running or drink running. Now to the beer, out of the two flights of 8 different beers 4 were tolerable and this is from people that don't leave alcohol behind. The sour was decent but heavy, the wheats were way to heavy and honest can't even describe them lol. Anywho long story but won't be back; if I want to be treated like crap i at least want a decent drink"

The women-lead space and brewski selections are rockin', but they're missing a key component--wifi.  I know, I hate sounding like your typical phone-using human being, but every time I'm downtown wifi is super handy. It helps us decide where we want to go afterwards! Anyways, Central is set up like your typical clean and succulent-friendly microbrewery these days. They have board games and serve yourself water (sparkling OR still. THAT's a first!!). They don't have outdoor seating, but plenty of seats indoors. They also sell small bites and other drinks like wines and ciders. Their guest list is pretty solid with brews from Zilker and Independence to name a few other Austin loves. I got a taster of Central's own beers. We really did not enjoy the milkshake IPA that had a strong vanilla aftertaste. It was way too sweet, but to each their own.  Their restrooms are clean and they allow outside food too. SCORE! Now if only the owners would install some wifi...our taptender told us that the owners are still getting that set up. So that's a great sign! They also don't validate parking, so if you need to drive to get here...come on a Sunday when parking is free downtown. Pro. Tip."

You can of course get a flight of beer to taste multiple flavors and I'd recommend doing that...then going back and buying a pint of what you loved the most.   The service was A-1. The woman at the front was very friendly and was open to answering my 500 questions about when they opened, if I can taste different beers, what're those people in the corner with the purple drink drink drinking? In addition to that I'm pretty sure the owners were also just hanging out in there and they were chatting with different guests which made it feel very homey and inviting  Price- on par with other breweries  Great location! Especially if you're just moseying around town ( like I was) and happen to stumble upon it.   The aesthetics are on point. Beautiful Edison bulbs and plan fixtures. Both benches and tables so you can come with a large group or chill on a date."

                "description": "One of my favorite spots in Austin. I love the venue under the live oak trees, the open space, and the playground. No hard alcohol, but I feel they make up for it with their creative cocktails and house-made seltzers.   The food trucks give enough variety that there is something for everyone -- pizza, BBQ, Mexican, and the BEST ice cream! But the best part for me is sitting back in the Adirondack, cold drink in hand, watching my little one playing on the playground with a live band in the background.   I hope we continue to get more places like this in Austin!"

                "description": "Wild place, but really fun! Stopped here on the way to the airport for one last beer on vacation, and was blown away at how crowded it was. There was what seemed like a farmer's market, concert, and youth soccer game all happening around this brewery.   Beer was good and there was a lot of food trucks to choose from. We went to the pizza one and it was good, but maybe would go with the BBQ or Mexican next time."

                "description": "Easily my favorite brewery in town.   The food trailers here are all bomb and on point. This is an awesome spot for lunch. You can get everything from world class tacos, great pizza to Texas Monthly Top 50 ranked BBQ.   The beer is absolutely amazing. The collabs with local breweries and bars such as Cosmic and St. Elmo are all cool and tasty -AF.   The to go beer options are always great. You can have a few pints and come home with some amazing beer to finish the night at home watching a movie with.   I've seen a few shows here. Saw Eternal Champion here and had a blast. The venue is great for live music, anytime they have a live show its worth the cover to hang out and see some live tunes and have some amazing beer.   The best thing about Meanwhile for me happens to be that its extremely family friendly. They have a playground a soccer court and large open field that is perfect for flying kites. They are all fenced in so its the perfect spot for me to bring my daughter to play. My family comes here regularly and we really enjoy the family friendly aspect Meanwhile offers.   I could go on and on about how much I love the beer and just this space in general. Its really do not miss Austin location now.   Thanks for offering so much good stuff Meanwhile you rock!  edit: I almost forgot to mention how awesome the coffee and breakfast tacos by Pueblo Viejo are here."

                "description": "A very Austin brewery, but I mean that in a good way. A lot of thought was put into design, decor and layout - and it shows. Very chic, but also comfortable . Gorgeous outdoor spaces, this is a great place to hit when we get good weather in central Texas. REALLY good beer, tons of styles - but all really well made. Any beer drinker will love a visit here. A variety of food trucks at peak times makes for a versatile dining experience for your group. Very family friendly with a nice play area for kids. Just a great spot. Drink local!"

                "description": "Here's a secret, a lot of folks who go to these breweries don't go because of how good the IPA or the cider is, they have a long list of other factors.   We had an IPA and a cider, they were good, not life-changing, but decent. I have yet to sample the entire beer selection but I will. And you know why? Because of everything else the place offers ensures I'll be back.  The tacos from the taco truck were really impressive, exceeded expectations actually. The pizza was equally excellent.   The set up for the grounds was spot on. The trees, the playground, the environment with families, dog owners, young people, it all meshed well because everyone had a section that fit their methods of socializing.  You can't tell me this isn't a science because significant thought (and money, I'm sure) went into developing this experience. Bravo!  Now I need to drink some more of their beers."

Highly, highly recommend. 100/10, great beer, tasty cocktails, delicious frozen rosé and a killer hard kombucha  This is place also has amazing food trucks too (dough boys- out of this world garlic knots with a lemon ricotta dip*drooling) and a beautiful outdoor area for adults and children (there's a playground!). Adults can have a beverage and lounge while their kids get their energy out. Very fun spot!!"

                "description": "This is probably one of the best breweries that opened in ATX in 2020 - during a pandemic at that! Since their opening, they've been doing gangbusters business with no signs of slowing.  Obviously, when you visit, you'll notice they have a huge space and $$ was spent to fully build it out. It's not a small brewery that grew up, it was built to be big. There is plenty of seating inside and even more seating outside on the turf + mulch area. But, be forewarned this place is busy. Saturday afternoons are packed with people with pets and families. There is a playscape so parents like this place.   Now, to their beer. Meanwhile brews consistent and good beer. They have a variety of beers from regular German Pils to New England IPAs. Nothing infected and nothing with off flavors. They always seem to have a good rotation of beers.   Don't like beer? They also have wine, cocktails and coffee! Something for everyone.   While they don't serve food, there are numerous food trucks to order from.   Even though the lines can get long, they do move pretty quickly (especially the line that is at the main entrance).   We would come here more often if it were closer to us, but getting across the river is the hardest part. :)"

                "description": "Since my last review about Meanwhile's extraordinary support for the community, we decided to return that support and have hung out in their beer garden a few times, enjoying different brews and chatting while people-watching. There are so many trees to shade the area and a playground in the middle for kids to stay entertained and out of their parent's hair. The inside area is clean and modern and very hip with good air conditioning (so important during the summer, well, really 9 months of the year).  We would have been seated there but are still cautious about the Rona. So, good beer, good vibes, good venue. And food trucks though we haven't tried any yet. Cheers!"

I'm always mystified by ANY questionable servers ... don't they know that if they'd give better service, they'd get better tips?!?!!   3 stars to the beer"

There was a kid's bday party there and we didn't notice (yay for our dog). There was plenty of water to help yourself to as well as a nice list of beers. They were all incredible (even the German ones)! They also have some cocktails, frozés and coffee available. We got an iced dirty chai on our way out, since their coffee looked and smelled good. WOW! Nice and strong! I am very picky about coffee being too weak and having to add extra shots of espresso, but this was on point!  We will definitely be back! Great, friendly staff, and we especially loved that we could order beer starting at 10a on Sunday! In early and out early!"

Its nice to have some variety of food choices with the pizza, bbq, and Mexican food offerings.  It seems no matter the day of week or time of day, one or two of the trucks are not serving food even on weekends.  Speaking of weekends... unless you are into family oriented madness, with kids running amok everywhere, because of the playground equipment and soccer pitch avoid this place. We enjoy dining out or having a couple of beers at breweries to kind of get away from life's madness, not to have to deal with this kind of madness."

                "description": "I chose this place for my birthday gathering of around 15 of us on a Friday afternoon and so glad I did!  I wanted to find a Dripping Springs like brewery without making my friends drive out there and this fit the bill.  Some tips below!  Parking - As Austin gets more and more crowded it's hard to find spots for large groups that are quasi central and have ample parking - this place seems to have enough street parking since it is out in the middle of a warehouse district that is empty on weekends.  We were all able to find parking with no issues.  Kids - this place is super family friendly.  My friends with kids felt very COVID safe due to the size of the venue and there is a spaced out area with a playscape.  Drinks and food - I had a few of the seltzer cocktails and they were good enough.  Obvs this is a brewery so I wasn't expecting too much in that dept.  You can order drinks at a window outside which also made us feel safe.  There are a handful of food trucks where our friends ordered.  Also we got there at 2:00 pm on a Saturday and were able to snag a couple large picnic tables.  I think that bc it is new it is not getting too crowded yet.  There was plenty of shade for us once we moved one of the tables around.  There was a ticketed show starting at 7:00 pm that Saturday that required a $10 cover charge so def check their website before arriving if you don't want to pay a cover.  Overall a great addition to the breweries popping up in the southeast Austin area."

Their beer is so good, especially their hazy IPAs. The vibe is so relaxing and cool, with picnic benches under the trees. I hope they open their indoor seating soon, and extend their parking and outdoor seating area. I always bring my friends and family who visit from out of town and I recommend it to everyone whose looking for a must-try local Austin brewery!"

We're usually the only ones on the playscape, and there's always at least one food truck open, plus the cafe.  There is plenty of outdoor seating (inside too, actually), and it's dog and family friendly. Easy parking in their lot, I've never had a problem finding a spot (again day time during the week).   I can't wait to go here for date night!   Highly recommend."

                "description": "The space was vibin'. Plenty of tables and chairs. Also a big playscape crawling with tons of kiddos. But off to the side, so they weren't annoying for the hungover heavy drinkers. On-site soccer field with goal, some dudes were playing a fairly serious game while i was waiting in line for the most delightful chicken tacos with guac and fresh spinach from the Pueblo Viejo food truck.  Reason for 3 stars - worst Paloma ever. Like ever. I was suspicious when i realized the Paloma was listed under 'Seltzers' (after i had ordered :/ ). Then grew more wary when the 'bartender' added WAY too many dashes of bitters ((( when a real Paloma is plenty bitter from fresh Texas grapefruit ))) and it was TERRIBLE. Straight gross.  Also one beer was ok, the Tender Robot- Hazy Ipa. Not anywhere near as caustic as Pinthouse Pizza's Electric Jellyfish, fairly enjoyable. But the only other beer we sampled (the Kolsh) was incorrect, no bitter finish, weak and thin.    So, come for the vibe! Come for the food!  Avoid their weird Seltzer Cocktails Choose carefully (or ask for a sample) of their beer before you commit to a full pint."

There's unlimited street parking since it's in a commercial area. The beer is good, staff is so friendly, it's so cute inside, the PLANTS on the shelf are adorable, the food trucks are great...I can't find fault in it at all. Besame is a must-try for ice cream and Dough Boys for pizza. Distant Relative has amazing BBQ chicken!"

The brewery has plenty of outdoor seating, plenty of parking, clean, new facilities and interior as well as nice views of their brewing equipment. To put it concisely, they check just about every box you could ask for!  They have an interesting selection of beer including a few blends I had never seen elsewhere, the most notable of which was their \"Moot Point\", a coffee-infused amber. Glad to say I can recommend this brewery, the great atmosphere as well as the impressive selection!"

                "description": "Meanwhile Brewing is a great space in South Austin to hang out with family and friends.  I kept hearing that Meanwhile Brewing was one of the best breweries in Austin to bring your kids, and now I see why!  There is so much open space for kids to run around and even two little playscapes.  I brought my 7 and 2 year old and they both had a blast.  My husband and I were able to enjoy some good drinks and food while the kids played.  I should mention - the brewery isn't just for families.  Parents with kids were in the minority when we visited on a Thursday night.  The brewery is great for anyone.  In terms of food and drinks, I'm kinda embarrassed to say that I actually didn't try any of the beer (I know, I know, I'm just not much of a beer drinker).  I did try the frosé (yes, I'm basic), which I enjoyed.  It had a floral note to it, which I really liked.  For food, there are four food trucks on site and our family managed to try them all.  My husband and son raved about the brisket from Distant Relatives, while my favorite was the Bob-a-rita (margherita) pizza from Dough Boys.  I also had pretzel and strawberry jam ice cream from Bésame.  I know, it sounds weird, but it was awesome.  I loved the balance of salty and sweet.  I highly recommend it!  Overall, Meanwhile Brewing is great and our family definitely plans to go back; there is something for everyone to enjoy!"

First off, I really liked the atmosphere. there is a bunch of outdoor seating, which is always a plus.  For drinks I got a flight, so I got a variety of beers. Overall, they were pretty good, however, they don't have a lot of variety in the styles available. I also got a slice of pizza, which was much better than I expected for brewery food. All said and done, it's definitely a spot worth visiting, but isn't the best that Austin has to offer."

Food/drinks - i have yet to have a bad food item from these guys. Everything is delicious and surprisingly thought out. It will take you by surprise. And the drinks. There are plenty of options to taste and enjoy based on your preferences.   $$$ - it is a little pricier then you might expect. But truthfully, for what you get, I will continue to come back here and spend the money.    Give it a shot. I do not think you will regret it.

Quality/Quantity - Beer was mediocre. My family did not like the menu here, so I was pressured to quickly finish my beer and sadly leave.  It should be illegal to only drink one beer...  We hit Trader Joes on the way back and realized they carried the whole line of their beer, so as you can guess, I got two more six packs:)  Now, I am happier.  Atmosphere - You need a much bigger parking lot, especially since almost everyone drives a huge truck. We got lucky with a space, but had to share some of the space with the huge truck to the right and the huge truck to the left, LOL. Teri Joyce and the Tagalongs were playing tonight. They did a good job, the place was hoping. Both the inside and outside spaces are large; however, again too large for their parking lot. Can some people carpool? They also had a small outdoor stand to order beer and food. Additionally, there were plenty of seats at the bar. The team seems to be working pretty hard.  Service - The bartender was just okay. Not much to write about, I ordered, he gave me the beer, and I left; still left a tip though :)  Price - $6.50 + $1 tip  Owner Suggestion - Did I say you need a bigger parking lot? Wish I had more time to enjoy your place, but no fault of yours. Hopefully next time. Keep up the good work."

Food is hard to decide if you are lactose intolerant.  We found a Pulled Pork and it came with a pint of beer. We also got two pizzas for the rest to share.  We had the wagyu and 2 choice of the specialty pizza cauliflower. That was a good choice.  I don't care for beer so I had a cider.   They were out of watermelon So I had cranberry.  Very tart but refreshing.  The bar tenders were all so friendly and nice.  I didn't see anywhere to get beer flights and my son had his bday.  Nothing special like a drink or come out to table.   It's a nice atmosphere with nice folks."

Everyone is helpful and friendly regardless of how busy they are.   Food and service aside, this is just a great place to spend time with the people you love/like. Every time I've been here has been memorable.  Showed up on a Saturday afternoon with a party of 25+ and we immediately found a group of picnic tables and spent the next several hours just enjoying each other's company.   Everyone enjoyed their food and drink but what we'll remember and what I'm most grateful for is the ambiance and hospitality at ABGB.   There's plenty of places to go eat, but when you have a large party and want to make memories with an Austin feel, look no further."

The food alone is worth coming for, it's upscale apps that are absolutely delicious and they also have pizza.  The con (and why I'm only giving 4 stars) is that this is a beer garden that has ONLY SIX beers available - all brewed in house. I wish they at least had some local options that made the beer list a bit longer, after all it is a beer garden. They also have a small list of ciders and wine available. The \"Industry\" Pilsner was great and a nice light beer but"

                "description": "*COVID Update*   ABGB is a must visit when in Austin. Parking in their lot is ample. Restrooms are on-site in the corner. Seating is self-served both indoors and outdoors, and there is free WiFi! Masks aren't required here, and most people don't wear them inside or outside. The menu is on a QR code, which is posted on each table. The water station is in the back.   I got the beer flight $15 as it was my first visit. The pilsner is definitely my favorite; it's a popular one! It's odd that there's only 6 choices, but it helps especially for those who are indecisive. If you order one beer, it's about $6. When I visited on a Sunday afternoon, they had live music and many couples were dancing along. I totally missed the memo to bring my boots and hat.   I tried the Calabrese and homemade sausage pizza ($3.50 per slice). Both were delicious.   Obviously with the live music, it's loud inside, but it's a fun place to hang out with larger groups."

I did a flight to sample their good stuff. It's 5 five ounce pours so it's filling! The bruschetta was good but needed more salt or balsamic dressing. It was still tasty. But the stuffed peppadews were really good. I'll need to come back to try their pizza. There's indoor and outdoor seating. Staff know their stuff. Parking seems to fill up fast.

It's nice because I can keep a running list of spots to check out when I find myself nearby and I don't need t hop on a zoom meeting with a client. ABGB is one of those spots. I stopped in here for a quick beer during covid and it was pretty solid, this is my first time back.   The wifi is good, clearly. I'm writing this review and it hasn't faltered at all. The beer selection is small, but what I've tasted has all been solid. Both in flavor and body, they are true to what they are brewing. Quiet and mellow atmosphere is lovely is for getting some work done and maintaining a medium focus. The garlic fries smell delicious.   The only downside is that I'm getting a little bug action. But I'm also sitting under a tree, in Texas, in June.     I'll be back and probably to eat."

We have always been happily greeted and shown directly to our reserved table. Servers immediately appear and explain how to order. We write our drink and app order on a slip of paper and they scoop it up and bring it back just as we've decided on our main course. They leave you alone unless you need them but are right there if you place the paper on the stand for more beer or water or a box for leftovers. The website is very clear a reservation is required and it is a 2 hour limit. Once the time escaped us and an employee came by with \"a gentle reminder that your 2 hour limit is up\" Nothing rude there.   Covid deets out of the way the chef is awesome.  Food is amazing. We used to come only for white clam pizza and beer which is still an excellent choice but there's so much more to be explored on the menu. I had a peach and turkey with brie and avacado that was simply the best sandwich I've had in my life. Specialty pizzas are so so good. And the calamari and stuffed portobello were very tasty. This is better than elevated bar food.    5 stars ABGB. Keep it going! We appreciate you"

Ample room both outside and inside to sit with your friends or family members. Either way as you walk in, you want to go to the left of the building towards the Tap Room. Yes, it's labeled on their wall.  The Tap room is where you will order your beer, food, and start your tab. Once you order your food you can pick where ever you choose to sit. They do give you an LED lighted pager. So once they page your, there is a particular location where you go pick up your food. It won't be in the tap room. LOL  Their large pizza holds 8 slices. Feeds two to four people depending on your tape worm's needs. Their pizza is phenomenal!!!   They have a great home brew selection on tap and if you are not a beer drinker, they have a great hard liquor selection.  Parking is a dirt parking lot (so if it rains expect mud) and could potentially get limited when this place is busy.  Again ample seating so it's a great place for large groups."

We finally found a place that was great called crown and anchor which was open like they said on yelp!  Received a call back on Monday that called my message of trash trash message, and said that I could look their hours up online if I wanted because they tend to change during the holidays. Anyway, very confusing considering my message was specifically about looking their hours up online. Wouldn't try this place again!"

I wasn't too impressed with the food, either with the variety of things on the menu, or the flavor of the food itself. The best thing I got was a kids' hot dog, which was an all-beef hot dog on a decent bun, exactly what I was craving, and very difficult to mess up. The pretzel and German potato salad were just ok. The beer cheese dip for the pretzel had a funny after-taste. My friend wasn't too impressed with her drink. We thought it was weird that they have a \"Rachel\" sandwich that's really a Reuben. Rachels are usually a spin on a Reuben, either made with turkey, or cole slaw, or something other than corned beef and sauerkraut that's on a usual Reuben. Anyways, they didn't get my order quite right, but corrected it. (I asked to add cheese on top of the hot dog, and at first it came out naked.) Missing a special request isn't too unusual, and they corrected it right away, so it wasn't a major deal.  But things got weird with some friends' orders. We were part of a large group. Two people were wearing political shirts. It was at the very least a strange coincidence that both their orders were not fulfilled. They waited and waited for their food and it never came. Others who ordered after them got their food sooner. There's no proof they were singled out for their shirts, but it sure looks suspicious... The staff said they'd correct it, but they were still slow to do so."

They had a slaw as well that was so unique, I would absolutely order again. We also all split the pretzel which was decent, but would probably recommend a sandwich or pizza over the pretzel."

Parking goes very, very quick. If the parking lot was larger this would be an easy 5/5. There is limited parking out front, around back and across the street but a majority of parking is a brisk walk away."

There were a couple of large private parties there and still plenty of room for the masses. Plenty of parking is a major plus.  They have a stage and outdoor sound system. Dogs are welcome!  Good selection of their own and others' beer on tap plus a full bar. Pizzas and sandwiches are good. The German potato salad is the bomb.   As with many other places, the \"stand in line and wait to order each round\" leads to me not ordering another round.   They could have used 3-4 more bartenders and a couple of bar backs. Maybe sign up for the TabbedOut app to expedite my lush habits."

The Pale Ale and the Mosaic IPA both tasted similar, both were quite sour, more like a cider in my opinion.   The Warm German Potato Salad tasted like mashed potatoes mixed with a tinge of vinegar. The Margherita, lots of sauce, not enough toppings."

                "description": "I stumbled in here on a rainy Friday night and boy was I glad I did! This converted warehouse space is gorgeous complete with cafeteria style tables and leather couches. The outside garden has a stage, fire pits and busy tables filled with students, Texans and tourists. It's all cropped by the traditional TX sting lights above your head.    There was a DJ spinning 45s inside that could be heard both in and outdoors. It was a sound garden of absurdity that wafted through the air. Think, Rosemary Clooney but knocks offs of what he could find at Goodwill of her. (ATX, don't ever change!)  The bar is in the back and after getting the lay of the land, I stepped up to the bar in the back and asked for a recommendation. The bartender asked what I liked and promptly brought me a dark porter in a plastic cup. It was delicious! It was the perfect way to end the night.  Hours and location information can be found on their website. Now scoot along, lil' doggie! This festival of fun is waiting for you."

                "description": "Came here on our last day in Austin after living there for the month. We had driven by this place a few times and always were intrigued. It's huge and looks cool! We weren't disappointed. Came when it was quieter on a Friday afternoon and were in awe by the scale of the place. It has a huge outdoor garden area with tons of seating and a stage. Then indoors the main area was really spacious but a bit hot midday, so we sat in the \"taproom\" where there was good AC. The bar is really nice and features this amazing historic lathe that apparently weighs several tons!  The bartenders were really sweet and they hooked me up with a delicious michelada!! Yum. It was kind of \"bloody mary\" style but I loved it. The only thing that was a bit disappointing was that each michelada was $10 yikes! And they didn't give you any extra beer on the side which I'm used to. They used their draft beers but it would have been a nice touch to give a little extra on the side especially for that price.  We also ordered a pizza. We got \"The Machinist\" pizza that was kind of like a Supreme but without the mushrooms, and something I've never had before on a pizza - pickled onions! WOW I was super happy with the pizza. It was huge, super filling for 2 people but so good that we had to finish it. It was $16 which I think was a fair price. The sauce + pickled onions gave the pizza so much zesty-ness it was amazing."

                "description": "What a Pleasure Palace!  * * *  Some drinking places are about the alcohol.  Some drinking places are about the food  Some drinking places are about the music on the stage or the games you can play.  Some drinking places are about the people you can meet to take home.  Some of the most legendary drinking places are primarily about the room.  If you are looking for a room, Central Machine Works has two of the best.  The back may have the most fantastic beer garden in Austin.  The front definitely does have the most beautiful grand beer hall in Austin.  As soon as I entered the Central Machine Works,  All I wanted to do was grab a beer or three or six,  Plop myself down in one of the corners,  And drink myself off into happy oblivion  The beautiful rooms carried me away into a dream.  * * *  It is easier to describe what make the beer hall work than the garden.  The beer hall is located in an old machine shop.  The machine shop is huge - an entire factory.  It has eighty feet ceilings.   It has a main room that goes on forever.  It has wings that disappear into more intimate corners.  It has fans the size of airplane propellers on the top  And gigantic open doors on both the front and the back.  There is better ventilation in the main hall of Central Machine Works than you get at most outdoor places in Austin.   The main place they pull your beer, is stuck off to the side.  That way if you insist on watching a stupid football game on TV  You can do so far away from the primary hall.  The main hall retains its quiet and its gravitas.  The main hall is black with warm yellow accents coming from wood furniture.  There are ridged translucent half domes filling the room with 1930's light.   Imagine a reading room in a Hearst mansion at night.  This is what the light feels like.  In the corners of the room are the vast vats where they make the beer.  In the middle of the room are two of the most comfortable plush leather chairs on the planet, with plush leather sofas to make the central rectangle.  Drink can often be the first step to falling asleep in a warm golden place.  This black and gold beer hall is just such a warm golden place.  * * *  The outside beer garden is a circus of the senses.   They actually do have strings of light draped over the top to make a big top.  They have two hundred and forty people.  The two hundred and forty people brought two dozen and fourteen dogs.   The dogs are on leashes but they raise a racket every time they see another dog.  The owners are constantly breaking up Hysterical Dog 1 meeting Hysterical Dog 2.  The owners are also assiduous about picking up the pieces when dogs calm down and finish their digesting.  Watching the dogs is as much fun as watching the people.  There are live bands playing.  The bands are good enough to make everything pleasant and festive.   The bands are not good enough to require that you pay attention.  Want to talk to your friends and ignore what is on stage?  No great sin is being committed against the God of Music.  But the musicians fill the garden with happy sounds.  These go with the circus lights and the shenanigans from the dog owners.  By the way, if you look closely, you will find sculpture.  Keep your eyes peeled.   The more you look, the more you'll see.  * * *  How are the food and the drinks?  The brewing is hit or miss.  But when it hits it is fantastic.  I had three different lagers, the American, the Vienna and the San Francisco.  The San Francisco was undrinkable swill. The Vienna was water-in-your-mouth-tolerable.  The American is a great great great hoppy lager.  You only need one good beer to produce a happy night.  Future trips will probably mean sticking to the American and enjoying life.  But the mixed drink program looks extremely interesting.  There is a lot of exploring left to be done.  * * *  The pizza is everything you could want a pizza to be.  I had a Machinist, which on its long list of ingredients includes pepperoni, sweet red peppers and jalapenos.  The peppers were all that was needed to send this pizza off to the moon. But the background players provided good support.  * * *  If you want a bar with incredible music, go to the Mohawk.  If you want a bar with incredible alcohol, go to Russian House or any of the downtown places with Ph.D. mixmasters.  If you want a bar with incredible food, Suerte and Barley Swine are good.  But if you just want to let the fog roll over you in a beautiful place,   You are not going to do much better than Central Machine Works.  I'm putting in a reservation on that leather chair in the middle of the main room.  Sometimes you can have your happy dreams while being fully awake."

All of the pizzas are *chefs kiss*. The frozen espresso martini are hands down my fave bev on the menu. The customer service is next level. I had a friend visiting from out of town so we asked what time the fire pits come on and they immediately jumped to light them up for us. 14/10 suggest this spot!"

The inside has an industrial feel with greenery and comfortable furniture everywhere...definitely passed the vibe check.   One drink you must order here is the frozen tequila sunrise cocktail, it's strong and super tasty with a slice of dried fruit that added a nice touch.   I had a pretzel that was to die for and a burger that was so good, I didn't even get a chance to photograph it!   There's a second bar outside, a stage and plenty of picnic tables with umbrellas; I also appreciate the fact that there are several water coolers around for those extra hot summer days.   The awesome and fun staff were the cherry on top for me and I look forward to coming back for more music and food!"

                "description": "Wow why didn't we come here earlier. A gem of a place with really nice servers.   Ambience- it's a humongous space and the tables are far apart. They have tables outside and inside but the best part is that you can sit inside and still feel safe (from a covid perspective) cause it's such an open space. They have done a marvelous job of using the heavy machinery for their decor especially at the bar.   Food- It's been a while since we had such a delicious, fresh, and hot pizza. The ingredients were super fresh and perfectly cooked. I wish they would have the breakfast pizza during the week as well.   Drinks- I loved their Kolsh and wife really liked the sangria too (see picture)   Couple of things that I wasn't a fan of-  1. The pick up station for the food is setup a little weird. We got a hot pizza (which was awesome) but the fact that I had to carry the hot pan to my table wasn't fun at all. This could potentially cause liability in the future. I was pretty close to docking a star for this but the pizza was way too good :)  2. The parking is a little weird so don't get dissuaded and leave. There is a huge parking lot in the back of the place but you have to go around a little (not a big deal for us but could be for some)  Overall, I'm going here again for sure !!"

Both times we have ordered inside at the historic bar and taken our drinks outside to enjoy the dark relief of the Austin heat! I loved the Aperol Spritz on tap so much we ordered a pitcher of it the second time coming. The ABV has got to be incredibly low with that drink-- didn't really notice any of the desired side effects  after two glasses.  Live music is over at 10 pm on the weekends. Their pretzel left much to be desired for. Dogs are welcome."

But what this means though is that you have to do something to stand out. You can't just brew your own beer and sell it in the warehouse, those days are gone.  Hold Out has a unique and very advantageous situation. They're next to Better Half (I think they're the same owner or partners?) and make great use of the property together as well as the opportunity to collaborate.  Additionally, Hold Out has their own food. While their menu isn't as complete as Better Half's, it's pretty decent for a \"happy hour at the brewery\" trip.  But you can't asses them without considering the Better Half contribution, which I've reviewed separately and loved.  The beer is good, although it lacked range in variety as there wasn't much darker beer. A lot of IPA selections, which I'm sure the market loves...but I don't.   I stuck to the lager and a couple other beers, all with weird names but I guess that's the game these days.   I had the vegan frito pie which was way more delicious than expected and had an interesting mix of flavors.   Of course, it all tied in well because we had dinner from Better Half and I don't need to tell you how good that was. You gotta try the grilled halloumi, trust me.  All in all, good vibe, great property."

To make matters worse, the waiter said \"sorry for the hold out\" and laughed when he gave us our food. I held out on my laughter for that one. It should not take that long for pancakes or burgers to be prepared. No clue what was going on behind in the kitchen but the chef definitely holding out on cooking or something. Hopefully this was a one off experience, but I'm not holding out faith for this place."

Out side under cover were rows of picnic tables, beer was served inside and the food was brought out.  While the beers were outstanding, the food was unexpected, beyond the burgers which we did not try, they had a few interesting dishes such as a Crispy Artichoke  and Pimento and a Indian chickpea inspired take on the chili Frito pie, both were excellent and we are not vegetarians, we just wanted to try something new.  The smoky Rauchbier styled Marzen (?) was unusual and worth a taste but a pint was a little over the top.  Note for those who commented on slow service we were there on a Wednesday and there were no issues, I am sure a nice weekend might be another experience."

Food and beer was OK, but there are PLENTY of awesome open and free restaurants in Austin that don't have arbitrary and ineffective covid rules.  I wouldn't advise walking here with a hungry family in the cold if you're opposed to conforming to mask mandates.  We escaped from Seattle to have a non locked down weekend, super bummed to have caved and supported this place.  They'd probably be checking vax cards like back home if they could.  Disappointing."

                "description": "Good place if you're looking for a lively spot to take friends or out of towners into the heart of Austin. Good drink prices and a good selection of beers, but I didn't find the two beers I tried to be anything special. They have a great food menu and the burger is really good, but it took quite a while for my food to come out. The ordering process was also a little chaotic -- long, long lines and loud music at the counter so it's hard to communicate with staff. Parking can be a nightmare if the lot in the back is full, and the roads are very narrow and uneven when you arrive at the brewery. Ultimately I think this is a good place for those looking to get the Austin experience, but I don't think I'll add this place to my usual rotation."

A great food menu that includes brunch. The curly fries were delicious. You can even order food next door at their sister better half cafe and get it delivered to you here. Their restrooms were brilliant. Best signage of this time!"

Hold Out Brewing's IPA selection did not disappoint.    TIP: Hold Out shares their private lot with Better Half, it's much easier to snag a table here versus Better Half."

                "description": "The food is always superior here. Always exceeds expectations for presentation, freshness, and flavor. The kitchen sink salad for $6 is fantastic. Vegetables are fresh and crunchy, the beets are chilled, the nuts crunchy, the small pear shaped tomatoes are excellent and the dressing is outstanding.  1/2 for $6 is incredible value. The burgers are great and the crispy chicken sandwich (during the week ar lunch) is one of the best in Austin and for the price is perhaps best value too. Have had some ciders that seemed very vinegary and perhaps not right but food is always great."

They have mostly Hazy juicy IPA's, so if you love those this is the place for you! My husband is one of those people and had a great time. I love sours and got the \"syke!\" And I thought it was great. They have food as well which we didn't get to check out but it looked awesome! I grab a cute cropped tank before we left. Hold out has a covered patio with a good amount of seating and seating inside. Our favorite part by far was the bartender that helped us. We didn't get his name but he has red hair and a mustache to match. He gave us some awesome recommendations to check out in Austin. Go for the beer stay for the hospitality!"

A kid devourable kitchen sink salad merried with a happy Dad chomping on a flavour wheel of a Chicken Bacon Burger, essentially a double merry-goround of chicken with bacon, that paired nicely with a Shampoo Horn IPA.  All on the patio, picnicking tabled with a flurry of blazin fans to keep you cool and a melody of tunes.  All to leave me goosebumps for coming back."

We had the pancakes, curly fries and burger. All were extremely delicious, the burger could use some jalapeños/onions but I'll try to see if that's an option next time. We also tried a couple 4oz sampler beers, I'm a pale ale fan and they have a ton of those.   Tons of parking in the gravel lot across. I'll definitely be back!"

                "description": "Made our way to The Oasis during a recent trip to Austin with some friends. It was definitely a bit away from the main city, but a beautiful scenic area. The Oasis is right on Lake Travis, and features a bunch of small stores and outdoor areas in the land surrounding it. We were there on a Friday afternoon, and surprisingly not a lot of stores were open, which was a bummer. Of course though, we were there for the brewery, which we were able to make it to. They offer plentiful indoor and outdoor seating; it was a nice sunny day so we opted for the outdoor seating. It was lovely outside but it was SO windy, even after we tried to switch locations outside. It was hard to keep our food from blowing away! The view was super nice though, so despite the wind, we appreciated the scenery surrounding us.  For food / drink - of course, I focused on beers. I was a bit disappointed to learn that they didn't offer flights - they had a good number of offerings, it would make sense to do flights! Oh well, at least they offered half pours, so I was able to try 2; I went for the gose (kiwi dragonfruit) and the Oktoberfest. Both were OK, not the best ever beer but refreshing; I definitely favored the gose! My friends enjoyed their pours as well. For food, we all split some apps, going for the OTXBC trio, the bretzel, and the truffle fries. The trio was a bit disappointing - it was underwhelming and a little piecemeal (we had thought everything would be mixed together but it was just a pretzel on top of the chips with the dips on the side). The bretzel itself was tasty, but the sauce was interesting; we thought it came with queso, but the dip we received looked nothing like queso and was thick with chunks of something in it (pepper maybe?). It was tasty, but unidentifiable. Lastly, the truffle fries were the best option - they were nicely seasoned and crispy with a large volume. We all enjoyed those! The prices were relatively reasonable for what we got in terms of quantity and quality.   Overall, we enjoyed our afternoon at Oasis Texas Brewing Company. The space is lovely with a great view, but the food and drink is just OK; you're definitely more there for the experience. I would definitely make it back to OTXBC during a next visit to Austin to try more beers and take in the nice view!"

We got to experience and enjoy the best of both in a way.   Amazing fresh made as well as barrel aged cocktails, a nice range of food options, and of course, breathtaking views.   The Barrel Room is rustic chic with fancy couches and a pool table. The tap room is plain rustic with a live music stage. The tap room had burgers and sandwiches to accompany the beers brewed on site. The barrel room offered pizza and wings to eat in between cocktail sips.   Oh, don't miss observing the really cool stairs in between the two floors."

Even on this cloudy day the sunset still peaked through and gave us a show.   Drinks are good but food isn't really anything to write home about. Its more about the experience you get here for sure.  They have a large parking garage and parking lot on site with plenty of free parking even on a busy night. There's also a golf cart shuttle to get you from the lot to the entrance if you need it, but it's also a walkable distance.   Really great spot to visit if you want a nice spot to watch the sunset and definitely has that wow-factor for visitors!"

The space is large and everyone seemed to be following the safety rules while indoors. We were a party of 8 and we had plenty of space.  I ordered the basic burger and they usually prepare it Medium rare. I asked for medium well and wanted only mayonnaise and cheese. It was cooked the way I requested but was very dry since they did not give me Mayo. My wife ordered the Fish Tacos (3) and said they were great. She ended only being able to eat 2 and another guest finished her last one. She said she would order again next time.   All in all is was good just not great."

The whole experience overall is just underwhelming? If thats the right word. There is always the steps  1. get in line to get on to the wait list 2. once in front be told the wait is 1-2 hours 3. get in line again for the bar  4. finally get seated and wait again for slow service.   One question is Why? Why would you even go here? The wait is 2+ Hours sometimes. The food is cafeteria quality at best. They are SEVERELY understaff. Oasis Brewery has better food and literally the same exact food. The quality of the experience over all does not justify the amount of time, money and effort for this place."

The Texas skies are truly breathtaking during this time and Oasis is perfectly positioned for patrons to see all that the sun has to offer. Come 1 hour early to snag a table next to the railings in order to get the best (unblocked) view.   Food: 3/5. My date and I only ordered the Pico Verde. It was a refreshing snack but nothing special. We would've ordered more but there wasn't a huge selection and nothing that caught our eye.   Drinks: 3/5. Very limited selection of beers. It's almost weird that this place is called a brewery because there are literally like 8 to pick out of. Most people just come here for the view though so it's not a huge problem.   Overall, definitely a gem in Austin. It's a great place for dates or just to hang out with family or friends. It's so pretty here that it doesn't even matter what I'm eating or drinking!"

We were at the brewery on third floor, ordered some beer and food, kitchen was bit slower than normal (they were busy! So that's fine), we ordered 3 items and they only gave us one and the guy took my call alarm and about to walk away, so I asked him where are my other two items, and he looked confused then asked me, else you ordered? So I told him what they were, and took him a minute to look around, and it was sitting right next to the first item, but he just simply looked confused!  I wouldn't suggest to come during busy weekend, unless you don't mind of waiting longer time, and getting mixed up on what you've ordered.  Overall still a great place to take visitors."

With the relentless Texas heat, nothing beats a tall glass of cold brew and a plate of parmesan truffle fries while enjoying an amazing view of Lake Travis with good company. If you're not a fan of beer, they do offer wines, ciders, cocktails, and margaritas. Speaking of margaritas, a true Texan can always tell if a place is good if their margaritas are on point!"

For the beers we had Grand Cru Dark Ale and Samurai Lager.   The Grand Cru Dark Ale comes in a small cup. The server assured me that was a good amount unless I was really found of dark ale. He was right that was a good amount because that beer is strong.   I pretty sure I wasn't going to finish the beer if I had asked for a double sized cup.   Really nice experience over all.

Texas weather is just right this time of year, the views make you want to make the drive from Cali to the lone star state just to get that perfect pic over the lake with a drink your hand in the free state of Texas....but don't be disappointed when you are greeted by a not so friendly mask police manager that wants to wear his mask under his nose ....   the guacamole had zero taste the salsa was watery and had zero flavor... the chips were the bottom of the barrel... all of the guests seated around us were unhappy and didn't receive good service either but were happy with the views. The fellow guests/visitors we met were super cool and that was the best part... the drinks food and service were way below average... what is it with these places? get it together! the views bring us there but you need to pick it up from there... managers are clueless... bartenders were so rude....embarrassing for Austin...  so many visitors and this is their first impression of Austin unfortunately... we can do better.  We ordered 2 pizzas and left 80% of them on the table....Tasted frozen with ragu sauce.... I can't even begin to explain the regrets I have going here... The guy that gave us a ride on the golf cart up was very nice and now I feel he may have been trying to warn us about going there..  Bathrooms were gross and tables were nasty... nobody was cleaning up after people.... trash and masks everywhere and near the water... I follow not unfollowed their social media page and the pictures are very enticing but it's the exact opposite of what you actually get... from the drinks to the food.. Fire pit was a nice touch.. we stopped to talk to other guests there on our way out... Its a one hitter quitter for all..  won't be back... what a waste of location."

                "description": "Wow. Just wow. I wish I lived in Austin just for this place, better said, Oasis on Lake Travis makes you want to move to Austin lol. I was really impressed with the scenery and view of Lake Travis, the fact that parking is free and that this location is really affordable.  This brewery offers an immense and spacious interior and exterior to enjoy your adult beverage and your company with a vining atmosphere and beautiful view. Honestly, this place is the place to be to hang out with friends and family or a date. :)  The affordable local brewed beer is amazing. Fortunately, as I am not an avid beer drinker, this place had a Wisconsin sourced stout and I am grateful they had a seasonal stout to offer to those with a stout palate. That just made me so happy because I wanted to drink with my family. They do have a full bar on the 2nd level but we didn't want liquor.  The bartendar, black guy with nice eyes and hair, was so patient and helpful. He even let us taste one of the crafted beer. Reason for this was because the website (menu via qsr code) was not updated to reflect what they had and we had to select what we wanted again lol. So he was just great and patient.  My brother in law ordered some food which I think is not really worth it BUT if you didn't have the chance to eat and didn't want to drink on an empty stomach, then go for it. Otherwise, if you're hungry and you wanted a meal, yeah, no, eat before you come here.  I can't wait to go back just to enjoy the ambience and energy with great, affordable beer!"

                "description": "Come for the views, they're the absolute best in Austin. You won't top this. The only trouble is it's on the 3rd floor and the elevator has been out of service for 3yrs so whatever you have you're carrying. We got amazing pics and they actually have a nice selection of vegan options! We were pleasantly surprised and stayed here a while. Drinks were just OK. My husband has IPA's and I have Rosé and whatever I drank gave me the worst headache. They're not carrying top selections but since people come for the view I don't think they care. Nonetheless - we'll be back for sure! We just can't bring visitors unable to walk 3 flights of stairs. There are wheelchair accessible views on floor one though so still worth the visit."

I think we got there at the right time because we were able to secure a seat inside where it was considerably cooler than the outside seating.   The process for ordering was fairly simple and the lady helping me was kind enough to break it down for a new out-of-towner. We got 4 sour beers and they were really interesting. On this particular occasion I had a new experience after I finished my 2nd sour beer. I learned that sour beer gives me heart burn. 1st time ever. I was asking my friend what this fire in my chest was. She loved the sour beers she ordered and we got glasses to remember the occasion. BOB... you'll always be my first.   I recommend checking it out and if you like sour beers Blue Owl Brewing will put a smile on your face. The staff is friendly and hip, and the beer flows as does the good times.   Prohst!!!"

The staff if exceptionally nice and has great customer service. I'm not a beer fan but I do love their Peach and Blueberry beers!  Their coolest thing is for $20 you get a great glass with beer and 3 others in plastic cups. Cool concept and a lot of beer in pours.  Getting a great following and you should go!!"

We ordered a glass and got 4 beers with the glass, if you are not able to finish your 4 beers, they will let you take the extras to go in cans! I believe the size we got was $20 per person. They had about 3 different options for sizes of glasses. The girl said we could even share one order if we wanted less beers per person.  I love all the options of the beers (they are all \"sour\" and DELICIOUS)!! My all time favorite that I tried was the Jubilberry!  The only complaint I would have was parking was a little hard to find but we ended up parking in a lot close by.  We will definitely be coming back when in Ausitn!"

I cannot recommend it enough -- thought I didn't like sour beer, oh boy I was wrong. Absolutely ADORE the Tangerina, Tiki Hop Totem, Plum de Plume, Limetastico and Jubilberry beers. And they had a Plum de Plume + mango beer slushee, so yum! Patio was very full on Sunday so we had to wait to snag an outdoor table but it was worth it. The staff is always incredibly nice and feels safe for COVID. Every Thursday they spin a wheel for a growler deal -- entire growler of amazing beer for $9! And their merch is so cute, definitely have a koozie collection now. Biggest perk of in-person is if you buy a beer glass (pictured here with a very cool design) you get 4 pours for $16. It really doesn't get better than this."

You know, it's been a while since I walked around a neighborhood without my phone constantly telling me where to go. This time I did, and Cesar Chavez led me here and to so many other amazing spots!   You walk in, order a glass that you get to keep! And then you get 4 beers in that glass! The best part? If you are like me and get the cool goblet at 16 oz. you can't drink that much beer at once. You can keep your tasting card and come back for the other 1 or 2 that you maybe couldn't do at visit #1! I think the limit is about a month between visits, but I'm not sure. Honestly, we came here 3 times. One time we didn't have our tasting cards so just did 4 tasting size glasses. Yes, we are big fans and came back to Indy with 4 glasses!   The patio is covered which is great during Texas spring/summer. If you're lucky, and someone leaves and hands you their card, double bonus!   I highly recommend visiting because even my husband, who does not love sours as I do, found a beer he liked (Van Dayum), and we even passed on the love to my sister-in-law who lives in RR! (How has she not been here yet?!)"

BOB is your uncle and your favorite sour beer. Come in and select a size, get 4 samples in that glass, and when you finish - keep it! The glass is yours.

For $16, my friends and I each got a normal sized glass to take home and 4 pours of any choice (you can do 8 half pours). There are also different types and sizes for glasses, so you could opt for a bigger or smaller glas.   Beer/Sours: Great quality drinks with a wide range of flavors. If you don't like sours this may not be the place for you, but definitely give it a shot if you like beers in general.   Service: Nothing to be said here, super nice and friendly staff!

                "description": "If you like sour beers, youll love this place. Personally i find it gimmicy. The sour beers dont do it for me. Also they make you buy a pint glass before you can order.  The main draws are that its in a cool neighborhood, i like that the beers are highly alcoholic. Also their patio is dece, but it could use more seating. Finally, their gimmicky ordering system causes people to leave free beer tickets around constantly. I like free beer.  The big gimmick, which I find annoying, aside from the sour beers buying a glass when you to get a drink. When you buy one, you're basically comitting to four 12 oz. pours and possibly coming back in the future. There are other sizes, but the 12 oz. Is the best value and it feels weird drinking beer from a shot glass.   You can bring a glass you already bought, but overall its annoying to bring a pint glass to a bar. If i wanted to clean my own glasses, i would drink at home. Thats why youre kinda commiting to coming back by buying one.  They give you a sheet to check off the number of pours. The sheets are transferable and can be used on different days so make sure to hold on to them. Also, we usually find a sheet of people who didnt use all their pours so youll usually get a few free."

                "description": "When we were walking over to this place from Lazarus brewing my wife said, \"I think they only have sours\". I was like no way, I will just grab an IPA or something... Oh man was I shocked to see that they literally only had sours. With that being said let me start this shockingly high review for a place that only has sours by saying... i do not care for sour beers. So a 5 star coming from a person who doesnt enjoy sours should say something.  I loved everything about this place. This place is in a cool location, has a great logo, has great aesthetic, and a really cool flight idea. If it wasnt all sour beers... I would live at this place.  Let me explain how the flights work here. You pick your glass size... If I were to guess I would say 4oz, 8oz, 12oz... but honestly that is a guess. Then you get 4 samples in that size. You bring up your sheet, they check off the beer and you sample it. Oh and the best part is that after you are done you get to keep the glass. Oh and the prices are not crazy. I want to say it was $6, $8, $10, but that might also be off. This is definitely one of the coolest strategies I have seen for flights at a brewery ever... Oh and the glasses all looked really neat for sure.  Now onto the beer. Like I have mentioned multiple times already, I am not a fan of sours, but I liked the initial flavor of most of these beers. We had the wee heavy, the red, the earl grey one (lazarus colab), and the cherry stout. Everything had a great crafted flavor, until I hit the sour note. I relied on my wife to drink most of these, but I was very impressed by everything for sure. And my wife was happy with everything as well.  I would suggest anyone in Austin come visit this place for sure. Definitely worth the trip and more so if you like sours!!"

The concept though was something I've never encountered. You can't just walk in and buy a pint of beer. You must purchase a glass, which comes with 4 pours. There are a variety of glass sizes from taster to full pint and the prices are actually pretty cheap ($16 for the full size glass and 4 pours). If you are already in the area and want to try something different it's worth a stop but probably wouldn't recommend going out of your way."

                "description": "Spent a whole evening here due to the unusual policy of requiring you to purchase a glass that comes with 4 pours. We drank our 4 14 oz pours over the course of a few hours, but it's nice that we had the option to bail earlier and take home a can instead. The patio is nicely set up with distanced tables, fans, and hand sanitizers at every table. We brought over food from Vegan Nom, a couple minutes walk away. My partner and I each tried 4 different beers. All were delicious! This was our first visit to the brewery despite buying the beer from stores many times. I would definitely come back but with the awareness of the policy that you have to buy at least 4 12oz pours (you can split amongst multiple people though). I think the real highlight of visiting the brewery are the frozen beer drinks. They had a \"Mexican Marteeny\" available the night we went, which is based on the Teenybopper ale with some other things mixed in. Amazing, and a great final glass! The bartender was lovely and was able to answer all our questions, too."

                "description": "Visited Blue Owl Brewing on Sunday evening. Extremely different and very bold beers, but even as someone who loves sours, difficult to get into.  Quality: I visit breweries relatively frequently, and I can confidently say Blue Owl Brewing is doing some very interesting things. From the way you order to the explosion of sour, nothing is familiar. We went with the Half Pint Glass and tried four beers, Little Gose, Van Dayum, Hop Totem, and Professor Black. I also got a sip of Cool and The Gang and Admiral Gravitas. And while you expect a gose to be sour, the red ale, IPA, cherry stout, and imperial oatmeal stout are not things you expect to pucker your lips. Does it work? I don't really think so. The standard sours were good, but the other styles are just overpowered and lose their charm. I give credit for going bold, but I think the experiment went too far. Quantity: Guests choose an 16oz, 12oz, 8oz, or 5oz glass, which then comes with four pours. Value: $12 for the Half Pint Glass with four 8oz pours. Ambiance: Blue Owl Brewing is located east of Downtown Austin. The brewery is in a good sized warehouse, but the taproom is relatively small. Most of the space is taken up by equipment. Out front they have a skinny patio area running adjacent to the street. Inside they have a bar at the center and then a few tables with high tops surrounding it. The decor is very cozy and homey. In the background indie hip-hop played along, which felt like a good choice. I will say the collection of games they had to occupy visitors, much like the beers, strays from the norm. With around twenty games, I had never heard of any of them before. Crowd: A few other people, but most did not stay very long. It is a very niche style of beer, and it is not really for many casual beer drinkers. Service: The ordering method is strange, which I am sure is annoying to the staff. However, everyone I interacted with was extremely friendly. Parking: Limited street parking on the main stretch, however parking can be found along the side roads."

I'm not a sour fan, even though I've done my best to try it every time I hit up breweries. Blue Owl is different...here's why.  True, their beer menu is all sours. That usually turns brew lovers like myself off, BUT keep reading the descriptions of the sours. They brew the sours with other beer varieties that some may enjoy more--hefeweizen, lager, IPA, you name it, they make it. It's called sour-mashing here at Blue Owl. I KNOW. I was drawn to their extensive menu and had the opportunity to try two that night. I love hefes, so went with the Litte Boss, which was a session wheat sour. VERY crisp and refreshing, almost like a lager, and exactly the perfect start to my beer tasting here. The great thing is, ALL beer drinkers knowledgeable or novice, can figure it out. Their menu has a timeline that tells you what is lighter on the palette, and what might be harsher. Their Little Boss was on the clean/light side, so I knew that would be a great starter...and it was! I also chose the Hop Totem because it was an IPA sour, and it didn't actually have as bitter hops as I thought it would. It was not as bitter, but the sour taste came out more for me...so I preferred their Little Boss more.  We stood at their standing tables, as all the other tables were full. They have board games (SCORE!) and every beer lover's favorite things to hear--A GLASS FOR KEEPS. Yup. Mine is sitting in the freezer in its new home. There are various sizes of beer selections, so take that into consideration when you're deciding what size of your drink to get. Also, you can ask the sweet taptenders if they have any stickers lying around--and you might get one for free!"

                "description": "The concept of buying a glass (to was an interesting concept as we were visiting and didn't want anything else to lug around. However, the pricing was not bad for what it was. I got the small 5 oz. glass and was able to get 4 beers to try. They were all delicious, even the sour hazy ipa (and I typically do not like iPad due to the hoppyness). Definitely recommend if you like sours like I do. They have a lot of different ones so you won't be limited."

She had been, but it was my first time - although I'd been eyeing Hopsquad as it was building up and it had been on my list to visit. The parking is limited, so plan ahead. The space is bigger than it looks from the outside - as it has an indoor bar as well as an outdoor picnic table area. I tried two beers (can't remember which ones) and they were both very good. The menu had good variety, so I feel like it's a good spot to bring a group that could have diverse beer tastes. The staff was friendly and seemed to be happy working there. I would definitely visit again!"

                "description": "This is a very wide-open brewery with plenty of places to sit, stand, chill out, hang out, etc.  I had the Cowboy Bevo (which is a brown ale).  I usually love the sweet, malty taste of a brown ale, but the IBU rating on this one was a little high for my tastes.  Not terrible, mind you, and I would consider it again. Just a little hoppy for my tastes.    It's in an industrial park, like many breweries are, but it was a nice, spacious, and clean set up. Service was quick too - so was parking.  On my last visit, they even had a local band playing from within one of the loading dock doors.   Bottom line, great tastes, services, parking easy, and some good live tunes.  Check them out!"

                "description": "Design aesthetic on fleek. Open ro ALL customers--dog and kid-friendly! Strong wifi and food truck supported, Hopsquad is going places.  We walked in excited to try their beers. We heard about this spot and it was so easy to find off the main road. It's connected to Circle Brewing and separated by an easily-crossed chain fence. UGH! How convenient. Beer nerds unite! The mural art is very instagrammable and the interior is even more of a design paradise. The chairs, tables, succulents, artwork and all-around ambiance is so calming, zen and open. It's the perfect place to get work done or enjoy a sunny day with your furry friends. We were a group of four, and all of us loved the space. They also have strong wifi, so y'all know this girl would rather get studying/work done with a beer over cafe drinks any day.  The restrooms are also very clean and GET THIS...they have tampons, pads and AVEENO LOTION IN THE WOMENS' RESTROOM. Yee-haw! They have flights of four for the typical Austin price of $10. Everything is wonderful about this place. They also have a little strip of grass for dogs to do their business--and they have a poop bag station too. The food truck looks like omakase (I'm not entirely sure), but they have so many outdoor games/picnic tables as well as indoor activities like fooseball and dog treats.  The aspects that could be improved are parking. Yes, they have additional parking that's a few lots away...but immediate parking is a drag. We got lucky and squeezed in on the side by the large trash receptacles. The beers also weren't everybody's favorites. They did have a selection, but they only have a few beers on tap. However, Hopsquad is so very green still...that variety will take time. GREAT new brewery providing a hip space for all folks!"

                "description": "We chanced upon Hopsquad recently, and I don't think I've ever been more comfortable at any other brewery in Austin. I do agree that their beer is still probably finding its footing (Austin does have a competitive craft beer scene, after all), but I don't think other places can hold a candle to Hopsquad's absolutely chilled out homey vibes.   I'll do a pros and cons list.   Pros:  - I can bring my human +canine children and seat them indoors.  - the staff actually don't mind human children.  -cider and wine available for non-beer drinkers   -the staff like my canine child (and there are plenty of other dog parents who visit which means you can play \"I pet that dog!\")  - board games  - foosball table  - plenty of space   Cons  - I truly believe there are better beers out there.  - cider portions are small - from a can and a little steep , price wise  So when you weigh the two, the pros beat the cons by a mile. As for the beer- give them time. I mean, no one really cared about a few other noted breweries 5 years ago but look how popular they've become now ! Here's to Hopsquad becoming Austin's next too brewery.   - food truck outside  - plenty of parking"

As the name suggests they are very much hops forward. I am not. I came in and asked the woman about non-hop forward beers. She suggested one and I tried it. It was very hop forward. The bar, if you call it that, is very pretentious. Would not come here again if traveling through Austin."

They're welcome!  We enjoyed the ambiance, hubs enjoyed the beer (I'm doing dry January) and they've got an amazing Japanese food truck out front (Tsuken Hoten) and their shiitake and avocado bowl was fantastic! They'll be serving a limited seating omakase very soon and it'll be reasonably priced!   We've got tons of greta breweries in austin but I think this one is in my top 5 for ambiance, dog-friendly, great grub, plenty of power outlets if you want to work, and friendly staff! I'll be sure to taste their beers myself and update this review accordingly.  Plenty of parking, and you can park in the lot by Circle if you can't find one in their lot. Head on over ASAP (Wed-Sun) only for now."

                "description": "I stopped in this past Friday for some crowlers to-go. As this was my first visit, I tried three different offerings. First off, their online ordering is slick and seamless. Secondly, they seem to have adapted well to the pandemic with adequate spacing between their outdoor tables. I would definitely feel comfortable having some pints in their beer-garden. If you are as excited about Austin FC (soon-to-be season ticket holder) these guys are within easy walking distance to the gorgeous new stadium. I can see myself having pre-match beers here before taking the short walk to the stadium.  Now on to the important stuff: the beer!  I opted for their Kate la Quimica SMaSH IPA, Professor Pleasant pale ale, and my personal favorite style Sir Winsor ESB. I found the SMaSH to be my favorite, it was a fantastic representation of the style, 9/10. My second favorite was the ESB, major kudos for carrying this style that is far too rare state-side. It was delicious and my second favorite of that style in town 8/10 (bonus point for a well-done obscure style). I thought the pale ale was fair, I found it to be a bit one-note. Though pleasant on the nose, it lacked a similar nuance on the palate 6/10. All said, I will definitely be back to try their extensive and varied roster of brews. As a bonus, the staff I spoke with were extremely friendly and happy to talk about both their brews and Austin FC. Keep up the great work!"

There is a decent amount of space both indoors and out, but I could still see how this place could get packed.   We went around 5 on a Friday and it wasn't empty but also wasn't too crowded. It was nice out so we sat outside. I got a flight which was only $10 for 4 smaller beers and I could pick any of the options on tap.   I'm not a big beer drinker so I don't know that it's fair for me to detailed review each beer, but from the variety I'm sure any one that likes beer could find something they enjoy.   Great place to bring a group! They also have a little food truck/ restaurant out back that looked really good but I haven't tried yet."

The problem is that it takes longer to get a beer here on Austin FC game days than any of the other places. I know there's a big crowd on game day, but how dumb not to anticipate that and bring in more staff. A brewery exists to sell beer. And you'll wait 45 minutes in line to get one here. Hopsquad just hasn't figured out how to serve beer at a reasonable speed so they are selling half as many as they could while inconveniencing everyone."

We came to Live Oak brewing Company on a Monday afternoon for a drink before heading out. It is spitting distance from the airport and a nice spot to wait if you have to kill time before a flight.  They offer a nice variety of beers and I think the main attraction is their disc golf course. We saw several people playing disc golf and enjoying a nice cold beer. They sell snacks like chips and pretzels but nothing homemade. I'm not sure if they have food trucks that rotate through or not.  Plenty of parking and good beers."

                "description": "This is my first time at Live Oak Brewing.  I was staying at a hotel near the airport and this brewery came up.   This is what I consider walking distance (under 2 miles) but it would be a quick Lyft or Uber if you aren't someone like myself.   First off, let me tell you about the staff here. As soon as I walked in the door I was greeted with a welcome like I was an old friend that they couldn't wait to see.  I told them I was a new comer and they were so happy to tell me all about their brews.  They explained each brew on tap and I asked which beer they recommended.  They suggested their Hefeweizen which is spectacular. Such an easy drinking wheat ale with a bit of a tangy finish.    It is definitely worth the visit.  It's animal and kid friendly with great seating indoors and outdoors. Looks like they also have a great stage for some live music and fun. Disclaimer it said they take Apple Pay but they do not.  Which is cool but a site isn't telling the truth.  Not their fault.    I will definitely making frequent stops here whenever I'm in Austin! Thank you for such a wonderful experience Live Oak Brewing! Y'all are the BEST!!!"

We headed over to live oak and had a great time on their 14 (?) hole course that winds throughout their land and is very well kept. After we played, we visited the Black Forest German food truck which is always parked in the parking lot. The potato salad is killer! We also got a flight from live oak and every thing that we tried was super yummy."

                "description": "I've always loved Live Oak beers whenever I can find them on tap, and I'm so glad we stumbled upon this on our way into Austin! The brewery is pretty secluded and tucked away behind the airport. The large oak trees that surround it are beautiful, and they have plenty of outdoor seating under the trees that's perfect for a nice day! There is also some indoor seating and the whole place is dog friendly. They have a huge selection of beers - the pils and marzens are my favorites. There's also a German food truck (The Black Forest) that I believe is always posted outside by the outdoor seating, so you have a food option if you need a bite to eat."

Shade.  Food truck. All Covid precautions in place.  Because of the extra precautions, it does take a while at the ordering/pick up table.  Understandable.  I ordered their sour, The Gose Coriander Salt Sour (where they add a flavored syrup of your choosing to it).  I love sours but just found the flavor of this one kind of weird.   Almost \"smoky\" tasting.  I didn't finish and got their Oktoberfest instead (much better!).   Plenty of parking and nice clean bathrooms."

                "description": "Oh Live Oak Brewing Company do I love you so!  You are always friendly, safe, spacious, and shaded for me and my company when we head out to enjoy your delicious and fresh beers. I cannot get enough of the Hefe that is always served ice cold and deliciously the best on a warm spring afternoon.  You keep doing you, boo!  I have had a leaving-to-a-new-gig goodbye party here where there was plenty of outdoor space for us to hang out, drink beer, and enjoy company with coworkers here pre-pandemic. Easy parking, lots of space to move around and/or play outdoor games, and never a fuss with separate tabs and closing out your tab.  Most recently we came for a friends birthday on a late Saturday afternoon and this place was buzzing with lots of other families and parties enjoying their beers under the nice big oak trees.  I highly recommend you lathering the SPF or sunscreen if you are going to be under a tree or even if you are in the shade especially in spring or summer times.  There will be plenty of picnic tables and areas for you to choose even if it does seem or look crowded when you walk in.  I was really impressed with how the set up is at Live Oak now in pandemic times. There is one single line to order your beer(s), 2-3 servers helping at 1 long table, easy and no contact for paying or opening up your tab, and clear signage and offerings on what beers they got on tap, in bottles/cans, and to-go as well.  Everyone in line are very patience and polite in giving you 6 feet distance as you wait to place your order.  There is 1 food truck, The Black Forest, onsite that also offers contactless payment and has the best German snacks and food. I highly recommend the pimento cheese if you see it on the menu. You are also welcomed to bring your own food to enjoy as you sip on some tasty beers. I even saw a large bbq pit, if I am not mistaken, as well that you could probably use or might have to reserve(?)."

                "description": "I'm now conditioned to pay a visit to Live Oak before I fly out of the Austin airport. Location is key!  Everytime I've been, I got the tasters. They're a little pricey for tasters. The standard for 4 tasters right now is $10, but Live Oak's are $14. They give great pours, come in cute wooden handles, and are equipped with little paper cards with beer info in it for the true beer nerds. I've never had to wait in a long line when I've come, but to be fair I've only come during the late afternoon. My favorite hands down is their Hefeweizen--there's a reason why it won awards! I really did not like the Smoaktoberfest. I love me some smoked flavors--mezcal, roasted tea, etc. BUT the Smoaktoberfest was not a winner...it reminded me of goji berries, which I do not like.  I wish their German food truck would open when the brewery was open. Both times I've been it wasn't open, and I've wanted to get real food while I was here before heading to the airport. That was a big bummer. However, Live Oak does have some snacks for those who get hungry. I've had their Zapp's potato chips and their pretzels with the green chile flavor. They were alright, but kinda pricey. I would suggest bringing your own snacks. Keep it light though, like chips or something. Their restrooms are very spacious and clean, and I love that they have outdoor AND indoor seating galore. Great space for all group sizes, but I've never seen dogs here. I did see someone bring their kid, so I think that's okay.  There is an abundance of parking for all car sizes. The drive there is kinda shady as you turn off from the freeway (like broken windows in cars that are parked along the road, and oooooold cars that look like they've been abandoned for years), so be sure to keep valuables hidden or with you when you go into the brewery. Can't wait to go back!"

As with my last trip, three years ago, Live Oak does German and Czech-style beers, and does them extremely well.  The brew my favorite pilsner, and normally I shun pilsners.  This time we also tried a number of their smoked beers--all were delicious.   Live Oak features a clean, modern indoor room, where you can borrow board games, as well as an outdoor seating area under large oak trees.  They also have a disc golf course.

The outside tables are a perfect place to enjoy mother nature.  Beers tend to be lighter and yellow, although there were a couple of darker variety.  Mostly low ABV.  Live Oak Beer would be very tasty in the hot Texas sun.  Recommend stopping by when you are on the way to or from  the airport.  It is also worth a special trip for beer lovers."

Beer- I would give this three stars. It's a specifically German style brewery so I don't expect fireworks or anything too crazy, but I thought it was just okay. The most creative thing they do is the added syrups but I would never, ever add syrups in a beer if it was delicious. Just no. Their beer wasn't exactly delicious so I didn't mind, but I had a hard time finishing it. Too sweet.  Service- maybe 2-3 stars. I had an okay experience with the staff, but they did seem very disinterested. Granted it was busy, and the weather was really off, lots of rain that was driving people inside. However, after being to a ton of tap rooms with extremely personable staff, my bar is set higher than theirs I guess.   Overall, I would say 3-4 stars but lean towards three. Not bad, not wonderful."

                "description": "Live Oak Brewing Company was our last stop in Texas. Unique old-world beers and a massive outdoor space make it a great spot for beer-lovers, families, and dogs.  Quality: Live Oak boasts a long history of brewing beers. In operation since 1997, it was the first brewery in Austin. And with its focus on old-world style, serving up beers you don't see on every menu, its no wonder they have had such a good run. During our visit we went through two Flights, getting to try their Hefeweizen, Pilz, Grodziskie, Gose, Kleinesbier, IPA, Helles, and Berliner Weibe. All beers falling on the lighter end. Perfect for summer and a trek on the disc golf course. I enjoyed all the beers I tried, but it was the unique characteristics of Grodziskie, a smoked Polish champagne beer, that truly caught my attention. Do not miss the opportunity to try this incredible beer. Quantity: While more beer usually is not a problem, the larger Flight pours may give pause to folks trying to sample and run. Value: $14 for a Flight of four 8oz pours. Ambiance: Live Oak Brewing Company is located close to the Austin-Bergstrom Airport. It is a unique location, but one that offers massive space to the brewery. They have a good-sized taproom, but it really is the outdoor patio, picnic area, and disc golf course that you want to be on. Unfortunately a hot summer afternoon trapped us inside, but I could imagine the fun outside on a more temperate day. Strange country folk music played, giving true Texas vibes, and the A/C bumped as we sipped on our beers. Crowd: We were the first to arrive on Tuesday afternoon, but slowly the place filled up. The outside is very dog friendly and a few people arrived with frisbees ready to start the disc golf fun. Service: Extremely friendly bartenders who are very proud of the unique beers they brew. Parking: The off the beaten track location has a large private lot."

We found this brewery just a few miles SW of Austin that just had STUNNING food! I had the chicken tortilla soup which was probably the best I've ever had. I also got a pair of chicken quesadillas while my wife got the pork tacos. Everything including the chips N queso was just great.   The vibe was relaxed and easy going, it was quiet enough to enjoy the Motown music mix, our servers were friendly, the prices quite reasonable, and food was delivered within minutes.

The beer that they are brewing is unique and flavorful, along with traditional street tacos and Mexican fare, which can be pretty competitive in Austin.   When we first go there, I asked for a Topo Chico, which they don't have because they have something much better!  If you want something refreshing to clean the palette before you start trying different beers, order the Hop Water! It is amazing!  I really have to commend the staff, because they were friendly, attentive to our needs, and fast.  That is a challenge in today workforce, and there is nothing worse than having great food and crappy service.   While the beer and food was delicious - the one thing that stood out as exceptional was the ice cream flight. That is a must have if you visit Beerburg Brewing. The seasonal speciality was Atole Ice Cream and it was our favorite!"

We had the whole patio to ourselves with just our dog and the sunset! The setting is hard to beat, a nice view of the hills, an area with trees and benches, and a dog park. They have an indoor area, too!  The beer choices were plentiful and varied, and for non beer lovers they have other alcoholic and nonalcoholic options.  We ordered flautas, brisket tacos, and patatas bravas. My favorite of the three were the patatas - great flavor, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Also quite a bit for the price. The flautas were good - the shell was perfectly crunchy. But, the taste was lacking. This was the case with the tacos, too. Also, for the price, I think 3 would be more reasonable vs. 2... Though I was satisfied (not too full) by the end. Definitely order some ice cream! Both flavors we had were great - probably the best of the food tbh!  Overall a great place to hang out with some friends and have a few drinks. Very dog friendly. The food is promising, but will have to try more to be convinced."

The staff is friendly and takes their time explaining what's on the menu and even provides recommendations.  Their food is fresh and delicious ... every item we ordered was so tasty! I LOVE that they have homemade ice cream ... a variety of flavors and some of them that are seasonal. I'm definitely coming back to enjoy their outdoor seating,  try their other tacos and of course... ice cream!!!  Potatos bravas - nice and crisp on the outside, soft on the inside. Delicious seasoning. Great sauce to dip the potatoes in.  Guacamole - oh so fresh! Again, just the right amount of salt and lime in it. Chips were fresh too.  Brisket tacos - well marinated and cooked brisket (on the spicy side), with caramelized and pickled onions on a semi fried taco... yum yum yum  Ice cream - chocolate with strawberry was great although I did wish they had more strawberries in it. Blueberry cheesecake tasted just like it's name!  Beerburg Brewery for the win!!!"

It wasn't crowded which was nice because it was relaxing- although I'm sure that won't last long...  we tried the flight and a variety of beers and enjoyed all of it! The staff was super friendly and the place is spacious and clean.   We got the mushroom asada and the quesadillas and both were amazing. I loved the fried crispy tortillas that both came with. The plates are a little small for the price but I think it is well worth to try the food! We also got pistachio ice cream. I wanted to get a flight but we were already too full. I would definitely come back though to try more as they have some interesting flavors!!"

I don't have to stand in line to get a beer! Yay!!!   Hate me if you want...I've decided to stop tipping at beer gardens where I have to stand in line for more than 3 minutes.   Good beer. We tried a flight of the lighter beers - all decent. Hubby liked the Sour but wasn't happy with the prickly pear milkshake IPA. I think he got exactly what he ordered...  Had chips and salsa. Menu looks pretty good.   Love the dog park and the shaded tables. Did I mention TABLE SERVICE!"

Ricardo Gutierrez, the general manager and chef along with additional staff provided a perfect venue for us to say goodbye to a precious member of our family. They went above and beyond to accommodate our family and provide an atmosphere that our Chase would have loved. We are grateful for your kindness, support and professionalism in supporting our family. Just know that we will continue to frequent Beerburg to enjoy your great beer, food and wonderful facility.

You can sit among the trees and enjoy a cold craft brew while chowing down on their great, and reasonably priced, cuisine.

                "description": "Yes! Another review about the fantastic kitchen and excellent service! But, I first need to mention the amazing music we walked into on a recent, sunny Sunday afternoon.   Michael Samuels was performing on piano, guitar, harmonica and vocals: a true professional. He had two other musicians (bass and guitar) backing him up and the sound was full, refined, joyful, and with a deep groove.  I just felt motivated to give a shout out to some great Austin musicians. Hope to see Michael Samuels back at Beerburg!   Now onto the meal. One order of the Winter Squash Huaraches (the Daily Special) and one order of the Cauliflower Chorizo Tacos. Fabulous! You can really tell this is a scratch kitchen using real family recipes as a foundation. Their corn tortillas are made from fresh masa for each order: the way it ought to be.  My friends were doing the beer drinking and they thought highly of the selections offered. Sorry I can't provide more about the brews, I'm a non-drinker. Regardless, it's guaranteed I'll be back for the food and music!"

So, the beer was delicious and the artisanal ice creams were incredible but when you visit do not forget to try the striped bass ceviche! Holy bajoles it is knock your socks off delicious. I'm looking forward to making the trek out to Beerburg again ASAP."

Because of covid most restaurants I've been too have been sloppy and rushed to get it out the door and not much care places in their food.   The staff were very friendly and took precautions to keep themselves and us safe, which we really appreciated.   I'm not a beer fan so I got a glass if the rosè, it was decent at best. My husband had a cider which was really good.   We will definitely be back with our dog once it cools down some and the full menu is available. It looks like it will be amazing!  Good job y'all!"

Mostly hard seltzer's on tap, but fun flavors. Beer selection was small but covered all the bases. The food they have is small portions but soooo good! Not your traditional pupusa or cortido, but I still enjoyed it. The flour tortillas were really good. Cubano is the perfect beer food though. Such a great brewery and I love that it's in Pflugerville. TVs with sports  and a projector playing a movie we're on the inside."

I really appreciate that they have a menu that caters to everyone, not just beer drinkers. I love their hard seltzer cocktails and they also have mead and a few guest taps from other breweries. The Mojo food truck is amazing - their pork tacos are to die for!  As far as the physical space goes, the patio is gorgeous and they have campfires going at night to keep you cozy. Everything is very well spaced out, too."

The first thing you notice as you walk into the beer garden is the nice outdoor space with a pleasant ambiance. They have picnic style tables in and outside, they keep the indoor space very open (making us feel safer during COVID era). The lights outside provide a nice touch, as well as the music- played at a low enough volume that we don't have to raise our voices to hear one another.   Now as for the drinks: their stout is amazing and smooth and very chocolatey. Their seltzers all have such unique taste combinations and are NOT overly sweet, like some of the big name brands. The strawberry tangerine reminded me of a Haribo gummy bear! The coconut papaya was delicious and I went back and forth between tasting the coconut and the papaya most. They even have cocktail like drinks that are good for those who don't enjoy beer or seltzer. My partner ordered the Hazy IPA and liked it enough to buy a six-pack to take home. George was our bartender. He has such a calm and respectful demeanor. He was really great and made the experience of tasting some of the drinks for the first time so pleasant.   The food truck is so reasonable in price and was delicious! It was so nice to have something other than typical bar food. Austin (chef) brings out the orders so quickly and is super kind! Their guacamole is really interesting and we all devoured it, their salsas are spicy and fresh, and they even have a mushroom taco with a black bean puree for those of us who don't eat meat. Everyone at our table enjoyed the food (other items ordered were pork nachos, Cuban quesadilla, and the pupusa).   Overall we loved our experience, and will definitely be back to visit this hidden treasure."

There are such few places left in Austin... ::::sigh:::: but you have to give credit where credit is due, and let it flourish!!!   A small drink selection but with variety. Friendly staff, and local music some nights.  There are delicious food trucks outside (yuummm jamaican jerk chicken... enough for two!) which top things off."

                "description": "The newest trend in South Austin hangouts seems to be converting former homes on a couple of acres into a neighborhood bar, most often with live music and a great outdoor patio. The Barn fits neatly into that trend. Located just a block from the Lowe's on Brodie Lane in Sunset Valley, this old house comes complete with an array of beautiful oak trees, a shady outdoor patio space, a full bar, and an empty (fenced off) swimming pool.   The full bar is open, and still includes a short list of beers and wines by the glass. Prices are in line with downtown venues. The night we visited, a folk band called Days Before Color was playing inside to an appreciative crowd. The venue's online calendar lists upcoming show dates and artists.  There are two food trucks out front by Brodie Lane, one that is mainly BBQ, and neither of which really offer a substantial vegetarian dish. Weirdly, there's a hair salon trailer out there as well. Because why not?  The Barn is family-friendly, which is a plus, but keep in mind that you will need to watch your youngsters closely to keep them safe and make sure they aren't imbibing alcohol. It's still a bar.  All in all, the Barn is a very welcome addition to the Southwest Austin nightlife scene, where we still like to keep things just a little bit weird."

And The web showed it to be open !!  We arrived and found only 2 food trucks open (side note  Oye Taquitos was amazing!) Some other patrons at the food truck said The BARn was between owners - I'm Visiting a friend new to Austin and we LOVED the name and had some high hopes and good ideas for some merch for them if there wasn't any! (New owners let me know!)"

                "description": "Wait, what? Double-take. Is that a barn? A bar? Food trucks? Hair salon? All of the above?! If you live in the neighborhood, you've probably had this thought more than once. By now you should know, it IS a bar! It does have food trucks! It also has a hair salon!  This is a cool little spot that they have been improving and adding to over time. It has bar games galore - cornhole (also a cornhole league), pool, darts, put put, jenga, etc. It has a small variety of drinks - a few hard alcohols to choose from, some beer, some wine, and usually a few frozen drinks. It's never too packed, which can be a good and bad thing. They do draw a nice crowd on weekends and when they have live music. They have spacious indoor and outdoor seating.   This bar is set up to be awesome, and I know the owner tries to get more people in here. He really is a nice guy! Ask about the history of the place when you're there, there's some interesting stuff! We've always had a good time here. So what is the problem? People are just slow on the uptake and they have their hands tied with advertising. So y'all need to branch out and try a new (well, not so new anymore) spot. Come hang, play, and be merry with your South Austin neighbors. You won't regret it."

Came to check it out and it's fantastic! Had to drop another review to attract more here- they haven't been open long but have an awesome set-up. Tons of space, great layout, super clean and good vibes. Family owned and run- the bartender gave me a few beers to try and clearly knows his stuff, not to mention knows the vendors and breweries, which I always respect. Delicious cold beer, they also have wine and white claw. Highly recommend- my favorite beer garden find in Austin!"

It was a chilly day when we stopped in - but they had the fire pits blazing so we had a perfect afternoon sitting outside drinking, very good NZ white wine in the fall sunshine. It's not our corner of town, but if it was I can imagine being regulars, it's got the sort of vibe that would make you want to pop in if you were at a loose end at the weekend. Just to see..."

From the moment we arrived we felt the unique vibe of a South Austin beer garden with food trailers in the lot and a modest $5 cover to have front row seats and a night of unbelievable musical talent. Beer and wine was modestly priced. Mike greeted us at the door and was a terrific host. Service was a little slow... but somehow it felt perfect to go along with the comfortable surroundings. We plan to visit again soon!"

Just passed my view I saw neon signs and one that said BAR.  This beautiful undiscovered oasis in the desert is called the BARn. It has a great divey feel to it, wide-open spaces, a pool table, televisions,  an outside beer garden and a wonderful variety of canned and bottled beer. It also does not have your typical red or white wine, you actually get a few choices. Its also kid and pet friendly too and it's a really a wonderful place for the whole family. They also have live music from Thursday to Sunday and from what I understand WC Clarke will be playing there soon. Look for Allyson, she is as smart as she is cute. She made me feel so welcome and is appreciative when people come in. I'm looking forward to spending a lot more time and winding down at the BARn.  P.S. The other cool part is you have the food truck park right next-door. It's a win win win situation!"

The best feature of this place is one of the  bartenders.  I believe her name is Jillian.  When she is working you never have to wait for a drink (even when it is slammed) , she also knows her beer and wine and is very good at assisting customers make selections.

You had to enter (with a dog) through a crowded patio with other dogs. I luckily found 2 chairs not being used at a table to pull aside, but oh lord. There were kids EVERYWHERE. I can handle well behaved kids but there were probably 5 kids per every adult there. It was madness. They were running all over and several times the poor guy delivering food to tables was almost tripped up by them. Our dog was super overwhelmed by parents not watching their kids running up to him.  My husband went to get us beer while I waited outside with the dog, and it took him at least 15mins the line was so long. The beer deserves 5 stars but our dog (and us) were so uncomfortable with how crowded and crazy it was, that we left after quickly sharing a flight. I'd come back, but it would only be right when they opened, and not for very long, considering they're this crowded often.  I definitely don't feel like they took distancing or mask-wearing seriously....my husband and I were the only ones outside wearing them when not at our seated area.  Oh, and the sewage smell is so insane. Rotten eggs bad. Hard to enjoy a good beer with that constant smell. Reminded me of Twisted X Brewing."

Aesthetically it is close to perfect, but I have to knock a point off for the food. We ordered the smokehouse nachos and while they were delivered promptly, they were barely warm with cold pieces of brisket. I have to say, I'm amazed they can find anyone to deliver orders to, since you only get a table card for them to locate you, but in our case, we were seated close to the door, so he came straight to us. The beer was okay and I had the cider mimosa. Another thing I was less excited about, but didn't take points off for, was the number of children running around the place. There is a large playscape outside and as a parent whose child was once young, I get wanting to have places that are kid friendly, but that's just not my jam anymore. Again, I don't fault the place for that, but it'd probably make me less likely to return."

Good food.  Interesting beer.  Don't bother with the Mac and cheese as it's very reminiscent of Kraft that you can make at home.  The fried chicken tenders were just ok.  The sausage sampler platter was tasty.  They had other items on the menu that looked good but we didn't have a chance to try them this go-round.  The Barbados Stout was a fine stout.  The Wee Scottish was more unique but wasn't as peaty as I would like, but was still tasty."

This is one of my top two breweries in the Hill Country (the other being RoughHouse in San Marcos)."

The staff is amazing and the inside space is clean and spacious which is great for social distancing. I ordered the Aussie Ale and loved it. I have ordered the specials here and crab cakes and they were amazing. Everything on the food list is great. We have a 4 year old who loved the playscape. If you want a quieter setting away from the kids you can go further back on the property to enjoy your beer. The restrooms were clean and the place is dog friendly. The outdoor area also had shade and tons of seating. I personally am not a beer snob so I can't fully critique the beer but I will say that having a place like this to go to and relax with the pup and kid in tow is amazing. They have also great cider and wine to choose from. Highly recommend all around."

The staff is always really friendly and do a good job of making sure that you're taken care of!  My favorite thing to get here alongside a cold brew is breakfast bagel sandwich. They serve Rosen's Bagels, which is the closest thing you can get to an NYC bagel in Austin (not an exact replacement, but close enough).  It's definitely one of the coffee shops that you need to cross off your Austin list!"

I have ordered 2 versions of their breakfast sandwich S.O.B. And I have to say both are delish in their own way.  Vegan SOB made with beyond breakfast sausage and a house made cashew cheese. It's just stacked with flavor. Then their original SOB you can get a few different meat options I went with sausage - there some kind of aioli, avocado and taters! Such a mess but worth it!   They have craft beers you can take to go- I love that they carry the brand Untitled art. It's a traveling craft brewery that makes incredible flavors!   Dog friendly and just a must stop spot! GO!"

It was easy to find from my hotel and primely located across from target on 5th street. The signage only says \"brew and brew\" so I was confused but soon confirmed that I was at the correct place. I know I desired the bagel with smoked salmon so I ordered it but was not impressed. The bagel was cold, flavorless and the smoked salmon was flavorless. I love a good culinary concoction but this just kissed the mary. It was pretty yet did not taste amazing. Presentation was nice however and service was good."

He was being a dipshit about his mask (like acting like he was wearing it, but then intentionally wearing it wrong so the staff had to say something). He took a call and didn't wear it and that woman said something so he got all in a huff and walked out. It didn't seem like anyone threw him out, to me. I did kind of want to toss him myself but guys like that always have some virus. Don't want to get close.   Anyway I've been home to Texas a few times lately. A friend told me to try this place and I've gone every time I'm home. The food, beer (I don't like coffee) and staff have always been really good. Made me feel welcomed home. They do it right.

There were a good number of people hanging out, but plenty of available seating with large tables and ample outlets available. The noise level was perfect, not so quiet that you'd be uncomfortable having a private conversation, but quiet enough that you can get work done.   Coffee drink offerings were pretty standard in terms of options and prices. They have a really wide variety of beers available, as with most spots in the area most of them are localish. They could expand a little bit on their food options, especially on their non breakfast items since they seem to lean more towards the happy hour crowd.   I went for the cold brew which tasted great- super smooth and didn't need much milk to get a nice creamy taste. Be warned it is super strong, it takes a lot for me to get a caffeine rush from coffee and this really did the trick.   Overall I think it's a great place for a date spot, to get some work done, or hit a casual happy hour. I can definitely see myself coming back here in the future"

Surrounded by many new construction projects is a small coffee and brew joint nestled on the corner - you might pass it if you drive too fast - please don't!  I came in recently for breakfast and I was saddened a little as the menu had changed from my last visit. I'm normally chill about this however my wife was excited about the breakfast offerings I described only to realize they trimmed the menu down a bit.  I went 4 stars solely due to the reduced menu from the past. I just wish they did more breakfast on the weekend.  The coffee is great (FlatTrack) and beer even better I'd say. I find going over to FlatTrack gets me a little more for breakfast vs here although the venue is larger.  This isn't a diss but a request to improve is all. The mainstream is coming and I want my local to stay."

Wright Bros BandB is in a great East Austin location. People are constantly filtering in and out, ordering coffee, cold pressed juices, and beer. I like seeing people drink beer at 11am on a Thursday morning. Makes me wonder what they do for a livin'.   The breakfast bagels are filling, and apparently the breakfast tacos sell out fast. My bagel had way too much dried rosemary on it, but that seems to be a popular bagel trend, so I guess I gotta deal with it or scrape it off (which I did)."

                "description": "Holy moly!! This place truly has some of the best ciders!! I've never really been a cider person until I came here. My friend and I found this place on a whim and decided to try out this cider bar. We both got the Cider Flights and tried out their Fried Pickles and Smoked Chicken Wings.  Cider Flights: The ciders here totally converted me into a cider drinker. The flight comes with your choosing of 4 different flavors. We chose: pineapple, black cherry, texas honey, cranberry, blood orange, original, and rose.   Fried Pickles: Comes with a side of ranch. Nice and crunchy and plenty to share.  Smoked Chicken Wings: I'm still not sure if I like these are not. I'd say they are like a 3/5...or maybe even a 2.5/5. It was a little more charred then I liked. Also the sauce that came on top of the wings (some sort of celery mixture) was just \"okay\". I wish we would have ordered their pizza because the table next to us ordered one and it looked really good.   Anyhoo, the staff here was superb, the drinks were fire, and the music was rockin! Enough to make me want to go back for more."

                "description": "I went to Austin Eastciders after spending the hot day at Barton Springs in the middle of August. It's on the main road leading to Barton Springs, so it was just a quick drive over. There's a parking lot in the back that they validate and there was plenty of spots back there.  There was a lot of outdoor and indoor seating at this spot. I liked the lookof the whole restaurant. It was pretty fun and playful, but also clean and aesthetic. We ended up sitting inside at a normal table though. There was also some bar seating inside and a little cafe area for the mornings.   Service was okay, getting drinks was fast but food was a little slower. We went in the afternoon, so it wasn't too busy because it was between lunch and dinner hours. We ended up just ordering some drinks and appetizers since we weren't too hungry.   Drinks:  I split a cider flight with my girlfriend where you get to choose any 4 flavors they have. It was fun to try a couple of flavors since we aren't big drinkers, but my girlfriend likes ciders. We tried Texas honey cider, blackberry, blood orange and peach.   Appetizers: - Truffle Fries - The fries were really good! We shamefully devoured them pretty quickly.  - Baked Goat Cheese - cider candied figs, chili smoked local honey, candied pecans, served with sliced and toasted Easy Tiger baguette. The goat cheese dip was also a big hit. I felt like it was kind of small though and we were wishing for more. A good combo of sweet, crunchy and savory.   Overall, fun little spot where you can try a couple ciders and eat a snack or a whole meal. Good location near Barton Springs, so it seems like it would be pretty popular in the summer."

                "description": "Stopped by here for the first time today after walking our pup around the Zilker area.  The patio here is dog-friendly so that was a big win in our book!    The patio is really clean, well shaded, and has a lot of fans.  It was the perfect setting for a quick Sunday lunch.  Living in Austin for many years I'm of course familiar with Austin Eastciders but this was my first time dining at their new restaurant.  The service was great and the overall atmosphere was very lowkey.  We came during brunch hours so there were both breakfast and lunch items available.  The menu is pretty standard with your typical American patio food.  Think burgers/sandwiches/salads/pizza.  I ordered the burger which was honestly way better than I expected.  I would certainly return and have another.  My partner ordered the breakfast on a bun which he also enjoyed.  Of course we had a couple of ciders as well.  They have a rotating seasonal frozen drink which we also tried.  Pineapple passion fruit was the flavor of the season!   The staff was attentive and even brought a bowl of ice water for our pup.    A couple of areas for improvement: getting seated was a little awkward.  All their signs say please wait to be seated.  After standing and waiting for about 5 mins we finally went to find a staff member who told us it was open seating.  Also, once we finished our meal it took nearly 20 mins to get the check.  Not a big deal bc we were not in a rush, but could certainly be annoying under different circumstances.    I wouldn't say I'd go out of my way to come here, but if you're in the area it is definitely one of the best options on the Barton Springs Rd strip near Zilker!"

And they have information about the history and process they use. We got a flight and some lunch. We really enjoyed all the ciders in the flight - the watermelon and blood orange were favorites! The food was impressive tbh. It paired well with the ciders and wasn't super greasy like bar food can be. When I saw that the burger had 2 patties, I thought they were smash patties, I didn't expect them to be like a normal burger size! Burger was cooked great and I upgraded to fries which hit the spot. My husband got the quesadilla and highly reccomend adding brisket!! Service was great and attentive. Would definitely suggest stopping by if you're in town!"

Everything is bright and FUN! Plenty of indoor, bar, and outdoor seating. Pet and live music friendly.  As for the food it's delicious. I love the fried pickles and pizza. The staff is always friendly and helpful. Sometimes it's hard picking my cider flavor. Parking is easily accessible in the the parking garage located directly behind the restaurant. You ask your server or bartender to validate your parking, and they give you a ticket to scan with your ticket for complimentary parking. Big PLUS."

Not too sweet as I am but a huge cider person. With that being said, one the best ciders I've had.   The misters on a very hot day are an added plus. Love the 2000 whatever songs they bring me back to my childhood and teen years. Added bonus.   In the front they have cute swings for the bar area. On the menu you can see pizzas - some say to order well done for crispy. I can't comment on this. They are also known for their baked Brie. Very relaxing place near a lot of key places in austin. Give it a try!"

Great vibe, very clean, very fun and fresh!  The frozen watermelon cocktail is delicious but STRONG. Let me warn you, you can't really taste the bourbon in there so be careful! But if you go on Tuesday's they are only $5.  The flight is a great way to sample a bunch of ciders! My personal favorites are the Texas Honey and Blood Orange. The honey is sweet and the orange has a delicious orange subtly to it!   The Soco pizza is a great deal if you are going for happy hour - 50% off! Crunchy crust, great way to soak up the alcohol.  Worth a visit for every local and visitor alike!"

                "description": "This place has such a fun vibe and their food and drink is excellent! It's definitely a trendy new Austin spot and fits right in to the Barton Springs area. I'm not usually a cider drinker but dang, these are delicious!  My Order: - Traditional Cider - Smooth and not at all overpowering tart. - Pineapple Cider - I'm hoping to find cans of these in stores because it was like a tropical escape in a glass! - Baked Goat Cheese - If y'all know me, you know I MUST order the cheese dish and oh.my.gosh it was worth it! Came piping hot and we scraped the bowl! - Hippie Hollow Pizza - This pizza is super delicious and stuck with our goat cheese theme. It has a thin crust and filled with veggies and cheese on top. Definitely would order again! - Charred Broccolini - Usually broccoli doesn't knock my socks off but this was so freaking good! The sauce pairing was seriously delicious. 10/10 would order again!  Pro-Tip: Have them validate your parking because mine would have been $29 but through validation it was free!  Get over to Austin Eastciders! Might be best to try it on a week night when it is not so chaotic but you won't regret it!"

The prices here are very affordable and the atmosphere is laid back. Parking on Barton Springs can be tricky, but they provide a QR code for a few free hours in the garage on your receipt. So thankful for this!  I've tried the drag and lady bird pizzas and both were great! When it comes to the ciders, a lot of the flavored ones are pretty sweet, so I like to just stick to the original.   Overall, I had a great time and will definitely be back!"

                "description": "My first time having hard cider and alcohol in 1.5 years (breaking pandemic sobriety- anyone else?) and Austin Eastciders didn't disappoint! I've been seeing these offered in multiple restaurants and just had to visit their brick and mortar location. We got a flight of 4 and a frozen cucumber melon cider (on their summer menu). I loved the Texas Honey and Peach Seltzer, and would recommend those for anyone! The honey goes down so smooth and pairs perfectly with the slightly bitter cider. The frozen cucumber melon tasted a bit like green juice and the melon cider was a bit underwhelming (could barely taste the melon at all) so I would stay away from those unless you really like your green juice/vegetables.   Outdoor seating was perfect in the summer- they had fans on for the heat and was a great place to kickback and relax with a friend. Parking in the garage is free (up to 4 hours) with a purchase, and you can easily redeem your ticket on your receipt when exiting the garage. The atmosphere was very Austin and laid back/chill, service was friendly, and I will return again for another round!"

I've had the Pineapple and the Spiced Peach (which is currently the top seller), and both are really amazing. Pineapple was in the can last time I came, and the Spiced Peach was draft - I prefer the draft. We came late during brunch, about 20 minutes before it ended (brunch ends at 2PM) and it wasn't too busy. The truffle parm fries are good, but that quesadilla - WHEW! As you can tell in the photos, it's DELICIOUS! They only have one meat in the quesadilla, which is brisket. So worth it though! Plenty of seating, inside and outside. Also, if you park in the garage, make sure to get a receipt so the parking becomes free. But, on Sunday's parking is already free! Not to mention, they play GREAT music, and a mix of music. I literally jammed every song lol. This place is really top tier, and is now my go to spot to come hang out (either solo or with friends) and drink great ciders. Also, very dog friendly. Definitely recommend! Definitely."

                "description": "I love the cider and the gluten free burgers, but the pizza here is such a sad excuse for pizza.   My sister and I recently came by for dinner. This is a busy location, so plan for a bit of a wait depending on when you stop by for food/drinks. I've been both outside and inside before and there is a cool bar setup with swinging chairs on the street-side of the building which are fun to sit in for your meal or while you're waiting for a table.  The cider and seltzer's are absolutely delicious and they even have boozy ice-cream (the chocolate orange is divine!), but stay away from the pizza. I've tried a gluten free pizza (the one with mushrooms) and my sister has tried the regular margherita pizza - both were flavorless with not enough sauce or cheese and just overall disappointing to eat. I've had better from fast-food pizza locations before, if I'm being entirely honest. My sister also had the cookie with ice cream and said it was decent but nothing to write home about.  I do highly recommend the burgers as the gluten free burger I ate was incredibly delicious, in addition to the drinks, and boozy ice cream. All in all, I recommend this place and most of what it offers, but don't try to order a pizza.   The other thing I would like to mention was the lack of service. There was literally no one around for the last half of the meal and we waited for drinks, the check, etc. Service was great for the first half and then servers switched and the second server was practically non-existent. Very frustrating."

I enjoyed the chicken and gravy dish, but the seitan was slightly too salty and chewy. If the seitan was a bit better, easily 5 stars.  Drinks were delicious - definitely try the cocktails."

                "description": "Read a bunch of restaurant reviews on Yelp before deciding on this place. There are so many great eats in Austin and this one is definitely worth writing about.   I went in on a Sunday evening around 8:45pm. There was hardly anyone inside so I decided to eat at the bar. The bartender (Laura Lee!) helped me dwindle down my options. I had read about the tomato and nectarine salad, but was worried that it would have a mustard flavor in it. She assured me that there wasn't and admitted that she, too, wasn't a mustard fan. SO glad I ordered it! It was such a perfect balance of flavors and I finished the entire thing.   Next up - should I get the eggplant parm or the \"crab\" cakes. She thought about it and says \"go with the crab cakes.\" Holy moly!!  These were INCREDIBLE! So flavorful and the sauce that came with it - just perfection! Highly recommend!!  Check this place out if you want something a little away from 6th street. It's just a few minutes away and so, so worth it. :)"

                "description": "Third visit to this upscale plant-based restaurant and were not let down. Recommend making a reservation especially if you want indoor seating. We enjoy the dimmed ambience, but sometimes large parties do make it loud inside. Our favorite starter: the Buffalo cauliflower with blue cheese. Favorite entree: the spicy \"chicken\" sandwich with oyster mushroom (nice that it isn't cauliflower). Not a huge fan of their Mac and cheese or loaded fries. On our most recent trip, we tried The 'burger' which was delicious especially if you like arugula. They serve upscale cocktails, beer, and wine. Pricing is pretty fair: $6-$12 for a drink and $13-$20 for an entree. Huge bonus: parking has never been an issue!!!"

Portions are very generous and we were happily stuffed. The cauliflower and Brussels sprouts appetizers are amazing. We split the kimchi grilled cheese and I crave it now! The cocktails were also great. A lot of people mention its pricy, but we really didn't think so compared to other restaurants in austin and for the portion size. We'll be back soon!"

                "description": "This place is pretty good for all vegan options. The food was flavorful and the service was good. We ordered the Nashville hot chicken sandwich and the hill country chicken and gravy. There was a lot of breading on both \"chicken\" dishes which was a bit much but the flavor was pretty good overall. The mac n cheese was a little bland, but that was the first vegan Mac n cheese I've had. We ordered the loaded fries as an app. Those were my favorite of everything we ordered. This is a pretty loud restaurant, but isn't always a bad thing if you get seated next to the right guests! Overall, I recommend at least trying this place out! There's an extensive drink menu, so it would probably be good for happy hour!"

                "description": "Had my first vegan restaurant experience here for my friend's birthday. We had the loaded fries and sriracha-glazed brussels sprouts for appetizers. The brussels sprouts were SO good. I was very surprised because I usually do not find brussels sprouts particularly appetizing. I had the Hill Country \"chicken\" and gravy. The fake chicken was really good, and it definitely didn't taste like chicken but like something close enough. The potatoes and gravy tasted weird. The Beer Plant curry had a strange taste. They had a lot of beers on tap, and we sampled around 10. The ciders were decent. I did not enjoy the \"when doves cry\" cocktail because it was bitter, but everyone else liked it. The atmosphere inside was really nice."

                "description": "A really fun concept. I love that everything here is vegan so I don't have to worry!   Starting off with the Sriracha Brussels - very tasty. I wish there was more glaze on it though and that it packed more spice. It's pretty mild but the sprouts were still quite tasty. The Carolina was a very interesting sandwich. I was expecting them to use jackfruit in a pulled pork sandwich but they used banana blossom instead. The flavor was there especially with the bbq sauce but the texture was definitely weird.  My favorite from this place is the kimchi grilled cheese! Being no dairy I have not had a grilled cheese in AGES and it was definitely something I really craved. This grilled cheese hit the spot. I love that they added kimchi and pear to give it more depth. The kimchi was pretty overpowering though. But overall the sandwich was so delicious.  Great food, slightly pricey."

Not quite outdoor but it did provide fresh, moving, outside air which made me feel more comfortable eating there. I can see this seating as advantageous during rainy weather  where you could eat \"outside\" and remain dry.   The food: looking at the other plates, I want to go back to taste what I saw. I ordered the chicken plate. Everything on the plate was well seasoned.  What I would suggest is if you like gravy ask for extra. I didn't have enough for both the potatoes and the chicken.  The chicken was super crispy, you definitely need the heavy duty knife that comes with it. It was great!  Would return for a meal to try other options."

                "description": "My best friend whose vegan was raving about this place since I landed in Austin and I knew I had to give this place a shot! We came by a few days before and unfortunately this place was packed so I decided to swing by before heading back to Cali. We ended up going for brunch and luckily I was able to call and snag a last reservation. Not gonna lie I was pumped! Once we got there we were promptly seated and ended up ordering:  *Fried chicken and waffles: I loved the chicken here because it was super crispy and it had like hot chicken seasoning which was BOMB! I literally kept eating it off my friends plate. The waffles in my opinion were too crispy and not sure how to describe but they were really bland. Like I have had waffles before and I understand they are light on flavor but this literally had no flavor whatsoever. Had to eat it with chicken to taste something  *oyster and grits: me and my friend were sooooooooo excited to order this not gonna lie but this was  the most disappointing. This was grits with chili oil and grilled mushrooms with seasoning. The grits was one of the most bland things I have ever tasted and not gonna lie I couldn't eat much. Usually I still scarf food down but this just tasted like nothing. Chili oil made it too oily. My friend tried mixing it up to eat it but still flavor was lackluster. I would not order this again.  *Kolache: this was a pastry like thing with impossible meat inside and again did not LOVE. The meat inside was lukewarm - cold. I liked it overall but needed more stuffing and more warmth since its a pastry!!  Overall, the food was okay. I don't know if I would try again unless I came for dinner. Service was great though and really enjoyed the help!"

I've been obsessed with Nashville hot vegan chicken since going to Nashville and not finding any options there. It tasted like chicken. The perfect combination of crispy, fried perfectly and they shredded the mushrooms to mimic the texture of chicken. I loved that they had options that are soy and gluten free.

                "description": "The Beer Plant was open for dine in eating and they have take out options as well.  The food here is delicious! I got the \"chicken\" platter which came with green beans, mashed potatoes and gravy, and 2 pieces of fried \"chicken\".  My goodness the flavors were amazing! The green beans had good seasoning and were uniformly cooked, each being a bit crispy. The mashed potatoes and gravy were savory and had a really good flavor profile. The fried \"chicken\" was a little dry and the texture was slightly different than what I've had at other places but it all worked together. Whatever seasoning they used in / in the \"chicken\" was phenomenal! Each bite was a burst of flavor in my mouth it was soo good.   The less great aspects of thia place are the food took a really long time to come out from when we ordered. I think it was like 40 minutes, maybe an hour? They also have a system where you put a card on the table to indicate you'd like a waiter to come over and it took 25 minutes for someone to stop by even though there were multiple staff that passed us before that point.   My friend I was eating with also didn't enjoy their gyro as much as I enjoyed the \"chicken\" platter. She said it was cold and ok but not super great but she liked the fries and cheesecake.  I would definitely order from here again but maybe do takeout instead of dine in."

I like places that don't have pretentious attitudes towards food when food is not their primary business. Paninis are perfect for a brewery - low fuss, easy, fast. And tasty!

Enjoyed all the beers but went back for 2nds with the BBA Stout, comes in a 7oz pour due to the higher abv.

I've been here pre-pandemic and during, and I gotta say...I'm so glad they're here to grace the South Austin beer community with their presence. When I visited the first time they had just opened and their taproom was still a work in progress. They still had a good selection of board games, self-serve water and beer/cider in a dog-friendly taproom. Yes, I repeat...bring yo dawgs.  Most recently, I ordered a trio of their 32 oz crowlers. There was a deal going on, and I GOTTA SAY THE SEVEN STILLS OMG. That scotch ale was deliciously dark and creamy without being overboard. I was afraid it would be burning on the throat and too infused with that liquor aftertaste. BUT it was so deliciously decadent. It had a dark chocolate feel with a full and steady mouth feel! Deeeeelish. I hope they brew it again. Their Peak Season IPA was also SO yummy and refreshing. I just checked out their tap list and there are so many creative and interesting beers right now. SO GET ON IT Y'ALL.  Pro Tip: check out their instagram page because there are usually cool deals or posts (like one time they gave free warm pretzels to the first few customers)!"

Great people with great beer and unsuspecting great food.    Peak season is a top tier hazy IPA.  Radberry was a great sour that was sweet without being fruit juice.  I think it'd satisfy both the tart lovers and Kettle sour seekers.  I was saving my appetite for a BBQ heavyweight but after tasting my girlfriend's turkey pesto I totally regret my decision to not get food.  The whole thing was a delight.  The flavors and texture all come together to deliver one heck of a Sammy.   Definitely a destination to stop at!"

                "description": "Came here to hang out with a large group on a Saturday afternoon, they have a sizable space with plenty of tables, space to stand, and games to play while you're there. There was a lively bunch of people throughout our time there, but it never got too crowded.   Their beer selection was fairly limited, but it's understandable given they're quite new to the area. The bartender was super helpful and let my friend and I sample a few of them. Being indecisive I still chose to have a flight after.   My personal favorite beer I tried was the dry hopped wheat, but the hazy IPA and the raspberry milkshake IPA also stood out! Their menu was quite IPA heavy, so hopefully they'll continue to branch out, but it does look like they rotate their menu quite often.   There's also a fantastic Korean food truck out back that I highly recommend checking out while you're here.   Overall, I think the combination of good space to hang out, tasty beer, and delicious food is well worth checking out."

I had a stout, golden ale, and red ale and all were phenomenal. I took a 32 ounce crowler to go and will come back anytime I am in town."

I ordered their American IPA called Pop! Pop! - it was very good. I also decided to try their sour menu and had their Foeder Saison (Family Matters) and enjoyed it more than the IPA even. On this night, one of the bartenders had put on an old playlist they had created years ago and I swear it was perfect song after perfect song after perfect song. You get it. A place like this can easily get by without having to play wonderful, eclectic music for its patrons, but the fact that it usually does just makes it that much better. As always, be sure to tip your [incidentally very cute] bartenders. x"

I've gotten into the habit of stopping in after the gym for a nice relaxing couple of pints while reading a book.  On the Sunday afternoons I've been frequenting this place, the parking is ample and the space is populated but not crowded. I love the diversity of their brews and the frequency with which they change. I've been very happy with the quality and friendliness of service. I think their price-point is spot on for both the brews and the food. I've recently fallen in love with their Caesar salad. It's absolutely delicious and I love the home-made dressing. This will be one of my go-to spots for the foreseeable future and one that I look forward to sharing with my friends. I highly recommend the Bada Bing pizza (meatball) if you love cracker-thin crusts like I do.  They always have a fun variety of beer. I've recently enjoyed their Foeder style beers. They also have a nice selection of hazy IPAs right now that show good variations of the style. Again, I don't have a single favorite as their rotation of brews ensures that I find a new favorite each visit."

Ordered a pizza and first off I love the crust. It's a thin crust that if you probably asked to have it cooked a little longer for some crispy but not too crispy crust and it would be amazing. Also ordered these Tex-mex style meatballs and they had chorizo in them which was different but satisfying. Next time I'm in Austin I'm headed back to oodwood for a Stromboli.  Service was amazing because you order everything from your phone and pay from your phone so I really don't see how someone could mess up that system lol it's not like your server is going to forget to put your order in.  It's dog friendly and I love that.  All in all I had a great first time experience and will most definitely be back."

                "description": "I lived so close to this place for a good minute and somehow didn't know about it. Thanks to a friend celebrating her birthday there, I got to finally hang out here. Brewery, bar, and pizza joint all rolled into one. The drink options are pretty legit. I highly recommend the Yule Boi, Imperial Breakfast Porter. It's a whole mood. Not to mention the meatballs on the appetizer menu. I would say what sold this place to me is the arcade lounge area they set up. I mean, they had Pacman and Tekken on deck!! Can I live here? Anyway, please go, eat, and have fun.  P.s. the pepperoni pizza is *chef kiss*"

                "description": "Ok, I want to give the 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding down for the blatantly misleading name. This feels a lot more like a sports bar with some outdoor space than a \"beer garden.\" When I think \"beer garden,\" I picture something with more ambiance (for example plants, string lights, communal tables, music maybe). Instead, here you have a patio with many TVs blaring the game and a dark, concrete/rock picnic area. Yes they have some string lights... on the outer edges of the parking lot #doinitwrong.  That said, they have a great selection of beers and the bartenders are really friendly and helpful. We also enjoyed the food trucks out back. Soooo, if you're looking for a chill spot to catch a game with some great beer, this will fit the bill! If you're looking for a \"beer garden,\" like for a casual date, not so good."

                "description": "The place has a roadhouse atmosphere, most of the staff looked like they were operating a biker bar which at first made me feel a little intimidated, especially when they ignored me. The gentleman at the bar acted like whatever paperwork he was doing was more important than paying customers.  After getting my beer I walked out to the patio to find a place to sit. I was greeted by what I assume was the owner (but again the biker appearance threw me off). He was polite, welcomed me and my party and let me know that he was there if we needed any help.  The seating was comfortable and fun. There was a food truck where we ordered nachos. They were good.  After returning for my second beer I recognized that the beer was flat. I alerted the staff, they gave me another but it was still bad. I suspect the lines need to be cleaned she apologized said she would take it off my bill, I chose another beer and moved on.  Later when lying she charged me for the bad beer anyway, so confused.  Anyway, overall I was disappointed with their beer selection, and disappointed with the staff attentiveness to customers. Had they taken better care of their beer I could have looked past their other shortcomings, but you have to get the beer right if you advertise yourself as a tap house."

Laid back, chill vibes, CHEAP beer (I don't know if it was happy hour or what, but my local hef (forgot the name, but not Live Oak) was only $4 (feel like I'm usually paying between $6-$8 for local draft hefs everywhere else), and there are TVs everywhere playing all the sporting events televised at the moment.   It's super spacious, there are wooden picnic tables everywhere for seating (covered wrap around patio and outside near the BBQ food truck), and there's also a handful of arcade-y games (not sure if they're operational at this time but they added to the backyard fun aesthetic of the place).  Nice staff, all the safety precautions accounted for, and off the beaten path cool.  Stop by just because or if you're making your way to/from Valentina's ;)"

It's so refreshing to get a cocktail for less than $16 in this city!  The vibe is also so laid back.  We've never had issues finding parking but on occasion have walked or rideshared here to be safe.  We also thoroughly enjoyed the bbq food truck that is here last time we stopped by.  Additionally everyone we've seen on the property has been safe and masked which we really appreciate."

                "description": "This review is mostly for the food. As of June 2020 the food truck on site is HBQ bbq which doesn't seem to have its own Yelp page - which is a serious problem because it needs some serious love! You know the standards for bbq are high in this town, and HBQ holds its own very well for being virtually unknown. My favorite part of a bbq meal isn't actually the meat, it's the sides, so I was excited to see the selection! I ordered a little of everything (well, not everything, but about half the menu... enough that the cook asked if it were for one or two people when he saw a tiny girl come to pick up all of it!) I ordered what I thought would be a chicken salad sandwich, but maybe I ordered wrong or maybe their idea of \"chicken salad\" is different than mine, because what I got was a typical chicken sandwich - sliced chicken, slaw and what seemed to be mild hot sauce on a hearty roll. Despite the initial disappointment, it wasn't too bad for a chicken sandwich. It was huge! A good deal for the price. However, I didn't want to fill up on it, so I was glad when my friend's son expressed interest in the other half of it. More room for the sides! The hatch creamed corn was amazing - other friends raved about it too. It had a bit of a kick after a few bites, but nothing a spice wimp like myself couldn't handle. The mac and cheese was billed as \"sriracha mac and cheese\" but was not spicy. It was average in a good way, slightly on the not-so-cheesy end, that would be a disappointment to have alone as a meal, but definitely enjoyable as a side dish. The cucumber salad was surprisingly good. I didn't expect much. Who gets excited about cucumbers? I ordered it out of curiosity and so I could feel good about eating some token vegetables. It turned out to be a real sleeper hit! It was a bit like eating pickles, toned-down enough that I could eat a whole cup of them without being overpowered by brine. When they loaded the \"loaded potato salad\" they weren't messing around! It had a lot of cheddar cheese and bacon, and some green onion. Apparently they rotate their pie selection, and this time they had peanut butter ice box pie. The cook asked how much whipped cream I wanted on it and I told him not to hold back! It was obviously delicious. Obviously. You're probably wondering about the meats, because this is a bbq truck. I was with a large group, so I got to hear everyone's review of just about everything on the menu, and everyone was impressed. I know they tried brisket, pulled pork, ribs, mac and cheese loaded with meat and queso, and queso as a dip. All servings were a pretty decent size for their price. The queso was the only unusual thing - it was more like movie-theatre nacho cheese that most Texans wouldn't call queso. However, apparently once it was mixed with brisket, it was good, and I saw several servings of it get finished off.  Like I said, I was with a big group, and the venue accommodated is well.  Drinks seemed satisfactory. (I only had water.) I think I heard live music coming from inside. Kids enjoyed the small playground. (And to tell, the truth, at the end of the night, I went and climbed on it too.) Picnic tables, shade coverings, parking bathrooms and all those important amenities were good. I wish this place was closer in to town, but if it were, that might ruin what they've got going. Despite the long drive south, I'll be likely to return! Update: I checked their menu and they have two chicken sandwiches. It looks like I ordered the wrong one. No wonder I was disappointed, but that's good news for the rest of y'all to know that their chicken sandwich is a decent take on a typical chicken sandwich. But I'm still craving a good chicken salad sandwich..."

It was rather cold that day but we opted to sit outside so we can have prime view to the TV screen.  They brought out heaters for the outdoor seating so there was some warmth to be had.  The drinks were a bit on the expensive side but they're showing the fight with no cover so it was worth it.  What I really enjoyed was the food trucks out back.  The food was amazing!  I had the BBQ plate and the cream corn and mac and cheese were so delicious!!!  The BBQ itself was great of course.  The atmosphere was really fun and I definitely would come back to watch the next UFC fight."

There was even a brewery I hadn't heard of. I ended up getting one from Southern Heights I'd never had before, but will be on the lookout for. The tables were clean and distanced. Everyone standing had on masks(CORRECTLY). The Women's bathroom was also clean and easy to access in my walker. (Gold star) We were driving back to College Station-or else I would have stayed longer. I'll be back!!  **it warmed my heart to see the coats and goodies that were there for those who needed them. (I wish I had something to donate.) I love how beer people help take care of their community**"

We didn't actually do the crawfish thing but were attracked here by some online advertising we saw.  We were super impressed with how fun our visit was and the service was prompt and kind. I had one of their blonde beers on tap. I am not a huge beer drinker, but it was cold, light and tasty. My wife had a Shiner on tap. Taylor was a quaint little town to spend an afternoon. One of the owners, Amy, stopped to welcome us which was super nice as it was clear they were busy. Several folks told us the BBQ was good so we plan to return soon. All and in all a very postive down home experience. Well done!"

I had a flight of four different Texas Beer Company beers and they were all okay but to be honest they tasted like beer you can get anywhere these days. I wouldn't say that I'm in a hurry to get back and try more.  Both the bartender and the server gave confusing and unnecessary explanations regarding the food. I didn't inquire where it was cooked, but they both took time to explain something about a \"central kitchen\" that is next door that serves a few nearby establishments? Thanks for the information...I guess. I ordered a pizza but was then asked if I had a back-up choice, so I ordered a different pizza. It was one of the worst pizzas I've ever had, and I am not picky at all about pizza.  Glad I stopped by to check it out, but probably wouldn't go back."

They have a shuffleboard and foosball table inside, a playground and outdoor games like corn hole and hook and ring toss outside, AND live music on Wednesday nights.  We have a big family, a complicated order and the people at Oz. TH make us feel like family. The food is excellent (burgers, tacos, salads, fish and chips, and more). We never have to wait too long. If there is ever an issue they are always quick to make it right.  The adult beverages are on a self-serve system and you pay by the ounce. You can get a flight of beer or wine, but I prefer the Fuzzy Navel Hard Seltzer. Yum! We have loved their commitment to the community and love supporting a local business we believe in. Thank you Oz.

Very crispy on the outside and moist on in the inside.   They have crowlers and growlers for 25% off everyday. I really wish they had a smaller to go container as I would've loved to have taken some of the Berry cocktail home - I can't justify the cost of it to take home a crowler or growler. We would definitely go back if we were in the area again."

                "description": "We really enjoyed this place which was an accidental find on our way back from one of our activities in Austin. It is a self-serve concept, so basically you are given a card to scan anytime you want to order a wine, beer, or a cocktail from one of their many taps. You also place your food order at the counter and they bring it out to you.   The fried avocado tacos were amazing and my significant other really enjoyed whatever tacos he had, which I believe were the Carnitas. Why four stars then? Two reasons. One is I was really confused on how much I should tip. I usually don't struggle with this being a bartender, but since we had to pour our own drinks and order food at the counter , I wasn't comfortable leaving a full 20%. Second, when you are pouring your beer, the price adds up very quick. There was one point my boyfriend poured a pint glass and the beer ended up being $22. That was a bit of a letdown. Otherwise the staff is VERY friendly and welcoming -they run a very tight ship. The bathrooms were exceptionally clean and the layout with a big outdoor patio is a bonus. Highly recommend, just watch the higher ABV beers because they add up fast!"

Tap House for the first time after a Vandegrift H.S. football game, recommended to us by a family member.  \"Go to Oz (pronounced Oz, like wizard of Oz) Tap House, is great.  First things first, we realized later it's not Oz it's Oz.  Notice the period after the z.  Oz. = ounce!  Makes perfect sense when you see the concept.  Dozens of self-serve taps, pouring cocktails, beer, wine, etc.  Way cool!  We couldn't tell how much vodka was actually in the Cosmos we had, but they were tasty!  The Community brand ice tea off the charts too.  Any place serving Community products knows their stuff ... oh yeah, the food.  Definitely \"gotta go back for more\" fare.  Fried cauliflower and jalapeños, nice ranch sauce.  Our server, unprompted, brought some buffalo wing sauce, \"dip a little in here, then the ranch.\"  Awesomeness!  House tacos and cod tacos were delicious, depths of sublime flavors layered into top shelf flour tortillas.  Our only observation was using the house taco slaw on the cod tacos may be a better pairing than the sautéed cabbage... at any rate, the tacos were outstanding.  We'll definitely be back, lots more on the menu to explore.  And a special shout out to James working the register.  Explained the concept, led us through the process, and answered quite a few \"newbie\" questions.  He was great, no need to hire more employees, clone James!"

What I hadn't seen was also you can pour wine or cocktails! This experience is perfect for all of those people crawling out of quarantine and not knowing what to do when they cant pour their own drinks. But now you can! And despite the setup involving many hands, Oz. keeps the place sparkling clean.  I can't speak much to the food menu. It's mostly a meat-forward fare. They have a vegan burger patty, but I was told neither of the buns are vegan. Since the patty was really soft, I am not sure it would work as a lettuce wrap. It seems weird to have a vegan patty when you can't have a full vegan burger, but at least there is a vegetarian option.  My mom liked her fish and chips.   I am really just here for the taps though!"

We tried a few of the beers and had some Tex-Mex.   I tried the sangria beer. I believe it was number 32 on the panel. If you like sangria and bubbles go for it, It's like sangria with bubbles (GF)  Husband had a few other kinds of beers which I tried and oh Man, It was very good! Nothing like I ever had before.   I also had the house tacos (3) with chicken, steak and fried avocado. The fried avocado was definitely a hit for me. It was full of flavor, creamy and crunchy at the same time.   If you are visiting Austin like us and want to drive away from the city you won't regret going to Oz Tap House.   Also, one of the owners is supper friendly we had the pleasure to speak with Sean briefly. Staff is also very nice, patiently explained to us how tap works.   Thanks Oz Tap House for such a memorable welcome!   I recommend this place to everyone!!"

                "description": "I just ordered lunch from Oz tap house. We got fish and chips, fried pickles,  a baked pretzel, a Caesar salad and a cheesesteak.   The pro's: The ranch dressing that came with the fried pickles was pretty good, As was the coleslaw.   The cons:  The fish and chips portion was small and soggy. It was two pieces of greasy fish, that iterally had no flavor. Fish and Chips is one of my favorite foods and I've had it all over the world. Never had I gotten it without flavor. How do you make something taste like nothing? Granted. I asked that the fish and chips have no hot pepper on it. Unfortunately, Hot pepper is the only spice Oz uses.  The fries were cold inside - clearly not hand-cut. The Caesar salad, was spicy in a weird way. It was not good.  The Philly Cheesesteak was very very spicy and greasy.  The Baked Pretzel - Auntie Ann's does a better job, this was a VERY basic, previously frozen pretzel. Nothing special and not worth the price.  The fried pickles - under seasoned and instead of crisp, they were chewy. Again not good.    Everything was extremely spicy, from the fish and chips to the Caesar salad. Food items that traditionally aren't spicy, were all grossly over spiced with hot peppers. Oz Tap House needs to learn how to use spices without making things spicy. Go back to cooking school - Spiced and Spicy! There is a difference! One more thing,  Read dietary notes. There's a reason why people write them."

We were greeted when we walked in,had the process explained etc.  Beers, a couple of ciders,and wines on tap. Pretty cool. I did semi accidentally pour myself 9 oz of wine, so it was a $12 glass, not what I'd typically spend on a glass of wine, but I also typically wouldn't be served 9 oz.  Our food came out quickly and it was really good!  I don't know much it was (folks mentioned auomatic gratuity) bc my husband paid, but it was great and we will definitely come back. They had a playground in the back that we saw,which would be great to come to with our lil people."

What really stuck out to us last night was customer service - from the front order person to the in-house table bussers, and the \"tap Bosses\" or so to speak.  They pay attention to what's going on. They make you feel like you are the most important person that has come in all day... and it was great to see lots of customers supporting this small business.  Plus, of course, there are MANY drink choices to sample and enjoy!!"

Overall everything is a little over priced. Food was sub par. Even happy hour there was only 5 cents off the beer. Expect around $8-9 for a 14 oz beer, and $15+ for mediocre food. And when I went to go tip, they looked at me confused as to why I didn't give them a big tip. Well the answer is simple. I did everything myself while all the workers sat on their phone talking in a booth."

Their burger, covered in camembert or brie, carmelized onions and whole grain mustard is so delicious!! Pair it with crispy Pomme frites and homemade aioli...it's a mic drop moment. The staff is kind and helpful, their craft beer choices and a small but wonderful wine list just rounded out the afternoon. All they have left to do is claim their yelp listing! LOL  But seriously, if you are a foodie, this should definitely be on your list of places to frequent. I'm sure they have many other amazing things to eat there, but their burger is so good that we've never ordered anything else!"

                "description": "First visit, so my assessment change over time. My initial sense is that while the food is good, the service needs some work.   No complaints about the food, which was quite good, such as the Heirloom Tomato Tarte and the Salade Niçoise.  The ratatouille could've used a bit more bread, and I thought the toffee flavor of the mango gelato-bread pudding dessert we got to be overpowering.  Drinks were varied and interesting, with French component takes on standard cocktails (e.g. \"The Vielle Fashioned\") that worked for some (their variation of the French 75) and  less so for others (I believe the Frontera Sidecar).  What definitely fell short was the service. I don't need overly attentive service, but it's not reasonable to be out of water for half an hour, unsuccessfully trying to flag down a waiter time after time.  This is particularly a problem given the small size of their water glasses and the lack of a water bottle for the table. Fixing this relatively small problem would be huge."

If you're outside you have to get your food and drinks by going back inside by the bar to put your order. To our surprise, the cocktails didn't have actual liquor which was strange. The boards they brought out after a good hour after ordering along with the fries were a bit lackluster. The indoor dining was very cute however overall experience and food taste wasn't great to come back to"

Hopfields was #5! #5 guys and not to be snooty but I didn't even look at anything past P Terry's which was around #15! Hehehe P Terry's is good (it's a local chain, made to order) but it's a drive thru and I was looking for more of an \"elevated\" experience tonight! No shade to my P Terry lovers!! So the Paschal Burger is $16 Medium rare, and slathered in ooey gooey camembert cheese and mustard! I enjoyed it! I regularly lean toward a sweet burger with carmelized onion (which were included), BBQ sauce, bacon jam and other ingredients like these. This burger is just savory not too bold and a textural delight! See the video for the \"unboxing\"! I would give it a solid 7/10."

I suppose you pay extra for the upscale vibe of the place.  This is not saying that the food is bad, in fact it is very good. The wine and beer options are the best in the area, now that Vino Vino is closed. The great thing is that you can go there for drinks, without ordering food, and have a great time sitting indoors or outside. The staff are very professional, welcoming, and they use their knowledge about the different wines to make suggestions."

It was pretty empty and easy to get a table, so we sat in the middle room of the place, which was somewhat of a makeshift library/lounge with old foreign decor.  We got olives and almonds to start, with escargot, which came with small lettuce leaves and was in a red sauce (not your typical garlic butter). It was really good, different and interesting to try it in a different preparation. For the main, we split the steak and frites. It was probably the smallest portion of steak I've ever seen and if I had eaten it myself I probably still would have been hungry. But, it was really nicely cooked and seasoned, as well as the fries. So despite the size it was super good.  Don't know if I'd come again, also because they only had some special cocktails and not a full bar, but it was interesting to try the place."

They are made with sherry and fortified wines. I got one with grapefruit and absolutely LOVED it. It was so creative and delicious. That being said, they do not serve hard alcohol. As for the food, we go the Mushroom Leek Tarte, Moules Frites, and Pascal Burger. We loved them all! The tarte was flaky and perfect and the burger delicious. I wasn't super wild about the fries and a with I had subbed them for a side salad, but I guess I will know for next time! The modules frites were great, but also had quite the kick, so don't order unless you like spicy food.  Overall, the atmosphere with the outdoor patio was phenomenal and the food was superb!

I've been waiting to go to Hopfields, and I'm so glad I had my first experience with my good girlfriends. Everything from the food, beer, ambiance to relaxed vibes completely made my experience so wonderful. Hilary was our wonderful server, and she was super chill and relaxed. She definitely guided us towards the best menu items. We started with the pomme frites (fries) because they ran out of the escargot dumplings by the time we got there on a Sunday evening. I'll definitely go back and try those. The fries were heavenly. Like crisp, perfect thickness, and that garlic aioli though!! They had a wide array of beers, and I enjoyed their wheat, IPA and belgian options. There was something for everyone...cocktails, wine--you name it! They also serve tap water too.  I was torn between the ratatouille and veggie burger. The mussel frites were the star of the table. My friend said her pascal burger was alright. It could have been more of a medium rare instead of a medium, but it definitely wasn't the \"best burger\" she'd had. I enjoyed the ratatouille. They give extra bread upon request--there's no way I was going to soak up all of the yummy juices of that flavorful ratatouille dish without BREAD! The food server was very friendly too. We didn't catch his name, but he was very knowledgeable when we asked him what was in the white aioli that came with our fries.   In all, the experience is wonderful for good friends, dates and even family dinners. The place is dimly lit, sooooo those of y'all needing glasses might need to turn on that cell phone light.

Taco Truck pilsner was great, Mama Pisner, and there was a pickle beer that was probably a tad too pickley for me (go figure).  Great/fun selection, good prices, knowledgeable staff, and lots of picnic tables out to keep you spread out and safe. You can get snacks too, or play Starship Troopers pinball (Do You Want To Know More?!?). We had  a good time just chilling there on a Sunday afternoon.  Oh, and they recycle those plastic can holders that craft breweries use. Bring yours back to help out the brewers in town!"

Anytime you stop by, you'll meet either the owner or his wife and they are both nice and very helpful. You can pretty much buy anything they have in singles and they always have their inventory listed online along with the untapped rating for each beer, which I find very useful. They have a solid selection of local stuff and occasionally some more rare stuff as well. If you're immunocompromised, you can call your order in and they'll bring it to your car; they also have a very sanitary setup inside and require masks (of course) and make everyone use the hand sanitizer when you come in. We've been there about 5 times mixing that in with buying direct from breweries but I really love the diversity you can get while supporting local at the Brewtique"

There's a good range of price points here too so you could find a good gift here.

This place is totally chill with a few picnic tables to relax and converse with friends. There is also a couple of other chairs if that's your thing. Sampling on sight is totally cool too.  On to the selection of beers. All I can say is,if you can't find something here that you would like, go home,empty handed and admit you have no taste. That's right, I threw the blame squarely on you! Why? Because they must have better than 300-400 different beers to choose from!  Now go, prove me wrong and try that chocolate oatmeal stout or triple ipa !!"

Just tell them what you're in the mood for, and you'll absolutely receive a satisfying recommendation.  They're dog-friendly both in and outside, and are super welcoming to well-behaved pooches. They also do some really cool charity events on behalf of some great organizations. There's almost always something going on in the evenings -- live music, comedy shows, football games, game night, beer tastings.

Owner(s?) seem to care a bunch, and have been available to point out new releases/limited beers, make recommendations, and take pics of my dog.   Prices slightly higher than other big retailers, but selection is much better (tip: check their Instagram for limited beers and new stock). Also, a good selection of CBD products for those interested. I have never hung around to drink there, but you can for a small per-beer charge if you want.   Hope this place keeps getting tasty limited beverages and doesn't turn into a vape emporium like the last one!"

                "description": "ELECTRIC JELLYFISH - okay, if you need me to say more than that, keep reading.  The newest rendition of Penthouse Brewing is NOT a pizza restaurant (honestly didn't realize that until I looked at the menu). Their newest location focuses on showcasing their brewing. The ambiance is really modern and trendy with TONS of space to feel like you can breathe (especially during these COVID times). The beer is wonderful, as always, and if you need a recommendation, refer to my first two words of this review.  Food order: - Texas Pretzel with cold whipped beer cheese - HUGE pretzel, so delicious! Admittedly, I could've lived without the beer cheese as it did not add enough flavor to really warrant the additional cost. - Whipped Burrata - Burrata is my second favorite cheese (to queso of course) so I HAD to order this. Basically it was a deconstructed caprese salad and I am all about it!  - Pulled Porker - To be honest, you could probably get better pulled pork at the 100+ BBQ restaurants Austin has to offer but it was very tasty and hit the spot!  If you are a newbie to the Pinthouse family or a regular, check out their new location - it will not disappoint!"

The Buffalo chicken dip has potential, flavor is good.. but the chunks of chicken are difficult to eat in the dip. Shredded would be easier but no big deal, just wouldn't order again. The real issue is the vinegar overload in the salad and bbq sauce. I love vinaigrette but this one was too strong for me to finish. Same with the bbq sauce on the pork sandwich. The pork was fine. The bread was fine. The bacon was cold. Just overall super average food.  Hopefully I just had a one-off experience. I'll be back to try again if not only for the beer."

Now I'm no fan of pizza so the food at their other establishment was always kinda meh for me. I saw the menu here and at first was like who wants \"sandwiches and hummus with beer\".. boy was I wrong... I loved the boiled peanuts, the humus plate and the pimento cheese sandwich. All the food I was served at Pinthouse was fresh and tasty and I'll certainly go back for more.   Their IPA's are top notch as they always have been. They have a crowler for to go and do growler refills.   Go here. Have fun."

                "description": "I went to Pinthouse with some friends for a Sunday afternoon lunch and had a great time! We got there in time for brunch, it ends at 3pm, so I decided to get their Rodeo Bagel and a potato cake. Unfortunately, they were out of actual bagels so they gave me a bun instead but it was still quite good. The potato cake, however, was absolutely amazing. It was perfectly crispy and topped with flaky salt, I think I could've eaten five of them alone and been happy. My main complaint about the setup is the fact that a big portion of the tables will get wet. We went during a huge storm and barely got a table because everything was either taken or wet. There was also supposed to be live music but they couldn't play because the stage was wet.   COVID Precautions: Masks are encouraged but not required. All employees were wearing masks though!"

                "description": "We don't live too far from this place and we were looking for a new spot to take our guests from out of town to but it ended up just being us two. We weren't leaving until we tried some beer and food and we like the ambiance of the place. A person comes to greet you once you walk in and pretty much give you the low down of the place and how its runs. Service is friendly, helpful, and done exceptionally. They are doggie friendly too.   You only need to wear a mask when you go into the inner part of the place. It has a lot of space and a lounge area with a swinging seat, so it has that cool laid back type of vibe. You can scan the code on the napkin dispensers for the menus. I ordered the DEADLUS CHARM (Belgian Blonde) and hubby got the OF SOUND MIND (Fruit and Sour). For food, I got the chicken and Brie sandwich and hubby got the chicken sausage sandwich. They were both tasty and the food was delicious and fresh. We recommend, we will return, and make this spot one of our go-to for our hangouts."

                "description": "Had been wanting to check this place out and wow, what a beautiful interior, does not give off \"brewery vibes\" at all.   For a brewery it is very modern with it's decor. Love the seating and the chandeliers and all of that when you first walk in, way to go whoever the interior decorator was!   That being said, let's move on to the real reason you're reading this.....you wanna know about the beer!   Well I decided to try their flight, which came with 5 different beers of your choice.   The most popular beer is the electric jellyfish, which is what I ended up settling on after my flights as well. They had also just released some new beers the day I went, and so I tried the \"dude blueberry\" which surprisingly as someone who isn't a fan of heavier beers, I actually enjoyed it. Don't know if I would've handled a full glass of it, but definitely enjoyed the trial version.   All in all, a great place to gather with friends, super chill and low key with a nice vibe."

                "description": "We decided to try Pint House Brewing after receiving coupons in the mail. One was for a free salad or sandwich and one was for $10 off. We weren't sure where the location was, but following directions, we were able to find it just east of Woodward at Ben White on the southside access road. They really need better signage because the entrance is on the south side of a large warehouse-looking building.  But it is definitely worth finding! We were greeted at the outside patio which is wonderfully shaded and well set up for live music in the evenings. We were shown to a table and told to remember our table number before we went to order at the bar. All the staff were appropriately masked and social distancing seating was enforced.  To take maximum advantage of our coupons (because we will be leaving Austin in two weeks) we ordered separately. I ordered the Italian sandwich with a side salad and an iced tea.  My husband ordered a chicken Caesar salad, an iced tea, and a blackberry cider. The drinks were all self-serve which made keeping our glasses refilled easy.  Our food came out very quickly, as we were some of the first people seated. And it looked amazing when we got it! See photos. My sandwich was huge! The bread was perfect; soft inside and thick and crusty outside. The fillings were amazing with several kinds of meat and cheese and vegetables with a dressing. The flavor was outstanding and I made my husband try it because I knew he would like it too. My side salad was also terrific. The dressing was an olive oil vinaigrette that was just perfect and the homemade croutons made it that much more delicious.  My husband's blackberry cider was so good that he had me try it, and it was delicious! It was slightly sweet and full of flavor. His Caesar salad was huge! It had the same homemade croutons and an incredible garlic Caesar dressing that even I, a non-fish eater, liked.   Try this place! They appear to be owned by the same company as the Pinthouse Pizza locations in Austin, but they are focusing on their brewery, sandwiches and salads, and they are all delicious!"

We had pre-ordered a bunch of food while everyone got their own beverages. The food was great and so was the service. I believe Stephanie was our waitress?   Ordering drinks was a little slow-they only had two people working the taps. We are on summer break so who cares?!? We had time to wait!  It is a great space: open-clean-and inviting. It has very tall ceilings which makes the space seem much bigger.   A few friends said they would come here back in the day when it was Midnight Rodeo. We heard a few fun stories.   I heard multiple people comment that they will come back- even a few that lived on the other side of town. I know I'll be back."

YES. What better reason to finally visit?  Take out is only available online but I couldn't figure out how to apply the promo. I have an infant daughter who's at the age where she is not in the mood to sit down at a restaurant. I called the location and asked if there was any way they'd be able to take my order but still honor the discount. I spoke to Will and he told me to place the order online and then he'd refund me when I got there to pick it up.  I show up and the place was packed! Apparently everyone got the memo. Will greeted me and promptly went to the back to grab our order and handle the refund. He even offered to carry it to my car since my hands were full.  I am SO impressed by this level of customer service. Especially on a busy day! Thank you Will for making this mama's day.  Food wise -- everything was BOMB. They were packed great and still was presented nicely after the drive home.  - Meatball sandwich. I only ate 1/3 of it and was stuffed. It was still warm by the time we got home and tasted delicious.   - Quinoa mozzarella salad was refreshing. It was a little plain (maybe some pine nuts or something to give it a crunch would've helped) but I loved the Italian dressing.  - Pimento sandwich. How can you go wrong? Another big portion!  - And my husband's favorite: sticky toffee pudding. He doesn't see it on menus often so he freaking lit up when he came home and saw it on the table.  Of course, couldn't leave without my electric jellyfish. Tried the Best Coast also. TBH I just loved the design on the can. I'm sure it's good lol  I want to come back for the burrata (they were sold out) and the pretzel.  The ambiance is lively, big open space, and has a very warm/earthy vibe despite its exterior. Parking is ample and there's a back exit so you don't have to go east on the frontage road to get back onto 290 W."

Even though it's considered an outdoor space it's completely enclosed and weather proof in my opinion.  We tried the Buffalo caramel corn and the Party mix which was a sriracha lime Chex mix. The caramel corn has a good flavor with a burn at the end but is very sticky. Our group of four really couldn't finish it. We did enjoy the Chex mix though.  The beer drinkers enjoyed their beers for sure and they will return for that reason. We saw lots of people ordering dinner and everything that went by  looked really impressive.  We felt that it has more of a corporate feel than a local Austin feel to it, so it wouldn't be a favorite spot for hubby and I."

                "description": "Was visiting a friend who brought me here for brunch! Plenty of distanced outdoor seating. Simple but sufficient menu consisting of sweet and savory kolaches, coffee, beer, and more. Ordering was simple, and food and drinks came out quick and fresh. I got the pepperoni kolache, veggie sausage and cheese kolache, and Alishan beer. Both kolaches were fantastic, but I had a slight preference for the veggie one! (It's a vegetarian sausage, not veggies + sausage.) I'd recommend getting 2 kolaches if you're not too hungry and 3 if you are. The beer was light, and I believe it was infused with tea and honey. And they filled it to the brim! Definitely worth the $5. In total, my meal came out to $13-14 before tip. Would definitely come again. Great atmosphere."

                "description": "We were super excited that Batch opened their own food truck and were anxious to try (the bbq place moved). The FT doesn't open until 3, at least on weekends, so we had to wait a little while once getting there. With their new covid- outdoor only ordering for beer it's hard to order anything else but their own brewed beer because the other cans they have are in a window display 6ft away. But, their beer is good, like this new carrot cake beer is pretty unique!  For their sausages, the price/quality is pretty good at around $6.50 each. The only bummer was the bun, it was too thick, dense and the sausage and toppings just sat on top. It was a little difficult to eat, but the flavors were great."

                "description": "Came by here for a snack on a Saturday afternoon, there was a nice crowd here but plenty of seating available inside and out.   I brought a friend who was visiting for their first kolache experience so we split 2 savory and 2 sweet kolaches to get both tastes. Given how delicious every option sounded we asked one of the employees for their recommendations and tried the brisket and jalapeño sausage for savory and the chocolate turtle and blueberry cheesecake for sweet.   I was expecting the brisket to be the star of the savory ones but we were blown away by the jalapeño sausage kolache. It had a fantastic spice that balanced with the creamy cheese and soft bread nicely. The brisket was tasty, but there's plenty of good places in the area to get good brisket so I'd highly recommend the sausage.   The turtle kolache was much more chocolate forward than I expected, if I hadn't known there was caramel on it I wouldn't have noticed the taste. It came out more like a chocolate croissant (not complaining!) but it was very different than the typical turtle dessert.   The blueberry cheesecake was my favorite of the two sweet kolaches. The blueberry jam was super flavorful while not being too sweet, and the cheesecake had a delicious taste but didn't give you that feeling like you survived a major life event that cheesecake desserts can give you.   Overall, I think this is a great spot to come share a few kolaches, especially for someone's first time as you can try a wide variety of them and be confident they'll all come out tasty."

                "description": "Came here a few weekends ago with the bf when we were in town. It's a fairly small brewery, when compared to others that I've been to, though they have a pretty big outdoor space. They have some vegetarian kolaches, so I decided to get their veggie sausage and jalapeno and cheese kolache, along with a mango kolache, and their mango lassi IPA. The bf got another IPA, and he liked his just fine.   I'm not normally a fan of IPAs, but I thought the mango lassi one was terrific. The mango kolache was pretty good, but the veggie sausage one really stole the show for me. I'm getting hungry just thinking about them again. I kind of wished that they had more vegetarian friendly options, but I can't complain as kolaches with mockmeats in them seem to be extraordinarily hard to find as is. We came during the day, so it wasn't too busy, but we did see a fair amount of people doing work here, as well as plenty of other parties just hanging out. Would love to come back here the next time I find myself in Austin again."

The kolaches are all pretty good and they also have beer to go from other pretty good and sometimes unexpected breweries. They do some really good ipas and sours and a lot of outside of the box variants that I really appreciate. I highly recommend checking them out and you should hit oddwood ales less than a block away too (they have pizza if you need a heartier meal). The attached pics are during the quarantine so they are of batch beers out in the wild."

We sat out in the patio area in the back, in which they had the fires lighting.  Ordered the Chicken and Waffles and the Chicken Fried Steak. Food was delicious and portion sizes are huge! I was a hungry boy going in, but definitely needed a doggy bag for this one.  Simply the best Southern Comfort food in Austin. Can't wait to visit again!"

                "description": "Called on Thursday 5:30pm and there was no wait for the patio so the hostess told me to come in. I was there 15 min later and another hostess (didn't get her name but she had a boy cut haircut) told me there's a 30 min wait. When I told her the waitress who answered my call said there was no wait, she then lectured me twice that I should have made reservations. Thought that was rude (before this, I've only ever thought Austinites were super sweet) - my first time here and the waitress on the phone didn't mention I should make a reservation twice. Shouldn't need to be lectured at the host stand and again when seated. Luckily another person came by and said we could be seated right away and luckily, the rest of the experience was fine.   We ordered the chicken fried steak and jalapeño hanger steak. From the photos, I didn't realize how ginormous the chicken fried steak was! It's the size of my forearm and can easily feed 3-4 people. It was my first time eating chicken fried steak and it wasn't bad. I'm not a friend food type girl but it was decent. I could only do a few bites as it was heavy. The jalapeño hanger steak was right up my alley. You have to eat it with the jalapeño; it's the perfect combo. I only wish they gave 2 jalapeños. The mashed potatoes also went perfectly! The popcorn, cornbread and drinks were also good. The Old Fashioned was smooth and the pink drink wasn't too sweet.  The waiter was much more pleasant than that hostess and the ambiance outside was lovely. I love that it's dog friendly and my dog was allowed to sit in my lap at the table (some places only allow dogs on the floor but my dog is a lap dog). They also brought a dog bowl. Overall really like it here and would come back and recommend!"

It was walking distance from our hotel on Third Street.  We got seated at the patio outside for a party of 5, and they adjusted the shade for us since the sun was in our face.   The service was okay, the food was pretty good. The size of that chicken friend steak was definitely Texas size! The cocktails were delicious. We even got a flight of moonshines, but that was a bit hard to drink. It was way to sweet for me personally.   Overall: Cleanliness: 8/10 Food: 8/10 Service: 7/10"

If you're looking for something on the lighter side, go for the Migas. Both the Beyond Veggie Burger and Backyard Chicken Sandwich hit the spot as well. They even accommodated my friend's request to switch the bread to a biscuit. The sauce that comes with the Sweet Potato Tater Tots is phenomenal.   They have great heated outdoor seating (tent style), wonderful servers, and generally a great atmosphere!"

The pimento was very flavorful and the pretzel sticks were baked to PERFECTION.  For my entree I had one of their fried chicken sandwiches. The chicken patty was very thin compared to most fried chicken sandwiches I've had, but the flavor was still there in every bite. The accompanying fries were yummy as well!  NOTE: on Mondays they have 50% off wine bottles. Just in case that's useful for you ;)"

                "description": "This restaurant just kind of pulls you in from the street. Being one of the oldest buildings in Austin, this place is obviously well known, and we were lucky to get in.   The atmosphere inside the restaurant just emanates southern charm and the menu offers some excellent southern comfort food entrees. Any time I find an appetizer not normally seen on a menu, I have to try it, and in this case, it was the deviled eggs.   I typically don't have the courage to try anyone else's deviled eggs because I am very picky when it comes to those, so I swore they better be good and they were very good. They were creamy, flavorful and had no pesky surprises like celery or relish.  One thing I never thought I would eat for dinner is chicken and waffles and being in Austin I decided I had to try. I was impressed with the seasoning of the chicken and the light breading. The waffles were fluffy, they came with plenty of butter and syrup. This entree was the epitome of sweet and salty, and a little bit spicy.  The staff are great, the drinks are great, and the atmosphere is alive. Cheers!"

The beer and bourbon selection is wide and very good.   We had the Pearl Snap Pilsner and the Convoxt Hill Stout.   The devil eggs were beautiful but the egg white had tight flesh. Was either over cooked or too long in the fridge. But we did arrive for dinner after 9pm.   The cobbler dessert looks great. But did not order it. Just admired from afar.   Excellent decor and ambiance in one of the oldest buildings in Austin."

Had we gotten there later, I think we'd have had to wait quite a while. Its flooded with customers on the weekend! Curious what it would be like during the week? ‍  Service was wonderful! Our waiter was fun, knowledgeable and attentive! I think that was the case across the staff. They take the service seriously!   The food is decadent! It's heaping portions with a southern flare. I got the green chili hash that was pretty good. My favorite part of the meal was the biscuits we ordered as an appetizer. Delicious!   This is a great spot! My friends and I enjoyed it!

By the reaction I got from our waitress when I asked, I'm not the only one who misses their legendary Sunday buffet, but apparently it will be back when things settles down, contagion-wise.  I cried a little when my Irish Coffee arrived with no whipped cream on top, but it had Jameson and Bailey's, so it would be churlish of me to complain. And the complimentary popcorn made up for a lot.  My companion was not crazy about her entree, Creole Crawfish and Grits. She was hoping for something along the lines of Shrimp and Grits, but instead got some grits swamped by a sort of stew that had more ham than crawfish. She's one of these incredibly polite people who won't send a dish back to the kitchen for anything less than serious culinary malpractice, so she just picked at it and left most of it.  I was delighted with my choice. The Chicken and Waffles were about the best I've had. The waffles were amazing, as was the chicken, and there was way more than I could eat--and believe me, I can eat!  The dessert my friend ordered made up for any disappointment in her entree. The Peanut Butter Mousse Pie was world-historic, as far as I could tell from the bites I was allowed. And it was huge--most of it went home with her.  The service was excellent, the prices fair, and we even found street parking."

                "description": "Got here at 1750 on a Thursday night.  Happy hour ends at 1800.  This place is already packed.  And there are multiple layers and areas to it.  30-45 minute expected wait for a table for 2.  That was about spot on.   Once we were sat, Charlie, the waiter showed up with our waters and a great attitude!   He offered suggestions with details.  I do believe we had to have ordered the two best meals they serve.  The horseradish crusted salmon and hanger steak.   You can't go wrong.     They have a great selection of high end bourbons.  Highly recommend trying the moonshine flight, too."

                "description": "Moonshine was a great experience all around. We were able to sit quickly. The atmosphere was nice and was a great place to take friends from out of town.   They had a good selection of appetizers and food, all of which sounded delicious. We ended up getting the pretzel, fried green tomatoes and roasted garlic as appetizers. The fried green tomatoes were delicious and I would recommend to anyone!  I ended up getting the club sandwich and it had so much flavor, the bacon jam on it really took it to another level. Portions were good size and each item our table ordered tasted great."

                "description": "10-28-21  Quality/Quantity - Great Happy hour. We ate so much we had to take leftovers to-go. Free popcorn - excess butter and salt, just the way I like it. It also opens up the liquid appetite (beer!!!). Lone Star Beer - refreshing, especially on a hot day Brussel Sprouts - not as crispy as I would have preferred, but the family liked it Fried Green Tomato - not bad, but once you had Lucille's Fried Green Tomato, others are hard to compare. Cathead Biscuits = 6 stars!! This was a hit. Very generous portions, hence we had to take our entrees to-go. The flavor, especially with the butter and honey, took it over the top. Seared Rainbow Trout - Good, but we were so full that we could not enjoy it, no fault of theirs. They also have a Sunday Brunch.  Atmosphere - Both indoor and outdoor dining. There seemed to have more outdoor dining than indoor...? It looked like they had a private event in the back. Men's urinal was broken, and amazingly there was NOT a line for the one toilet for the Men's restroom. Valet parking is offered for $12 by Austin Valet Parking LLC.  Be careful of where you park in this area, sadly there was lots of car vandalism.  Service - All team members were working hard and offered good service. Hannah took care of us, but the \"busboy\" took service to the next level. He even talked to us while we were waiting in the lobby before being assigned to our table and gave selling suggestions.  Price - If we did not order our entree, then this happy hour dinner would have qualified under one of our \"best inexpensive meals\".  Owner Suggestion - Please keep your restrooms in top condition. Or, post signs if you have restrooms in other locations in the restaurant. Other than that, great job, especially with your happy hour menu."

                "description": "Moonshine is a great place for brunch, or any meal, as the menu is solid and the service is on point.  Looking for a quick bite to eat before heading out of town (to return home) we arrived at Moonshine early and did not have any lines to deal with. In fact, we were seated immediately and began to peruse the menu.  It was early, so we passed on drinks (though their whiskey list was well populated and the \"little brown book\", available upon request, certainly peaks a whiskey hound's interest). Ultimately we decided on a couple sandwiches and placed our order with our friendly waiter.  He returned with our drinks and a basket of DELICIOUS spicy popcorn! What an appetizer! I polished off the entire basket without hesitation and it was everything I could have hoped for and more.  Our meals arrived shortly thereafter and we dug in. Everything was very well prepared and tasty. Personally, I had the Sunday House Club and loved it. One point of recommendation though: go without the bacon jam as I found it to only serve to diminish the flavor of the pimento cheese and make the sandwich more messy overall.  As previously mentioned, the service was great. Our waiter and the bus boys were there exactly when we needed them and we were in and out in no time flat. What a great cherry on top of the experience.  Moonshine can get rather busy as the day progresses so I suggest you arrive early and enjoy the food, service, and ambiance. While we didn't check out the patio it looked and sounded very inviting. This place really serves the entire package and you won't be disappointed in your visit."

                "description": "I would put this place closer to a 3.5, but I can't quite give it 4 stars. They don't take reservations and we were a larger party. By the time we arrived, the wait was 45-60 minutes. We anticipated that and a table opened up in the bar area, so we order a few appetizers and drinks. The bartender got very flustered with us and at one point just walked away mid-order. Being a large group primarily from the northeast, maybe our personalities didn't jive. We did recover, but it was off putting since that was our first interaction with the restaurant.   The biscuits were a hit with the group. The pretzel was ok. We were seated a little over 90 minutes later. By that point I wasn't super hungry, but I ordered the harvest bowl with chicken. Overall, I found it dry. We did sit outside which was really nice as the night was perfect for outdoor dining. Our server was really good and was on top of everything."

Food in terms of the \"loaded\" fries leaves a lot to be desired (they're not really \"that\" loaded, so the price for the product is absurd); the pickles tasted good but the fry was quite irregular; the spinach artichoke dip is delicious but the chips cannot lift the dip without you helping them along, either by doubling up or scooping with a utensil.  Beer is alright.  One of the lagers is so-so but the raspberry sour is pretty good."

                "description": "Super excited to have another brewery in the South Congress area to go enjoy some tasty as heck beers and get in your order for some Southside Flying Pizza or other tasty snacks and items on their menu!  This location will forever be in my heart as the first time I ever stepped foot here was when we were in desperate need for some warm food, cold beer, and water.  Beers:  I have been enjoying the melon + grapefruit notes in their Simcoe Pale Ale as well as their summer seasonal ale Vaquero Ranchers lager that is just easy and smooth to drink down on a summer day.  Unsure what to get - check out their crowlers to-go and canned beers! I grabbed a sixer to take home with me the last time we were here just so I can try the variety of other options they have here.  OH! Also I noticed they have a frozen drink machine too!  check it out for me, eh?!  Food:  We came here on a weekend and there was a crawfish broil happening to our surprise!  Easy to order online, at your table, and/or at the counter. I really love the option to order directly from your table and be able to pay without having to get up and go to the counter especially if you are nailing that ping pong game against your friends!  We really enjoy ordering and eating pizza here as Southside Flying Pizza nails it every time and there is enough to enjoy with everyone.   Outside / Inside:  all COVID safety measures are practiced here and taken seriously both inside and outside.  There is PLENTY of seating outside and ample amount of space to move around without it feeling crowded at all.  Snovid: When we experienced about 5 days without water we noticed that Last Stand Brewing were offering water fill ups. We grabbed our containers and made the quick drive down South Congress to get our fill.  I am SUPER appreciative of the kindness, ease, and availability to be able to get some water for our needs during the snowpocalypse that all of Texas experienced.  I will forever be in debt to Last Stand as the showed their genuine willingness to help their community out in a time of extreme need.  THANK YOU, Last Stand! You are truly a life saver.  I appreciate your kindness and help always!"

We were stopped when walking in the door by a rude ass employee (dark curly hair with glasses) literally yelling at us about a mask from across the room full of people. We are fully aware some spots still require masks and as we tried to ask if we can sit outdoors she rudely interrupted us and continued to tell us she won't serve us unless we have a mask. Shit lady haven't you ever heard of customer service or even normal communication. She could have approached us and explained their policy it was not necessary to demean us for making a mistake.      We walked outside my sister was livid and embarrassed. I talked her into staying and me walking in with my mask since she has forgot hers and her sitting outside on the bench area. I saw the employee again and asked if we could sit outside at a table which was our original plan (if she listened and didn't scold us like children) she said I can order since I have a mask but my sister can't leave the table with a complete attitude. I ordered got the beers, drank them and we left.      The beers are good but not worth the rude inappropriate staff. There are plenty of local breweries with good vibes and good beer! Don't waste your time."

                "description": "My friends and I enjoy the atmosphere, but we frequently don't get good service here. The bartenders don't seem to be on the same page as far as pour amounts go, either. Depending on the bartender, you may get a tap beer in a small plastic cup or a pint glass. I asked a female bartender why that was, and she said they do either \"double\" or \"single\" pours. I went back the following week and asked for a double pour of the same beer from the week before - this time with a different male bartender - and he said they only do beers in pint glasses. I guess there is a lack of communication on that front but it's resulting in customers asking for double pours and being charged more for what should be the normal amount of beer and frankly that doesn't sit right with me.  The value of the food from Southside Flying Pizza is also overpriced. The quality of the food is not equal to what they're charging, and they're frequently out of menu items and condiments by the evening. I've never been for lunch but their \"special\" is a slice of pizza for $4, which hardly seems like a special to me considering the quality of the pizza.  They make tasty beer, though!"

                "description": "Just get the Thirsty Goat. It is a crowd favorite. We stopped in on a recent Pub Crawl and the place was hopping. Since they don't sell food, your pup is welcome and we had fun lovin' on some sweet dawgs! Uh, the four legged ones.  They are great at working the crowd and selling their beer glasses. Katherine was there at the door on the one day (Saturday) that we stopped by to explain how it works. Lots of t-shirts and ball caps to pick through and new fun people to meet. Everyone's happy with a beer.  I also love that Thirsty Planet supports Divine Canines, a therapy dog group that sponsors training for dogs to service hospital patients. Just wish they were open for more than 4 hours a week. Rumor has it this outstanding brewery will soon move to a new much larger space on South Congress."

                "description": "Came in on a gorgeous spring Saturday afternoon and enjoyed my free...yes free...beer tasting here. Now, the \"free\" tasting is 3 tastes of anything they have on the board in the little taster glasses. There is an option to purchase full pours which includes a glass.  I have always been a fan of Thirsty Planet's beer offerings as I have had them at several brewpubs around Austin. Their Buckethead and Double Buckethead are my handsdown favorites! When I was out and about and headed to some other breweries, I stopped in here and was happy I did.  The staff was very nice and there is ample communal seating inside and out. They also offer tours, but I did not take one as I was a bit tight on time.   For a glorious afternoon in a chill atmosphere with great beer offerings and a little roadtrip out of Austin, this is a great place to spend it!"

It's cheap to get a few pours and most everything there is close to some ambrosia of sorts. I've definitely had the goat everywhere so I was glad to try the only-found in-house bevs.   I do not like IPAs so what did I try first, the double bucket head IPA of course. Awesome taste. Not so bitter but leaves you feeling good. Pretty strong so it was a great way to start the morning. I can't recall the other beers I tried but I do remember leaving happy."

I don't have any of the ABV info but it had a nice lemon taste to it. Very refreshing for the hot weather.  Thirsty Goat - American-style Amber Ale, 6.5% ABV. Had a nice spicy finish with the beer.  Yellow Armadillo - Light American-style Wheat, 4.0% ABV. Very refreshing. Had some citrus flavors in there.   There is a nice outside area with picnic tables and plenty of seating inside and out.   The guys there were so nice. Very engaging and informative when it comes to the beer info.   When I make it back to Austin, I'll definitely be stopping by again."

The outdoor \"patio\" area is lacking but the indoor tasting area makes up for it. From what I understanding they are opening another place soon.  Take advantage of the \"Barks for Beer\" sale. $20 for a special pint glass that's good for a free pint in several restaurants and other breweries."

We stopped by this place and had a swell time. The owner/brewmaster was super nice and friendly, in fact, everyone who worked there was awesome. If you don't want to drink three beers, you get a tasting glass and three free tasters. But then you don't get an awesome pint glass...   Only gripe? No AC (in August, yuck) and it is SUPER LOUD inside. And it seemed that the more people drink, the louder they got and it was just incredibly noisy.   If you like Thirsty Planet beers, or beer in general, definitely worth checking out."

                "description": "Checked out their brewery tasting and tour this past Saturday.  Warning: there are times it will be quite crowded like when bus loads of people stop by.  However, even despite the crowds, the bartenders did a great job of serving everyone.  $10 gets you a souvenir pint glass and three full pints (plus you can taste a few oz of the other beers they have for no additional charge, so really you can taste 7-8 taps for $10).  Their yellow armadillo and thirsty goat are both solid crowd and palate pleasers.  I liked their merch as well, bought a ladies tee for $18.  The tour was about 25 minutes long, but it was the hottest part of July and it was not a/c, so I think they mercifully made it quick for us.  We brought kiddos and the outside area was kid friendly, although not completely fenced in by the side of the road, which was a bit nerve wracking.  I wish I had brought some more small bills as tips collected in the tasting room go to a local charity, which rotates monthly or seasonally.  A fun way to spend a Saturday, would be even better in the cooler months of the year."

                "description": "More like 4.5. We had a great post-Zoo visit here on a sweaty Saturday afternoon. $10 for a sweet glass and three pints always works for me. They'll also give you a small tasting glass for free, but why bother with that?   I've been a fan of Thirsty Goat amber for awhile, and this visit turned me on to the Hoppy Blonde and Buckethead IPA. I'll be looking for all of them at local bars.  The \"tour\" is one room, but hey they're a small business, which is cool. Very informative, maybe more than the average beer fan will want, but beer nerds will love it and it's not hard to step out and back to the bar if you get bored.   One downside, it was super stuffy in the tasting room. Not sure if their AC was acting up or just couldn't handle the crowd and the July heat. However, that didn't stop my group for staying and drinking until closing time. I'd recommend Thirsty Planet to any beer lover visiting or living in Austin."

We signed up for the tour online (which is free) but there was no list and it seemed like they weren't going to do the tour at all. You might have to remind them. Once we mentioned our interest, they announced it and a bunch of people joined in. I'm not sure reservations are really needed at all for this. The tour was fine, nothing to write home about. If you've done a tour before you've probably seen everything they have.  I liked a lot of the beer we had, especially the thirsty goat ale. They were out of the wheat but had a rhubarb beer which was interesting.  Staff were friendly and when not totally overwhelmed with people, happy to engage in conversation about the beers.   It did get quite crowded and I understand why. The outdoor patio is lovely when the weather is nice and they have tons of games. For me it was a bit too crowded and noisy, but that's the small price you pay for free - $10 beer. (You can either get 3 tickets for a small glass for free or 3 pint tickets + a keepsake glass for $10.)"

They were professional, yet easy to work with, responsive and surprisingly affordable. Jason did a great job behind the bar causally handling the beer orders while educating those who wanted about their beers.  PRO TIP: They use Sonos wireless music system, but do not have an external headphones jack. Download Sonos on your phone and the then manage/update your playlists and you can listin to an iTunes playlist by going to \"This iPhone\" (I assume the same for Android phones) and then Playlists. If you do not want an iTunes playlist, you can create a playlist in Sonos app ahead of time or play Pandora, Spotify, XM/Sirius, etc)."

I first tried their Buckethead IPA at Second Restaurant and enjoyed it enough to look for Thirsty Planet's website, where I discovered they offer tours most Saturdays.  No information about the tours is provided on the website, but here's the deal: sign up online, when you go there's an optional tour, plus four 4 oz. samples for free, or you can purchase the \"souvenir glass\" for $7 and use it to get up to 4 pints free...a nice deal (although, I don't know about you, but I couldn't consume 4 full pints in 2 hours).  They have a nice large indoor tasting room with communal bench tables and an outdoor patio as well (but it offers no shade).  On to the beer:  * Buckethead IPA - one of my new favorite local IPAs; it is well balanced with the bitter and hint of sweet, with a pleasing Amber color and a mildly citrusy nose.  * Thirsty Goat Amber - a lighter amber, malty but with a slight hoppy finish.  * Double Buckethead IPA - an even stronger bitter taste than the Buckethead...save this one for last. * Yellow Armadillo Habanero - I could definitely taste the habanero flavor, but the spiciness was tempered by a pilsner-like base.  It's surprising how easily this beer can be consumed."

The place had a nice welcoming feeling to it, and stepping up to the bar got me a friendly greeting. I was not familiar with their brews, but saw one called \"Twist and Stout\", and being a fan of the dark stuff, went right for it. Oh my... *smiles coyly\" This stuff was liquid sex.... and I knew it was going to get me in trouble.  So next up, I explained my fondness of the dark, but felt the need to expand outward, what would they suggest. The man behind the counter said without hesitation - \"Thirsty Goat Amber\"!  Boyo was he right! After two pints of that, I had an expression similar to the one on the label, so I took some time in my truck to eat a sandwich before driving away.  Yup, I'm going back!"

The brewery does not have an actual taproom open regularly, but instead is open only Saturdays from 12-4 pm in their parking lot. I went during their anniversary event and it was $25 for a glass that you keep and 6 8 oz pours of your choice (you can do 12 4 oz pours instead). Majority of the pours turned out to be larger than 8 oz so you can really get trashed here. They had 44 beers on tap. Pretty insane. Unfortunately, none of the beers were that great. They had like 4 food trucks and a lot of porta potties (lines can get long).   Overall, this was a quantity over quality brewery. We had 4 people in our group and none of us were impressed, although, we are from California and are spoiled by all of the good breweries out here. If you just want to get the job done and get trashed on a Saturday afternoon, this is your spot. If your a real beer lover, you may be disappointed"

Maybe it's an exclusivity thing...it sure works. If you are visiting Austin and have a free Saturday early afternoon, be sure to hit up 512 for your beer desires. You can take your tasting cup home as a souvenir. They have outdoor seating, merch for purch, and are kid and dog-friendly. Double wow! My boyfriend and I made it to 512 at the tail end of their Saturday hours, but we were able to share a tasting for one. That was perfect because it was the safest way to drink, play some ladderball (it was my first time playing that!), and drive to dinner afterwards.  They have clean restrooms and an easy way to purchase your guitar picks as proof of beer-drinking capability. When you park (plenty of parking btw), walk first to the door on the tasting room's left. You can purchase your tasting power, then head over to the main room for the adventure. When we went, there was basically one taptender pouring while a barback was helping him out with the glasses and stuff. It seemed like a lot of regulars were there, mostly 30+ in age, but all having a great time socializing. There wasn't a food truck there, nor any food on site, so bring your own or head out to eat afterwards."

You get to taste 6 full glass beers or 12 half glass beers and can pick if you want them to pour half a glass or full glass. The beer list was extensive! There were probably 2 beers we really liked and tons of unique ones that were puzzling to us. They also served some complimentary cheeses. There's also a few food trucks for hungry people. The only thing bad about the event was that restrooms were porta-potties. Many people brought their dogs to the event too. Cool to people and dog watch."

I'm glad we made a point to visit and will likely bring friends here when visiting in the future.  This place is dog and child friendly with a handful of picnic tables outside and an optional, small 'tour' if you're into that."

Had an IPA. Very tasty. I like. Me, happy camper. 512 Brewing Company taproom mostly outside. Ugh... You buy your beer and hang outside in beer garden. Very unique way to order beer. Buy tokens (12 for $24) at one location. Then walk to beer taps. Ugh... They give you two 8oz glasses. Yeah... Never a fresh clean glass to try delicious beer. This is a comfort I like in a taproom I feel it makes a big difference in flavor and service. My two cents. I have only had their IPA. I am an IPA guy. I like the classic flavors and full body beer. 512 Brewing Company IPA does a good job for me. I would like the tasting experience as an option. I really enjoy a 4oz sample to try all the beers. Not a fan of using my beer token on a maybe. Oh well. 512 Brewing Company I will be back just not that often..."

After relocating and driving myself to work like a pleb for the last 2 years the thing I missed most was the beer.  The few times a month I'd venture into Specs I'd always ask the beer guy about this(and Hitachino) and was always met with the tired response citing the owners devotion to sustainability.  I grew to loathe the environment.  Every time I'd toss something in the blue bin at work I'd scowl.  It just wasn't worth it.  I wanted this beer in something other than a keg.  Low and behold on my last trip in I see a stack of 4-packs of Pecan Porter.  The most perfect stack since the pyramids.  Beer guy saw me and came over to share in my unbridled joy.  I cursed the owner one last time for making me wait so long.  And grabbed two."

                "description": "512 had the honors of providing me with my first brewery tour. It was great, but definitely a little different than I expected. I attended the first weekend where they changed their \"style\" of the tour. They have not updated their website to list the correct details. Admission is $12 per person. This gets you the tour (optional), a small 512 glass souvenir for tasting, and 6 tickets for beer tasting.   The tour is said to start Saturday's around noon. However once you arrive, they will let you know how long they are going to wait based on the amount of people waiting. (they like to fill up)  That being said, we had about an hour wait outside on the patio-ish area (no cover, bring a hat and shades) to enjoy some brews! The weather was great and they have giant Jenga and corn hole for you to enjoy. Dogs are also welcome outside. If you plan to skip out on the tour and just enjoy the beer, bring lawn chairs as the tables get crowded after a while.   IF you decide to attend their tour, keep in mind that it may not be exactly what you expect. The brewery is small and there are only about 3 sections to view in cramped spaces. Get up close to the tour guide so that you can hear because they do not use a microphone. They have some work do to on the tour, but overall I enjoyed it.  Stop by 512! Besides, you can't beat $12 for 6 beers!"

For $12 you get an 8oz 512 glass to keep and 6 guitar pics to trade for different brews. There beers were all great, we even got to try some limited edition that's not being distributed yet. The \"bartender\" was really cool, knowledgeable about the beers, and overall pleasant to talk to. The only thing missing would be some type of food truck or snack.   Definitely give this place a try if you are a beer lover!"

However, 512 takes the cake on my brewery tour of Austin this time around. We showed up around noon, definitely past their \"tour\" time and it wasn't even available on their eventbrite / website anymore. Regardless, the brewer (New-ish Guy, woo!) let us in the tour and filled our two glasses with delicious Pecan Porter that was on nitro at the time.  I definitely loved their IPAs (IPA and Seven), their Wit was also not bad at all. The only thing I was a little eh about was their Pils and that's ok with me. They were incredibly knowledgable, the tour was fun, and they're doing some really cool barrel aged stuff that you don't see at a lot of breweries. They're also very dedicated to self distribution, despite how difficult that seems, so I'm definitely looking forward to other 512 beers I can get my hands on in the future."

I would highly recommend this place for casual dates, group meetups, and all your brewery outing needs! We both had a pint of beer to start with, then ended up with a set of tasters each to try more of their other beers. I was so pleased to see on their menu tonnnnns of hazy IPA's, but also that they had a larger number of beers on tap to choose from! That's always a mini gold mine when there are over 10 beers on tap. There were two beertenders on shift when we went, and we had to wait a bit for us to get our orders in, but the place is so chill and so spacious that we didn't mind waiting. We saw a lot of other couples, small groups, and even people with their dogs inside!! So dog-friendly brewery, check!   They also had cornhole indoors as well as pool! I love that this brewery caters to making itself a great source of beer, but also a great place to hang out. That is sometimes forgotten, but this warehouse style brewery does it all. Everything is super low-key, and they even had a food truck outside too.  Their restrooms are clean, wifi strong, and their brewery holds plenty of parking space! I can't wait to come back again."

Places like this don't attract uppity people and the interiors resemble that. A great color scheme with not a lot of exotic patterns, the place is rustic and industrial. One of the owners, Mike, will graciously give tours of the brewery that produces the beer sold up front.  The beer selection is IPA heavy. Though the selection changes, at the time I went there was five IPAs to choose from. This brewery leans towards dark and bitter beers. A friend mentioned to me that drinking one beer felt like drinking three, and for me the coffee stout hit me harder than anticipated.  Southern Heights is Austin born and raised, by people who work industry jobs along side the rest of us. This is where you can drink local and meet local."

Walking into Southern Heights I wasn't the biggest fan of IPAs, I had never found one that really really did it for me...this place made me rethink my stance on IPAs.   They are posted up in a super cool warehouse that's mostly open and is welcoming to parties of all shapes and sizes. When I went, there were even a lot of kiddos there. The staff was amazing, they were super knowledgeable about their beers and beer in general and they treated my friends and I very well! They have a food truck that comes on the weekend and it is for sure worth a visit as well."

The staff and the two owners are extremely friendly and welcoming.

Regardless of the type of beer you like, I am sure you will find one of their beers amazing. And they are very good about letting you try whatever you want to make sure you get the right beer.

Indoor and outdoor seating, dog-friendly, easy parking, and free games.  Tons of space in the back and great place to chill and have a quiet night drinking, or have fun and drink throughout the day.  Saw families with babies and dogs, and also a birthday party tables over.  Cans to go available as well.  Food smelled great out back with Vietnamese, Texas BBQ style, fare.

I am a light beer drinker and took a liking to one of their originals the Extra Crispy. This is off the menu at the moment but we also like the Pilsner. Their beer is way better than others in the area, we can't wait to see them be more and more successful."

I'm not a heavy beer, crazy hops kind of guy so having easy drinkable beers is awesome to me.   The space is awesome and very spacious and the flights of beer were great. Will definitely be back!"

                "description": "My buddy and I just heard about this little gem last week and decided to check it out ASAP. Luckily we got to stop by Sunday November 26 for a few afternoon pints. This brewery may have the greatest juxtaposition between the outside appearance (plain and nondescript) and the beautiful tap room and quality beers within.   Both of the owners were behind the bar (Austin and Chris) and were happy to talk shop. Austin showed us around and told us about how they started, their backgrounds, their current beers and plans for the future.   We both had the pub ale (great, imminently quaffable, low ABV, everyday drinker), then my buddy had the pale ale while I opted for the West Coast IPA. Both the pale ale and IPA were absolutely fantastically executed and perfect representations of their styles. I can't wait to try the special porter that will be coming up in a few months.  Back to the space: the tap room is beautiful and you can tell that the owners have really poured their heart and soul into this place. There was a large TV on the wall, tons of bar seating and several 6-8 top tables. The bathrooms were industrial chic in the best way. Bonus points for free WIFI. These guys are off to a fantastic start! Right now they do not have an outdoor space for our four-legged friends, but one is in the works.   Stop by and try some awesome beer from some really great guys."

They have a great selection of beer on tap (my favorite being IPA). The space of this brewery was also surprising. It was very large and spacious with tons of seating. There were a couple of tables outside (picnic tables in the back alley) but loved all the games available and the ping pong table. Cant wait to go back and try more beers."

They  had staples like a Pilsner, or you can try something a little different like the sparkling golden ale (IMO heavy on the brut flavor). They have seating inside as well as outside, and they're dog friendly! They also had some cute shirts/apparel with their logo on it for purchase. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying this place once they expand their selection a little bit, but overall it was good! It's also right down the way from St Elmos Brewing, so add it to your list and hit them up when you're in the area/getting your beer fix."

Sometimes new breweries take time to develop a good list of beers, but I was impressed.   The setting was nicely laid out and decorated.  Indoor seating with AC for those hot days, as well as outdoor seating.   Check out Vacancy and support local independent breweries!!"

                "description": "One of the best \"better\" burgers in Austin.  Plain and simple.    It's a bit hard to find from Lamar because it's semi-hidden in the Midtown Commons apartment complex.  Like the Triangle and most other new Austin developments, there's retail and restaurants on the ground floor.  Decided to drop in here tonight because the burger came highly recommended.  I'm definitely glad I tried it.  The burger is deceptively small.  It looks like a smaller burger, but the density of the high quality burger patty combined with their bun makes it more than a meal.  Don't forget their fries, which were described to me as English style chips.  The fries look like flattened steak fries and are exceptionally crispy.  I'm not sure what the seasoning is, but it's strangely addictive.  Black Star has a huge variety of beers for the drinkers.  For the non-drinkers, they have a variety of canned and bottled soft drinks, although no fountain drinks.    Being a co-op, the service is friendly and obviously takes a lot of pride in their pub.  The quality of the food and the service both show that."

We split the tofu tikka masala and buffalo cauliflower (we added bleu cheese). I'm sure I could've eaten the whole bowl of of buffalo cauliflower by myself. It was super tasty. The sauce was just a little bit vinegary and the cauliflower soaked up all the flavor. Get it with the cheese, if you aren't vegan. It gives it that extra sharpness. The tikka masala was a bit spicy. I was surprised by that. We both liked it. The tofu was perfect with it. You have to know how to do tofu just right, and this was it! Everything was gluten free, for my friend. I can't wait to go back after I have my baby so I can partake in the adult beverages. I had my eye on some that they made there."

Pups have to stay outdoors, but you're allowed to bring them indoors to place your order. They have tons of beer options, great in-house brews. I was floored by their options! I always go for the flight when I try a new brewery to get a better taste of what they offer. I loved pricing: 4 for $10, and my favorites were the Island Baby (pineapple what!!) and juicy Fructis hazy IPA. They had a bit of everything, so that's always nice for beer geeks. Quench my palate, Black Star! They have their beer menu overhead--super easy to read. They also have great happy hour, but we arrived later after it was over. The food menu is on the paper menu that they have at the front of the line. Grab yourself the menu while someone stands in line for ya!   They also offer food specials for that day. It looked good--I think it was some sort of tofu (veg) tacos, but I wanted fries...so went with their avocado club. It was a bit heavy on the mayo, but it tasted great. Their chips...crisps...fries whatever you want to call em were the REAL WINNER. Y'all. Fries are so crispy and uneven...wedge-style. BUT not dry or lukewarm. They are delicious. I would go back just for their addictive fries. Trust me. They also offer the impossible burger too for veg folks, and other options like grilled cheese. I just love how veg-friendly they are. THANK Y'ALL. Grilled cheese gets old for us who don't eat meat.   The atmosphere is very chill and with a darker ambiance. It seems like the perfect spot for group hangs or a relaxed date. Parking was easy, especially since there's a customer parking structure that's free. It's also close to public transportation if you choose to take it. I love this spot--I can see this becoming a new favorite."

                "description": "I cannot emphasize my love for this place enough!!! Usually I am not the type of person to seek out breweries/pubs simply because they are loud and not too clean. I make an exception for this location due to the fantastic service I am given every. single. time. (NO TIPS HERE!! They work and treat you well because thy are paid good/decent wages!!!!!!)  Atmosphere: 4 Pretty big, can get crowded on evenings (cause it's freakin great). Lots of indoor seating and ample outdoor seating (covered)  Food: 4.5 Most of the food I have had here has been pretty decent. I knock off half a star because I've noticed a slight inconsistency in the servings (read about fish and chips) Fish and chips: my go-to food. Usually comes with 2-3 strips of fish and the potato wedges/strips are always well cooked, and come it's this out-of-the-world sauce!! Addicting af but wish they would consistently give 3 strips of fish ): Fried avocado tacos: awesome!! Sounds like it would be plain, but came with these giant thicc bacon strips on it that really added the savory taste Cheese board: nice variety, definitely love that the cheese is locally sourced from Antonelli's! Good mix for everyone's taste buds and really liked how there was plenty of bread too. Ice cream: seasonal flavors but I tried the pecan and regretted only having one scoop.  Service: 5 The servers here are always!!!!!!!!! SO cool and nice and helpful. Whenever we need drink recs, or anything at all, they are there to help! Even called in to ask if they were playing a game before, and offered to put down the big screen to have us come by and watch as we ate."

Foodwise, the only things I've liked are the chicken snack, and the seasoned chips. The burger is just okay, but the fish for the fish and chips needs salt and let's get some dang tarter sauce. They serve it with an aoli, which lacks seasoning. A side of coleslaw would go a long way too.  I'd be back, primarily for a cold one, and I would not not go for food again, but not by my will."

Pros: easy to find a spot inside or outside (although Texas so nothx), easy parking (lot or garage), delish fries and cheese boards and fried avo tacos, you can get flights of house beers for only $10, I believe they have board games too   Cons: I think only beer available (fine by me but depends on your group)"

My husband and I both god the black star burger while our friends had the beyond burger. Both my husband and I felt our burgers lacked seasoning and we couldn't taste the pub sauce (no idea what it was supposed to be). Our friends beyond burger had lots more flavor. The fries were great though! As long as they all aren't over done and completely crispy the soft center ones were delicious and seasoned well.   Beers/cider: I decided not to get anything by my husband had a hops on  while our friends had mango hops on and a cider. All were delicious. My husband actually meant to buy some can but we forgot.   You could help yourself to water, ketchup, silverware and napkins. You also bus your own table. I'd come back but have some different food."

The hill country views are beautiful and I'd imagine sunsets here are gorgeous. Outdoor games available. Dogs on leash are allowed.   Lots of seating and an interesting idea on how to hold your seats/table. It was nice not having to worry about somebody taking our spot while playing with the animals. You can also get food for them at the bar. They were pretty gentle and didn't mind selfies.   Lots of beer, cider and wine options. I had the sweet Sangria (Messina Hof) and Cherry Cobbler by Martin House. Both delightful and fruity.   They have 2 food trucks: Gringas Grub Shak and Kelly's Hill Country BBQ. I went with Kelly's and got the Brisket Elote Parfait and it was so, so good. I want to go back just for that! There were so many options to choose from. There's really something for everyone. I'll definitely be back!"

Plenty of great drinks on tap as well as friendly bartenders.   The bae and I came here after a swim at the neighboring Blue Hole Regional Park. Short 11min drive will get you to Shady Llama from Blue Hole.  The star of the show is the petting zoo featuring the llama and two donkeys. You can get up and personal with the llama by feeding and petting. I was a little hesitant to get too close because who knows if he'll spit.  The view of Texas Hill Country is breathtaking and you could sit here for hours just taking it all in. There were two food trucks on site offering tacos and bbq.  THE FINAL BAMBOO: The vibe here was so nice. Great place to unwind after long day at the pool or chill with friends until dusk."

As soon as you walk in, the chairs and hammocks out provide a nice campfire style vibe. There are a ton of trees to keep you cool, and the view of Hill Country is one of a kind. To your right, there is a small fence with adorable llama's you can feed and pet. I didn't get to try the food, but the bbq smelled incredible.  Lots of beer and wine options, and great place to bring your friends for a relaxing afternoon."

It the best of what the area wineries offer in terms of a place where you want to spend a leisurely couple of hours, with a great assortment of local craft beers on tap (and options for the non-beer drinkers).  I like that there is a variety of seating options (picnic tables, Adirondack chairs, barstools) and they are nicely spread out.  Aside from the view the main attraction is their resident llamas and mini donkeys, and trust me, splurge on the bag of feed for optimal up-close interaction with these adorable camelids!  | Beverages | A nicely curated selection of local beer on tap, and surely something to please everyone.  There's also a selection of cider, hard seltzer, wine, and non-alcoholic beverages.    | Eats | We didn't eat here, but there's an onsite resident food trailer offering tacos, quesadillas and burgers."

                "description": "What a perfect place to enjoy a relaxed few hours on a nice weather day in the Hill Country! The Shady Llama, just west of Wimberley on the way toward Dripping Springs on RR12 is a gem of a yard bar offering Texas-based craft brews, soft drinks, and wines with a killer view and a few furry mascots to feed and pet.  Our family loves this place. We can each enjoy a tasty beverage we like, have a good lunch from the Gringa's truck we like from Wimberley, and feed some alfalfa to some llamas and burros.  There are plenty of socially-distanced places to lounge around the terraced and tree-shaded yard, and everything is outdoors. It's actually perfect for pandemic times.  Pro-tip: do not try to come here during any weekend with special events in Wimberley, like Market Days or Rodeo. The parking lot has limited capacity. Lazy Sundays are the best time IMHO."

                "description": "Judging from the recent reviews, I guess I'm in the minority. But I miss pre-COVID Shady Llama.  It's just not the same and the magic is gone. Given that literally 100% of the place is outside,  their COVID protocols are way over the top.   Why do you need to assign picnic tables??   And all the hammocks are gone (risk of transmission is greater from canvas than wood??).  At least they stopped doing the inane requirement of reservations they were doing for a while.   So if you're uber paranoid and love restricted freedoms maybe it won't be an issue for you.    But it just made my wife and I sad to be back (1st time in a year and pre-pandemic we were regulars).   Yes they have good beer, and higher prices now to offset the fact that people obviously aren't flocking there like they used to.  And the view is great and it's fun to see the llamas and if you never went before maybe you'll be none the wiser.  But for me it's just a sad reminder of what it used to be and a testament to how much fear and paranoia have all but ruined our country.   I won't be back until they restore everything to pre-pandemic protocols."

                "description": "Just all sorts of whimsical in brewery form.  Their table designation decor they give you at the front so you can claim your spot without fear of anyone scooping it up when you're grabbing a beer or going to gawk at the llamas or mini donkeys is adorbs and shows attention to detail and a winning customer service experience right off the bat.   The tables are spread out nicely and there's plenty of shaded options or exposed ones, depending on your tolerance for the sun/heat.   It's actually on top of a hill so you can get a lovely panoramic vista of Hill Country, so you better believe if you're there at sunset, you'll be getting a gorgeous setting to close out on.   They don't brew their own beer (or wine), so they offer up a glimpse of Texas' finest on tap, which I appreciate. During COVID, every order came with chips or a treat (from a Costco assortment), but there's also a taco truck in the back if you're looking for something a little more substantive.   Kid and dog friendly, and since there are cute animals roaming the grounds (but fenced away from the tables), there are a lot more kids also roaming the grounds, so if that's not your thing, this may not be the place for you ;)  They have 6 llamas and two mini donkeys, and while the guy checking us in made it seem a sighting of them is rare unless you get there right when they open because that's when feeding time is, they were ever present during our midday visit. You can purchase feed for $1/bag to lure them over, and so I have a feeling we just had an extra generous crowd that day that always kept them fence curious!"

The picnic tables outside are plentiful but were all full when we arrived. Luckily two guys let us join them. I had the Raspberry Berliner Weisse and it quickly became my new favorite. It is sweet and crisp without being overly sweet. Our friends both got the Cream Ale and loved it. We all walked out with growlers. Everyone there is super friendly and very welcoming. We had the baby with us which was fine (there were a few kids there)...but every time a car was exiting we would have to wrangle him down (minor downfall of basically sitting alongside the parking lot). We are looking forward to visiting again."

                "description": "Bluebonnet Beer Company is simply amazing. They are a little difficult to find, look for the side street behind the post office and you should notice it on the right.  Their beers are super delicious, I had the wit, pecan brown ale , cream ale and hef. Out of all of them, the cream ale and wit come highly recommended. They are so smooth and drinkable.  There is a schnitzel food trailer that serves some pretty decent food. The place is small but all of the employees I encountered were nice and friendly. For seating, there is only plastic benches avaliable located in the front of the brewery. Not really any kind  of shade or landacaping but this is expected since it is such a small brewery.  It may not have all of the amenities and backyard space that other larger breweries in Austin have. But if you love beer and want to interact with some awesome, friendly people then Bluebonnet Beer Company is the way to go. Everything is tasty and pints are currently at $5 each, you can't beat that price."

If it's cold outside, I highly recommend bringing a layer or two as there is only a bit of seating inside but about four picnic tables outside. Also, wait to grab dinner at the brewery as they have rotating food trucks Thursday-Saturdays. When we went, they had a lobster roll truck that served amazing rolls.   I started out with their Oktoberfest beer, which was very good! My mom, who is not a big beer drinker, got their shandy and thought it would be great for a hot day. The beers are $5 a pint, and I thought it was really cool they have a series related to the Immortal 10.   Parking is not a hassle, the beer is very good, the people are friendly, and your hardest job will be finding a seat. Enjoy!"

Beer is tasteful and I don't always love IPA. Their indoor seating is limited by this isn't normally a problem in Texas. They have plenty of tables outside and also have tents in the summer. No food but there is always a food truck - if you follow them on Facebook you can see what it is ahead of time.   Staff is always friendly and accommodating. Plenty of space for puppies here too.

We know that they are popular and were even excited to try Jimmy Vega's Smokehouse but when we arrived half of the available tables were set as reserved. There was literally no where to sit. Every table was packed. We had our 3 yr old son with us, so standing wasn't an option, especially since we wanted to eat too. We asked anyway if any of the tables were available and was told no, they are all reserved for 5pm, but you could squeeze in anywhere else. In the end, we left irritated and disappointed, while I understand reserving tables, but when you only have 10 tables and you reserve 5 of them, that doesn't leave much room for anyone else."

We went for the fried green tomatoes, the Buffalo chicken sandwich and the country fried chicken. When our food arrived everything was beautiful. Really great presentation. But unfortunately when we tasted it we were in for a big disappointment. Everything just tasted like salt. The flavors of the toppings and donuts all just blended together with nothing interesting or any pops of fresh flavor. I will say everything was cooked to perfection, but the flavor was just off/missing.   Bummer."

After waiting about thirty minutes to order, she finally came up and as we were ordering, she rolled her eyes and walked away. It was clear she wanted us to leave, so we did.   I understand being short-staffed, but again she only had three tables to work. All in all, terrible."

It is extremely satisfying when executed successfully, so shout out to Gourdough's for doing it extremely well.   I was actually expecting the doughnut to be sweeter on my dish, and I'm happy it was not. Everything really paired well together.   The vibe is very Austin-esque and the staff was super friendly. My friend asked for no cheese on her burger, they put cheese, but the waitress happily got it fixed up for us.   I can't wait to go back!"

                "description": "Gourdough's answers the questions that you didn't know you had. And the answer is always donuts!    How do you make mozzarella sticks better?   Wrap them in donut dough, aka The Big Cheez.   How do you make a breakfast sandwich better?  Serve it on donuts.  The McGourdough is maple sausage, egg, and cheese (on donuts, of course) with maple on the side (opted not to have the pour-over). There's plenty of maple flavor in the sausage so I never used the side of maple syrup.   Once again, how do you make Kolaches better?  You guessed it, use donut dough, aka Gotchie Yo Kolache  And finally, is it even possible to make a Cuban sandwich even better?  Yup! The Cubano, a Cuban sandwich on donuts.   I'm shocked that they didn't figure out how to serve me my beer in a donut!  That's right, a full-bar to go with all that doughy goodness!  Donuts and alcohol, what more do you need?"

                "description": "This was my first by time here and was sort of disappointed in what I received; I guess my expectations were higher. The description state \"crispy fried fillet chicken breast smothered in honey butter.\"  I did request to have the honey butter on the side. I got two chicken tenders instead of a chicken breast (not to be too critical but the description should be updated if chicken breast = chicken tenders). The honey butter sauce was not what I was expecting; (not a fan). On the bright side, the donut was pretty good. Even thought it wasn't a chicken breast,  the tenders were tasty and had a good crunch.   I did order the miss shortcake and it was pretty good. But nothing special I suppose. Maybe I'll try a sandwich instead so get a full experience. I'll try them again and see if I get a different experience."

Smells super weird in there Idk if I'm smelling old oil or what but it's weird.  2. There are lots of people working here, yet getting service or someone's attention was hard. We were approached when we first walked in and then after that, it was half assed.  3. I got the cucumber mint drink and it's like a mojito but with rum and cucumber instead of mint. Wasn't my fave, wasn't sweet enough, just tasted like cucumber water and lime juice.  4. Our donuts were really good but I was told by my friend that they were smaller than the donut food truck which is disappointing.  I got the sin a bomb and it tasted just like a cinnamon roll. My friends got the cherry bombs and peach donut and we all enjoyed it!  5. Vibes were just off and my friends agreed. If you're looking for good food, sure, but if you're a vibes type person like us, you'll feel weird here lol."

The menu is entertaining and interesting to say the least! We got the saucy cock (LOL) which was amazing! I was looking forward to the Count Gordough Cristo, but it flopped in my opinion. The sandwich arrived cold and the ham was colder so I don't recommend this dish. Other than that, lots of TVs to watch the game and great drinks of all kinds!"

                "description": "Was super excited when I heard about Gourdough's and they did not disappoint. We were seated pretty quickly and our waitress was super nice in getting us situated and being patient with us when we were figuring out our order.  There's plenty of seating both indoors and outdoors with additional bar seating. Lots to offer in terms of a drink menu with beer on tap too. Since it was the middle of the day, we opted not to drink though since there was still plenty on the menu for the day.  For food we got the GPH Mother Clucker (not pictured),  Blue Balls (front), Son of a Peach (middle), and Granny's Pie (back). Would hands down come again for the Mother Clucker. The fried chicken was cooked to perfection and it paired so well with they honey and donut with it. Between all of the donuts, I think the Blue Balls were my favorite because the blueberry sauce wasn't all that sweet and more on the tangier side so it wasn't like I was getting a total sugar high like I did with the other two. I did love all three, just the donut holes a little more. As a side note, the menu says those donut holes are supposed to be blueberry filled but ours came with a blueberry sauce on top. Nothing wrong with that, but for future customers looking to try, it's worth knowing.  In terms of price, everything may look expensive, but the portion sizes that go with those prices are definitely reasonable. Plus, the donuts are made fresh and cooked to perfection, so (again) the prices are justified and reasonable for what you get. Almost everything on the menu is also shareable if you're interested in trying a bunch of things without a singular price tag.  Definitely recommend if you're in the area and looking for a place to eat all your calories and try a bunch of different donut dishes. Will be coming again the next time I come to Austin!"

I usually get the black out but this time I got the miss shortcake which was delicious and wasn't too excessive like the black out can be. Excellent dessert spot for sure. The reason I'm giving it four stars is because we had to wait roughly 40-45 minutes to get three donuts? That seems a little excessive especially since they did not seem to be understaffed. And when the donuts came out they felt lukewarm like they had been sitting out for 10+ min which is a bit disappointing. Maybe there was something extra going on which is why I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. Great taste which is why I recommend it but maybe just go to the food truck next time?   Overall: 3.9 stars"

The place has a fairly large outdoor seating area that is super dog friendly. Parking however, is limited. They have a small lot in front of the restaurant for maybe 10 cars. Otherwise, it's street parking, which is also limited.   The food was 10/10! Tried the Rise and Shine, which is one of their most popular brunch items. The chicken is thick and crispy. The egg and quest were perfect. And I am a huge fan of the pickled jalapeños (on top) too. The El Diablo was delicious too, not spicy at all. Also appreciated the huge portions.   Overall, loved my experience here and will certainly come back to try more!"

                "description": "Made a stop here for Happy Hour while visiting friends in Austin this weekend and was so glad we did! We came mid-afternoon and were seated immediately without reservations. We started with drinks. I had the Losoya Street Lemonade, and I loved it! It was sweet and tart and not overpowering at all! We also ordered a Water Moccasin Fishbowl. Fair warning, this one was  very sweet! Good but sweet - reminded us of a blue sour patch kid.  After we made a small dent in the fishbowl, we ordered our doughnuts. We tried the Sin A Bomb and the Heavenly Hash. The Heavenly Hash definitely took the trophy between the two. The doughnut itself was amazing (tastes like funnel cake), but the toppings were even better - fudgy chocolate brownie icing, rich chocolate chips, marshmallow cream, brownie batter drizzle... oh my.... It was so sweet and chocolatey, and we finished it QUICK!! The Sin A Bomb was good as well, but the butter on top was a bit too much for us. If we had ordered it with just the cream cheese topping and not the slew of melted butter, I think we would have liked it more. Not bad by any means, just not our cup of tea.  We never felt rushed and sat their enjoying our doughnuts and drinks (and attempting to make it through the fishbowl) for several hours. It was a super laid-back atmosphere and the perfect place to catch up with old friends. In fact, we were there so long that we got hungry again and ended up ordering mac and cheese - which was also amazing! You can see we are the picture of health going from doughnuts to mac and cheese, ha! I wouldn't come here if you are on a diet... everything on the menu is either a rich dessert or a loaded Southern dish. Would love to go back and try some of the food items like the Chicken Pot Pie or Burgers. Everything that the people around us were ordering looked delicious."

Only reason for the 4 starts is today we came for what had to be the 6th or 7th  time and got kicked to the outside patio for having a dog. This is ALWAYS the brewery I go to when it's hot because they allowed dogs inside. I've had every other bartender let my dog in, love on him and have had zero problem sitting inside with him. Even their Facebook has a picture of a dog inside. Today we were told that was never allowed and should have been told to go outside. We have also seen many other dogs inside during past visits. I hate inconsistent rules. Also, super sad that we'll have to find a new brewery this summer. It's too hot to be outside and my dogs nickname is the the brewery dog.  I'll still support them during cooler months-- but dog owners should know the rules have changed. Very sad. Wish they would have posted something about this change."

                "description": "I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Whitestone Brewery. The environment felt very relaxed and casual and I loved the outside patio area. We got a selection of beers, I personally really enjoyed the Mango Crazy wheat beer and the Keyboard Gansta IPA. The service was also very friendly and they offered some samples if you are in between choices.   The taco truck outside was also very good! I highly recommend one of their loaded fries. The fries were perfectly crispy and tender in the middle, and super flavorful toppings. The tacos were also yummy and I'm a huge corn lover so the elote bowl was perfect.   I will definitely be back to try more of their seasonal beers!"

                "description": "It's been a hot minute since I visited Whitestone- I think the last time I was here was in 2016, when it was quieter and a lot more laid back.  Fast forward to 2021 - the city of cedar park and Leander are booming.  There is a huge influx of population. The tables at Whitestone are full, there is a food truck (which is awesome) as a permanent fixture BUT the overall customer experience has left me disappointed.  Maybe because it's a Sunday with lovely weather, the guy behind the bar is done with people, or, he isn't a people person , or, he just didn't like the way I looked? But man was it hard to get him to give me an effing beer without getting hateful glances. Yeesh. Im kinda scared of coming back here now!  That aside, im not really a fan of their beer selection either - the kolsch is OK but I've had better. I guess the biggest advantage is the proximity to both CP and Leander and for the people who live around here.  So, this isn't much of a review rather than a semi rant ?   Also guys- kids have a tendency to move around from one side of the table to the other. They're not capable of sitting still and neither are you. If you'd rather than families stay away, just tell us to our faces."

The ladies behind the counter are very nice and loaded with insights about the beers. There's a food truck outside that was delish!! (Tacos and burgers) the al pastor tacos were amazing. We did not try the burgers but from what I've seen/heard it's also very yummy! Whitestone is in a great location in Cedar Park, TX. We are heading to Balcones state park to go hiking but saw this along the way and had to stop in. I'm glad we did!"

Oh yah and coffee too. We got to meet Derek and his wife, the owners. This is such a great spot to go and work or to relax at after work! Will definitely be back and can't wait to watch this business grow.  We were having so much fun I forgot to take pictures! I'll update with pictures next time I go."

I also felt kind of weird about asking for a flight but then being told uhhh we're not doing those right now- seemingly bc the line was long. It was odd.  Small indoor space, kind of lacking something aesthetically - compared to other Austin breweries.   Good truck onsite but it wasn't that good :/  Overall just meh!

Tonight there was an open area for dancing and the food truck Killa Wasi was there. Really enjoyed our time there though the great event turnout made the beer line pretty long. Will definitely return to sample other beers and see experience it during a \"regular\" day. Staff was very friendly and I enjoyed the stouts!"

                "description": "Love me some authentic microbreweries.  I haven't been to a solid microbrew spot since moving to Austin, so this was such a breath of fresh air. It seems like there are plenty of breweries that also double as restaurants and music venues--which is cool, I'm all for that, but deep down I'm a plain microbrew kinda gal.  Getting here got me so excited as our GPS took us to industrial surroundings AKA the location of every great microbrewery. There is plenty of parking, and they had a yummy-smelling food truck parked outside, but we already ate so skipped that. My friend and I walked in and immediately felt the warm, relaxed energy that Independence had. I couldn't decide on what pint to get, so I settled on a taster set of four for $10. Not too pricey. The selections were not really in my favor, as I tend to go for wheats, belgians, juicy or hazy IPA's, or oatmeal stouts. However, I knew I would find something I'd like. One can never be too picky about beer.  They also have board games and free stickers! I love that!! Their logo is the lone star on black fire--super cool. Our taptender was a wonderful and friendly man. I just wish he would have been a little more wordy with his explanations of the beer profiles. I'd assume that microbreweries attract devout beer drinkers and self-proclaimed snobs (like myself), so I would love it if he was able to elaborate more. Anyhow, I will be back even with a larger group (yay picnic tables!), but I hope that they have more varieties of beer, or that they rotate their taps often."

Freak power is going for $2/pint right now! Honestly, you would be hard-pressed to find a deal this good anywhere in Austin TX. It's a hefe and goes down easily, very easy to drink.  My personal fav is the convict hill oatmeal stout, coming in at 8% and tastes like coffee. Also very easy to drink and is a nice addition in \"wintertime.\"  Good place, fair prices, decent selection!"

We've been a few times and it's always fun! They allow outside food, so it's always fun to pick up some bites and enjoy their awesome beer as we Geek it to random trivia.

Beers listed on the wall, not that many options here but still good beers.  One of the beers I wanted to try ran out so they recommended another based on that selection. Good job, I liked it.  It was a bit sour, so it hit the mark.  But the one I liked the most was the End Credit Chocolate Hazelnut Porter. The hazelnut makes it smooth, and the chocolate flavor comes through as well.    The staff was cordial, not overly friendly, but it's patrons sure are. They made room for us to walk up an order, they asked what I had ordered, and made recommendations based on what they had already tried.  They had live music that day too.  Very entertaining, good set, he even dedicated a song to one of my friends.  Very cool!  They have games like chutes and ladders, Rock Trivia, Oversized Jenga, and more.  Beer and entertainment, can't go wrong with that!"

With awesome craft beer, great hipster service and entertainment usually on the weekends you will have an awesome time. Try the beers on special, but also try the ones that are mixtures between two beers they are special and only unique to this establishment. The bathrooms are clean and there are snacks by the register, but be sure to eat before you get here since some beers are heavy and you might get full which really isn't a bad thing, but good to know!"

It's a little bit of a trek but well worth it. Pups are allowed so bring your four-legged friend on a leash. Aw, you know beer and dogs go well together!  There is, oddly, a Ceviche food truck in the parking lot. Hmmm. Beer and Ceviche? Kind of like pairing Thunderbird wine and a fruit salad."

It's a really large place and they set up picnic tables right outside the brewery.  The Sunday afternoon I went, I believe there was some event wrapping up. DJ was playing 90s RandB/Hip-Hop which contributed to the great vibe. All of their beers tasted amazing. I ended up going with their sour beer. Perfect balance of sourness and fruit. I would definitely come here again."

But once you arrive, there is indoor and outdoor seating.  There are occasional food trucks.  Plenty of games including jenga.  I like the chill vibe.  This is a great place for an afternoon drink or three.  The bartenders know their stuff.  Ask as many questions as you like regarding the beer choices.  You can do tasting flights or go right to the pint.  I prefer the Stash IPA which is one of my local favorites.  Other beers are good too.  Can't go wrong here."

                "description": "When I was visiting friends in Austin last month, a friend and I decided to hit up a local brewery for a couple of hours (it's a tradition of ours). I had to pick up my brother at the airport after, so I was looking for a place that was southeast, so Independence fit the bill. When I lived in Austin, I used to drink Independence beers all the time, but I never made it out to the brewery. I was impressed! It's really large! Tables inside and tables outside. They have several beers to choose from. The line for the bathroom was REALLY long, but we happened to choose a day that had an event (puppy adoptions I think) and it was PACKED. All in all, good beers, they were playing good music, and I had a great time with my friend! Great afternoon, and I'd go again!"

There are lots of shiny distractions on the menu, for sure, but there are some solid entries as well.   The food is nothing amazing. It's just ok. And wow what a wasteful process to give everyone a pizza box. I guess you are not offering the pan it was cooked on or some other dish you don't need to wash or dispose of, and I'm sure they are recyclable, but you just have one trash, so what's the point. Maybe you are saving water instead of trees.   The events are cool, fun stuff. And like I said, a great space for it.   The bartender/manager guy is very snooty, but I guess if he is that proud of the place, that's good for him. You just get the feeling he'd care less if you were there or not. I can pretty easily choose not to go just to not need to deal with that.   But, I'll be back."

You treat a customer with respect and gratitude, guess what they will be coming back.. think of all the repeat customers you losing out on, because of your rude staff...  Do appreciate small business, but if you dont even care about yours and really improving the overall customer experience, why should you...  Setting yourself up for disaster.

We've been wanting to stop in here for some time and I'm so glad we finally did! The beer is tasty, I only had a few sips since I'm driving but next time I'm pounding some brews! However the pizza!! Omg!! Now that was delicious! I ate half the pie to myself and sadly I feel I could have ate the whole thing haha the crust is chewy crispy, the sauce tastes freshly made, the cheese actually has that cheese flavor and not some pre shredded cheese bs! Oh and the pepperoni!! It was so flavorful!!  Now for the atmosphere! As soon as we walked in we were greeted with smiling faces!! Everyone was so friendly!! I swear this is the first place in Texas that I felt truly welcomed!!"

They have indoor and outdoor seating, you just have to walk around the building. We chose to sit indoors and watch the football game, wasn't too long before our food was ready and it was bread-tastic!!!! There is so much flavor, I would definitely order again it...

Batches were so small only about 8 people could be served and it took over 20 minutes per batch.  FINALLY, at 2pm I got crayfish.  They had run out of sausage, no potatoes, 1 small piece of corn.  Watching the Laurel and Hardy show of the \"cooks\" was hilarious.  They had no idea what they were doing.  Between 4 years in NOLA and 25 years in TX, I've been at least 100 crayfish boils. WORST ONE EVER.  Based on how mishandled this \"event\" was, I would never return."

On several occasions, we used their pickup and it was great. They were efficient, considerate (all the utensils and napkins) and the food was always good considering we would eat it while parked at Zilker.  Well, we finally decided to eat there this time. They have an awesome covered...tent or something, that fits up to 60 folks. They even had a heater blowing in that thing!!  And the food, whew. The grilled halloumi plate was so creative, we loved the mix of flavors. The spicy chicken sandwich was different than at other places, in a good way. I left trying to place all the flavors and can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu.  A cool bonus is the view from the parking lot. I was able to take a quick picture."

                "description": "Possibly the rudest customer service I've experienced in Austin. There was a drink mixup and instead of accommodating us, they were rude and accusatory of us, as if we were trying to steal drinks from them. When in reality, the mixup happened because their waitstaff doesn't know what their food and drink items are by looking at them. They would just put the items down on the table and walk away. Instead of remedying the issue, eyes were rolled at us, and we were told if we want something else we needed to come inside to the bar and \"pay for it ourselves\".   We also had brought a birthday cake. It's an outdoor coffee shop and bar with a super casual atmosphere. When I asked if we could use some utensils, they told me that I shouldn't have a cake on the premises (which is \"standard for restaurants\") and that it would be $15 for us to use their forks and/or consume the cake on site. They said I should have called ahead. If it was a nice sit down restaurant and not a bar that has a Sunday brunch, I would have.   Again, this is an OUTDOOR coffee shop and bar. We had a big group of 20 people who all bought a ton of food and drinks, and we were treated like we were taking advantage. We were super patient (I've worked in customer service and know how awful people can be, so I always treat waitstaff with respect. But this is not that).   Never coming back."

Great place for outside chilling, pet friendly, cabanas for shade.   The inside is really modern and really fast. They get you your drinks and will walk and deliver them to you outside. Great place for a morning coffee with friends!"

I was not a big fan of the donut balls i tried, though they were hot and possibly freshly made. They were a little dry and dull for my taste . The breakfast sandwich was amazing too and they had a vegan meat option which is wonderful. Plenty parking, which is a plus in Austin and great outdoor seating too. Will go back again!"

Parking was also relatively easy since they have their own parking lot. They have happy hour Tues-Fri and Sunday 3-6pm, with $6 burgers! They also have reverse happy hour 9-10pm daily (also $6 burgers). The patio is very dog friendly and there is a self-serve water jug as well to help yourself.

The portion was smaller than expected but the food was really good - the had browns were crispy and the Parmesan with the sunny side up egg paired really well with their gravy. I liked how the pickled onions added a sour kick to the gravy, but preferred the dish without the onions.   Would definitely come again and sit outdoors, if the weather permits!"

We went on Labor Day so it was quite busy and took probably a good 40 minutes to get our food, but it was absolutely worth every minute of the wait.  The Pastrami Sandwich had the best, smokiest pastrami I've ever had and everything from the mushrooms to the bread to the berbere horseradish sauce was just so well executed and damn delicious.   The Big Springy salad was a nice healthier contrast that still tasted interested and decadent (okaay, we added fried chicken, that might not be the healthiest). It was a little light on the cojita-chimichurri dressing so we got some more, and I just wanted to jello shot that condiment cup straight into my mouth it was so good.  I started off with the chagacinno and while it was a tad sweet for my preference, it was still absolutely delicious as well."

I had heard this place was one of the best breakfast spots in Austin and it did not disappoint!   I ordered the chicken biscuit and completely cleaned my plate not a crumb left! I will say the chicken was slightly salty but nothing i couldn't handle. The chicken tastes like it might be brined that would be my guess as to the extra salt (not sure if they use a brine or not). The cocktail was pretty good too went well with the sandwich.   From the description I was thinking there was going to be a spicy marmalade sauce on the side to dip the biscuit in which would've been amazing but nonetheless still a very good breakfast sandwich will definitely be going back the next time I'm in Austin!"

I absolutely love the backyard patio vibes - seems like a very chill spot to just hang out and chat.  I don't really recommend coming here to study or do work as this place can get quite rowdy. The same owners also opened a brewery right next doors called Hold Out Brewing, so you can slowly transition from productivity to drunken stupor if that's your thing."

                "description": "Better Half Coffee and Cocktails belongs in the book of Austin AF restaurants. What does that even mean? Innovative menu using fresh ingredients with high prices.   Our table of 3 split the entrees and shared as easy apps to get the full experience of the brunch AND lunch menu. For brunch, we ordered the Waffle Iron Hashbrown, which was literally a plate of overcooked hashbrowns, topped with coffee and cream gravy, cotija cheese, an egg, pickled onions and scallions. Sadly, this was just basic to me (or as Gen Z calls it Cheugy). Nothing that I would die for...  For lunch, we ordered the Vermicelli Salad, the Chilled Ramen, and a side of the Cauliflower Tots. I could not get enough of the Vermicelli Salad and strangely the Cauliflower Tots! The Vermicelli Salad was refreshing and light, and I enjoyed the Pineapple \"Fish\" Sauce substitute they use to make this dish vegan friendly!! The Cauliflowers admittedly looked like burnt bite-sized toast when it arrived, but as soon as I dipped it in the beet ketchup, I couldn't put my fork down.   BEWARE! If you order any of the Frozen Sloppee Frozen Cocktails, this thing will mess you up (in the best form possible). I would advise ordering with caution! The Spicy Peach'arita was my poison of choice, and though delicious, if you add Texas heat, it will melt fast and have you only tasting tequila!"

We started off with a brunch drink that I can't remember the name of, it had champagne and vodka, but it I was really good.   I was eyeing their creamsicle latte, but I wasn't in the current mood for a coffee drink, so sorry I can't tell you about it. It looked good though. They have some very interesting selections for coffee that I'd love to come back and try.   Food- we ordered the cauliflower tots with beet ketchup. It comes out looking like tofu and the taste is very good. The beet ketchup is a nice addition. My husband got the hash browns topped with Cojita gravy. The gravy was so good, the hash browns were cooked to hard, but a easy fix for next time. For the table we got the Pastrami Chips and Queso, that tasted like a brisket. I got a summer salad which was probably the only thing that we had that was meh. My friend had the chicken biscuit in which she said was really good. All in all I would like to come back again as their menu had some interesting items on it, a good looking happy hour and for the most part the food didn't disappoint."

The breakfast burrito isn't the largest thing in the world so if you're hungry make sure to get a side or an app along with it.   Will definitely come back.   There was a time limit on our table which wasn't preferred and the tables themselves weren't amazingly comfortable."

The cider was good they had some crisp ciders that came off more like a beer if that's what you need. My favorite was the blood orange or the pear. Still a toss up between the two. Also this place has some crazy good wines. They are cheap for a much better quality compared to the ones you get in most stores. They had football running great AC for that Texas heat. Best of all they allow dogs! When I came in my novice skills when drinking wine and ciders were put aside by the owner who gave me a great understanding and tour of his selections. The staff are all super friendly too!  There are no downsides to this place. Except for the hangovers. (Mostly self inflicted) I recommend Sundays. For your visit. There is a cool little coffee shop inside too. Nervous Charlie's was serving up brunch. Soo many good combinations outside of your regular mimosa routine. Do yourself a favor. You are not too cool to break away from your traditions to try this place.  In regards to the cider snobs leaving bad reviews. They obviously didn't come here for something new. Why would you want to go somewhere that copied someone else? Boring.... wish they could get more stars."

It's very laid back, intimate, and relaxing with its clean aesthetic. Down in South Atx, we have Texas Keeper (awesome cidery, very different fireflies-on-the-porch and farmside vibes), so it was nice to see a completely different cidery with literally garage-space, elevated, and hipster vibes.   We both got cider flights, and loved the diversity of selections. Their ciders are all hilariously named (Fuccboisen is my favorite...I should've ordered that). I enjoyed their Smell the Van and EZ Tea (it truly tastes like tea!). The EZ tea was so delicious. Quenches thirst, subtle, and very honey-like. Their ciders aren't sickeningly sweet, and the flights give you a great little taste of all of the ciders that you're curious about but are unsure about getting a whole pint of. Their inventory has a clean design too. Their tees are super adorable, as well as their BEVERAGES sweaters. Tempting.  Service was wonderful. Our cider taptender was a wonderful man who was very sweet, knowledgeable and welcoming. The space is small, so it's not recommended you come here with a huge group (unless you plan on taking up the entire space. They have strong wifi, serve-yourself water, and different styles of seating from regular tables to taller barstools. They have little succulents on the table along with a well-designed menu for their \"specials\" deals. I would usually go to 4th Tap next door, but why not do both and hit up Fairweather too?"

The pet nat was INSANE. Seriously gorgeous, open, airy space with beautiful murals that instantly put you in a good mood"

                "description": "I usually am not a fan of cider...at all! But, after some friends who are also beerdrinkers suggested this place and that it wasn't your typically overly-sweet cider (which is what I have the aversion to) suggested this place, I decided \"why not?\".  The vibe here is super chill and the cider-barista was super nice and everyone there chimed in when I asked about the diff ciders they were offering.   So I will say, while I am still not on the cider bandwagon (I mean beer will always be my first love), the ciders here were actually drinkable! I enjoyed that they were on the drier side so your mouth isn't annihilated by chocolate and you can actually appreciate the different flavor components of each one! I will also give them kudos for actually packing a little bit of a punch w/the abv, which you don't usually see with ciders either!  Definitely enjoyed the vibe and the concept here!"

I think a coffee shop was attached too but it was closed at night. We got two samplers and honestly it's hard to pick a fave and the flavors were fun!

                "description": "First ACTUALLY dry cider I have had while in Texas. Please do yourself a favor and visit this tap room.  It all started with a long wait for barbecue and a guy wearing a cidery shirt/hat. A quick google search later I dragged my family to this tap room so I could get a cider fix (having spent five years in the PNW it is a tough itch to scratch here in TX). The bartender/coowner was extremely friendly and ready to answer all questions. He was adorable and alone was reason enough for a follow up visit.  My sister and I had a flight of their four ciders on tap. Currently:  Common: base for all other cider, ACTUALLY DRY. In lurv Tejano dreams: green chile cider, bomb af. Strong pepper aroma and beautiful subtle Chile flavor. Nelson sauvin (I think).... very strong hop flavor forward with sweet cider finish. A good balance for people seeking hop flavor while trying to expand to cider. huell melon: hop flavor is SO subtle that it almost tastes like sour fruit flavor. I LOVED this cider. I can't wait to try it again.  Opens only Fri-Sun this is definitely a stop to add to your weekend plans. There are big things coming for this cidery. I can't wait to watch them grow.  I loved this cidery and cider and definitely recommend to anyone in the area."

                "description": "I really love Fairweather's concept and having a new addition to Metric Row that isn't another brewery! (Love to y'all breweries, though.)  I came here the day after opening day with a few friends who love cider (I'm indifferent) to try out their brews. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised!  We each ordered a flight of their four ciders on tap. One was the Common, which is the base for all their ciders. Another was one of my favorites even though it involved a little heat from some peppers! The last two were hopped ciders, and the bartender/co-owner told us if we tried them first in different orders, we may like one over the other. He was right, both both were delightful.  I want to give a five-star review to support a new business, but my only tiny complaint would be the fruit flies. Some kept buzzing about here and there, but you can only imagine they want to get a taste of this dry cider sweetness!  If you're a beer person like me, you may have found a new hangout for your friends who don't love beer as much as you. But you'll still enjoy what Fairweather has to offer -- so much so, I ordered a 12-oz pour of my favorite hopped cider after my flight!  Good luck, guys, and congrats on your opening!"

                "description": "Fairweather was a surprise find for me thanks to the wise owner of Sunrise Mini Mart.  That guy knows SO much about all different types of distilled liquids, I wish I had a brain that could store that much knowledge.   I digress, this review is about the awesome family who started Fairweather (super friendly and knowledgeable).  I bought their cans of Common and was blown away.  Cideries claim to have dry cider all the time, but it's not TRULY dry.  Common though was legit.  These guys are making a truly BONE DRY English style cider from apples sourced from the PNW.   It's not perfect yet, but you can taste the potential. It reminds me of Shacksbury.  The fun artwork on the can intrigued me to go check out this spot that was just a few minutes drive away.  The tasting room is TINY! Start small and dream big! Kuddos to them for turning a cold warehouse space into a fun modern hipster community watering hole.  On a Friday night, get here early to even find a spot to sit!  I arrived around 5:30pm and sat at a high table outside and had no line.  By 7pm, people were crowded elbow to elbow, with a long line.  There also is very limited parking.  Be prepared to take time to find a spot and walk.  When they state they are pet friendly they mean it. Not only was my furry friend chilling with others, we were soon joined by a parrot!  I had a great time. I had come by myself, but ended up having several great conversations with people I had never met before.  Truly this place is only months old, and has quickly become a new neighborhood hang out.  The ciders are all 6.5%.  You can enjoy a flight of 4x4OZ for $10, enjoy a glass, or enjoy a guest cider or something from Austin Winery. I love the local support for other local liquid makers. There is a wide range of ciders to choose from.  They have some fun experimental ciders that were not like anything I have tried before.  It's hard to choose just four for a flight.  They have their staples- Common, EZ TEA, and Tejano Dreams, but also some Dry Hopped Ciders, and fruit ciders. My favorites were Tejano Dreams (nice kick), Gin Bot, and Dr. Rudi."

Their cider is so amazing with fusions with sweet tea, gin, wine and different fruits, it'll definitely give you a pleasant experience you may not have been expecting. They also have so many more flavor options than what they offer in the store so id go to the cider for more options. You can also take pictures in front of the interesting wall art with the unicorn things going on."

You can get a flight or by the glass. If you are usually a beer drinker or new to ciders, they will definitely let you try a few so you can find your favorite.   If you are hungry, there are usually food trucks at 4th tap and they let you bring food in. It is not officially dog friendly but sometimes they have a table outside when the garage is open."

It's quite small, but there was ample seating when I was there. Their cider is different from most of the dry ones I've had before - my favorite was the common with citrus-y flavors. The Apple flavor wasn't as strong as I was expecting (or used to with other ciders), and maybe that's just the case with a \"true\" dry cider. It tasted almost like a wine, which is great if you're a wine lover, I suppose!"

We had an excellent server and really liked the \"Snug\" we sat in.  The seating options are pretty and a unique feature actually.   Seating: Large tables, small tables, \"Snugs\"(private little cubby with plenty of room), bar seating, outdoor tables and cozy seating around a fireplace outside.   The food: Pretzel w/ dipping trio. Yes! These are excellent w/ an awesome sourdough flavor.  The fish and chips was pretty good. Great batter with a ton of flavor in it. The pizza (ordered without the pepperoni). The dough was under proved and under cooked. Ok at best.  The irish stew was pretty to look at but had none of the heart or depth of flavor that you'd expect from a stew. My soul was craving a hot heart stew, no luck. Disappointing.   Drinks: No wells here!! Just a quality selection of excellent wines and spirits.   We'll definitely be back and try a new selection of foods! If you're looking for a place to visit/meet up, this is a great venue. Plentyyyyyy of room!!"

I want to start off by saying I hadn't eaten breakfast, lunch, or dinner prior to arriving there which you could only imagine I was hangry(hungry + angry)    So I park my car and Soon as I step on the curb to make my way towards the door the hostess had already opened the door and was greeting my wife and I with a warm and friendly greeting.   As a manager myself, I always preached that our customers should never have to touch the door and I was so glad to see this establishment have the same values about it as I do.   We sat down and in no time our waiter Homer was at our table greeting us. I must say he was very personable. He truly grasp the concept of building rapport with his customers.   The food came out pretty quick which was a huge plus because a I stayed before I was \"Hangry\"  My fries were cold, but then again they're fries so I just asked for some fresh ones that had some heat to it lol.  My wife order the 8HR Braised Short Rib and she stated it was just ok.  I asked for lemon pepper wings, My receipt shows that's what I got, but I can tell you that want what came in my plate. Was I made about it NO, why you ask? Because whatever the heck it was taste pretty darn good. I should have asked what was I given because I wouldn't mind ordering it again.  My fish and chips was freaking AMAZING and whatever little SAUCE they give you to dip you food into.... AMAZING!!! make sure you ask for extra so you get enough to dip your fries in it to lol. My wife tried my fish and chips and said she couldn't wait to come back to get that next time.   On our way out the door the host struck again with grabbing the door for us and she did it with a smile. As I was walking my way to the car another employee told me how much they appreciated our business and I'm thinking to myself write your done working your on your way to your own car to head home and you still take the time out to make is feel special. I feel that the friendly service has us excited to come back and eat here again and we are looking forward to it."

Great service, great outdoors... good filtered water... yes I can tell...  I will be back to try out patio and bar in the very near future!  Would love to try more items on the menu.

The place is gorgeous, spacious (big groups are welcome!)  We wished we didn't have to leave. Their back patio is beautifully by a creek. They also control the mosquitoes which could ruin any patio dining experience for me. It's a win all around!  I can't wait to come back to this piece of Ireland in Round Rock, the managers told us that a lot of their restaurant decor are from Ireland shipped here. That's pretty personal and lovely in my book."

Staff is friendly, never have I ran into any issues with reservation or walk ins. If you want to sit outside I would recommend just calling in and making a reservation.   PET FRIENDLY! Same goes with my recommendation with a reservation, if you're bringing your pet just make one so they know where to seat you outdoors. Call before :)  The menu is great! I've tried a lot of different vegetarian/pescatarian options on the menu and haven't been disappointed. You have to try the pizza!   I don't drink alcohol so I can't review on that but from what I see and have heard it's really tasty.   I love going to lunch and dinner here, so much fun.

A guiness draught at any type of irish pub shouldn't go for $9 nor any bar for that matter in my opinion. All food and drink prices could be $1-2 less, especially if it's a limited outdoor menu. If we were dining in (and it's beautiful inside + full menu offered), I could see those prices being fair. If the drinks were to be $1-2 less in the future, we could see ourselves being regulars, but definitely not until then.  Two of our friends ordered the wagyu burger, when asked on how it compares to a non-wagyu burger, they said they wouldn't have noticed anything especially different to a regular burger in comparison if they had not read the menu.  Nonetheless, they seemed to enjoy it.   I would order the reuben sandwich again with the kimchi slaw. I thought the kimchi slaw was very creative and it added nice flavor contrast to the otherwise classical meaty cheesy aspects of the reuben. The kimchi by itself was good, they use older more fermented kimchi, which gave the sandwich a bit of sourness to it.   My wife ordered the fish n' chips, one of her favorite barfoods. The fish itself was very moist and tender and it appears much larger in portion size than what we were expecting when looking at other user's yelp photos. The chile-lime tartar sauce wasn't very 'chile-limey' at all, it tasted just like regular tartar sauce, don't get me wrong - we LOVE any tartar sauce, but they could dial up the chile and lime all the way to the moon if that's what they're advertising.   Lastly, the staff was nice, although our waitress basically dissappeared for the second half of our stay and kept forgetting/taking an unquestionably and questionably long time to get our drinks and takeout box. Service was just OK, there is always next time.   Bonus points for the restrooms, very neat, clean and well decorated."

The Fish and Chips  and Reuben Sandwich are delicious and portions generous. The craft beer is also the best (Huckleberry wheat).  Plus the place is filled with great atmosphere, and plenty of history. Our server (Jewels) pointed out the wall plaques located all along the restaurant filled with tidbits of information. This contributes to the experience. The music is great and staff friendly. A very happy place! We drove from South Austin to visit, definitely retuning soon!"

                "description": "This brand new brewery is the spot to be lately and I can understand why : great outdoor space and patio,the ambiance is both appropriate for a romantic date or a friends outing.  I had the charred vegetables which were delicious although the portion was quite small. The pepperoni pizza is cooked in a wood fire oven and was delicious. Overall, it was a good experience, my cons would be the service (organization still balbutiating and we waited 30 min for our drinks) and it's pricey for the size of the portions. $14 a cocktail is overpriced, but their craft beers were good."

The drinks were \"okay\". Not great, but not bad. The food was what was disappointing. I ordered the flaming bacon burger. The waitstaff that brought it over, said \"wait I have to light it on fire\", and she took off quickly without another word and before I could ask how long I was supposed to leave it lit- We had said we hadn't been there before, so it was all new.  So my entrée tasted like 151. It was gross. The fries were pretty generic, so they didn't make up for the burger debacle. Likely to return? Nah."

                "description": "5 stars for the atmosphere/design. 4 stars for the manager that tried to help correct some mistakes. 3 stars for our server that seemed to have pushed beyond her limit. 2 stars for a good looking menu that was greatly under-delivered. 1 star for the overall management and organization of the restaurant.   We had a group of 6 that was sat outside on patio. We ordered charcuterie, pretzels, wedge salad, hot wings and lemon pepper wings, a beer flight, the Carrie Bradshaw, the smoked margarita and a few standard mixed drinks.  After placing our order, we were brought 5 place settings for the 6 of us. We asked several times for the 6th set which was eventually delivered after all the food was gone. The servers keep saying that they didn't have any silverware or plates left!  ‍  Our drink orders rolled out so slow that we had to go to the bartender ourselves to make sure the order was ever placed. The manager came over to apologized which was very nice and professional.  The charcuterie was delivered without any explanation  of what everything was. It was a very odd mix of flavors from sweet to acidic that did not pair well.  The pretzels were by far everyone's favorite. But it was also served with no description of the 3 sauces. The thick white cream was actually an amazing garlic butter that we all devoured once we finally figure it out.  The wedge salad looked beautiful and was enough for all 6 of us to have some. I only thought it was weird that they covered it in ranch inside of blue cheese   Both flavors of hot wings were so salty that it ruined the rest of the flavors. The sizes were good though.  All of their beers except the ipa fell flat and not good. The mixed drinks were super yummy and I really enjoyed my Carrie Bradshaw.   The 6 of us were all in agreement that this place was such a sad waste. It looks so cool and could be really something great if they execute their food on a higher level and manage their staff/facility better.  We won't be back unless they can turn it around"

The outdoor games will be perfect for friends, parties and the kids. I know my toddler will love running around and playing and checking out the turtles in the creek down below.   The food was okay. We spent $80 at lunch with water. They desperately need a lunch menu!!! Please add a lunch so the locals can come enjoy the place during the week."

I started with a glass of caymus since it's $2 off for Happy Hour and although it's yummy as usual the tiny pour made me a little sad but I have to remember some people measure wine to the T. We also had the drink with Tito's and watermelon and the one with empress gin and rosemary, both were tasty and again $2 off for happy hour. For an appetizer we had the pretzels and the short ribs and both were prepared well. Finally our meal, I had the Cuban sandwich and my friend had the roasted vegetables, no complaints about either and I'd absolutely order the Cuban again. I'll definitely be back but may steer clear of wine due to tiny pours unless I get a bottle."

                "description": "We visited again this weekend, our third time since the opening, with another couple who was joining and had not yet been to CandB.  All of us commented how the atmosphere is lively and how we like the decor and that service is good.  But the consensus this time, as at our other visits is that the menu is somewhat disappointing.  The food is a cross between general bar food and a smattering of Irish pub dishes.  What we had was fine but a variety of true entrees is what's lacking.  Maybe more Irish fare would be good like shepherd's pie, corned beef and cabbage, smoked salmon, etc.?  The burgers and sandwiches are okay but just a few more options would be great."

The beer and cocktail selection is fantastic, too. I will have to update my review after we have the opportunity to eat indoors. After two visits, the outdoor menu (while great), was getting a bit redundant. Chicken wings, salads and pretzels all very good.   I believe they have more offerings inside, so again -- we'll try that as soon as possible.  Also: don't miss the restrooms! They are super cool. The women's room was inspired by the luxury restrooms on the Titanic, I believe!"

Their innovative twists on a classic dish was truly incredible from the first bite when the diversity of flavors exploded on my tastebuds. Also, the price was phenomenal for the amount you get. One small pizza was MORE than enough to fill me up and leave me beyond satisfied. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying all their specialty pizzas. If you're looking for something incredible and affordable, this restaurant is an absolute MUST. Innovative, fresh, affordable, and delicious; it can't get any better."

During Covid quarantine, I have been taking advantage of their online beer release ordering and curbside pickup. Yay! Really hope this \"new\" process doesn't change. I also discussed they sell their dough to go, so I've been getting more creative in my own kitchen making pretzels and other yummies.   What else can I say? Nothing really, except go...just go!

Pictured is The Works and it wasn't anything special in my opinion. But I will always go back!! For Honey Pear  Note: Happy hour is M-F from 4-6pm and its $2 off pints of PHP beer as well as $2 off beer mates (cheesy garlic bread). Only complaint is I drink beer too slowly so maybe next time I'll order 2 before happy hour ends ;)"

For example, my friend convinced me to try the honey pear pizza (I was suspicious but got it anyways), the tanginess of the pear with the sweetness of the honey and caramelized onion, with the saltiness of the prosciutto made it one of my all time favorites! Of course, they have \"regular\" pizzas as well, which were also quite delicious. PHP is also a brewery. I won't claim to be a beer connoisseur (it was good beer, that's all I can say), but the combination of beer and pizza here is amazing! Great laid back atmosphere with excellent pies."

My go-to has to be the honey pear, but I've tried most of the others and you can't go wrong. Three slices of the large pizza is sufficient to get me stuffed.   The inside seating is plentiful, yet the place is somehow always packed and very loud (think, so loud I have to shout to hear myself). But the hassles of dining in is still worth eating the pizza fresh and hot. You can ask for to go plates and forks for your party if you'd like to eat elsewhere. There is ample parking and employees are all kind."

Food is always hot and fresh, ready when I am and made to order. Wish they would include more beer cheese, but that's just cause I like it so much! Would love to come in for a pint and check out more of the menu and plan to do that soon. Staff are friendly and helpful. Overall a place I will frequent as much as possible when I'm in the mood for a good burger."

                "description": "Was there about 9 pm last night. My companion wanted a really good burger and Yelp gave us this place.   We were the only patrons eating at tables. There were a few guys at the bar. Since I wasn't really hungry, we decided to order their signature burger which is made with ground brisket and ground meat from short ribs. I asked for it to not be overcooked. We talked about the cooking temperature with the waitress and she assured us it would be cooked medium. When it came out it was more like well-done. Pretty dry meat and not all that tasty. The bun seemed like it was homemade and was good, as were all the veggies they put on it. Fries were nothing special.   We will be back and I will try their fish and chips.   Service was good and the prices for what we had were consistent with 2021 inflation prices. I am sure this would be the place to be when a soccer game was on.   Music playing on their sound system was very good too."

This definitely brought me back to my Navy days of Portsmouth and London Pub style fish and chips! Perfectly battered and fried with that nice light crunch when you bite into it. The buffalo cauliflower bites was a first time try for me also. All vegetables need too be made this way. Not too spicy but just right.  This was a takeout order and everything was still hot and crispy when I got home. Perfect spot for any occasion."

I came across the Fort Kenney Pub in Yelp and knew that the following Saturday would start with a fry up!  When we walked in, the staff were all super friendly and welcoming. It wasn't busy as it was still early but there was plenty of seating and the football could be seen from most of them.  The food was great and everything I had hoped for! I subbed black pudding for an extra sausage which our server was more than happy to do. The sausages were really delicious!  Really enjoyed spending my Saturday morning here eating a yummy breakfast. I would love to come back to try some of the other meals on the menu!"

I feel like they could have done better to give it a pub feel. It feels nothing like a pub which was disappointing.  I'm docking one star for the Pimm's Cup. It's made with that awful soda machine Minute Laud Lemonade. It was horrendous! That was all I could taste. Simple syrup and Minute Made Lemonade.  I also docked a star for the music. It was SO LOUD. My husband and I couldn't talk. Literally. Couldn't hear each other. We were starting to question whether we're hitting an age where we say things like \"the music is too loud\", but no. No no no. This was freaking ridiculous! They had a lady there playing it for an hour before she started what I think was a quiz or game. Music should add ambiance. This felt like we were sitting front row at a concert. It was insanity. To the point I'm totally okay removing a star because of it.  We'll probably go back for the food, but if we're in the mood for a cocktail, or conversation, it won't be high on our list."

Burger didn't come on pretzel bun like usual and meat was basically raw. Side salad was a generous portion but the cucumbers were moldy. Chicken Tika was awful. Looked like freezer bag pre cooked and seasoned chicken, dry and tasteless without the sauce. Rice was soggy mushy, clearly too much water in rice cooker when it was made. Bread that came with the tika had a yellow gel slime. Going to get people sick or worse serving up food like that.. When I called to let them know about the bad produce two different people took attitude with me about it, poor customer service. As someone that works in the food service industry I'm disappointed. Will not return or recommend to anyone."

Thus, we knew that crossing the proverbial pond was a must! This is how we found ourselves at Kenney Fort Pub. Can I just say, y'all, that what we had here was just what we needed? This is true English pub food, and it warmed the very cockles of our very recently frigid hearts!   Hubby went with the English Breakfast! As he was wolfing it down, he looked up at me with an actual sparkle in his eyes, and he said, \"Do you know what this reminds me of most recently, honey?\", and I said, \"Yep!\"! I knew right away that he was referring to that Irish Breakfast that he got at the military part of the airport in Shannon, Ireland, on the way to his too long deployment in Afghanistan in 2018! The picture that he sent me on WhatsApp of that breakfast in that airport is burned in my memory forever!   I went with the Sunday Roast, and it was bloody fantastic, as well! The picture tells the whole story! So good! Chris ate 3/4ths of it, which is our usual division of restaurant food, but I just loved everything about it! The horseradish sauce was MAGIC! I could bathe in it!   We ended with the Sticky Toffee Pudding, and damn, y'all! Just damn!  Bottom line: if you've never tasted either of these traditional plates across the pond, but you're the sort that likes little tastes of many things, both of these dishes will be RIGHT up your alley!   And, even if you're not down for little tastes of many things, you'll absolutely wax poetic about that pudding!   What a fantastic find!   p.s. Our server was Noah, and he was a gem!"

Everything was well seasoned. The kids fish and chips was great and my 5 year old ate it up.   I did not like the tikka masala. It was not creamy and felt heavy on the cumin. It was a smaller portion and not very much sauce. This was the only dish I didn't care for.     Also, when you pack up a to go order, please package the naan separate from thee sauce. It was packed together and the naan was all covered in the sauce that I didn't like so I didn't eat that either.    They need clearer instructions on what their pickup curbside process is. It was a little confusing but we just called and the man who answered brought our food out.  Maybe we were supposed to go get it inside?  I don't know.    I'm glad Kenney Fort Pub is in our neighborhood. I am sure  that we will be ordering curbside from them frequently."

                "description": "Can't believe I haven't written a review here yet.  I went out of my way to get here. Was so looking forward to eating real British food.   I was going to be out this way during my first vaccine shot at Dell Diamond.  It was around lunch that I arrived here.  Waited a short time until they opened. Yes, I was the first one there.  First stop was to the loo.  Yes, it was labeled Loo. Started off with an order of iced tea.  Sorry, Brits no hot tea on a hot day. I asked the server if I could possible try the Black pudding they serve with breakfast. Turns out the server was one of the owner. So I got a slice. Ordered up a Scottish Egg and a plate of Bangers and mash.  I have had Scottish eggs before. These were a bit different because they used British sausage.   British sausage is very much leaner than US sausage.  The sausage meat surrounding the soft boiled egg was denser.  And it was served with picalilli (British salsa).  Loved these starters. Next up the bangers and mash and a slice of black pudding. Had to try the black pudding first.  Trust me it is not a pudding but a blood, oatmeal, pork fat, spices sausage. Before you turn your nose up, try it. A little nibble and interesting flavor. Bigger bite and it was good, before I knew it I finished it off and wish I had more. The banger was a Cumberland made sausage.  Lean pork shoulder meat makes it different than US sausages. Once you get over the difference, It is really good. But the mash potatoes, oh wow. They add mustard and cheddar cheese to theirs. Next batch of mash, I plan on adding mustard to mine. Now if that isn't enough, Red Onion gravy.  Take a slice of sausage, dip into the mash and make sure you have the gravy on it.... Prefect bite. I keep thinking the next time I go, I will get the fish and chips. But as I am writing this, all I can think about is the Bangers and Mash."

The chips (fries), claimed to be triple fried for the ultimate crispy texture, were basically thick limp noodles. My next dish was just a soggy mess. I can't even remember was my third plate was, it was that underwhelming. I might try this again and sit at the restaurant.  The key might be eating it immediately, not in ten minutes."

                "description": "First time at Slab BBQ and it's already our go to bbq in the area. First, all meats are gluten free! Yay!!!! Second, their meats are delicious! I had the chicken and the brisket and both were really good , seasoned well and very moist - cooked to perfection. I couldn't finish my salad and took maybe half of it home. So, portion wise, this is also a win. My daughter had the 1/2 ribs and we were all taken by surprise on the flavor. Seriously, TRY their RIBS!!!  They have a selection of different sauces, including a strawberry one that came with the ribs. I was very skeptical at first, but it worked pretty well. However, their mustard based one is my favorite.  We can't wait to be back!"

                "description": "Great BBQ for an even greater price! I was really impressed with everything we tried, and for it all being just under $50, it was worth it. It's not your \"traditional\" BBQ stop - the menu is really fun and there are some pretty creative treats to try, from Texas-sized sandwiches to habanero strawberry glazed ribs. The meats were tender as could be, the flavor was incredible, and the sauces were amazing. Will definitely be visiting again!   Service: 5/5 Food: 5/5  Individual food ratings: - Habanero Strawberry Glazed ribs (5/5): sweet and spicy (but more sweet), these ribs were perfectly tender and had really great flavor! You can get them without the glaze, or get the glaze on the side. - Smoked Gouda Mac'n'cheese (4/5): pretty tasty mac, very cheesy and creamy, would be great with hot sauce or meat. - BBQ nachos w/brisket (5/5): super loaded, huge shareable portion, and great flavors! Add extra sauces on top to get saucy. - El Jefe sammie (5/5): brisket, onions, peppers, and Fritos for some crunch, this was a great sandwich and super filling! - Twice baked potato casserole (3/5): needed a kick or maybe some more salt/pepper, but was good overall with the dank white sauce on top."

The menu pretty easy to survey and food comes out quick fresh and hot! Those are the things I love quick fresh and hot. The prices are appropriate and the sides are reasonably priced. Also the baked beans was the business. Oh, yeah the nortorious BIG was delicious! It's topped with Cole slaw and piled with brisket very tender meat!   I love this place and it was a short drive from the hotel."

The pulled pork sandwich had very good flavor and the Mac and cheese was fabulous. They also serve beer which complements BBQ , IMHO. The service was courteous and prompt. The dining area was clean, though we opted to sit in their temporary outdoor seating area because it was a beautiful day. Check it out as an alternative fast food option."

The have 4 types of sauces, I sampled them all and my fav has to be the backyard red sauce. We ordered the Texas OG on a tortilla and the Tony Montana. The brisket was meaty and fatty. The Tony Montana could have had more queso on it for sure. We also tried the gouda Mac and cheese amd twice baked potato and it was creamy and pretty good. The potato was just ok according to my boyfriend. They are located in a strip mall with lots of parking."

We thoroughly enjoyed our meal! Our party of three started with the double meat bbq brisket nachos, then we shared 1/2 # of ribs, a Texas Tornado wrap with double brisket (absolutely LOVE their brisket) then added an extra large order of the smoked Gouda Mac and cheese, green bean casserole and finished up with a banana pudding .  Gotta say I haven't eaten such great bbq for years AND took home enough for another meal.  This is my new go-to for Austin BBQ! They have a nice selection of regular and craft beers as well.  Definitely a repeater!!"

The sliders, brisket nachos and chicken sandwich were all delicious. The max n cheese was good, it had a smoky flavor, like it was cooked on the grill. The potato salad didn't have any flavor but we just know not to order it, it was a side and not the star of the show like the meats. The music was great! If I lived here, I would definitely be here once a week! Great food and vibe!"

The line was long, but luckily I was able to head to the to-go desk and place my order fairly quickly...Brisket Nachos packaged with all the ingredients separated so as not to get soggy. They easily survived the drive home to Cedar Park and were super delicious and unique! Like a chopped brisket sandwich on tortilla chips with queso. Um, yes, please.  This barbecue place has a vibe like no other. The walls and music combine hip hop with classic Texas in a way I would not have dreamed possible, but it works. Pretty trendy spot. I really appreciated the clear partitions separating tables as a covid precaution."

                "description": "There were brisket nachos involved too but I only got a photo of the ribs as the nachos were halfway gone by then  they were excellent and a generous portion. The St. Louis ribs are some of the most tender I've had.  I wasn't a huge fan of the bbq sauce that came with the ribs but it's on the side and they have other sauces available as well- the one it came with was a little sweet for me. Planning on bringing my small rib aficionado this weekend after the pumpkin patch.  One complaint... the kids meal ribs says it comes with two.. TWO. Mine will be asking where the rest are if I ordered him a kids meal  they do have a great amount of meat on them but I have a 3 year old that eats like a teenager when he has ribs in front of him so these kids meals won't work for us  we will be getting a whole rack and I'll be lucky if *I* get to have two."

Right when you walk in, the smell hits you, and you know you've picked the right place.  Not only do they have great food, they have a bar with beer, several flat screen TVs and a nice-sized patio area. I had the BBQ nachos with extra queso and rib meat; it had jalapeños, diced onions and pickles and one of their signature bbq sauces drizzled on top. My meal was so amazing, and the portion size was enough to get full and still have half of the plate to take home(which is equally amazing after reheating in the oven)."

We knocked off a star bc some of the meat was dry, the smoked mac was very runny and the coleslaw wasn't too good but overall enjoyed our meal. We allotted more time here for lunch bc we assumed there'd be a lunch rush and orders would be slower if meats were being smoked throughout the day but our meal came out almost instantly so stuff was ready to go / could have contributed to some of the meat being dry....  * Slab slider trio - sliders of Notorious PIG, Texas OG and Chicken WA. Notorious was very good flavor and pulled pork was still nicely moist. The Texas OG was kind of a let down bc the brisket was dry and there wasn't a lot of sauce on the sandwich to keep it moist and flavorful. The chicken WA was actually pretty good and the chicken surprisingly stayed moist * El Jefe - hubby got this was and liked it.. the brisket wasn't as dried as it was on my Texas OG * Smoke gouda mac - I love macs and this was way too runny, wish the sauce was more creamy * Cole slaw - my hubby is a cole slaw snob and he thought this didn't really have enough flavor  They had outdoor seating so we got to people watch but it is in a strip mall, so not too much to see.  Woman at the counter was very nice and gave recos for us while we were ordering."

I've had Hitmaker on my radar for a while. I came through with a good friend close to closing hours on a weekend. We were stoked to try their flights, which was great to get a taste of everything. Their menu is limited at the moment, since they're pretty new. I didn't feel any sort of type of way towards any beers in particular, but I do love that they had a Belgian called Accidental Trappist. Their rye wit I love too. They tried to have a little bit of variety in their menu which I appreciated.  The brewery also smells new too. I love it. It's like the smell of a baby or a puppy. Weird. So let's move on. They have board games for all, clean restrooms and TVs. The seating options are endless. You can go outside and play outdoor brewery games or sit indoors at the bar or in their many picnic tables. Parking is also super easy, and the taproom is easy to locate with their brightly-lit sign (especially at night). I definitely see us coming back here more often, especially since our taptender was a sweet and informative man who was so kind to stay a little past brew hours to let us finish our conversation and beers. I will definitely be back for the exceptionally kind service and cozy brew times."

My plan was almost foiled again, but this time luck was on my side. Due to Covid-19 the hours online didn't match their actual hours so I got there an hour before they were actually set to open. I didn't want to wait around for an hour until opening time so I was going to head home. As I was leaving I happened to run into one of the workers (maybe an owner) and after explaining my dilemma he graciously agreed to let me in an hour early to enjoy their beer. I was delighted and thankful. I got a glass of the Summer Saison and the Hill Country Haze and enjoyed both. The service was great and the atmosphere was enjoyable."

The Google provided some excellent information: \"The co-owners started six of your favorite neighborhood bars/restaurants - MugShots, The Hideout Pub, Bender Bar and Grill, Pour House Pub, Violet Crown Social Club and Pour House Pints and Pies.\" Having been to a number of their locales I looked forward to having a few Hitmaker beers.  The bottom line their beers did not disappoint. My IPA was not excessively hoppy and had that typical fruity citrus flavor. Plus one stepped out of her comfort zone and went with their Kolsch offering. My tastebuds told me this was not a typical Kolch as it was pretty lite and could have masqueraded as a lite pale ale. A good summer beer.   The bartender on duty was very knowledgable and was eager to fully describe their offerings. The taproom is cozy, dimly lit, and cool. Perfect atmosphere for quaffing excellent brews on a hot summer day. Lastly, feel free to bring your mutts."

Pale ryeder and rye wit have a bit more flavor but still an easy drinking wonderful drink!  It'd be hard to stick with just one here, but if I did; I'd probably go with French Saison, wonderful taste and a bit stronger than the others.  Coconut Porter isn't the best porter I've had, but if it's cold outside this would be my drink at the brewery. Hill country Haze is an IPA I could drink, but I'm not an IPA fan.  Accidental Trappist is good.  I can't put my finger on it... you just have to try it.   The brown ale is a little heavier than most and I'd be tempted to grab it instead of the Porter.  They have some cans of wine and a cider too.  $2 tastes 6oz.  $4/5 16oz pours."

After hitting a farmers market and a flea market we decided to take the route less traveled home by watching the compass and staying off the major arteries. This is where Lady Luck showed us a sign that I almost can never resist,\"Tasting Room Open\", like a mosquito to a bug zapper ,I'm in!!   I have to say I really dug this place for a few reasons beyond the fresh beer selection. First is general layout,not to big or to small,its just right. Second is decor,simple,industrial,clean. The focus here is on their craft brews not a bunch of goofy crap on the walls. Third is noise, this place was chill. I was actually able to converse with my bride without the aid of ASL!   On to their craftwork, after meeting the very friendly barkeep we decided I'm a picky bastard and he had me try a few samples, all were very good. Landing with the Kolsh really hit the spot!!

You can do a 4 beer tasting flight and they have around 12 or more on tap.  You can buy beer to go in cans or they have growlers available and some cute merchandise.   Be aware the v neck tee shirts they have right now are cut pretty tight/narrow.    They have a nice back patio where you can eat and drink and bring your canine friends and sometimes have local craft vendors back there as well.   I really like their Coffee Kolsch beer!   You definitely need to walk next door  and check out Revolution Distillery - simply fantastic gin and cocktails with a free tasting of a few of their spirits.  Can't buy bottles of hard alcohol on Sundays but they were still open today (Sunday) and they are happy to serve you delicious cocktails!"

Such is the case with Last Stand. It's a good brewery. It's got old school Hill Country funkiness, as evidenced by their chicken shit bingo games (every 3rd Sunday!)  For better or worse, it's also just down the road from the behemoth that is Jester King. Hell, there's a great distillery 10 feet away! Last Stand's brews are good; this visit I had the Citra Smash, Simcoe Pale Ale and the Fuzzelicious. But I'd be lying if I said I wasn't thinking about Jester King with every sip."

Large beer garden with Chicken $**t bingo every 3rd Sunday of the month. That beer tho!  They focus more on the hoppy-side (love their CitraSmash); however, they also make great porters, stouts, and other seasonal brews including barley wine. A flight of 4 - 2oz pours will set you back 10$ if it's your first visit. Then, go for a full flight!  Light snacks available (pretzels, etc.) and food truck on-site at times.   Package available for sell and they also custom fill 16oz crowlers. Cans also available at ATX merchants (e.g., HEB).   Support local!   Family and Fido friendly. Cheers to the love of great beers!"

My 3/5 stars is due to the build your own pizza coming with cheese (which we don't and can't intake) so we spent $20 and weren't able to eat it. I'm hoping someone else ate it because it hurts my heart to think a cow gave her milk for nothing. We were told that we had to purchase another pizza. We decided it would be best to go elsewhere for food. My only advice is to inform the customer that the pizza comes with cheese automatically. We wouldn't have known otherwise.

                "description": "This was our second brewery on our beer tour, while in Austin. Small place, and not many beers on tap, but you can still find some good ones.  Their beers are listed on the wall on tap, and they also have them in the fridge if you want to take some bottles home.  They do flights, and of course that's what I did to be able to try more. The Coffee Porter was like drinking actual coffee.  Delicious!  I left this one for the end, after one sip since it ended up being my favorite. Imperial Oatmeal stout was just OK, in my opinion.  They also had it in Whisky Barrel Aged - same alcohol content but the barrel aged process always makes it taste stronger.  I wasn't loving these so didn't finish them.   Holiday Ale - was good, tasted just like it's name implies. The one that surprised me was the Smash Citra. I usually stay away from IPAs (too hoppy for me) but this was amazing!  I could have had a second one.  Service is hit or miss.  They were a bit slow preparing our flights.  One of the ladies was really nice and friendly, the other two people behind the counter, not so much.  You can enjoy your beers inside but the outside is really cute. Looks almost like a schoolyard with long wood tables, space to walk, and a cute colorful seating area near the exit.  Across from them there's Revolution (locally mad gin) and another brewery. So, this is a good place to \"park\" and enjoy a drinking day out with friends, without having to drive around for more.  3.5 stars"

                "description": "Came here after a stop at JK and this place was a pleasant little surprise!  Far less crowded than JK and the outdoor patio area was fantastic on a gorgeous spring day to just vegge out, hang w/friends, enjoy some brews, and play a mean game of cornhole!  Their beers were very hit or miss for me. I did the sampler and nothing really stood out, but none were undrinkable, just not really my style. If you like hoppy beers, then you will probably enjoy their selections more than I did. Their stout was ok, but in all fairness, probably not the best choice on a warm day as it was heavy.  I will say, what stole the show for me here was our little discovery of their Revolution Spirits barn. They were doing a free tasting of their gin and Cafecito coffee liqueur, both of which were absolutely awesome!  I really like the gin as the lavender in the batch we tasted was very prevalent. I am usually not a gin drinker, but the mix of this w/the hibiscus tea that they served was perfection! The Cafecito, however, was so mindblowingly good, I immediately dropped the $25 to purchase a bottle on-site! It is made w/Cuvee and packs a delightful, caffeinated, yet alcohol-y punch. I have paired it drizzled over some coconut, chocolate chip, almond vanilla ice cream, and it is what dreams are made of!  I probably would come back here in a few months to see if they have any different beers on their rotation and to restock on the spirits."

I will say that I need a session beer from them... something a little less on the alcohol would be good, but that's just my preference.  The location is just a few minutes down the street from Jester King (so if you're already out at JK, come give Last Stand a try!). They are located in a really cool business park. There's also a distillery a few doors down!  There is a couple of places to sit inside and a full outdoor area with seating (if you're allergic to hay, it might be an issue)."

The inside is rather small if the weather isn't good, you might want to come when you'd enjoy outside. It was easy to find in a business park area. Parking seemed limited . We brought our kids, it was an Overall good experience."

Usually I am running by it and we decided to finally stop in for a drink on a Saturday afternoon.  We decided to do a flight of a piece of the ciders so we could try them all. It was the perfect choice as we both had different opinions of what tasted good.   There are a few food options but we didn't eat here. They had a guy in the outdoor seating area that was cooking up some food on a grill.   Overall a cool chill place to grab some drinks and hang out inside or outside."

I like that the offerings keep expanding with ciders, coffee, snacks and there's special events held on premise too including one with baby goats. I also stop by for refills of SoCo ginger beer with the rotating seasonal flavors.  Check out Moontower and the personable staff will convert you into a repeat customer!"

                "description": "Do yourself a favor and stop by the Tasting Room at MoonTower Cider Co., over on Tillery Street, proudly brewing fine cider on the East Side.  I was fortunate enough to show up just after the room opened (2-9 five days a week) and the ambiance and mood was perfect for a cloudy day: French  jazz on the stereo, clean lines in the furniture and understated appointments and the well-informed and cider fan Anne-Claire behind the bar. She patiently walked me through ciders in general and expertly helped me understand one cider from the next from the \"core four\" and special tastings.  Dog-friendly and laid-back, this is the perfect place to escape from the mayhem of daily life and enjoy an artisanal brew made by the good folks right here in town. How artisanal? They brew their own mead.  Anne-Claire or others will be happy to recommend the cider for your palette and will speak to food pairings as well. All in all, a low-key, friendly no-pressure environment. There are no sales people here: there are artists happy to help you discover and share their fondness for cider.  Go."

You'll want to easy into this space, try every last thing they've made, and tell all your friends about it. Such a welcome break from all the overly loud, vibe-first, money-grab breweries popping up around Austin.

I asked if I could just pay for something so I can use the restroom. I was told the cheapest thing was an $18 shirt. Upon checking the menu online, I can see that that was a lie. I would have gladly paid for $12 nachos to eat but nope..the cheapest thing was the shirt. Gotta keep people from not using the bathroom.  I can understand the policy. But lying and turning away a transaction to hold a principle? It deserves a Yelp review."

                "description": "I would really like to give Abel's their 5 stars which they probably deserve but the Restaurant sits at the bottom of a hill. This is not ok when you're bringing in a bus loaded with passengers. Shell passengers at that (Shell has a zero tolerance for unsafe practices). Cars on every side of the street so a bus would have to unload in the street. Luckily for me this time Heaven was on our side by allowing us to get our buses up from the hill. Going down the driveway was just as challenge because we had to turn just right to make the turn to drop the passengers off at the door.  The OS came when we had to turn the buses just right to get out the drive and up the hill onto the street. What makes this even more dangerous are the pedestrians walking in front of the bus, to the side of the bus and in the back of the bus.  It takes a skilled driver (like myself) to be able to get out of the mess I was in. This was the perfect time of all the times I should told my clients dropping them at the door was unsafe. But there I went.  If I didn't position the bus just right getting up that hill a tow truck would have to be called to unstick me. That's what we call bottoming out the bus, when the axil is stuck on concrete enabling the bus to move.  Now my coworker trusted me and followed me right down that forsaken hill and tried to get up the hill as I did.  Now mind you, if we get the buses stuck it will take a tow truck at least 2 hrs to be dispatched and out to our location. It's cost $$$ for a bus pull out, the restaurant is located in a neighborhood so they would have to use an alternate to their homes, patrons inconvenienced, our passengers stomachs full they ready to go to get to their hotel. Shell most definitely will report us for an unsafe practice and we would have to answer for that unsafe practice....just a mess. Anyways, I got my bus out and the other bus as well. There was no bus parking not enough curb parking so we were unable to dine at the restaurant. I forgot about that so I change my rating to 1 star. J/k"

I have to say that I almost didn't go because of the reviews here, but my experience was totally different. And it was absolutely a 5 star experience.  Overall the Views are objectively great right off the water, the food has been very good both times - I had a really good Salmon dish most recently. But more importantly the waiter Rob has been incredibly kind and attentive - even offering Iced Tea \"to go\" both times.  I'd recommend you judge Abels for yourself and come to the restaurant -- I actually asked them about previous reviews and they did say they've been really shifting all of their service to be the best and that's what I've seen first hand.  I can't speak to how they were in the past, but today the experience is 5 stars!"

Although there was a wait for a table, Johnny, the BEST bartender/server EVER, found a couple of barstools and made room for us at the bar.  Johnny makes a GREAT host, and GREAT Bloody Mary!  World class. Perfect blend of spices with other ingredients.  I had the Texas burger (YUM) and my husband had Abel's Tex-Mex twist on a Philly steak sandwich. \"Absolutely delicious!\" The open air bar on the lake is a beautiful setting, the weather was perfect, multiple football games on big screens, and a great vibe.   Fabulous food, and not at all expensive.  But Johnny made our experience superb."

I used to come here frequently when I was new to Austin but I think my standards were lower and theirs were higher. First of all, it's a pain to get parking around here. Once you're parked, you're better off going to one of the neighboring establishments. The food is so mediocre and overpriced, and I've nearly tried it all. It's not bad, but I'd say it's on par with many chain \"bar and grill\" type of restaurants. The view of the lake is the only asset that draws crowds."

It was embarrassing for me because I picked the place. Thank God that my friends and I are pretty chill people, so we just rolled with it.  However the service was abysmal, the Mexican Martini was not drinkable, bathrooms were filthy and there was not a manager in sight the whole night. Well, at least not until we left and saw them all chatting on an unoccupied patio to the side of the restaurant. I guess it was socialization time while their servers are outside floundering. The girl who served us was seemingly taking care of the whole patio (although failing) and said it was her first week. Wild.   Two people from my party didn't get their meals until everyone else finished. We had to basically beg for our drinks. And the food was honestly 2 stars at best...  Only good thing about this place was the ambiance"

Abel's will be in my routine rotation from here on for dinner and drinks.   They have always had a strong kitchen for an affordable bar and grill - so much better than the place next door. Tonight, I was taken care of very well by two affable gents at the back bar, Stuart and Eric. Stuart told me I should try the blackened redfish. He shared it was a new rotating special. I was amazed how perfectly it was seasoned and cooked.  One of the best redfish dishes I have had in months. I immediately asked what I need to do to convince them to serve this on the regular menu. They said let our management know online so here it is.  I was texting friends about how good it was and that we need to come back soon. Please keep this dish on the menu - as often as possible - and give your chef a raise.    Another fun plus - Stuart and Eric know their sports. We had a fun smart conversation about all current sporting events.   Bottom line.  If you are a sports fan, go here. eat the redfish, ask for Stuart and Eric. drink, have fun and repeat. Also, brunch on Sundays for early fantasy games is another great call.   Five stars on this visit. See you soon."

                "description": "Sweet waitress. She was clearly slammed. That's not the issue here. Sweet potato fries were delivered to the wrong table by someone running food. Pancakes were burnt. Both out of her control. She got them both taken off rightfully so.  The BIG ISSUE was ours and two different tables cards were wrong up wrong, mixed up, and delivered to wrong tables. Our credit card went to someone else's table and we found it ourselves. Still not mad at that sweet girl at all for the record. Our tab came out cheaper and we signed it and got out. Forgive us of our sins. What was EXTREMELY CONCERNING is the manager approached my father IN THE BATHROOM and chased him out the front door. My father explained that a transaction was made and there was a signed document, end of story. Argue that with anyone especially when we were on the street walking to our car. What does the manager do? He THREATENED to call the cops! My husband, who paid the tab suggested to the manager that we go inside and talk privately. The manager proceeded to discuss this private matter  in front of customers IN THE PARKING LOT! Legally, we did nothing wrong. Transaction was made between the establishment and our family. Signed document. Off the property. Boom. If he would have came up to us and started with excuse me, we messed up, can we fix this please- would have been the start to a better approach. Chasing my father. Threatening to call the cops. Discussing in front of customers after we left. We could have sorted it out had he not been so aggressive. I was in the service industry for 8 years, he was 1000% out of line. The scenery is pretty nice though. One star fir that."

Came in with a few friends and sat for about 15 to 20 minutes, after waiting I had told the hostess that we hadn't been helped yet, she then said someone would be out shortly to help us. Waited there about another 10 minutes and still no help. They were not understaffed by any means, in fact there were people standing around doing nothing which was why I was so irritated. I had read the bad reviews and decided to dismiss them and try this place for myself, wouldn't recommend."

                "description": "Visited Odd Duck after months of waiting for a reservation, and was met with food and service that went above and beyond expectations. A local farm to table establishment with an elevated twist, I highly recommend Odd Duck as a go-to spot in Austin.   As many other Yelpers have surely noted, Odd Duck's menu is seasonal, so I'll spare you the details regarding the food I ate, as the menu has most likely changed. Feel free to sit back and trust your waiter's suggestions, as they are veterans of their craft.   One thing that I would like to commend Odd Duck on is their extreme attention to detail, which was immediately noticeable to me. From their unique plates and cutlery to the maintenance of their restrooms, this dining experience made it well worth the price point. Additionally, our waiter made it a point to clean our table throughout the meal, which was awesome.  5/5"

                "description": "1,000x yes, go eat here.  Odd Duck was a \"must eat at\" stop on a specially curated visit to Austin. It is a fun, quirky, farm to table, seasonal and special menu kind of place, with a lovely team of staff and cooks. A team running a dream.  We sat at the bar and our bartender/waitress was super friendly and attentive - we were chugging water since Austin heat is ridiculous compared to New York heat, so she kept us hydrated as we waited for our food. She helped us work through our order and recommended some items and how much food to order since the menu is set up in a specific way with some featured small and shared plates.   As each dish was served, the server explained the dish, which I loved. It made the experience that much better to know the unique aspects of each dish like where the ingredients came from or how to enjoy it best.  Everything was delicious, and yes, the rave reviews of the cornbread are totally accurate.  10/10 stars for sure"

                "description": "Pictures of menu on August 17, 2021. Reservations are strongly recommended as this place is quite popular (rightfully so though)! We picked the tomatoes, quail, and cornbread and everything was 10/10. I don't typically eat cornbread but theirs is MAGICAL and a must do! Their service was also A+, they were kind enough to mark the menu with vegetarian options, they even provided ways to alter some of their dishes to make them vegetarian (see photo). The French Toast dessert was also a delight. I'm a big fan of their rotating menus and will happily return to try more.   There is complimentary valet parking. You can also find street parking by the restaurant. They have happy hour 5-6pm daily with drink specials only."

                "description": "Odd Duck is an OG in ATX's food scene; I've known about it since undergrad (10+ years now!) but haven't had a chance to try it until I was in town recently for work.   Before local/farm2table was cool - Odd Duck was doing it. It still feels great to support local farmers and producers though.   The food here was OUTSTANDINGLY flavorful -- bringing it to that edge but showing finesse and balance. I also appreciate that they made vegetarian versions of certain dishes so there are some options for Vegs!   My only regret? Not coming here sooner!   The menu will be different when you visit, but we thoroughly enjoyed each dish! We had the:  *Redfish Ceviche (leche de tigre, persimmon, cucumber, potato chip) *Cajun Pork Rillette (apples, pickles, Sour Duck Market sourdough toast) *Dry-aged wagyu burger (pimento, BBQ sauce, beer battered onion ring) - like an EXPLOSION of flavor.  *Wagyu Sirloin Cap (beef fat papas bravas, soubise, green bean salsa verde)  *French Toast (Vanilla Ice Cream, Cajeta, Apple, Pecan, Brown Butter Cereal) - yes, we had French Toast for dessert! So good and I recall just a pinch of salt from keeping it from being overly sweet!"

                "description": "A gem in Austin for their authenticity and willingness to explore.   I loved dining at Odd Duck so much that I'd say it's now one of my favorite restaurants in Austin (first time was earlier this month). I'd go through all the dishes but that wouldn't be helpful because the menu changes seasonally (since they are a farm-to-table restaurant +1). First, I love that it's tapas styled (+1) because it means you get to try more dishes and nottt feel like you're over ordering!   What stands out to me about this restaurants is their sauces. The ones that I had with the heavier items (the red meat dishes) were rich and dimensional. Some of the flavors were unique because it had some aspects of familiar tastes mixed with ones that were foreign to me. I loved being able to try all the dishes because I knew I was tasting a unique dish that was created (or crafted) by a talented chef.   From a bar seat, I could tell that the servers and chef love what they're doing (trust me, it doesn't go unnoticed). I love knowing that my meal was made by people who are exploring, learning, and having fun! I honestly think it's hard to NOT want to support a restaurant like this..   Every foodie's must-try for sure."

She created customized menus for each person indicating what they could/could not eat and even came back with variations of dishes the chefs said they could do. The service here is excellent, as was the food.  Food is tapas style, so we were ordering tons of dishes for the table. Their menu changes frequently, so what you get really depends on when you go. Overall, we had a great time here and would love to come back!"

                "description": "Odd Duck is definitely a must-visit if you are in Austin!  This restaurant supports the local Austin community, so it is neat seeing the various sourced goods within the innovative dishes here. It started in a trailer but transformed into what it is today with its farm to table creations.  We found street parking luckily, which was right on Gibson Street W. I did notice there is a private parking lot with valet included in it. I highly recommend making reservations. I found my reservation about ~3 days prior to the date. There are bar top seatings and outdoor seatings available. It's great for dates, friends or family (more for adults).  FOOD: Cajun Pork Rillette (4/5; Apples, Pickles, Sour Duck Market Sourdough): The cajun pork rillette was decent but enhanced with the addition of the veggies. The pickled veggies brought life to the dish. It was my first time trying rillette though, which is pork meat that is submerged in fat then cooked at an extremely slow rate. Another important note was the sourdough (it was baked perfect).  Mushroom Chorizo Tostada (5/5; Squash and Pepita Butter, Radish, Pickled Onions): This tostada was something else! It is very unique, and I loved all of it (including the texture of the tostada). There are 3 pieces, but I ate 2/3. I could have ordered another one for myself. The squash and pepita butter had some flavor, which helped bring another part of the taste element into play. Nothing overpowered another.  Apple Salad (4/5; Smoked Squash, Lavender, Chevre, Black Pepper Pecans): This is a lighter dish. I am not a big fan of apples, but I can assure you that I ate them in this salad! Great flavors that burst in your mouth... even the black pepper pecans.   Wagyu Sirloin Cap (5/5; Papa Bravas, Soubise, Green Bean Salsa Verde): My date loved this. He is an all time meat-lover, and he raved about this. The wagyu was cooked perfectly at medium-rare. It easily became one of my top 5. I also have to mention the pickled veggies with the papa bravas because they were delicious. I did not try much of the soubise (white onion sauce), but it was not overpowering. It added a nice, subtle savory taste with the wagyu.   Service was great and attentive. Everything came out on time. Our drinks never touched bottom.  Would I come back!? Definitely!!! They change the menu pretty often too. I am a fan."

We were greeted immediately by the hosts and taken inside. The drinks were amazing. we ordered cornbread to go since we heard such amazing things but I wanted to try so many things on the menu and there were only 2 mouths to feed.   Unfortunately no duck egg for the dinner menu.  We got the wagyu beef which was slightly a bit more raw then I would have liked it.   Drinks were pretty good with the Cucumber Daze and a watermelon drink (can't recall it was one of their seasonal drinks)"

I had the pleasure of trying the ceviche, cornbread, scallop, and wagyu steak dishes here and each dish blew me away with the creative fusion of flavors.  The pacing that the food was brought out was perfect, leaving just enough time to digest and converse between bites. I honestly was expecting the place to be a bit fancier on the interior given the price point and exterior, however, the quirky decor meshed perfectly with the spirit of the restaurant.  Our server was very attentive and made sure that we were taken care of, and carefully explained each dish, and gave suggestions for the best way to consume them. My personal favorite was the ceviche - although it wasn't traditional, it was one of the best that I've had - the flavors were phenomenal! Please get this if they have a variation of it on the menu.  I'm so excited to come back here again as they change their menu every month so there is always something new to look forward to!"

The meat was stringy and hard, not at all what wagyu meat should be.The ceviche was a bite size with what looked and tasted like Lays barbecue potato chips. The worst experience in Austin. The lemon dessert was not tasty even for a dessert lover. It  was just like a bowl of sugar. The lemon cake was dry and the sorbet was just ok really no satisfaction. So disappointed because it had great reviews, but don't waist your money!I was so looking forward to supporting local restaurants especially farm to table, but after telling my waitress Rochelle that the wagyu was not great and seeing how she did not care makes me not want to try a different local restaurant tomorrow!"

After booking I was super excited to hear my colleague confirm that it was a great choice.   We sat at the bar as it was the only thing available a week out when I booked. We took our servers recommendations for the most part. We tried a little bit of everything. Staff was super friendly and even more knowledgeable about every dish. A random runner, manager, chef would deliver a plate and explain in great detail. Watching the cook work the live fire oven was fun and seeing the Waygu sirloin caps getting seared made the mouth water.   Sadly, I'm coming off COVID snd my taste wasn't there as I would have liked but my foodie friend said everything was a 10!"

We sat at the bar and the bartenders were so nice and even made us some special cocktails not on menu.   We had: -cast iron cornbread. Seriously the best corn bread I've ever had. That green chili was such a unique and pleasant touch and the butter was amazing. It was so moist and the salt bits at the bottom were heavenly.  -the pork loin was so tender. I've never had pork a medium or light pink and got a little scared but was reassured this is normal way to cook pork so it's not too dry. Wow I've had pork all wrong all these years. It was so good and the little touches like kimchi peach, the mushrooms and the mole sauce were all just amazing.  -panna cotta was so unique because it had a torched marshmallow on top, graham crackers, mint, and rose petals. So delicious and great \"light\" way to end dinner. There's always room for dessert no matter how full you are, right?   Make reservations especially if you want a sit down table and not bar top. Love this place, now on my list of recos."

                "description": "What a cool spot! We came here looking for a place with atmosphere, good drinks and good food and YES! This fit the bill!  We were seated at a bar-side table height space where we enjoyed the show of the busy kitchen- and it was a very interesting experience! If you are 2 and up to something different and into cooking: this is the one table for you!  So I posted a couple of pictures of the view of the kitchen... but here is the drink and food review!  We got 2 cocktails : The prickly pear margarita had a bitter after taste that I just had to work through (lol yes I finished it) and the other one was a (something in the bag) sweet and delicious vodka concoction: Reccommend! Then we got 2 appetizers the babaganoush and the nachos..: the babaganoush was green. It was interesting but... mostly tasted of a pea purée. It came with pickled squash that was sweet and delish and some pickled okra that was unexpectedly good! The bread was incredible. The best. The baba was different... Then we got the chicken nachos that were 4 very loaded and flavor nachos. They were very good- it was beautifully stewed or braised or whatever they did to the chicken was lovely! Lol. We were full after but had to had to taste this specialty I've cream we were privy to: an off the menu scoop of vanilla milk tea ice cream served with peach compote and brown butter cereal crunchies: our favorite part! Over all we had a great experience and the table by the kitchen offered us an intimate view of each dish as it was prepared and presented before being sent to the table!  What FUN!! Ask for this table! Apparently they take reservations and we just got lucky today  Enjoy."

                "description": "I wanted my final meal in Austin to be an amazing one, and I did not regret making giving Odd Duck that honor. The menu here rotates monthly with whatever ingredients that might be in season, and flavors are punchy and inventive. All the dishes I ordered were excellent, and I only regret that I could not have tried more  The restaurant itself has a few different seating configurations - you can sit at the bar and watch the chef's in action, or do individual tables.  The cast iron cornbread was an excellent starter with crunchy, caramelized edges and the leek butter gave it a bit of a fresh vegetal touch. The marinated cucumber and watermelon salad with fish sauce and cashews evokes Thai papaya salad flavors.  I really liked the delicacy of the fried whole quail, but especially the creamed corn sauce that came with it. The aged pork loin was stellar - it made pork taste like high quality beef, and all of the little garnishes topped off the dish, the black garlic pecan mole was so flavorful.  I had the Dewberry Lane cocktail, which was very smooth, but a little bit too sweet for me."

                "description": "Honestly I really wanted to write a positive review but instead I got very sick off the food tonight and still suffering. When I return this time ithis time it's different I believe the managers are different and is now owned by someone elsomeone else. They know they no longer make the drumsticks like before now they have dried up, comma bad bad dark meat of low quality, comma instead of the succulent white meat of chicken they normally do cook. They served me a very old salad it was horrible I didn't even get to taste it the tomatoes were rotten and smell it was were rotten and smelled you could tell the salad's been in a refrigerator for a long time period period the hamburger was a $22 hamburger small I took a picture so everyone could see a $22 hamburger with little fries. I'm not a glutton I just don't understand why someone would raise a hamburger that high I know that meat cost a lot these days, but but if it is small let it be an amazing tasting hamburger and his hamburger instead of dried up. To my shock I wasn't planning to write a negative review until I got home with a bad sickness my stomach is still hurting I don't know if it's what I ate or the chicken tasted funky. I don't think I can return back to this restaurant ever again I find it to be shocking that these people were very nice to me this time around  and didn't understand Why I felt bad after 35 to 45 minutes still feeling bad is still feeling  bad stomach aches..Hope this helps everyone out there who understands that if you're gonna pay over $50 for a meal it better be a good one instead of a  stomach ache!! New ownership but not in a good way!"

Plus it was very nice and clean which is a plus.  We were greeted nicely and made to sit at their patio table in next few minutes. Our server was very good as the water came out fast and after placing drinks order it came out quick too.   For food we ordered brussel sprouts and fried cornbread as appetizers. Brussel sprouts were usual but corn break was too sweet than usual. Than we had aglio Olio pasta without chicken and it came out okay. Though I liked their chicken pesto club.   All in all, it's a nice place to have drinks with big outdoor patio, good service and decent food."

They tried to seat us at a table that had yet to be cleaned. Then we waited 5 mins for anyone to come by the table once we were seated.  Despite placing our orders right away, we learned 30 mins in that there were still 10+ dinners ahead of us and it would be more time. Best thing of the night was the waitress offering to cancel our order and close out our tab with our drinks only.   Our previous visits were OK but never lived up to any of the reviews we've read."

                "description": "The overall quality of not only food but ingredients and recipes has declined drastically in recent months. The caesar salad dressing went from creamy and rich with anchovy, to a simple blend of olive oil and parmesan cheese. Brunch items consist primarily of store bought premade processed ingredients straight from HEB. Sitting outside long enough you will notice employees running back and forth with bags from the HEB next door as the restaurant runs short on supplies throughout the day. A simple stroll toward the bathroom provides a clear view of the pantry stocked primarily with Knorr mixes and highly processed precompiled ingredients. For example a $22 Eggs Benedict Entree consisted of store bought Thomas English Muffins, pre-packaged ice cold Parma Prosciutto, Ore-Ida frozen potato cubes, and \"hollandaise inspired\" Knorr Bearnaise sauce powdered mix (almost more powder than liquid sauce). The side of bacon I ordered was unmistakably signature Hormel fully cooked bacon drenched in liquid smoke and processed applewood flavoring. It is truly a disappointment to see a local staple that once emphasized farm to table ingredients transition to a business model that more closely resembles \"frozen food aisle to table.\""

The chicken was placed beside the greens. Probably slightly overpriced in comparison to other venues. The other food item, a chicken sandwich was good, although the choices in sandwiches was extremely limited. The bill was paid on the credit card reader with my tip of 20%. I asked for a printed receipt and saw that the 20% was calculated on the total bill which included the tax. I guess I was partially tipping the government. That practice is not acceptable nor is it standard. My suggestion would be that when you go, put in your tip manually."

We also got the charcuterie board and fried cornbread and really enjoyed those as well. I had the aglio olio for my main and it was tasty. The bread pudding for dessert was a great finish!

                "description": "A cute sorta tiki lounge. Want a micro staycation? If you allow your imagination to suspend disbelief, Anthem could be a tiki lounge on one of the islands of Hawaii...without the airfare to get there. The decor of longboards, hula girl jiggle figurines, and tiki torches can transport you for an hour or two to a tropical paradise.  The service was perfect! I unfortunately did not get the bartender's name, but he was prompt in greeting me, and offering to get me a drink to start my evening. My guy was parking the car so I ordered appetizers and drinks before HH ended. We had blood orange frozen margaritas which were delicious. We tried the fried cauliflower and some guacamole. Both had good sized portions and were tasty.  Another bartender checked on us as she walked by, which was great. I love when everyone works together to provide excellent service. There were two hosts at the door to greet people- they were both professional, warm, friendly, and prompt as well. Good job, Anthem in choosing excellent staff.  The decor was spot on. It felt upscale without the upscale prices. We sat at the bar, and the stools were comfortable enough to have a full meal if you were to choose to do so. Overall, the place was clean and spacious as well. Go check it out and let me know what you think. Aloha!"

He was super friendly and helpful and made us 2 Austin visitors feel right at home. Thankful for you!!!  Now, the food. The JFC Popcorn Chicken was FIRE. We ordered the honey sesame version that was sooooo tasty!!  The sweet potato waffle fries were a hit too, and so was the chips and guac.   We also had espresso martinis that were surprisingly without coffee beans but still tasted good!  Overall, we LOVED our experience here. Whether it was Christian's incredible service or the amazing food, everything about this place was a treat. Would love to come back next time we're in town!!!"

Both of our drinks were so delicious that we each got the others drink order for the second round.   The yummy fries were so so yummy.  I highly suggest.  The brisket wontons also were so great.   The place is super cute.  I would have much preferred to sit in the front more part of the restaurant with the bar. It's decorated so adorable and the booths are intimate and adorable.   The service was amazing. We had several different people waiting on our table so I'm not super sure how that worked out but it did.  It worked very well.  10/10 recommend.  Great place.   It was kinda hard to find parking tho."

                "description": "I was blown away by this place - Texasian?! I have never heard of that fusion before but I am so glad it exists. I wish this was everywhere!  A group of 9 of us came here for dinner and we were all so impressed with the food. The appetizers are where it's at . The yummy fries blew some of us away - WOW. The brisket rangoon was outstanding. And the miso mac daddy....c'mon.   I would say the appetizers were more star players than the entrees. Don't get me wrong, the entrees were delicious too but I can't get over the apps.  The service was good. Our waitress was attentive and checked on us frequently. However, she did tell us there was a 2 hour service limit....  The decor was very cool and the whole restaurant had mood lighting. We had reservations at 6:30 and it was pretty dead at that time but really picked up 30 minutes later. Once it was a full house the atmosphere became louder and more vibrant. Right on S. Congress, where the bars are, I didn't see many parking options.  Overall, I want to come back here. I want a texasian restaurant in my city immediately! For now, i will just have to recreate their menu on my own."

                "description": "LOVE LOVE LOVEEEEEE this cute gem! I can't believe it's tucked away on Rainey street. Street parking is hard to find unless you come on a weekend day. They have weekday happy hour which is basically only good for the drinks. Not many shareable food items on it. I'm so glad to have found this spot. The drinks were so great! These two drinks gave me the perfect buzzz. If you like fruity drinks try the Splash and EXSW (East by Southwest) hate the name but love the drink. We ordered the furikake fries which is the perfect comfort food and filling definitely big enough to share between 3-5 people! We also ordered the popcorn chicken, I personally did not like whatever coating/breading. Service was fast. I would definitely dine in again for weekend brunch or an early dinner."

                "description": "It's probably clear from other reviews that two of their best dishes are Brisket Rangoons and Miso Mac Daddy. However, don't sleep on the Nam Nom Noodle Salad! I almost never order salads from restaurants, but this one is worth it. It's the most flavorful salad I've ever had, and the balance of textures sends it over the top. Just as I was proofreading this post the manager came by to check that my meal was good. Their attention to detail keeps Anthem at the very top of my favorite restaurant list!"

I would recommend you order their fried shrimp and French fries. They have a bit of spice and come with cole slaw and dipping sauces! You get about 10-12 pieces and a ton of fries. It's enough for 2 people."

It is a savvy mix of Asian and Latin cuisine with a fun spin, and it's affordable. Don't sleep on the miso Mac daddy -- it's a combination of like Mac and cheese balls and sushi. Truly amazing. The fried tofu app was delicious as well. For entrees, my partner had the noodle salad (yum), and I had the vegan curry dog (comes on a pretzel bun), and you can't go wrong with either. Really, it seemed like you can't go wrong with anything you choose here. Staff are all young, welcoming, and friendly. Added bonus: GREAT happy hour and cocktail menu in general. I'd eat here weekly if we were local."

I'm just obsessed with all the sauces they used on the cauliflower.  The noodle salad was like the insides of a spring roll with hoisin/peanut sauce. Also, they were nice enough to split the salad for us."

I wish I had taken pictures of the food, but it was so good (and we were so hungry), that we completely forgot.   I was told you MUST get the brisket rangoons, and they did not disappoint! For the main course I got the Border Salad, which fed myself and my mom. Would definitely recommend. My husband got and loved the Hilo Chicken Sandwich with Furikake Fries (Furikake is a Japanese seasoning - mix of sesame seeds and dried seaweed).   Wish we lived in Texas, this place was fabulous! Great atmosphere, big screen TV's for sports, and an extensive drink menu as well"

Went here for Sunday brunch and it was much better than my expectation.  I highly recommend the JFC Chicken and Biscuits... it was to die for! My only complaint is that the brunch menu felt a little limited. There were only 4 entrees and 2 sides."

                "description": "Wow - so many amazing foods to try! So, we decided to try them all with the sharable appetizer platter called, The Cure! That was definitely the move - 4 of us shared The Cure, the Aloha Burger, and the Hilo Hawaiian Sandwich with 2 sides (Roasted Cauliflower w/ vegan thai green goddess dressing and the Sweet Potato Fries w/ truffle yuzu and miso aioli).  This was the PERFECT amount for the 4 of us to share. The staff even split the burger and sandwich in half for us without us even asking! We were also able to super easily split the bill evenly.  Our server was polite and attentive. The vibe of the restaurant was so fun and unique. We did have reservations for 8:45pm on Sunday night, however, I don't think we would have needed them because the restaurant was not very busy despite how delicious it was!  HOT TIPS: - definitely try the Brisket Rangoons and Hilo Hawaiian Sandwich!"

                "description": "SHISHITO PEPPER QUESO $7 - the queso was good but the shishito peppers did not add anything. Just think of it as good regular queso.  HAPA CHICKEN SANDWICH  $14 and HILO HAWAIIAN SANDWICH $17 - We got these two with an order of the sweet potato waffle fries and an order of FURIKAKE FRIES. Between the two sandwiches I liked the chicken one better. The hawaiian had a lot going on and frankly I think there was too much competition between all they ingredients for any one of them to stand out. Additionally I don't think it was worth $17. The chicken sandwich was simpler, but because of it I remember the chicken. Both types of fries were good. The Furikake didn't add anything to the regular fries.   PIÑA OLD FASHIONED - I never order old fashioneds, but everything else I wanted from the happy hour menu was unavailable. I was not disappointed. it had a tasty dried ginger and pineapple garnish which I munched on and the drink itself was both strong and delightful!  Note: The waitstaff here was not required to wear masks and therefore didn't."

Mai Tai cocktail is served in a Chinese vintage take out! ( so cool and Instagrammable ). The pineapple bread pudding is so good! Warm delicious and not overly sweet which is great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!!   Can we go back to our server!?  Dalton! It was a pleasure to be served by you on my birthday!

They capture a broad spectrum of tastes and styles of beer. The food is bar style, wings, fries, tots, sandwiches, etc.  nothing I ate was noteworthy. There is room for improvement on greeting and service times.  There was one person working the bar and another waitress floating but no one approached us so we got up and asked.  Then another gentleman came from the back to wait on us.  There were not enough people in this place for the service not to be swift and great. Especially when I bring a party of 8 that are all eating and drinking. Anyway it's a good stop for a quick bite and a beer if you're in the area.  Just not a place on my list to revisit."

                "description": "Growler USA is definitely one of my favorite places to go to for drinks and food. There's a fantastic selection of beer; with something like 100 taps, you're bound to find something you like, whether you want a sour, IPA, or stout. Most of them are Texas beers and the selection is always changing. If you're not feeling beer, there are plenty of other drinks too: sodas, kombucha, wine, cider, mead, etc. A huge plus for me about Growler USA is they have pours starting from 4oz -- perfect for flights and lightweights! -- to the typical 12/16oz, and of course they fill growlers.  There is also decent food that goes a bit beyond typical pub food and is of course more varied than a food truck at a brewery. I'm particularly fond of the tater tots and mac and cheese, but it looks like they've added some new items to the menu in the last couple of months.   Another great aspect of Growler USA is the incredible staff. There is one woman in particular - her name eludes me - but she is extremely knowledgeable about beer of all kinds and can give you some great suggestions based on what you're feeling (or even if you're trying to do a beer and food pairing)!  I believe there is also some kind of special every day of the week. I know Sundays are $1 off sours, happy hour all day (discount on all appetizers), and I believe the tapover beers are discounted as well. Plus they do special events like Beer 101 classes. For all these reasons, I think Growler USA is a great value overall and there really is something for every taste. I know I'm always learning and trying something new every time I come here, and it keeps me coming back!"

                "description": "Take advantage of the specials and this can be a very reasonable place to get a good beer. The extensive menu and regular Tap Takeovers encourage would-be cicerones to expand their palate.  Don't bother with an entree. Food is mostly overpriced and underwhelming, so maybe get a large appetizer to share with your party. The wings and tots are alright and I hear good things about the pretzels.  The staff is all pretty nice. The price point and atmosphere attract a slightly older crowd for a location so close to a university, so don't worry about this place being flooded with undergrads like myself most of the time."

I just walked with my wife and daughter for lunch.  We waited a few minutes to be seated, or told to seat ourselves - but were totally ignored.  Finally a guy at the bar told the bartender that we had been waiting a while and she said, loud enough for us to hear, \"I don't care, I'm busy.\"  The place was not remotely packed.    Terrible, and very rude, service by the bartender working today.  Candidly one of the worst experiences I've had, and we didn't even make it to a table.  We headed over to Torchy's for a great meal instead."

Every time I find myself in this establishment, I am off-put by the care shown to me by the staff, and how excruciatingly good the service always is. Also another thing that irks me is just how good the pretzel is. Why can't other tap rooms produce a pretzel of the quality of the Food Truck Bavarian Pretzel.  Also the price of beer during happy hours, Friday's, and Sundays is OUTRAGEOUS. $3 on select beers?? What is this? My friends fridge?? On top of this the incredible selection makes me red in the face with frustration, that like that special someone, keeps me coming back for more.   All and all this establishment is painfully well run and makes me smile."

There are TVs and good music playing. The staff were incredibly nice and helpful. The food selection is good and tastes good as well. We will definitely be back.

But they also offer samples before you commit to anything.  Didn't try food but it looked like typical pub fare from the menu.  Closes at midnight but kitchen closer to 11.  Free WiFi and about 5 TVs.  Main knock on this place is placement of TVs.  Almost 60% of the seats have no view of a TV.  If at bar you're sitting sideways to see and most high tops look out the window.  Will be back because I really liked the selection, but setup just seems pour for this type of bar."

                "description": "I still remember the first time we went there. It was on the slow end of Dirty Sixth, where the old Havana location was.   I recall it vividly because of an interesting Interaction I had with the bartender.  As I looked at the menu, I asked about the pastrami and he said, \"Its good. So good in fact, it's the second best in town, behind Pious Pizza.\"  I remember thinking how it was honest but cocky at the same time. Sure, you may not think it's the best, but you're sure your second best?  Well, he was right.  Fast forward to a cool, hazy night in 2022 at their South Lamar location. First of all, the building is immaculate, an intentional nod to their style and culture. I love it.  My wife had the prosciutto baguette, which was delicious. Although the bread almost stole the show on that one.  The kiddo had the chicken schnitzel and, man, who puts that much effort into a kids plate? Really tasty and well executed.  I, like always, went with old faithful, the pastrami sandwich. My old friend was as delicious as always, as it didn't disappoint. The bread was great but didn't come close to stealing the limelight.   I've always worried about Easy Tiger turning into one of those Austin brands (talking to you Torchy) that loses its way, and I'm sure some may feel that way, but the experience at South Lamar could've been back at that old Sixth Street basement.   Five stars, folks."

A big group of myself and a bunch of other girls had decided that Easy Tiger was the place we wanted to support this night! I was so excited because, like I said, this was a top place on my list of places to go!  We had called the day of to make sure they could accommodate a large group. They said yes. We let them know when we were coming that night and how many of us it would be. All good (we thought)!  Our group starts to arrive at Easy Tiger and we realize that they thought we were coming the next morning and not the time we had told them. Okay, no biggie, we can fix this. We had also been told that there were only two servers that night. You could tell they were overwhelmed. We had made it clear that we wanted to make it as easy as possible for our server since there were so many of us. We were told that they would be able to give us two long tables next to each other so our group would be at least semi close. This didn't happen. Again, whatever... It just kind of sucked.  Now on to food! Yay! Most of us were starving. I can't speak for everyone else but I decided on the Pretzel. It looked so good in the IG photos. When it came out (fast if I may say), it was cold and not soft :( The cheese and other sides it came with felt like they were just taken out of the freezer. Inedible. Sad Ashley.  I drank a Peach Mule that was A1!! That was the highlight of my time here!  Would definitely come back, sit at the bar, and maybe order something different. I'm sure this was just a case of miscommunication and I'm excited to give them a second chance!"

When their 6th street location closed I was so sad, but then like gremlins overnight they multiplied in the best of ways. Having an east austin, and south austin offering and more is such a boon.   We love their snacking/grazing boards. What millennial wouldn't? They're basically adult lunchables. Meats and cheeses and nuts and jams, oh my.   The pretzels and beer cheese are also legendary. But so much so that they sadly often run out of pretzels like they did for us the other day.   We love the use of covered and outdoor seating, especially in this time.   Wanting more substantial fare, they got you. The sausages, pastrami, the blt, all incredible. Really you can't go wrong. So, go!"

Location: upon arrival it looks like an outdoor situation but once you park your car around the back you slowly realize it's a indoor/outdoor vibe. Areas have great coverage from the sun and I love that they have fans as well as Heaters on the ceiling!   Food: The Food was Fan-Freaking-Tastic. I won't lie first glance at the menu I was ehh. Nevertheless I asked my waiter chandler what should I order he made wonderful recommendations.   The pretzel  10/10: crispy outside pillowy soft inside   The Cajun Chicken Sausage 10/10: that prefect snap you want from any sausage casing and the home made Chow-Chow was the prefect topping.   The breakfast potatoes  10/10 : It was like the par-boiled the pots then fried them    Brussels sprouts 8/10 : Great flavor just wanted them a little more tender   Our cocktails 8/10  We order 3 different kinds all three were just okay.   The dessert and bread too take home was also really good.   All in All I would definitely recommend stopping by."

Pog had very citrus-y flavors which I liked. I also got the pretzel which was decently sized. The dips were good for the pretzel.  The bad part... the service. We ordered three beers the first time around, which took around 15 minutes to arrive. The beers weren't really cold at this point. I am not sure how that would be possible but I expect it to be the waiting staff seemingly lounging around talking to each other doing nothing. We asked for the waitress and it took an additional 10 minutes for her to arrive. We then ordered more food and drinks which took additionally extremely long amounts of time. The kicker was that there were two other seated tables so the place was basically empty. I would really recommend going to the 7th location over this one, at least while the current waiting staff is still doing what they did when we went.   Food was alright. Service was shockingly bad."

                "description": "This is a joint review from me and my partner. We went on two separate occasions. I went with my coworkers on a Thursday for an outing/birthday. The place itself is cute. Allows dogs. Twinkling lates. Cornhole off to the side. Just a cute, trendy, Austin-like place. But the experience was lack luster. The food took very long. The establishment didn't own enough cups, so part of us had to share cups or just didn't have water. The food was mediocre, save the fries. In this kind of weather, you should be prepared for flies to constantly fly around and land on your food. The drinks are also weak and the time between them will sober you up.   My partner went a separate time. This time I had three things to eat: a strawberry and goat cheese salad, French toast bites, and ricotta toast to share. The salad was ok, but smelled absolutely rank. Even the vinaigrette smelled super off, and not in a heavy-in-vinegar kind of way. The goat cheese wasn't the best, and frankly you could see the indentation of the packaging. The French toast bites bad poor texture. You'd expect to use a slightly stale brioche but instead was a baguette style. It was not soaked enough in the egg mix before cooking for it to have a fluffy texture. Instead, it was hard and unenjoyable. A poor quality baguette instead of the nice ones at real boulangeries. The ricotta toast was the best part, but still wasn't that great. Texture was also off, like an overcooked steak that takes too much force to rip apart. Not only that, but the food took 1 hour to get here.  At the end, they took his card and forgot to return it for 30 minutes. Couldn't get a hold of the waiter and left very late due to him forgetting about us.  Twice have they been very disappointing! Don't recommend this place unless you just want to waste money on a company credit card or take your young mother-in-law that you hate."

We all shared a sourdough bread and wow it tasted so fresh and tasty! It was as if it was freshly baked (which I believe that's what they advertised) and it was more than enough to take home to enjoy for breakfast the next day. We also all shared the sausage sampler with the sauces that go with each sausage which I LOVED. Each of them had their own taste and they did an excellent job pairing them with the appropriate sauce.   As for my entrée, I ordered the prosciutto baguette which was quite huge! Very delightful, but I ended up not finishing it. Their bread portions are very generous.   Would love to come back!"

I really like the whole look of the restaurant (even though parts of it were under construction). We had a few drinks and really liked them. We decided to snack a bit and ordered the pretzel. My fiancee really enjoyed it! I thought it was good. The beer cheese was delicious!  I wish we had the stomach and time to stay for a meal since I thought the menu sounded tasty. I would love to stop by for brunch one day too."

                "description": "Easter Sunday and no reservations? No problem. My friends and I decided to check out the new South Austin location of Easy Tiger. It was my suggestion and, thankfully, everyone loved it!  We started with a cinnamon knot, a soft pretzel with mustard, and a round of mimosas. The pretzel was out of this world! Warm, with a light sprinkling of Kosher salt, a crispy exterior and the lightest, fluffiest interior EVER!  We got it with a nice whole grain mustard; cheese was an optional side. The cinnamon knot was pretzel dough in a different shape with a sprinkling of cinnamon (it was savory, not sweet). Good, too, but it wasn't warm, so it got overlooked as we focused on the warm pretzel. As you can see from my photos, we were overcome with hunger and I almost didn't get a picture of the pretzel at all! It was that good.  We moved on to the Grazing Board, a side salad, and avocado toast.  The grazing board was truly a show stopper. It included a blue cheese, guyere, and brie, Prosciutto, sweet red grapes, dark and white raisins, slices of sour dough and walnut cranberry bread, tiny, tiny gherkins, candied walnuts, apricots, whipped butter and other toppings. It was visually stunning, but equally delicious. The house salad had the best, giant croutons and a light, delicious dressing with fresh greens, cherry tomatoes, radish slices. The avocado toast was a thick slice of grilled sour dough topped with a generous mound of mashed avocado, cherry tomatoes, and thinly sliced radishes. Delicious!  The space at the S. Lamar location is very nice, bright and open. There are several outdoor seating areas, so no problem finding a spot to sit. There might be an issue finding parking, as the parking lot is small (and each parking space is tiny!)  I cannot wait to go back and try some other things on the menu as everything I saw coming out of the kitchen looked good. I want to try it all!"

                "description": "Long story short, the drinks were good but the food and service left a lot to be desired. I didn't drink much and I really only took a few sips from my friends beers and most were good. I'm not a beer enthusiast but I have nothing to complain about when it comes to the flavor of the drinks. The food was very underwhelming since it left a lot to be desired. The cinnamon twist was super dry and not very warm. It's like they left it out for a while and just gave it to us because even 10 seconds in the microwave would've made that cinnamon twist soft. The pretzel was a lot better since it was softer and the three dips that came with it were good with mustard being my favorite. However, neither felt fresh. It felt like both were sitting out for a while since a freshly baked pretzel would be much warmer and much softer.  Okay with all of the good or mediocre stuff out of the way, I just wanted to say that the service here was one of the worst I've had in a long time. My friends and I ordered some beers and it took 20 minutes for us to receive them. When we got them they didn't feel as cold as they should be which leads me to believe that they were poured earlier and forgotten there. I question how it takes 20 minutes to deliver the beers when we were one of three tables there and you simply need to pour the beers into a cup. Every time my friends ordered more drinks, there was usually a 20 minute delay before the drinks arrived. When we asked one of the waiters if he could get our waitress, she didn't come until 15 minutes later. There was no urgency in the servers and they were just hiding behind the divider chatting it up. Good service needs to be the waiters and waitresses coming to us instead of us searching for them. I've heard a lot of good things about Easy Tiger and I think I'll be going to 7th street Easy Tiger given how poor the service was here."

                "description": "What a gem on South Lamar! There are some business that have survived the pandemic, some that have folded, but there are very few that have creatively embraced it. Easy Tiger has gone beyond that where they started the business during the pandemic and built something absolutely majestic.   Drinks - Ofcourse the beer selection is amazing but the best part is that there is something for everyone. They have a great selection of wine and some really cool cocktails.   Food - This was a pleasant surprise. I have never heard my food snob wife utter the words \"This may be the best avocado toast I've ever had\" .. not just that the Brussels sprouts are a delight and the egg sandwich is really good too  Ambience - This is where they go from being great to phenomenal.. the outdoor area is a perfect setup and the best part is that they have a little kiddie park for the little ones. All this overlooking the green belt.. does/can it get any better?   One thing to add .. on a good day parking lot gets full very fast so plan accordingly!   A must must go for a nice sunny day or otherwise :)"

                "description": "I can't complain about the beer. The cinnamon twist I ordered was 1.5/10. It was hard and stale, and the temperature was lower than lukewarm. If they tried to reheat it even just a little bit, it probably would've been much better.   The service was absolutely appalling. We ordered beers, 1 for each person for 3 people total when we arrived. It took about 20 minutes for our beers to arrive, and it wasn't even busy. There were only 2 other tables at the time.   When they dropped off the beers, I asked if I could order another one. He told me he'd get the waitress for us, but she took another 15-20 min to come get our order. The whole time during the wait, I noticed that a decent amount of staff (4-6 people) were standing around chatting with each other in the back. The whole time they were chatting, we were waiting for our waitress to give her our next order of drinks.   TL;DR: Extremely inattentive staff, with very slow and poor service. Staff doesn't seem to care about the customers at all, and the cinnamon was stale."

                "description": "Easy Tiger is a pretty popular spot to come up when planning a trip to Austin, so we decided to see what all the hype was about! We visited as soon as we got to town, so we got a bit of a sampler lunch. The server informed us that their bakery was down so anything with their bread was off the menu for the day. This was a particular bummer because that also meant to pretzels which I'd heard a lot about! Regardless, we find some great bread-free options.   We settled on the kale salad, sausage platter, chicken schnitzel tenders, fries. The fried were amazing-- waffle cut and so crispy!! I am not a huge kale gal, but the kale salad was also amazing and made me feel better about the fries!  The sausage platter is a fun way to sample a few things, but the server dropped a couple pieces of the brat when bringing our platter and didn't acknowledge it or offer to replace them which was a bit awkward and disappointing (why I deducted a star). Overall, the brat was the least exciting option on the board so we just enjoyed the rest, but it wasn't ideal.   We also got a pitcher of one of their Austin pale ales which was a great light lunch pairing! Their beer menu is pretty expansive with both local and classic/safe options.   Parking was a bit tight because this spot is so popular! On a Saturday for lunch our wait was 20 minutes which was very reasonable. They also have a little park area for kids which is fun!"

First off, I love how you sit, order on your phone and the servers bring stuff out. Super efficient and felt safe during these COVID times.   Second, the outdoor seating is spacious and has a great view of the kids play area so you can keep an eye on them while you eat and drink.   Thirdly, the food is delicious! I got the seasonal pasta salad and fried Brussels sprouts and both were excellent.   And last but not least, the coffee is awesome! I'm from Seattle and have high coffee standards, and I just loved my cappuccino.   Thank you for offering a kid-friendly place for us to hang out!!"

                "description": "Solid choice for a beer garden. It's a bit off of the main street which makes it quieter, but it seems like they could have switched the building / beer garden with their parking lot and offered their guest a view too. Either ways, came here on a good weather Sunday and waited for around 30 mins which is OK, plenty of open seats but I suppose they were careful with Covid. Service itself was also a bit slow - you order via a QR code and your own phone, but the food itself took a bit to come out. We had a large pretzel, Bratwurst and a turkey sandwich. The pretzel was great, warm and soft. Sandwich was also good, with a nice brie, very filling. Could have had a bit more of a side with it than the couple of salad leaves. The bratwurst was also decent. We saw lots of people walking out with baguettes and the likes, so supposedly those are good and worth a try.  The beer selection is OK, assuming you're a fan of smaller breweries that do a ton of hoppy brews, nothing really Pilsener like in the selection."

                "description": "A beautiful fall evening in Austin deserved a patio visit. We sat upstairs and the view didn't disappoint. We just missed the sunset but the sky was still stunning.  We grabbed some menus and decided on drinks and a giant pretzel. We also got the charcuterie board. My friend got a margarita which is said was 4/10 on a scale of margs. I tasted it and to me it tasted like a melted frozen margarita. Way too sweet for my liking. I wanted a cab (wine of choice) which they didn't have...I got a Malbec which wasn't horrible but I prefer a good bold cab.  The pretzel was great as always and the charcuterie board was well laid out. Neither one of us like the almonds. They had some sort of oil on them. What I really was sad about was the jam. I was hoping for a fig jam but it was not. My first bite was not good at all. I even asked the waitress what it was...she very nicely called down to the kitchen on her little mic and found out that it was a strawberry ginger jam. Those two flavors do not go together in my personal opinion. The ginger was way too strong and over powering.  The cheeses on the cheese board from Antonelli's Cheese Shop were on point. The goat cheese with honey was great. The blue cheese was yum and the Gouda was \"Gouda\".  ba dum tss.   Overall- this place is a no brainer for a casual night with friends over a pretzel and a beautiful view."

                "description": "SHAKE IT TILL YOU MAKE IT!   After dinner last night we decided on going bar hopping. I really don't know the places to go so I trusted my brother and his girlfriend's opinions here. They wanted to show me the places where they have gone on dates and enjoyed.   Whiskers was one of the first stops we made after dinner. My brother told me that this bar had plenty of different rooms that you could go into. So we first walked around and went into each of the rooms before ordering some drinks.   Me being the smart 25 year old that I am decided for the evening since I had already had vodka at dinner I was going to only drink white liquor for the evening because I did not want to screw myself and be really hungry over when my parents got here the next day. (HAHA)!   I looked over the seasonal menu and decided on the Sage Advice drink! It had citrus juices in it as well as vodka. And it was spectacular. All of the flavors in this beverage complimented each other very well. It is definitely one of those drinks I would classify as dangerous. If you had a few of those you might be on the floor. It honestly tastes like juice. So one too many might lead to you not being able to walk. So just be warned.   The inside of the bar was decorated for christmas. They went all out. There were chandeliers at the bars and lights everywhere and even one big christmas tree all decorated in white lights.   It is definitely one of those bars that you need to check out next time you are in Austin. I have only seen it with the holiday decor, but I am sure they decorate it all out for other holidays as well!   The staff and service was great! Very quick and easy. It is a busy bar so you might have to wait a few minutes to get a bartenders attention. But it it all worth it at the end of the night!"

                "description": "An East Austin staple with an eclectic and quirky décor.  If you are looking for a quiet, stuffy cocktail bar, this place is not what you're looking for (at least on the weekends). I would characterize it as sort of a slightly dressed up dive bar with some very unique vibes. The interior has the feeling of an old wild west sort of saloon, crossed with an old cathedral, crossed with an old hunting lodge. Past patrons have written messages on the walls and it is interesting reading some of their musings while sipping on an old fashioned. The exterior bar is fairly standard, although there is a random bath tub located in the middle of the backyard area, which is another interesting quirk.  Generally, the cocktails here are quite good; sometimes they pre-make the cocktails in a larger batch, cutting down on the wait time a bit. My experience has generally been positive with the pre-made cocktails.  One downside here is that it is very popular and is therefore quite crowded much of the time. During the busiest hours on weekend nights, you can expect to encounter a line to get in and another line to get drinks. That said, if you're with the right company, a few minutes wait for cocktails is pretty tolerable.  If you are visiting Austin, this is one good spot to check out to experience the \"charm\" of the area. Additionally, being on 6th, this place is very walkable to other bars and makes for a great place to start or end the night."

It was a hot afternoon, and it got a bit uncomfortable inside (no a/c), but it would be an awesome place on a cool fall day (the four we have in Austin!). I tried the old fashioned first, having heard it was \"signature.\" It did not disappoint! My second drink was not as good (something to do with ambition in the name?), so I will stick to the old fashioned next time.   Also, I feel it's worth mentioning that I didn't feel any sort of discrimination. Having read some of the other reviews, I was a little nervous to visit as older than 30,  but I found no problems at all. I had no issues getting drinks. Only once did an employee act like a jerk because the inside bar was closed, but that wasn't readily apparent, and he got snippy that I was waiting there. He did it with others, too, though. I think everyone's experiences are valid, but my experience was not that this bar only caters to picture perfect 20-somethings."

Definitely recommend going after dark because the setting of the inside of the bar is part spooky/part western-y/part old-timey and kinda makes you feel like you could meet a vampire in the corner... but in a cool way! I have had many different drinks from their set menu but admittedly their bartenders know high quality cocktails on and off the menu so order your heart's wishes.   My most recent order: - Twisted Nerve - Fancy, not-too-sweet, and so refreshing on a warm day! - Whisler's Old Fashioned - Smooth and will put some hair on your chest.  Give this bar a shot! Or take a shot... No judgement here."

The tea + alcohol mix is the best thing that's ever been created. I can't have any thing else! If you're one of those people who say, \"I don't like *insert disdainful alcohol color of choice*\", trust me, you won't discriminate alcohol after coming to Whislers."

There's a burger truck outside that i must say is not bad at all. To top it off, they have a TUB out in the \"garden\" area. Always remember: what happens in the tub, stays in the tub! I'd give this place 10 stars if i could! It's a MUST if you're in the area!!"

Every person who visits me here in Austin leaves a fan!  They don't have casamigos and you definitely can not get a Vegas bomb! No beer on draft but there are 3 canned options (hans pils, fire eagle IPA, and a golden ale brewed specially for whislers by a local brewery.)   Sometimes it can take a little minute to get a drink but that's just life baby! I promise you the wait is worth it."

                "description": "Last night my wife and I made the mistake of going to another cocktail bar that wasn't Whislers. Big mistake. ~$30 and 45 unimpressive minutes later, we hightailed it over to East 6th.   First thing I noticed is that they nixed their dinky parking situation to make room for even more patio tables. Perfect. It's not like Whisler's really needed the space, but with the interior bar unmanned and COVID in the air, it's a welcome addition.  I'm always surprised when people say the cocktails here are unimpressive. I don't know where else they are drinking (in ATX at least), but I'd appreciate a clue-in. Whisler's does a damn fine job; we always drink too much here because we can't stop sipping on inventive and tasty cocktails.   Last night's outing had two standouts I'd like to highlight. First, the Drab Majesty. With rum, cachaça (a fermented sugarcane liquer), beet, raspberry and lime, the drink struck a sweet spot between sweet and savory, with some carribean flair to boot. Next, the Feel Good Hit of the Summer, mint julep-inspired with an attitude. Couching the bourbon inside a fruity melangerie of cantaloupe, apricot, lemon and lemongrass made for a supremely sippable summer drink - a sublime libation if I ever had one.   Last note; I love coming to Whisler's and walking out having tried multiple types of alcohol I never knew existed. It's always fun to learn a thing or two!"

                "description": "Must stop place for cocktails on 6th street. It's worth the drive to go on the east side. Great date night spot or to meet up with friends. Plenty of outdoor seating. I got this mezcal drink with turmeric and it was so good. I like the smoky taste of mezcal so I enjoyed it. Btw, if you like mezcal, don't forget to check out the \"secret\" mezcal only bar they have upstairs. The bartender will help you select one based on whether you wanna shoot or sip (definitely sip it) and your price point. It had cool music playing, there was incense going, and it had a whole hipster surfer tantric meditation vibe going. If you live in Austin or just visiting, go there for a drink or two."

To my surprise, I got a great drink without the waiting part. I had a twisted nerve which was fantastic. Not sweet, not dry, just really smooth. The other patron in my party had an old fashioned and said it was perfect!  The prices are great for how strong the drinks are. The music and energy were reminiscent of the speakeasies. I definitely recommend and will be visiting this establishment again to try some of the other drinks on the menu."

Great atmosphere, great service and great beers and I'm not a beer drinker. There is something for everybody.  When you visit a place like this your faith and hope in our country will be restored. The news and maybe even your own neighborhood/community could be negative or living in fear of what's to come, get out.. turn off the tv, hang around your fellow Americans and breathe in some good ol Texas Hill Country air! Does a body good. If that doesn't make your mouth water then stay home...   Food Trucks! Live Music! Veteran owned! Dog friendly!  Face friendly! Goof folks! Oh and beer!  Cheers!!! Merica!!"

What an awesome event with vendors selling all kinds of things, food trucks providing some delicious victuals, the Reed Meisters playing some great Polka music, and 12 Fox serving up some incredible beer. Without a doubt...12 Fox brews up some incredible beers. I really loved the Negro Sombrero. One of the best and smoothest beers I've enjoyed in a very long time."

The idea that this was founded by veterans and gives back to veterans is amazing.  The beer itself, I was personally disappointed in. It was too \"heavy\", if that makes sense. We tried 3 and one I enjoyed but didn't love. It seemed like they were heavier/stronger than they should've been. Plus a lot of \"froo-froo\" drinks such as mead, etc. made up half their offerings. I get that you need some for people that don't like beer but they had too many."

They have many of their own beers on tap (featured beers change often) and they also feature other local beer, wine, cider and mead.  It's a family (and dog) friendly establishment featuring an awesome tactical playground!  They have food trucks, live music events, and seasonal family fun events.  We are happy to have them in our \"neck of the woods\".  The owners are kind and always welcoming! We hope they stay around for a long time to come!  They have over 80 picnic tables spaced outside across the property, so you can pick any table that fits your style!  Clean restrooms! Free to use water and ice machine!  Changing table!  Rona Rules! Great place to have an outside birthday party or celebration!  The list goes on and on!!!  At at time when our local businesses are struggling to stay afloat, and many are threatened with permanent closure, we are happy to support local business!  12 Fox has gone above and beyond to give back to the community, help neighbors, and support other small businesses at a time in need."

Any of you who know me at all know my great penchant for craft beers, especially local, and I'm always up for a new brewery. So, turn left it was.  Parked in the large gravel lot. Walked up the trail to the building - HUGE kiddo playscape - I wanna slide! :) Very chill, nice place with a great patio and lots of other outdoor seating.   The proprietors/brewers are Army Combat Engineer veterans who learned about and found their love for beer while being stationed in Germany. Hence, they dozen lineup of Euro-styled offerings. They use single sourced malt and rainwater to create crisp, clean suds that aim to please. Of course there's hefe, pils, saison, dunkel...they also do a solid IPA.   Highly recommend! Really great folks, brewing their best, and serving one of the most outstanding charcuterie and cheese boards I've seen anywhere...no joke (and you might know that's also my \"thing\"). Go hang out in the Texas Hill Country, sip a cold one, get your snack on, and listen to live music on select nights. If a band isn't playing, some locals might start a impromptu jam session. What else could you ask for? Cheers!  Note: at time of last visit was informed they were going to have 2 food trucks on-site. Icing."

Instead we found a business observing no COVID safety precautions whatsoever other than a chalkboard a-frame asking patrons to stay 6 feet apart, a guideline which I seemed to be completely alone in observing. Not a single member of the staff was wearing a mask, nor were 95% of the clientele while ordering at the bar or moving around the establishment. No capacity controls were in place, and the place was generally indistinguishable from a pre-pandemic beer garden.   A ton of wasted potential here, it's a shame the business owners aren't interested in being responsible members of the community and taking basic safety precautions."

Don't think I could drink too much of it though because it is so sweet. There's a playground for kids so parents can hang out while their kids have some fun too, lots of times they have a live band or singer playing.

The beer was absolutely amazing.   The beer was absolutely incredible.  They seem to focus primarily on Belgian style beers, which is my absolute favorite, but they have some IPAs that will appeal to the hipsterist of hipsters as well.   We also tried the Cranberry Mead as well as their cider, which was crispy and dry that would appeal to any lager or Pilsner fan.   The outdoor area was expansive and, frankly, beautiful.   The staff were very friendly, accommodating, and genuinely excited to share their knowledge.  It was fun to get their perspective on what I should try.    One thing worth mentioning...that I have seen in comments:   The folks behind the bar don't wear masks.  The order process is 6 foot distances, so no big deal for me, but some may have a problem with this.  Although I feel we are being extremely careful with covid guidelines, for some reason, I felt perfectly safe here.  Overall, I was extremely impressed with the quality of the beer, the beauty of the grounds, and the charming staff. This place will be a regular haunt for us."

                "description": "I've been passing up some awesome food and beers for years.  Don't make the same mistake I did.  I Yelper plead with you!  I also learned two things I've been missing in pizza, too.  I've passed this place dozens of times.  It sits on the fringe of a west Austin neighborhood and several apartments/condos between them and 183.  I believe it is affiliated with a restaurant that has a place in Fort Worth, too, but I might be wrong.  What I'm sure of my first visit there was killer!  I'm planning on going back when I can eat and drink a whole day away!  They have a great outdoor area with plenty of umbrellas and we chose a table.  The server acknowledged us right away.  We QR'd the menu and by the time we'd made a choice of food our beers were on the table and cold (good pour on the Guinness, btw).    We ordered a pizza of our own:  Sausage, mushroom, green peppers and spicy marinara sauce.  Okay, first... You know how some chain pizzas you have the ingredients all coming off together leaving you with less than even a cheese pizza?  Not here.  Every thing is chopped into small pieces and spread evenly over the entire pizza.  Every bite comes with a mouthful of exactly what you ordered.  Second, put some of that marinara on a piece of canvas and I'd eat it.  The spices brought everything together.  We got wings too.  Golden Buffalo.  Perfect heat! Crispy.  Meaty. Those wings were gone so fast I was looking at other tables to see if someone had snatch a couple off our plate LOL  We were licking the hot sauce off the plate.  I'M DOUBLING THE ORDER NEXT TIME!  Great service, cool vibe, good food!  Did I get lucky or find bar food Nirvana?  I dunno.  I'm going to rock a five star and adjust as I need to, but I'm not going to deprive myself of another visit here for sure!!"

                "description": "Fun Neighborhood joint.  This feels like a place where you'd walk in and they'd say, \"Norm!\"...if that were your name and you were on an episode of Cheers.  The beer was deliciously cold served in a thick glass to keep it that way. The pizza was generously embellished with toppings, and the crust was above average. The service was timely and courteous. I really liked the outdoor patio. Part of it is covered with fans, and part was uncovered with tables with umbrellas. The only drawback is there's a lot of road noise. We sat at a table as far away from the road as possible, and it was acceptable noise-wise. When our world health situation is better, I hope to see all the tables filled with large groups of friends enjoying pints and pizzas. For now, come check it out with your close friends and/or significant other."

It was way more laid back then I expected (place is always popping outside!!) which was great, I'm not for the \"pay twice what it's worth because we are fancy pants\".  Everything was very reasonably priced, and freaking delicious! We tried a few of the drinks (I tried a few of the beers) and it's safe to say I left tipsy and happy! Can't wait to visit this place again and try some new pizzas and beer!"

                "description": "My friends like this place, but I don't see the draw. The pizza is mediocre. Fortunately tonight I discovered their sandwiches are good. I got the Pourboy, with Fries. Everyone else in our group who wanted food ended up being in a sandwich mood, so the Chicken Parm sandwich got good reviews from two of the guys. The fries were well-seasoned and looked promising, but were a little cold and soft. Other times I liked the Fried Pickle Chips, but could only eat a few pieces before they got overpowering. It's not like we'd eat that many pickles out of the jar in one sitting! I think the server mixed up my friend's beer order. The final blow to this spot is that their outdoor chairs are wildly uncomfortable. I even brought my own seat cushion the last few times I came! This time it saved my butt, but my back still hurts. I'd give Pour House a 3.5 but I'm in a generous mood so I'm rounding up."

This isn't even the first time this has happened. On another occasion, I saw a rat running out from the KITCHEN and into the parking lot. It was disgusting. The owners of this business need to have pest control come in so that their patrons can eat without worrying about rats, and so their kitchen staff doesn't have to cook with pests. I've worked in the service industry and know this is no ones fault but the owners. Do better by your employees and your customers and get rid of the rats."

                "description": "At first glance, the interior of Pour House looked a little un-maintained. But, then of course, Austin. Where everything is underground. I was excited about the local beer list, though the stout selection was a bit thin. I went with Redhorn, a coffee stout that was a little short on stoutness for me. But, the flavor was good.  We ordered three 8\" pizzas to share: El Supremo, Hawaiian, and a Veggie pizza, providing plenty for two adults and two children. The pizza was quite good, as in Austin-good. I couldn't put my finger on it, but there was something unique about the flavor.    Our server was very good, personable and informative. We ate a late lunch, during which a growing number of what appeared to be regulars gathered mostly around the bar. The location is a bit secluded from the rest of Austin. But, it's near the technology district, where I was working for the day.  Parking was a little confusing because we approached the building from a side where the entrance wasn't visible. It's a private parking lot with plenty of space. Outdoor seating is available. Highly recommended!"

The environment was chill and not too busy during lunch time so that was a plus for us because we needed to be back for training within the hour.  Three of us ordered the Cubano and it was so tasty! I definitely enjoyed the pickles and pork amongst other fine ingredients they packed on that pizza! One of guys ordered the regular pepperoni pizza and he said he liked it a lot. The crust and dough of the pizza was cooked perfectly thoroughly.  There salads were delicious and portioned perfectly. When you arrive the parking is all in the back area pretty much, and you enter through the patio area. They have signs for you and that guide you to entrance."

Unfortunately, Jollyville is busy so you have to speak loudly to each other but there's not a lot Pour House can do about that.  At first, our waiter seemed like he was going to be a lot of fun but we quickly realized he was all show and no action. He forgot to bring one of our drinks the first time around and then we very rarely saw him after that until he was ready for us to pay the bill. We had to find a different waiter to order a second round of margaritas.  The margaritas themselves we're nothing to get excited about and seemed like they had very little alcohol. We ordered two orders of the fried pickles, though, because those were great! (And even here we had to flag down our waiter to place a second order and get extra ranch dip).  We will go back because of the convenient location and nice patio but we will have our expectations set appropriately."

The Canadian bacon, all so good. Also got a pita bread house made bruschetta. Wow, is that good. Diced tomatoes, with small cubes of mozzarella, and fresh basil. Deliciand shareable. Again I had the cherry limeade drink. It's perfect. The whole meal was fantastic. The waiter we had was super nice. This place is packed. So get there early. It's loud inside, but they have a large patio, but tonight it was chilly. No heat lamps. Parking lot is tight too. Been here twice and I think I took the last parking spot both time UPDATE: I've never been here for brunch, so today is the day! Chicken and waffles it is! I find chicken and waffles such a Southern thing, and I can't get enough of it. If it's on the menu, I'm ordering it. Their waffles are amazing. It's two small waffles with pockets of like brown sugar maybe? They have some kind of crunch to it. I didn't even use syrup because they just had a great flavor already. Chicken is tender and juicy. And it's a big piece of chicken breast. Bartenders are so Southern with their \"yes ma'am\" and hospitality. I always had a drink in front of me and I was checked in to make sure everything was to my liking. Pour House on Jollyville Road is such a great place to go alone or with a group. Their patio is outstanding, service is Southern as Southern can get. Always had a great meal, an even better cocktail, and the service is hands down Southern and hospitable. You have a great team here, this is my go to place"

Picked up 2 pizzas for myself and office manager. Her first response was that it seemed to be frozen pizza. I agreed. Pepperroni was sliced so thin it was almost tranparent transparent. Sauce and crust definitely seemed directly from the frozen section. My large greek salad was equally disappointing - very much so.  Counter staff was very friendly and courteous though."

                "description": "Ordered a few pizzas over the weekend, and thoroughly enjoyed them!  If you like pizzas that are lighter and refreshing, then this is a place to try. My favorites were the Twisted Rita and Sweet Sow. The Shrooms to the Moon had some good umami to it -- it's the most flavorful, but a bit heavier than the first two. Also -- if you like pizza rolls, then I would definitely try the Rollin' Ronies.  I will definitely be ordering these again in the near future.  Note about ordering: I ordered online and picked up the food. I will say, however, that the order was not ready by the estimated time. Instead, you can wait for a text notification to pick up the order. I didn't know that, but now I do!"

It took over an hour to get our order. The brewery was having trivia night so maybe they were swamped with orders? Regardless, while the food tasted great, the portions (pizza and pizza rolls) were pricey for what we got. Paid over $50 for dinner (one salad, one small pizza, 3 very small pizza rolls and one dessert.)"

Our favorites are the Shrooms to the Moon (Mushrooms, Caramelized Onions, Sausage) and the Backdraft (Sausage, Pepperoni, Jalapeños) pizzas.   They are the perfect accompaniment to a pint of draft beer from whichever brewery is housing them at the moment. But if you're looking to just bring their pizza home, you can also order online ahead of time to skip that 20 min wait on site."

                "description": "Looking at recent Yelp reviews, I was nervous about how this place would turn out. BackDraft did NOT disappoint.   First off, where is it? There is conflicting info on Yelp and their website. I called ahead because going to the wrong pickup spot would turn me into a hangry rage. They did not answer the phone but the host breweries did. CONFIRMED: They are currently located at Celis brewery.   We ordered 2 pizzas for pickup on Grubhub on a Friday night. BackDraft and pepperoni. They were ready in about 30 minutes. CONFIRMED: The pizzas were AMAZING. Like... hands down some of the best pizza I've ever had. Their homemade sausage and humongous thin pepperoni slices were phenomenal.  I can't speak for anyone else's experiences recently. It sounds like delivery may be questionable? But as of April 2021, if you can drive to pick up a pie, this is the place you need to go."

                "description": "Oh man.  The pizza here is fire.    It's located right in front of 4th Tap Brewing Co-Op  which is a perfect pair.  We ordered their signature pizza, The Backdraft.  It's topped with House Made Spicy Sausage, Pepperoni, Fresh Jalapeños, but we also added mushrooms on ours.  It's a thin crust style pizza that is PACKED with flavor.  Our buddy ordered the Kale Yeah Caesar salad which he was very pleased with.  The guys that run this truck are really cool and definitely dedicated to their craft.  Backdraft Pizzeria is definitely up there on the short list of Austin's best pizza.  I'd be surprised if they didn't branch out and open up another location in the near future, especially in the downtown Austin area.  I would highly recommend giving them a visit and try their food.  How can you say no to a fantastic pizza and a frothy craft beer to go with it?"

                "description": "TLDR: BackDraft is back, and they're better than ev-VAH!  I'm a longtime fan of BackDraft, even once calling it 'the best pizza you can get off a truck'.  That's damning with faint praise, as this is some of the best pizza in all of Austin.    Back when I first tried them, the food truck was parked down on 360 near Bee Cave.  But now that both I and they have moved to the north quadrant of Austin, and they're attached to an excellent brewery to boot!  By far, my favorite is a slightly altered 'Shrooms to the Moon', which is a triple-whammy combo of homemade spicy sausage, mushrooms, and carmelized onion. If you look at the picture, you'll see that the crust has the  right amount of 'char' or 'leoparding' as some call it.   Whoever's doing the pizza-slinging at BackDraft knows their stuff. Get down here when they're open, grab a brewski, and you're in for one of the best lunch combos that Austin can serve up!  Some Tips:  1) I said 'best lunch', but be sure to check their hours before you come. I'm pretty sure they just do lunch Friday and Saturday.  Otherwise, they follow brewery peak hours and just do evenings.  2) Try the Shrooms to the Moon but ask them to hold the caramelized onions.  Without the onions, you get a spicier, hotter pizza which goes perfectly with a pale ale beer to wash it down.  You'll end up with a pizza-nirvana feeling of a warm glow in your tummy.  This place scores a 5 out of 5 on the 'CTJ Scale', as noted below.  5 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Jesus good. Would be OK passing away after finishing a plate here. 4 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Mary good. Would be OK being seen eating here by Mother Mary. 3 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Joseph good. Would be OK having a beer here with Jesus' Dad. 2 out of 5 stars: Come-to-the-Apostles good. Meh. Wouldn't have my last supper here. 1 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Nobody good. I wouldn't have my penultimate supper here, either."

But this pie from BackDraft pizza ARRIVED cold.  The fact that it was skimpy for the cost pretty much assured that there weren't going to be any leftovers. From one perspective; that could be a blessing. Because while it wasn't the worst pie I've eaten; it would easily place among the bottom three. Two stars is more generous than this deserves."

Prior to the pandemic a popular spot to catch bands on the outdoor stage, not too sure about the music situation right now. The Whip In is a corner beverage depot with a quality selection of craft wine and beer. If I may add, a very quality selection of wine and beer. If you want to expand your palette and try  a new craft beer or wine, def stop in. Very large selection of chilled rose, which I found impressive. The selection of beers by the glass is also impressive. This is a very cool spot to come in and meet friends, and grab a pint. The Whip In is also an Indian restaurant. The quality of the food is not a 5, but a 4. If you are looking for great Indian food there are better options, but the overall experience here and what it offers is above average and worth a visit."

First off, the draught board which is usually full up to 70+ was very scarce, so not sure what was going on there.  We ordered the chicken vindaloo and chicken shawarma. I was confused when our food came out for 2 reasons: 1) I wasn't expecting a wrap and fries for the shawarma- just was expecting rice since the menu didn't describe it as a wrap, but whatever - my bad 2) it came in takeout containers with only one set of silverware (plastic)  I went back inside to ask for another set and also asked if why (out of curiosity) the presentation had changed to takeout containers. I was told \"it's a covid thing\". I tried to explain nicely that I understood - but have only been in Austin since covid and have come every week or so since January, always with plates etc. She repeated, seeming annoyed with the question, that it was a covid thing, shoved me two mini plates and some silverware and walked away. Ok, cool!   I'm only giving a 3 because I have been here 6-7 times, always with a great experience. Tonight was a 1 star for service, but honestly food was below par as well. Leaving a sad customer :("

Most everything has changed. When I asked about NA beer options for my partner I got a curt \"No\" and the server left. The layout is much less cozy than it used to be, and sadly, I won't be going back."

                "description": "This might be one of the hardest reviews I've ever made. I have come to the Whip In for years (I still remember playing a show here when I was a kid in my father's band and having one of best and most interesting Indian fusion chicken fried steaks of my life) and always appreciated (and still do) what they're doing. But the prices are just getting too damn high.        As of the past week, every single beer on tap has risen by a price of roughly $3 on average; essentially the base price for any beer on tap STARTS at $8, and without a doubt that's the highest I've seen at any establisbment in Austin, and I have been to an uncountable number. I also had their $12.99 Kurma (also known as Korma in some resturaunts) and it was good, but more like a $8.99 Korma at Tejis as fas as quantity and depth of flavor goes.        Make no mistake, this is an indesputed historic establishment that's likely also struggling with COVID and I'll still support it, but seeing these changes is just disheartening and it's getting harder and harder for me to justify still stopping in on the weekend."

                "description": "Whip-In, what happened? I've lived down the street from this place for a year and have come at least once a week. It has steadily declined. Constant staff turnover, and the menu and beer selection has shrunk to basically half of what it was.   The food in particular is a shadow of what it used to be. Tonight, after finding out they didn't have any of the specials on the board, we ordered chips and queso and after bringing us one order, they brought us a second mistakenly? Both had stale chips and the queso was burnt. I asked for no cilantro in my dish due to an allergy and it was absolutely lousy with it. Tried to drown my sorrows with a beer and was served the wrong one.   Honestly, not sure what changed but this place isn't what it used to be. Hopefully it's just an off night, but I've thought that several times in the past few months and it's only become worse."

The beer selection for purchase might be my favorite in town that I have found so far. They carry my two favorite breweries which aren't found many places and then have a multitude of beers on tap, too! I love the tarot card feel at each of the booths and then the perfect little patio outside.  Dog friendly, live music when the world is allowed to sing again, and Indian food? You would never know.... we brought some friends here recently and quite honestly... this might be my new little \"let me take you to a local spot we love.....\" for our guests. Go. Have a beer. Buy some to take home.... and definitely get some garlic naan."

I ordered a chicken tikka masala curry along with two beers - Belgian ale and a wheat. The CTM was a decent size and quality for the $12 tag. I'll definitely come back again to relax with friends and my doggo in the future. I thought the fridges in the back full of beer was pretty cool.  TLDR - decent food and draft beer selection - bunch of freezers with lots of beers and shelves of wines - cool music - had one TV inside from what I could see"

                "description": "Such a funky place with great food! Minus the rancid smell of bathroom near the bar, this restaurant/bar/music venue/convenience store has got a great atmosphere.   I ordered the bhindi (okra), and loved how tomato-y it was. Okra at indian restaurants is my go-to, since I am fan of its texture and all the spices typically used. Whip In did not disappoint; however, I am sure this dish may not be for everyone. If you like the idea of an uber savory, tomato-paste-based okra dish with lots of Indian spices, this is the dish for you. Finally, the okra texture was quite stiff because I suspect they used a rather dry/old part of the plant. :/   The rest of our party ordered chicken vindaloo, and they also enjoyed their dishes. I found the vinaigrette-cabbage side to be moldy, but D. did not think so.   Minusing a couple stars because Whip In seems to skimp on using fresh ingredients. I can see myself coming back here though, since I do love Indian food and live music."

The outside patio \"pre-COVID\" had lots of games for guest to play. There's enough TV's to watch sports from anywhere you're sitting. I recommend ordering the fried chicken and homemade mash potatoes. I think it's their most popular dish. The dish is fried to the perfect level of crisp, and it's very juicy!  I also like their salmon!  As far as the drinks, if I'm not ordering my usual Austin Eastcider, I'm getting their jalapeño margarita! One of the best in town!   The vibes are always good here."

They have indoor seating and half outdoor seating (it's \"outside\" of the restaurant but still covered on all sides - great for when it's cold out!   It's a cool bar with live music and games but my favorite part is the food!   We got the cheese fondue that came with a bowl of pretzels and it was nothing I expected at all - pretzels are okay at best usually and most places has cheese that taste gross but this was the best pretzel/cheese combo I've ever had!! The pretzel balls were pretty big in size from what I was expecting, they were warm and perfectly seasoned and delicious! And then the cheese - wow I could literally drink a jar of it if I wasn't my age and getting heartburn everyday as is. I haven't stopped thinking about the pretzels and cheese since my first bite! I definitely want to go back to Austin just for this dish.   And then for entree my boyfriend and I split the butternut lasagna and they were so nice enough to split the dish for us without us having to ask.   Oh yeah and for drinks (I forgot to take a pic) but we got the Smashed Irishman and it was so good we ordered 5 through out dinner.   The staff was really nice and the place was super busy so some things took a little longer to come out and we were forewarned before ordering anyway."

I was happy to see CD had an Austin location!  We came on a week night and it was still pretty crowded. Wait time was about 30 minutes, so that gave us some time to walk around and do some window shopping at the Domain. Once we were seated, we put it our order right away.  Pretzels and Fondue: The softest pretzels!!! Perfect for dipping in the provolone cheese sauce. We actually got 2 rounds of these as they were that good.  El Matador: tequila, elderflower, ginger agave, and orange bitters. This is my favorite drink here. Has enough of a fruit taste without being overly sweet. And the bartender made it with a lot of love. Lol. Only 2 drinks and I was finished for the night.  Our server was really great and kept checking on us throughout the night. Fun crowd. Fun music. And a really fun time."

Brussel Sprouts (3/5): not crispy like I expected it to be but the flavor was solid and unique.  Salad (4/5): they made kale taste good. that's impressive!   36-hour Pork Ribs (3/5): very sauce-y and therefore, very messy. At least the flavor was decent. The ribs itself were are not very tender.   Steak Frites (3.5/5): not bad but also not great. The salad on the side was great tho.   Korean BBQ Skirt Steak (4/5): lots of flavorrrr. Better than the Steak Frites. The meats on these two dishes actually tasted the same but this one had sauce. I actually liked this main the most out of the ones that we tried!   Overall, chill spot for a nice dinner with friends. I would rate this place a 3/5 for the food but probably bump it up because of the ambiance. There's lots of space and a few games to play so the vibes probably make up for the food."

We tried the burgers, the pork nachos, the salmon, and the kale salad. The Kale salad was incredible. I would have given a higher rating accept that it seemed our waiter forgot about us and we waited over 45 minutes for our food and appetizer. Otherwise, I think it is worth a try and the whole area of downtown Austin is great for kids."

Could not really taste the gochujang flavor, not spicy at all. Kurobuta Pork Ribs - My favorite, good flavor. Would have preferred more fries though. Spicy Vegan Curry - My daughter's choice, I guess it was good, but not something I would have ordered. Had a hint of lemon grass after taste, which is a little different from Indian or Thai Curry. Separated rice versus rice combined in the sauce is also preferred, so we can control the flavor.  Atmosphere - This is a very good spot. I like both the indoor and outdoor space. There were a few activities (cornhole, etc) for the guests. I like the choices of seating - regular tables, high top tables, bar seating, couches, etc. Additionally, your huge wrap around bar was nice. Lastly, I am always a fan of an open kitchen concept.  Service - Julia did a good job; she came back and refilled our water often. It was really busy and the entire team seemed to be working hard. I also noticed 2 employees picking up garbage as they walked back and forth serving customers, this is always a positive plus.  Price - $49.80 + tip  Owner Suggestion - Seems like you are very successful, owning quite a few restaurants. Congrats on all your success, and wish you many more. I look forward to trying your other restaurants in the future."

It was busy but there wasn't a wait if we wanted to sit outside. I was concerned because of how cold it was outside, but they assured us that the heating lamps outside kept it pretty comfortable so we could check and feel it out if we wanted. They were correct; between the heat lamps and the heated seating (amazing!), we faired well.   Our server was very helpful and knowledgeable of the menu. He recommended his favorites to us and we took him up on them. I ordered the Spicy Korean Skirt Steak and my husband ordered the Prime Rib sandwich. They were both absolutely delicious. Like finger-licking good. I seriously can't wait to go back. I also love that they have a kids menu and are more than willing to bring the kids food out first if you ask! We will be returning to try the ribs soon!"

To my husband and my luck there were 2 seats open.  It was Sunday around 2ish and there was a guy singing with his guitar.  The speakers were amazing you can hear him inside and out on the patio.  Friendly staff. The food was so good. My husband and I are some carnivores but today we both ordered vegetarian options  Don't let that fool you. Both dishes were packed with flavor. My favorite was the vegetarian spicy curry. Holy cow was it good. So good. Would definitely visit again!!"

The restaurant is large and has plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. I arrived at around 5:45 on a weekday and did not have to wait to be seated.   I ordered the Fried Chicken and Between You and Me to drink. Both were delicious and definitely recommended. The portion sizes are large enough that I had leftovers. My friend ordered the Monkey Bread for dessert. It smelled delicious (and according to him tasted delicious) but I was too full for even another bite."

                "description": "The food at Culinary Drop Out never disappoints. Brunch or dinner, they have great options. I especially love the build your own charcuterie option. I recently went for brunch and we had cheeses, meat, and Brussels sprouts on ours. The Gochujang sauce on the Brussels is amazing. It's sweet and a little spicy. I could have eaten a whole order to myself, they were that good. I also loved the Wellness Retreat cocktail. It has a slight spice and it's a change up from just getting a mimosa."

This is a great place for large groups. More bar than restaurant.   Cocktails were tasty and reasonably priced. Large selection of beer on tap. The menu is a little thin, and our brunch items weren't anything special.   Service was top notch. We'd come back for happy hour, but probably not for a meal."

                "description": "We had been trying to get here for a while and we're excited to finally make it in. Unfortunately, we probably won't be returning.   Food: We ordered the pretzel fondue, the breakfast sandwich, the breakfast burrito, and the hash.   The pretzel fondue was 'meh' at best. The bread that came with it didn't really have that pretzel texture and very little salt. Provolone cheese is a pretty light tasty cheese so it didn't taste great as a fondue.   The other food items were great but all came out lukewarm or cold. Which, relates to the...  Service: It took a long time for the food to come out and my guess is that's why it was cold. Because it has taken so long to get there, we were too hungry to send it back.   The server was forgetful and/ or missed the details. For example, we had to ask three times for a bowl for the dog. Many servers just bring one out automatically when they see a doggo but, even if they don't, it doesn't take three reminders.   Overall, service was slow and not, well, service-oriented. For example, my friend and I both had coffee and my friend asked for a refill. The waitress stepped away and I assumed she was getting the pot for a refill. Nope. She came back with a new cup for my friend and took off. So, I'm sitting there looking at my bear empty cup. As someone who was a server for many years, it seems so obvious to me that you should ask the other person if they'd like coffee as well especially when it's near empty. That's just one example of the just miss when it comes to great service.   Other details: - The ambiance and big open patio was great which *may* pull me back for a drink or something. Then again, you can get the same at other places in the domain.  - They didn't offer corn tortillas which I feel is really strange. My friend has celiac's and can't do gluten but corn tortillas are fine. Since they didn't have corn tortillas (or a gluten free bread option) it limited her options significantly. Granted, they said they could do lettuce wraps but let's not pretend like that's the same.   I don't think I'll be returning to Culinary Dropout."

They had one vegan option - the spicy vegan curry which tasted like Thai curry. It was pretty yummy but the portion was not super filling for the price in my opinion, so my only wish is that there was more! Overall solid place for vegans and non vegans to enjoy a meal in the domain!"

Jarrod, the bartender, and Sam, the waitress made us feel at home and I made what was it looking like a pretty bleak Christmas Eve into a wonderful party night. Between the two of them, awesome awesome is the only word that I can use to describe the feeling of hospitality on Christmas Eve, it saved our night and made us loyal customers of crown and anchor whenever we will layover in Austin or visit.  Bravo and Cheers to Jarrod and Sam. We will be back whenever possible! Thank you!"

We finally decided on a random Tuesday to pop in after work and we're kicking ourselves for waiting so long! This place was so great! They have QR code menus on each table for both food, and beer, and they were so user-friendly, and easy to navigate. The tables are spaced out, and there's seating on the front deck, under the cover on the patio, and some inside as well. The staff was seriously THE friendliest we have encountered in Austin, especially during COVID times. They checked on us regularly, and basically made it so we never had to go in and order anything, because they were SO on it! They are amazingly, over the top, dog friendly!!! It's one of the few spots we can sit under cover with our dog, they have tons of water bowls, free snacks, and they even brought him out a very special snack from the kitchen! They gave him lots of love, and were happy to have him there.  We ordered cheeseburger baskets with fries and they were so delicious! The portions were huge, but the burgers weren't so fat you couldn't handle them semi-gracefully. They were loaded with melting cheese, and the smoked bacon was amazing. There was an abundance of toppings, and a huge pile of perfectly crisped fries. The beer selection and HH is just awesome, we have zero complaints at all! We'll definitely become more regular patrons here, and I highly recommend going out of your way, giving them a chance, and checking out this perfect neighborhood bar!"

My fiancé is that obnoxious person who walks into a room and immediately tells everyone we're from out of town. Maybe that attributed to the friendliness but I won't complain.  We were trying to see as much of Austin as we could in one day, but if we had more time we would have stayed for a few more beers. Great patio too.  I can imagine this place being a complete cluster during football season. My alma mater plays Texas in 2025 and we may need to be here to find out :)"

Basic wooden tables, a nice porch, 3 dart boards and 2 pool tables. You dont have to pay for darts, but you need collateral. They always have a great selection of beer, also they always have a nice deal on some type of beer they're trying to get rid of. Your dollar will go far at this place, especially during happy hour.  In terms of atmosphere, its no frills. Its great for big groups and small groups and hanging out. The porch is enclosed with screens but it is a little hot in the summer. Its great in the fall and spring though.  In terms of food, nothing is really stand out. But, it isnt bad either. Their burger is like the perfect backyard barbecue dad burger. Their fries are pretty good too but there jot artisanal. The cheese fries have a healthy amount of cheese. The nachos are fine too. The prices are a little high compared to the drinks. But, they're not unreasonable.  A lot of researchers at the university have happy hours here, so it gets busy on fridays especially during the semester. People from the neighborhood come too so theres always a crowd. That being said, youll usually be able to get a dart board or a pool table if you want it."

Look no further than the Crown and Anchor pub.   If you're looking for an expansive beer menu, they have it. Just about any craft beer you can think of is available.   If you're looking for great atmosphere, they own it. The owner Derven has been operating the place for 25 year and is a true Austinite. He has played gigs with many of the areas legendary musicians back the 80s. You can find him at the register most days haggling regulars and slinging beers.   Food? The food menu has the essentials and is affordable and tasty. It has enough options to satisfy just about anybody including a vegetarian or vegan and the food is always great and reasonably priced.   What else? Pool tables. Check. Darts. Check. Plenty of sitting area? Plenty of parking? Check and check.   Overall Crown and Anchor is a mellow and great dive to try a new beer, eat good burger or to clank glasses and cheers with beers at.   The old show Cheers comes to mind. It's a must stop for the neighborhood."

The price varies depending on the type of beer and whether it is happy hour or not.  I got a pint of 512 pecan porter for $4 during happy hour.  They also have pitchers available.    This place is not upscale, but it is a chill place to grab a beer and hang out, watch the game (NBA playoffs and baseball were on while I was there) and there is indoor and outdoor seating and two pool tables.  I was there on Sunday night and pool was FREE!  I suck at pool and don't particularly like pool, but I was up for a few games to help kill the time, so that was an added bonus, especially if you like pool.  There were probably 20 or more beers on tap, lots of bottle and can options, so I'm sure you will find 2 or 5 things that you like.  Parking was free on Sunday.  Pro tip, go on SUNDAY!

What I like about the burgers is the quality of the meat and the fries are really good.... crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.   Be warned, this place gets packed when school is in session but you should be able to find a seat or grab a beer."

                "description": "Well, since I wrote my last review, I've played a lot of board games, been to lots of board game bars, and new places in Austin have opened up.  And for a minute, I thought: the competition is getting tough... There are cheaper ways to go out and play board games now, and there's always tons of places to eat in Austin   But honestly, Vigilante still deserves five full stars because they provide a unique experience you can't get anywhere else. The service is EXCELLENT. The wait staff is always extremely friendly and makes you excited to be there. The game masters are truly that, and can teach you a game as fast as possible. The food is also much improved and truly enjoyable. While also staying out of the way of the real focus: playing games with friends!  By always innovating and keeping the experience top notch, Vigilante will always have a spot in my rotation."

It's got everything you could want for a nice fun evening.  Ordering system is pretty simple - just tell your server what game you want and they go fetch it. Once you're done, flag someone and pick another game.  Food is pretty simple and if you order three things all at once, it's a little cheaper. I wasn't particularly hungry the couple of times I went but the pretzel bites are decent with queso. The sandwiches and milkshakes also don't look bad though I can't vouch for it. They got a lot of drinks on tap too.  Sit back, kick back and relax!"

We got the dumplings, pretzels, gyro , burger and cookies. They have so many games to choose from and have \"game masters\" to help you pick a good one. We stayed for 2 hours. It's been a long time since I've laughed so much. No one was on their phone, no one even wanted to leave the table to go to the bathroom. Oh Drinks were great too."

The room really made our night special with the insanely detailed decor, Bluetooth speaker to customize the gaming vibe, and remote controlled fan for comfort. The waitresses were also so kind and we all felt right at home. We ordered almost every drink and small plate on the menu. I recommend ordering an old fashioned and the dumplings - the sauce was so good! In the main area, they had a nerf gun war planned to end NYE along with a champagne toast. Everything they do is well thought out - definitely give it a try!"

The food was okay, most of it we liked, but when we ordered the Gyro and we didn't eat it our waiter noticed and was kind enough to take it off our tab! We have an excellent waiter! The bartender was great, and the hostess at the front door was super cool! I'm very glad we got to experience Vigilante! And when we are back in ATX. We will be back :)"

                "description": "This is such an amazing concept and we had a blast!  Our group of 4 came here for an adult game night and were not disappointed.  They have a huge variety of board games to choose from.  These game range from easy to hard, long play to short play.  We ordered several different appetizers to share as a table and we each had a burger.  The appetizers were decent and the burgers were very small but pretty good.  This place is definitely not about the food but about the games.  It is good for the snackable items, but I wouldn't plan your dinner here.  The drinks are good and very reasonably priced.  We had a reservation for two hours, but we ended up staying there for about 3 and a half hours and we were not kicked out or asked to leave.  The staff was all super friendly and helpful.  This is definitely a spot that we will be back to."

Bar food is delicious and perfectly snackable. You can never have just one plate. The staff is always friendly.   By far the most unique and best part is the extensive bored game library. This makes it the perfect gathering place for parties small and large to get together for some wholesome and competitive fun. The thought put into this aspect is also plain to see. The design of the tables, the food choice, and the atmosphere makes this the perfect place for the next role of the dice or grand strategic victory. For large parties and special events, ask about the hidden rooms."

For one occasion we reserved one of the private rooms for playing some DND and it was super cool! It's hidden behind a bookcase! Also, the bathrooms are nice. Just saying."

They do split the check individually since it's a handheld POS system that they use.  Majority of your party must be there in order to be seated, otherwise you can just wait at the bar. If you choose not to play board games, you can hangout at the bar and they'll give you switch controllers so you can play smash on their projector screen.  I saw that there was 1 hidden room, behind the bookcase, which I can only assume people can rent out for private parties. There is free parking out front in the garage.  -1 star because service was painfully slow."

                "description": "Man what a gem this spot is! If you haven't been, you mos def need to go. From groups of 2 to about 8, you're gonna have a great time from their lengthy list of board games, small and easy plates, plus brewskies or cocktails! Came here with three friends on MLK night and it was busy! But we were able to get our gaming in. FYI, at night it's a bit tough to see the store sign, but it's right at the corner/entrance of the apartment complex it's near!  Inside - 5/5 The left side of the spot has long benched tables with booths lining the wall/corner. If you sit in this at area, the staff give you a cool plasma-esque lantern so that you can call them over for food, libations, and games. The back of the left side is a bar with a projector in the behind. But what really sets the inside are the four person tables on the right side that are outfitted for perfect board and card games. Each side of the table has compartments where you can put your personal items, a cup for rolling dice, and a slider for cards. There are swinging sections at each corner to put your drinks or other items. Lastly, each side has a button that turns on a light right above the table to let the staff know you need something! P legit.  Food - 4/5 There are two pretty cool three plate deals you can order for $12 as you partake in the games. So far I've had the tacos, fries, and rolls and they weren't that bad. Nothing to write home to, but would be nice with larger portions. If ya don't do the deal, the  plates a la carte are of course a bit more expensive. Also, they can gluten-free most, if not all options! The beer and cocktail selection is pretty nice. Again, nothing out of this world, but cool you can really spend hours here.  Games - 5/5 The best part of Vigilante is of course the games. As several of the menu photos depict, they have a full menu of categorized games (e.g. adventure, party, cards, board). They also break it down by how difficult the games are to learn, set-up, and play. They of course have your staples - Settlers of Catan, Cards Against Humanity, Exploding Kittens - but there are plenty of more games that you can try with your friends! For example, we tried Sushi Go (a quick card dealing game to get the most points) and it has now become one of our go to games! The fun part is that the games are placed in a protective wooden box, which makes you feel like you're accessing a side quest of some sort.  Tips! Like a night club, it's $5 per person to sit at a table and play! And it's unlimited games all night. Your group can only one game at a time. Sit at the 4 person tables I described above! You won't regret it! You can order per person - the staff have mobile card readers  Overall - 4.5/5 I don't think any place is perfect as I believe it's always fun to continue building and making something better. Nevertheless Vigilante is a must go place for a date, a \"night in\", or what have you among other game loving fellows. It has everything you need and you're not risking yourself in the crazy scary world out there. Don't do yourself a disservice and go go go (Power Rangers)!"

                "description": "Overall poor customer service. Visited for happy hour today with friends, and ambiance initially was nice. Their system of notifying staff with flicking lanterns only however encourages neglect for tables; we were never notified that apparently staying for more than 90 minutes meant EVERY guest at the table was charged their game fee, despite us never using any of the games.  Poor communication. We weren't even told of this option by any staff. Once we asked for our checks we were each notified of the surcharges, which honestly felt like I was being scammed because there was no communication given to us. No itemized receipts for me to prove this either, just electronic signatures on a page where the default tip was the highest amount percentage. Bad service but I still tipped 18% because there weren't any other options. Seems like Vigilante is just sneakily after your money, doesn't sit right with me.   Extremely small portions of sides and appetizers. Beer and cider was average selection and price. There are better places for happy hour that don't try to scam you with hidden fees."

You order games from a menu (they have an amazing collection) just like you would order food. They have some good vegetarian options. I felt that portions are small when compared to other restaurants. But if you are here to spend time with your friends, that should be ok. The \"choose your own adventure\" was $12 for 3 items ok the menu. It costs $5 per person to play the games if you are sitting in the general seating area.  This could be a really good place to just hangout with your friends and have a good time. They are also open until super late!"

                "description": "Terrible experience! We decided to go here last night after dinner (group of 4) and we called ahead to see if we needed a reservation. We were told no, they keep some tables available for walk ins. When we arrived it was 8:55 and the host told us we were 3rd on the list because there were some 9pm reservations coming in. Ok, no problem we waited outside. Slightly confusing to us though because the place was half empty. The host said it's because they're still operating at 50% capacity. Um...why? Texas opened 100% back in March. Anyway, waited outside. 9:00 comes and goes, 9:10, 9:20...so we go inside to ask what's up? No people ever walked in while we were waiting. We were told that if the 9pm reservation doesn't show then they call and text them to ask if they're still coming and give them time to get there. This was ridiculous! We had been there 30 minutes..the only people waiting on site..we had money to spend there..and we had to wait just in case someone decided they wanted to show for their reservation 30 minutes late. So back outside, there's an open table that's just been sitting open so we decide to seat ourselves. We ask a server if we can get some drinks and he says he'll be back. A few minutes later another guy comes outside to tell us we can't sit there, they're waiting to see if the 9pm folks are going to show. It's 9:30!!! At this point we are fed up and argue with the guy about this \"policy\". We finally said we would just leave because it's obvious we weren't welcome, our money wasn't needed (although idk how since 50% capacity isn't good business for anyone). To top it off, as we are getting up to leave the man who I assume is some kind of shift lead tells us NOT TO COME BACK! Great business you're running here. Such a disgusting experience."

Mainly wanted to write this review because I noticed there were no pictures of the brunch menu anywhere I could find online. Saturday and Sunday, 11-2, if you come and do the pick 3 for 10.50 brunch they waive the $5 game fee. My table tried every dish and there were no misses. Here are a few notes: -Loved the mini smoothie bowl (it's more like a little cup) -Taco is great just be sure to add bacon and you may want to ask for extra hot sauce  -Bacon pancakes come as stack of 4 and they are baseball sized, so pretty good deal -Hash-browns are also a pretty decent portion   I don't really need to speak to the game menu; they have a vast and varied collection and there is multiple things for everyone.   A must go for a low-key brunch option :)"

                "description": "I came here with a group who rented out \"The Wizard's Office,\" one of the private rooms available. They state the capacity is 12, but I can't even imagine how uncomfortable that would be. Not only would there be little room to maneuver yourself around, but it would be swelteringly hot. Even with our party of 8 it became stuffy. Service was the biggest issue: waitstaff were unresponsive to the push-button service request, often taking 10 minutes to come in. Waitstaff also had to be asked over 4 times to bring additional water until it finally arrived.   There's a good selection of games, although it can be hard to find what you want given the proximity of other tables to their game selections, and that they are all in their own custom boxes, making it more difficult in some aspects to locate a game, as they're not as easily identifiable.   I'm trying to find a good way to describe their food, and the only descriptor I can think of is, meh. I'm happy we went to Top Notch before coming in, as the food is small, and they didn't \"course it out\" as described. Instead the food came within minutes of one another, clogging up the table. Not to mention, one of the people in the party later ordered a burger, for it to take over 40 minutes to appear.  Will I come here to play games again? Yes. Will I come here to eat or drink? No. Best you stop off at any of the other numerous restaurants in the area beforehand."

Thelma is an absolute sweetheart. (She and her husband own it). We are looking forward to attending the grand opening later this month and watching Ghost Note Brewing mature and prosper into the success we know it will be."

                "description": "3.5 stars for the cons, given that other, less refined establishments in town lack these issues entirely.  Pros: Cozy ambiance, intimate atmosphere inside, quaint almost romantic patio in the back that still feels as such even with multiple parties outside. Fit that in with some personable bartenders, and you've got the makings for a really nice date night! The Bartender who hosted us personally was wonderful company for conversation with the rest of my party, and she took the BEST care of us during our visit that she could.  Cons: An arguably limited selection of liquor for a place that seems to focus its pride on craft cocktails. It's understandable that the pandemic had severely limited business as of late to give any benefit of doubt, but combine that with a lack of providing customers with a preference of liquor for classic standard cocktails exacerbates this. The coups de Grace in dissatisfaction came when I was informed that the bar had absolutely no cherries to compliment a cocktail that is typically garnished with one. Other regulars who overheard me went out of their way to mention that it's a decision from the ownership down. If it's a matter of affordability for something as trivial yet pertinent as a jar of Luxardo cherries, then bigger core issues exist elsewhere; if it's a matter of personal opinion as to what constitutes tradition in a drink, that's even worse when any reasonable bartender or connoisseur should know that the \"best way\" to serve a drink is however the person consuming it wants it dressed."

                "description": "The Tigress is the  OG of classic cocktail culture in Austin. They opened their doors well before the craft cocktail madness took over the local blogosphere. There are no codewords, no hidden doors, and no over the top marketing gimmicks used to try to make them stand out from the pack. They don't need to. They just offer highly skilled staff serving up classic cocktails the way they were meant to be.   I'm a cocktail enthusiast and admitted \"drink snob\" with very high expectations of any place that claims to be a \"cocktail bar\". The Tigress is like a \"small batch heaven\" located off the beaten path. The rotating menu is carefully curated and the liquor selection, though small, is a blend of unique, local, and masterfully crafted offerings. You won't find mass produced, highly generic, overly commercialized well spirits here. Though the seasonal menus are small, the bartenders are highly skilled and can handle almost any classic cocktail request. In fact, they've even introduced me to a few that I'd not heard of previously, but are now part of my \"at home\" offerings (The Trinidad Sour is a favorite I didn't know I had previously). From the perfectly selected glassware to the outstanding skill of the folks behind the bar, this place is a must visit for every cocktail conisouer looking for that one special place where you stop in for a drink and leave having had a memorable experience.    Despite having all the right things to lend itself to being a high-end elegant cocktail bar, The Tigress has a casual, local, friendly feel. If you don't fancy yourself a cocktail person, have no fear.The drinks are very reasonably priced and the bartenders are highly skilled at asking about your flavor profile preferences and making the perfect recommendations for both the experienced drinker as well as the cocktail novices of the world. Don't be afraid to ask their advice. I take friends and visitors from out of town here regularly and they've never steered us wrong.   Cheers!"

They have outdoor seating which can probably seat around 10 ppl - very small tables surrounded by a few chairs.   For drinks we ordered the boys of summer, paper tiger, leash-less and native tongue.  The drinks were very okay, hit or a miss . I liked the boys of summer, wasn't the best drink I've ever had but certainly better than the others.   Our hostess was a little moody for some reason. She asked   Overall- can surely try it out for a drink if you are in the neighborhood."

If this were a Western saloon, there'd be a piano player, mopping his damn brow and waiting for higher spirits before smashing out a tune.  (you can even smoke outdoors, and if it's cold enough, no one will come out for a solid hour, guaranteed)  If you are not the type to make friends with every moron at the bar, this is a good place to seek some quiet and forgetfulness on off-hours, which are pretty much all hours not the weekend.  TCM is always on, subbed; Ida Lupino, Fred Macmurray, the Bogart, etc, become regulars to you, and inevitably some doofus pipes out, sure as God, \"You know, I think Empire Strikes Back is one of the top ten films on the planet.\"  Sit long enough, still, like a walking stick; in comes a Bumble date once or twice a week: a leather daddy with a face pitted by acne that got the best of him years ago is making up big time by going to absolute town on some mixed girls, reciting the old lines, sure as Old Faithful, pat and safe and just this shy of rote PUA material; a young guy is meeting a blonde with a bob, discussing schadenfreude, saudade, acentrism, kicking canes out from mobility-disadvantaged Nazis, and everyone works at IBM or Dell.  There is always a gang of strangers who know each other over drinks, stinking of the day; every time you come in, they're here, swigging down Claire's Knees and Plump Perfections.  Some of them probably even had a cookout or two before life got in the way.    Every year they do Tiki Week.  Someone's written them up recently.  One of the top cocktail holes in this wreck of a town.   There is something disgusting in being known. Thank the Lord if you are the type who is able to weave little shrouds and stitches of obscurance around your neck wattle and your denimed shanks.  This is a place to hide, to commiserate with your immoralities."

I was told that cocktails were their specialty so I just wanted to keep it simple and asked for a rum and diet coke.  The bartender immediately replied \"we don't carry anything with aspertame in it!!\"  Yet I could see regular coke in their cooler, so I think high fructose corn syrup is that much better?  There was no need to make that comment, simply state you don't have DIET. A little attitude, so so drinks.  No wonder at prime time there were only 4 or 5 people in the place."

Dim lighting and wood booths line the place. Funny to say, but they have he most comfortable bar stools I've ever sat on!   The bartender was very friendly, talkative and great at recommending drinks.   First, I had The Green Drink! She said you can only get it 1-2 times a year! Unique and tasty! Never had a drink with cilantro in it. Good balance of fresh herbs, pineapple and citrus.   Second drink, she made a custom cocktail for me. I was in the mood for gin but my favorite drinks are mojitos and vodka presses. She didn't bat an eyelash and whipped up something exactly to what I asked for.   Prices are average for a craft cocktail ($9-10). The green drink was $12 but not crazy for the specialty and freshness."

                "description": "This is such a cool place! I planned an outing in Cedar Park with a group of my girlfriends. After our outing at the Ecuadorian chocolate factory, we needed a place that could accommodate a fairly large group of friends during lunch time on a Friday (a task that seemed.... yikes). I am very thankful I stumbled across The Good Lot on Yelp! I reached out to make sure The Good Lot could accommodate us, and they said \"Of Course\" and let me know that all of the trucks would be out on Friday.    When we arrived, we were pleasantly surprised to find several open food trucks and a large building (see, beer bar). People had their dogs outside and everyone seemed to be having a good time.   Between all of us, we tried every food truck. I personally got Four Brothers Venezuelan Kitchen. I am a sucker for good Venezuelan food. I got a Pulled pork Bowl with extra garlic sauce, black beans, avocado, sweet plantains, and all the fixings. I would definitely eat here again. I tried a few samples from other food trucks as well.   Everyone left super happy. This is a great place to go if you have a casual group looking for a quick bite and place to hang out.    The next day (Saturday), I swung by the dog park across the street and stopped by again for lunch on my way home. They have trivia nights, live music over the weekends, and happy hour all day on Monday. Please build another location close to Fort Hood. A copy and paste of exactly what you already created would be great. ;). I promise to stop by weekly."

So, it was midweek around 8pm and while the patio had plenty of folks and there was music going the food trucks were done and they weren't too courteous about letting it be known they were closed or out of food or closing up.   So, the taps were open which allowed me to try out a beer. The staff pouring were definitely friendly, letting me know some of their personal favorites on tap as well as letting me try some out. I did also appreciate that they had some NA options as well and I liked the kombucha they had on tap so much I had two more of those instead of the more adult beverage options they had.  If there was a way to have some of the bar staff cross train with the food truck staff it would make a huge improvement."

                "description": "The Good Lot is a wonderful addition to the CP area. Bring your kiddos and your hounds sit outside under the shade or on their covered patio.    Cocktails anyone? I was surprised at their expansive craft beer options. Check out their rotating taps at: https://thegoodlotcp.com/beergarden/drinks/  There are wine, seltzer, and non-acholohol options as well.  When we visited there were 3 food truck options; Yard Bird, Oink, and our favorite The Rice is Right.    Be aware on weekends and when there is live music parking will be a challenge. This has been a point of contention with the neighbors and according to the Good Lot, they are looking to expand the parking area.    Pro tip: Don't park in the adjoining neighborhood park 5 minutes away at the Veterans Memorial Park. Stretch your legs on the way there and work off that beer on the way back."

                "description": "As far as I can tell, The Good Lot only has 5 star reviews and for good reason.  It is a great beer garden with plenty of non-beer options as well.  I have always passed by the place and noticed how busy it is most weeknights and especially weekends, but I am certainly pleased with what it brings to the community.  Generally it gets pretty busy after 6PM until close, and parking can be difficult to find.  Carpooling or taking a rideshare would be the best way to do it in my opinion as I would hate to park in front of someone else's house in the nice neighborhoods nearby.  Certainly a parking lot expansion is something the owners are considering as that is my only issue with the place especially when it gets busy.  That being said, it is always a great atmosphere with a variety of food and drink options.  There are also always lots of dogs in the grassy area by the patio and it is nice to see how family-friendly the place is.  I will certainly be back and bring some friends in the future!"

                "description": "My daughter and I visited The Good Lot yesterday (8/8/21).  It's the new and hot food truck and bar spot in Cedar Park TX (2500 W New Hope). The Good Lot has a main building with a large dining area enclosed by glass garage doors that open and a bar that has numerous beers, ales, ciders, and craft sodas.  It's nestled among the oak trees. There is a nice amount of paved parking and gravel lot parking.   The Good Lot also has dining areas under the oaks along with a game area (corn hole) and a playground for the kids with a large wooden teepee for climbing.  They are dog friendly.   The Good Lot had 4 food trucks.  We chose The Rice Is Right that serves Korean inspired rice boxes and other items.  We ordered the crispy chicken box and the cauliflower box.  Both items were perfectly fried and coated in a sweet and spicy Korean sauce.  Flavor was amazing.  The boxes came with steamed white rice and a purple cabbage slaw.  The portions were large and more than enough food for us. There were other food trucks that served Mediterranean, Pork, and Chicken.  The menus look good and I will explore those in the future.  The Good Lot and The Rice Is Right are on 'My Keepers List'."

Most importantly the environment and the friendliness of the staff was exceptional.   During our visit we met the owners and their family and it was truly an enjoyable experience. Playing corn hole and chatting with the family was outstanding. Neil and his wife are fantastic.  Do yourself a favor and enjoy and afternoon or evening there. I think you will enjoy it."

The beer selection was great, lots of locals including Whitestone, Hedgehog, Red Horn, Family Brewing and (of course) some lovely PHP Jellyfish on tap.  We decided to tried Yaadbird, since we hadn't had any fried chicken in a while. The lemon pepper chicken was on point, crispy, juicy, peppery, a 'lil salty, and everything you need in your fried chicken!  The property is beautiful and well landscaped. The lawn was amazing! It was so fluffy! When we first arrived we just admired the live oak trees and the quality of the grass.. Lawn lovers, you will understand...  The bartenders were very nice and very excited to introduce so many new people to the Good Lot. The owner was all over the bar, pouring drinks, helping staff, and checking with guests, seeming to have time for everyone.  We are looking forward to coming back here and trying the 3 other food trucks, along with the rotating beer menu. Hope they are planning to host more events, as we would love to do an anniversary party here at some point!"

I've been to about 20 pubs and bars in CP and this one stands head and shoulders above the rest. It's an open air (no AC but there is heat in the winter) with big garage doors that were open and a huge ceiling fan so it was comfortable. There were about 20 taps and 3 of them were not filled yet. I chatted with the owner and she said she was looking for ideas so my friend Greg gave her some. :)  There is plenty of indoor seating. Plus, there is a huge grassy area with picnic tables and even a fire pit. It's family-friendly so no smoking.  There is a playground for the kids and spots for four food trucks although only two were filled.   Beer was about $6 on average so not cheap but not expensive either. $1 off all day on Mondays.   It was an enjoyable experience and a really great ambience. I'll definitely be back!"

This place is non-smoking, dog-friendly (leashed) and kid-friendly, with a unique play area, six sets of cornhole, and plenty of shaded grassy area to run around in. Tables are wide and comfortable, and the entire patio was open-air, so social distancing is a breeze. We ate at the Oinkmobile truck (delicious) and grabbed local beers and ciders at the patio desk. We walked the fifteen minutes from our house, but it looks like they have a decent-sized parking lot and are working on creating more space. The only downside is that there's no ramp down to the grass/play area, but hopefully they'll make it more accessible in the future. Staff was super friendly, and I can't wait to come back for open mic night. Because yes, we'll be back!!"

Huge outdoor space with picnic tables plastic chairs or plenty of room to bring your own (even saw someone bring their own folding table). Live music was at just the right volume playing just the right kind of classic rock that doesn't offend and always pleases. Beer selection was generous and reasonably priced (not to mention $5 glasses of wine). Had a 50/50 burger at Oink and was BLOWN away. It's half bacon and half beef and all good. Loved it. The bacon Mac and cheese was also delicious but the portion was a little small for $9 (my only complaint of the night). Do yourself a favor and if you're up in the 613 check this place out!!!"

Once we got a drink, we were lucky enough to snag a table under the fans and the breeze was so nice. They had live music while we were there, which I believe will continue on weekends so that's fun. The lawn looked so nice, chairs to sit in, trees for shade, lawn games for entertainment! There were 4 or 5 food truck options while we were there and while we didn't get any food, all the food we saw coming out looked so good! Definitely recommend stopping by and checking it out!"

If you Google penny bag it will tell you they avoid them because it's bright (thanks Matt for googling!) but I like to think it looks like a spider web to fly eyeballs so they are trying to stay away from a web.

                "description": "What a fun local spot here in the CP! Been wanting to come check out for awhile now and finally drive out last night and closed the place down!!! (sorry guys, we were the last ones to leave)  Parking is nuts so plan ahead and maybe carpool... We drive a jeep so we had no issues ... live music and plenty of smiling faces.. service was great, bathrooms were clean... dogs welcome! Plenty of good beers, wines and ciders... gals were so nice behind the bar.. offered samples and were super sweet... good folks, good music and good grub.... my son joined us and grabbed some food from the food trucks... cauliflower wings, shrimp fried rice and macaroni and cheese... so so good.... bring your chairs/ blanket to sit on because tables and chairs are hard to snag... the lines are long for drinks but they go fast.... We will be back for sure! We feel right at home here. If you like fresh air and freedom... come here.. if you are afraid of fresh air and human contact, probably should go to Austin and be amongst others who feel that way... Merica!"

I enjoyed the openness of this place -- there was a lot of seating that was not in the immediate proximity of others which was great. My only issue is the pricing -- I cannot pay over $5 for a Kung Fu Robot IPA when I can get it for $3 near my apartment. $8.25 for an Electric Jellyfish? I can't but I understand."

It gets crowded on Friday and Saturday nights when there's live music and it can be hard to find parking, so recommend showing up in the late afternoon if you want a good spot."

Inside and outdoor seating were well layed out and loved the concept of the warehouse feel. The bartender was really knowledgeable about the drinks and gave great opinions on what we should try in our flights. My favorite was the imperial cider. Great flavor! All of the ciders had a real depth of flavor to them.   Would love to come here again in a trip and enjoy the food trucks I've heard about that show up."

We visited them middle of a day when not many people were around to have such an early start lol. We all had a tasting set, which I tried cucumber, blood orange, sangria and spiced peach. They were surprisingly all flavorful and enjoyable! Tried their frozen cucumber drink as well - super refreshing. We also ordered a couple of chips and popcorn. The only thing I wish they'd do differently is to serve a few more snack items. Something you prep by microwave may suffice but not just a few bags of chips... maybe if food tracks around were open, it would be all good?"

This is the East Austin location and is easy in and out with plenty of parking.   I walked in and immediately loved the interior. There were lights and barrels stacked to the ceiling. I was surprised by the lack of seating for how popular this location is... there were only 10 or so picnic-style tables inside and a few more outside. It also wasn't terribly busy and I arrived around 5pm on a Wednesday.  Not knowing what I liked, I ordered a flight of ciders. They were incredibly sweet, and I mean almost too sweet. I drank most but the Texas Honey and Blood Orange were too much for me to finish (perfect for those with a sweet tooth though!). The staff were helpful though in helping me find some good options!  Overall, I'd try Eastciders again. This is a great happy hour spot for friends, coworkers, date night, etc."

Would highly recommend for groups or a relaxing afternoon. Thank you!"

They just released the Blackberry Cider this week and it was so good. It's a nice fruity, sweet and slightly sour cider. I also tried the Honey Cider. Both excellent !! They sell all their ciders by the packs or the variety pack if you need to stock up before leaving.   The staff was 5-star. The decorations were 5-star. It was just such a nice chill, vibe. Will visit again soon."

Well look no further Austin EastCiders has a nice outdoor seating area where you can enjoy the beautiful weather or they also have nice indoor seating. They have at least 6 of their ciders on draft yearlong with a couple of seasonal small batches. They're all very smooth, crisp, semisweet and refreshing. You can also get cocktails in a can which is one of their ciders mixed with sake, cream sherry or agave wine. Next visit will be to their Barton Springs location to try out their food and other cocktails.   Rating: 9/10  Cider Flight: Honey, Pineapple, Sangria and Cranberry"

On the last day of my trip I took the time to go into the city and explore as my flight wasn't until the evening. For brunch I stopped into Kitchen No 324 for their eggs Benedict. I noticed a Honey Cider available on the menu and decided to try it. This is the day (even to this day) I discovered my favorite hard cider of all time. Austin East Cider's Honey Cider has such a smooth taste that balances the honey, brown sugar and hard apple cider to give you a complete blueprint of the perfect cider.   Fast forward to today and Austin East Ciders (and the shipping wizards) finally opened up ordering online for shipping and delivery. Amanda noticed this and ordered some as a surprise birthday present. The Honey Cider is as good as I remember it. Definitely recommend trying this product."

For food we only had the queso and chips but two many cocktails to count. If you are a cider fan and want to support a Cider based Austin group do yourself a favor and stop by. The only thing I would say is, get their early so you don't have to wait for 30+ minutes. But, they validate parking so if you bring a waiting beer you will be fine."

I think it was underdone and too hard so it was a bit tough to eat.  The 2 plate bbq dish was good though, especially the brisket (how can you go wrong with brisket?). The \"coleslaw\" wasn't the best and could have used more seasoning and either a better vinegar or mayo base to give it a better texture.  The drinks are pretty good and their atmosphere is overall nice; would definitely go again and check out their HH menu."

We instead ordered the mimosa carafe for $12. Presentation could have been better. They were just served in normal water glasses which made the mimosas go flat pretty quickly.  We ordered the Whiskey-infused Banana Bread French toast and the Eastside Benedict. Banana bread is on the crunchier side as opposed to fluffy (which I don't mind). My friend liked her benedict and thought the brisket was cooked well!  I was not blown away by any means, but I may come back another time to try out their dinner menu."

I politley told the waitress it did not taste right and seemed artificial. She got all upset when I asked for a Hazy Beer instead, and stormed off, only to return with a Lager instead of the Hazy.  I ordered the 3 meat BBQ plate. All three meats were totally dry, and tasted like nothing. The wife ordered the 2 meat plate; both meats were dry and tasteless.   $85 dollars for lousy food and service."

                "description": "I hate that this is one of the last remaining bottomless mimosa spots in Austin because I would give it lower than one star if I could. The food sucks, and the service is even worse. I came once during July 4thweekend, and it started pouring. Waiters would still bring food on trays that had an inch of water in it, and I was one of those unlucky ones who received food after it started raining. I asked the waiter if it was possible to return my food because it was drenched in rainwater, and he said it was too late because I had already ordered it. Excuse me?? I was genuinely shocked. I went downstairs to ask a manager if I could get a refund, and he said I would have to dispute it with the online ordering system company. Absolutely ridiculous. I couldn't say enough negative things about this establishment. Please, anybody else, do bottomless mimosas because I'm tired of having only this one crappy place be the go-to despite how terrible the service and food is."

Anyway, we showed up to this place and we almost left because it was sooooo packed! It was during their famous brunch time, and so we had to get the mimosa carafe. We ended up changing seats when the bar opened up, so we'd have a view of the game. Loved all the ladies working there. They were nice, friendly, funny, and it made it such a fun day! We ate some loaded fries but added their brisket- omg so good! Also had some fried pickles, but forgot to take a photo."

                "description": "My friends and I were visiting Austin for a 30th birthday. We were looking for a bottomless mimosa brunch spot so we looked online and found this place. It turns out that they do not do bottomless mimosas they just sell the bottle or glass by their price. So they should really take off their advertisement of $14 bottomless mimosas because we would have went elsewhere. When we were there, the app that they have went down, so everything was chaotic and no organization was there. My friends and I ordered food and drinks, my friends food came out but mine did not and it was a whole ordeal to get my food. I ended up having them box it up because my friends already finished their food because I didn't want them to wait for mine and have their food get cold. I spoke to the manager on shift and she basically was just trying to make excuses for all their mistakes rather than just own up to them and apologize for all the miscommunication going on that day. Katie, the server, who wasn't even our server, was AMAZING. She was the only one who truly cared about our problems going on and she will literally be the only reason we would ever come back to this place. She should be placed in management. If you do visit here, ask for Katie to be your server because then you will have a great experience for sure!"

                "description": "Went today during brunch to celebrate my birthday and my experience was probably the worst I've ever had at any restaurant.  I asked the hostess to place us on the waitlist for a table inside and she tells me it'll be about 30 min wait. In the meantime, my party and I decided to sit outside and order a drink while we wait. We never got a text letting us know that a table was ready.   We stayed outside and ordered food. 3 of us ordered the chicken sandwich, one of us ordered the brunch burger, and another friend ordered the Brussel sprouts. Well, everyone got their food except me. I waited a little over an hour, asked 3 different waiters, until I finally got my food. My entire party was already done eating.   I had also ordered the bottomless mimosas, but I never received that either. Everyone at my table kept getting their drinks, while I was still waiting for mine. I got up, went downstairs, and asked the hostess if she could remove the mimosa from my tab since I never received it.   Food is ok, but service is TERRIBLE. Still can't believe how bad of an experience I had."

There's a small parking lot where I was able to snag a spot so we are off to a good start! Music is good and service was nice and friendly.  Got the smoked wings for an appetizer and bottomless mimosas to start. The wings were good and the homemade bbq sauce was sweet tangy and a hint of spice, *chef kiss.

You have to order and pay through an application which removed the ability to receive our meal in courses. We got appetizers and meal all at once. It took over 45minutes to get our food which was subpar. The cornbread was completely burned. The BLT sandwich literally had one slice of bacon and the queso was lukewarm. This is a foodie town and today's experience was below quality considering citywide options."

The manager came by our table letting us know that the kitchen closed at 9 PM and that there was nothing she can do. Nothing you can do? Not even heat up our food? We let her know that we were disappointed with the food once again and then asked us \"Well when the waiter came by did you guys let him know everything was okay?\" And \"I'm just trying to figure this out... how long did you guys wait to eat your food?\" She was just very defensive and looked terrified at the same time. Then she mumbled something to us and left. I questioned management and tried to figure out if she was even the manager because of the way she handled the situation. My husband and I both looked at each other like what is going on. The waiter came by and let us know our meal was taken care of but we would have to pay for our wine. He also gave us a free appetizer card. We're from Los Angeles so of course we won't be able to use that. I would definitely come back and give this place a second chance if their guest services was better. Unfortunately   food was not great at all and management needs improvement."

Walking in gave me comforting coffeeshop vibes, with mostly tables of small parties 2-3 drinking beer and socializing.  Having no idea what to order, staff made some recommendations for a flight that were all fantastic. My favorites were the Cuerno Rojo (lightly carbonated and very smooth) and the Continental Breakfast (heavier stout but tastes just like French Toast and Maple syrup). I had to do a double take that I wasn't just drinking syrup but the flavors were spot on!  I'll be back again with friends/family and hopefully get to enjoy the great coffee I was smelling as well!"

The kids enjoyed the chips and salsa while we sipped our stellar brews. Excited to try the Leander location that is actually closer to us. 10/10 plan to come back, especially to try the coffee."

Red Horn just gets better and better with age and has really turned into a community institution - especially during the pandemic when they switched to \"to go\" beers that we could all take out to the parking lot and drink while socially distanced. Fortunately those days are past us but I think I will always have a soft spot in my heart for this place that was a little bit of sanity amidst all the insanity.   As for the fare itself? The beers rotate and you can't  go wrong because they will always let you sample (I'm a strawberry pop-tart ravioli fan - and yes that's a beer). Pair that beer (or wine) with a meat and cheese tray or maybe a panini and you have absolutely nothing to complain about. They even have food trucks on most days...  Thanks for being here Red Horn."

It's hard to find decaf that isn't boring and the decaf here is strong and full of flavor! I even purchased a pound of decaf beans to take home.   I pulled up and my first thought was that the vibe was more brewery than coffee shop and I was right, but I was wrong that the coffee would just be an afterthought. When I went on a Saturday early afternoon, there was a taco truck and people hanging out in the beer garden. Lots of bicyclists and not sure if it's a popular rest stop or because there's a bike shop in the same parking lot or both or something else. Once you step inside there is a giant section of beer taps and beer menu, and a small coffee and pastry menu. They also sell ice cream here which was tempting but I stuck to my americano and later a vanilla latte.   The inside has plenty of socially distanced seating as does the outside and I lucked out with a parking spot right out front. There's a large lot of shared parking for the businesses.   I want to come back to check out their beers!!"

An excellent coffee shop in the morning to meet with co-workers to do some brainstorming with excellent coffee or a wonder patio for a chill evening and great beer or wine. They have a great menu to pick from too, so you not stuck with just pretzels. I personally like the vegetable panini, and my husband like the cheese board."

                "description": "Fantastic coffee house and brewery with inside and outside space located at parmer and 1431. You can get coffee, lattes, and cappuccino served anytime or also buy their beans to go.   They usually have 30+ taps of delicious craft beer which 10-15 being their beers with other guest beers also. They normally have cans to go and they will do growler fills as well. Its unusual to find a place that has both really good beer and great coffee but Red Horn is just that. There are a few slightly more secluded tables where I'll see people working remotely quite often. Most weekends you can find a local artist performing live music too."

Not only is their coffee delicious they have a great variety of beers to choose from. They have recently expanded their outdoor seating which is covered so great for all hours of the day. Parking is sometimes limited but it speaks for its self on how many people love coming here. It's a great place to study, relax, and meet up with friends but get there before rush hour if you wanna snag a good seat inside. Clean environment and staff is very friendly! Also, great music"

Restrooms were super clean! Huge win for me.   I'd come back for beers if I'm the area."

They have decent size indoor seating available where in live music is performed from time to time. Additionally they have small outdoor seating area.

Weeks later, I walked in with our service tiny chihuahua dog (since there's a sign that says \"we welcome service dogs\" so I went in and ordered coffee and as soon as I began to wait for my coffee to be ready so I could take it to go there is this man that was very abrasive behind the counter and I miss felt like I was in the principals office and he said that dogs are not allowed in the facility.  He was very abrasive embarrassing and in my face. I personally think if you don't allow dogs at all then take the service sign dog off the window. It's a shame because that's very close place for us to get coffee but I don't want to have that feeling again."

                "description": "Been here a few times. I must say that the waiters and waitresses here are phenomenal. During my most recent experience our waitress was Karisha.  Late 30s early 40s generation like me will LOVE the music selection here - I felt like they were playing my old playlists from high school or something!   (And they actually have a barcode to listen to their playlist on Spotify which I thought was cool)  I ordered the 20 oz ribeye. (I had a very paltry breakfast and had recently worked out so my body was lusting for some bovine carnage)  My better half ordered truffle fries and the Gardein Buffalo chicken - which she absolutely loved - and trust me that's a rare sight - so Thank You Yard House!  Meanwhile, this steak had everything I hoped for - it was bone-in, juicy and cooked to perfection. The server even asked me to cut into it to ensure it was to my liking - I had to ask her to repeat herself because I've never had someone ask me before.. how thoughtful! And cut into it I did, again and again until all that was left was the bone.   The Parmesan mashed potatoes were also scrumptious! Just the right texture and not too cheesy at all, the right touch of Parmesan.   Oh and there was also the healthy baby broccoli. The heads were very good, the stem was a little tough for me to chew but that's probably because they are grilled (as opposed to steamed) but that's fine because I usually only eat the heads anyways.   I don't usually drink but they are supposed to have a large selection on tap as well as bottled beers. I had the Heineken 0 (0% alcohol) and for those who used to drink Heineken I recommend it because it tastes exactly like the real thing! I was amazed they had it, so I guess there's something for everyone here.  I think this place is a keeper and I will return to see what other delicious adventures are lurking inside that menu. I've had the steak bowl before and it always hits the spot! The burgers are also delicious - though sadly I'm watching my carb intake recently.   In the end, you can't go wrong with this place! It can get pretty busy but all you have to do is give your name and number and they text you when your table is ready! Just go walk to Restoration Hardware and look at extremely expensive furniture you'll never buy in the meantime or stroll on over to Amazon books and play with their toys :) the possibilities are endless"

                "description": "We've come here almost every week, sometimes multiple times a week since we moved to Austin 3 months ago. The hours are great and the food has always been good, you get a full menu and happy hour specials. I'm not sure if we've been here any other Sunday but this past Sunday the food was absolutely awful. I'm not sure if the head chef, kitchen manager, etc. is off or what but both our meals and appetizer tasted like they were microwaved leftovers.   We got the ahi tuna and it was very strange this time, so strange I didn't want to really eat it but the portion was so small this time we just ate it. I guess that kind of shows we're really not picky so when I say something was terrible it's really-really bad. I know anyone reading this will say that's your fault for getting ahi tuna from a sports bar but we've got it dozens of times and it was always surprisingly good. The tuna sandwich and poke nachos are great as well, but we didn't get them this time. We did get the fish and chips and the hot chicken sandwich. The fish was 100% microwaved, it was rubbery and had no crisp to the breading so they're dead giveaways. Also, the coleslaw was brown so that was nice. The chicken sandwich tasted nothing like the chicken sandwiches we've had from there before, and the taste of this one was not pleasant. We still ate most of our food so I wasn't going to complain that it was terrible unless our waitress asked and to my surprise she never did. lol. I think she knew so she avoided that question.   The cocktails and beer selection is great from here and they make great drinks for a sports bar. During happy hour they have small discounts on drinks and larger discounts on food. I don't remember what they all are but I know the cocktails are 2 dollars off, nothing crazy but hey I'll take it. I ordered my first cocktail during happy hour and about 30-40 minutes later another. The waitress took my order for the drink and came back later maybe 10-15 minutes and asked if I still want the drink I ordered. I was confused and said yeah so another 10 minutes or so I got my drink. My girlfriend was on her phone and noticed she came back to ask right after 11 PM when happy hour is done. So I was charged 2 dollars extra for one drink, I could care less. But it was really weird for her to do that.   I don't think we'll stop coming here because of our bad experience. I figured I would take my time to at least let the establishment know of our experience. So they can improve - if they want to. I know a lot of restaurants have staffing issues and there is a massive amount of competition in Austin. A bad meal isn't the end of the world by any means."

Finally, last night I had dinner at the Yard, and was so pleased.  First, Miguel, our  young wonderful Server who was just the BESTEST-helpful, kind and patient.  You couldn't ask for more.  Second, the food, the appetizers, buffalo wings and Sushi Nachos were so impressive, fresh and tasty.  The bacon cheese burger were amazing.  Good beef, and delicious fries.  Of course the Beer was good too, and cold.  All in all I am already planning my return until I sampled everything on the menu that appeals to me."

                "description": "Yard House in my opinion, is a chain that is highly underrated especially when it comes to their happy hour. In case you didn't know, during happy hour all their apps are half off.! Unfortunately I only took pictures of the calamari and nachos, however some of my appetizer favorites are the ahi sashimi, poke nachos, fried calamari, and the chicken lettuce wraps. I also like the chicken nachos, classic sliders, and have heard great things about the cheese curds. Often times, I come here for the happy hour and don't even end up ordering an entre just get a few half priced apps!"

                "description": "Exceptional service(two waiters were both checking on our tables and made sure we had everything we needed!) and pretty solid food! I got the KBBQ Cheesesteak sandwich, which had decent flavors and nice presentation. I would personally have preferred a stronger tasting gochujang sauce, but it was still tasty as is. My friend got the whiskey salmon, which had great sauce! The sweetness and whisky flavors mixed very well. I had a pretty good experience overall and was really happy with the atmosphere and waiters! Tim and Noah, you guys were cool!  I also had Yard House in the past once at maybe 1am and ordered their pepperoni mushroom pizza and Margherita pizza, both which tasted great! Definitely a great meal after being out with friends. Would recommend as a fun, laidback place to eat and drink!"

The drinks were pretty and tasty cocktails, the poke nachos are always delicious and we went w our usual favorites there, mine was the carnivore pizza and his was the spicy jambalaya. Overall a nice chill vibe and atmosphere and nice little stop in the domain."

The waitress that assisted me was attentive, knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. My order came out in a timely manner. I ordered blackened shrimp tacos that came with rice and beans. The sauce that is on the tacos is spicy. For my drink I ordered a Sangria. The food and drink were great!   I sat outside on the patio because it was a nice day outside. The patio is a nice size that has a lot of tables. The restrooms were clean and they are unisex. It's a parking garage across from Yard House which is convenient."

Great spots for drinks after work, happy hour, dinner etc   Eats- we started with the spicy tuna roll but was told it was not sushi! Glad they said something! Was very tasty and without the guilt of the rice!   I got the Baja fish tacos (white fish) it was lightly fried with a nice sauce and slaw on it. I wrapped it in lettuce to lighten it up a bit. However it was delicious! Would 100% recommend this! I also ordered brussel sprouts instead of the rice and beans and they were deliciously fried !   My husband got the Nashville hot chicken sandwich with fries! This was delicious and not super spicy, filled with flavor! Fries were good too! Would recommend this as well.   Worth- the whole check was about $100 after tip. We did get a few drinks as well so that added up. However the portions were large and we felt that it was worth the amount of food and quality of food as well.   Drinks- i got a couple vodka sodas and my husband got the half yard of the left hand milk stout. He loved it !   Services - our waiter was very nice. He checked on us multiple times and refilled waters promptly, he also guided us through the extensive menu and helped us narrow down our choices. Loved that!   Would def come here again! I might bring the pups next time and sit on the patio(when it's warmer)!"

We ordered waters and beers, which they were out of all the beers we wanted to try. Our waitress didn't bring us water for 25 minutes! We had our appetizers basically finished by the time we even had a drink. The poke nachos and cheese curds were awesome and really large. The waitress barely checked on us, and when she did the one time we asked her for sauce and she just never returned for over 15 min. We paid and left without ever getting our sauce. Food and atmosphere were amazing but our waitress truly ruined the experience for us."

                "description": "We absolutely love yard houses HH! We have tried bunch of there appetizers and they are all pretty good, and most of there appetizers are 50% off and pizzas too. But if it's outside the HH time, I this it's bit pricey.  Chicken nachos: skimpy on the chicken and too much of sour cream.  Korean chicken wings: it was pretty good, it had a nice hint with a hint of sweetness and our kiddo loved it.  Onion rings: I mostly don't like onion rings because it's greasy and feels heavy, but at the YH, it's light, crispy and non greasy.  Chicken strips: chicken strips comes with the small basket of fries, chicken stripes itself doesn't have much flavors or seasoning, but it's good if you dip it in some sauce.  They don't have online reservations, so that sucks. Ordering and paying is with the tablet they have on the table and that's not convenient either, we had to try atleast 4-5 times for payment to go through and it's so confusing, otherwise everything else is good."

It was meh but it filled our bellies so in that aspect it got the job done.   The drinks are where it is at here. My husband ordered a flight of beer. Tons of options to choose from. I ordered Bishop cider on draft. I got the strawberry (my favorite) and also the apple pineapple. All the drinks were good.  We noticed that staff attention to customers had been a little lacking and very slow. I think this has more to do with our crappy country and COVID. But who am I to judge? We just made sure to grab our check before I was even close to being done with my second glass."

I don't think I've ever been in a bar with such nice and professional staff. They have an epic beer selection. Though beer isn't my thing, the selection still impressed me! They helped me select a beer, as I said, beer isn't my thing. They were patient and actually found me an option to \"get me through the night\". I did move on to margaritas though, and were these delicious! So why the 4 starts, well, they kept running out of things. For instance, my margarita went skinny when they ran out of the regular mix they use. Then, they ran out of limes! The margaritas, even the skinny ones, were fantastic! They use A LOT of ice, but still tasted delicious. Decor was wonderful for Christmas. It was just a warm and inviting space. We will definitely go back if we are ever back in that area! Parking was sufficient, as it was a weeknight. I'm sure that helped for it not to be too crowded. Everything was very clean also. Just a great place to go and meet with friends over drinks. If you're expecting tapas, call ahead to see when the kitchen closes. The kitchen had closed shortly after we got there, which was a bummer. Regardless, check this place out if you're in the area!"

The back courtyard has giant Jenga and other games and there are plenty of seating options both indoors and outdoors. Just recently tried their food and the loaded fries were pretty good!

Tons of beer on tap and very knowledgeable bartenders who make great recommendations. I will say that their cocktail availability is slim but definitely a good spot for beer."

There were a couple of mistakes by our server at first, but I chalked it up to him possibly being new or simply having an off night. Unfortunately, the service progressively got worse throughout the dinner. From spilling a drink on the table, to telling us he wasn't focused, to the bartender remaking the drink and under pouring it, and it taking almost 20 minutes to receive our check after we asked three times for it, you can't blame it on anything but a lack of effort. Continuous poor service can truly ruin an evening if you let it."

I read the reviews on Yelp (as I always do before going), and suggested this place to them.  I am sorry for doing so. We got there, in what seems to be happening area of downtown Round Rock, which I did not know existed.  There are several bars in this same stretch of road.  Parking was easy on the street.  Once we got in, it has the bar and lot of the front area filled (no social distancing here).  Sign at the front read, \"Seat yourself, and we will find ya\".  We sat at a table/booth section across from the bar near the back.  Our waiter, seems like he did not know much.  We asked him questions, and he was not sure.  We found out though, if you don't want beer, they are limited on other alcohol.  I wanted a Grey Goose and tonic.  They did not have Grey Goose.  I asked for Ketel One.  They did not have.  They said they only have local vodkas, \"Dripping Springs\" and \"Titos\".  I went with \"Titos\" and waiter asked three times, what I wanted with the vodka.  My friend got a \"Apple-tini\".  It came in a very small v-shapped glass, that looked like not much more then a shot...and it had ice chips floating in her drink.  She used to be a bartender, and knew that is not what you are supposed to have there.  Also, her boyfriend had a Long Island Ice tea.  He sipped it, and it was not tasting right.  So, she walked up to the bar to get it fixed.  They told her to go back and get her mask and come back (*mind you, no patrons at bar were wearing a mask).  She did so, and ask if they could remake it.  They did so, and brought to our table by different waitress person, and he tasted it, and still not right.  So, my friend asked the waitress if they knew what they put in it.  They went thru all the ingredients and found out they use \"lemonade\" instead of  \"sweet and sour\" , which made it taste really sweet.  The food was just ok.  My friend got a salad, and looked like left over pieces of lettuce they had lying around. The nachos were just ok, and the reuben and cuban were ok.  It took us about 15 min or more just to get our waiter to come back to get bill.  They pay attention to bar area, but not much in area around it.  Sorry, won't be back."

                "description": "After enjoying delicious food and well poured drinks from my favorite bartender Tanya, I was blindsided for having a political opinion. I was shushed and shunned by the staff for having any kind of point of view. I decided to move to the main bar to be by myself and was then questioned by the staff, who blew the whole thing out of proportion. I was told that I needed to leave the premises by some screening bartender because I was \"disturbing other people\"; all while never raising my voice. If the staff had not perpetuated drama, it would have been dropped. I would not suggest this bar unless you're absolutely certain that you're going to be quiet and pay for over price drinks for underwhelming service from the newer waitstaff. Weak management."

I fully understand markup and a business making a profit, but come on. Could still make a killing at $40, and I wouldve actually bought it. Need to take a calculus class at ACC to learn about price optimization.   Good beers on tap, too."

When you walk in they have mostly a collection of not your average beer. For those looking for bud, coors etc time to expand your horizons lol. Every month they switch up which brewery they get select draft beers from, notably good draft  breweries!  This month they were featuring Clown Shoes, a brand that  has some really great  IPAs and high % which is nice. Tried a 12.5% stout while here and it was amazing. For sure a beer lovers bar!"

The bar staff is friendly and accommodating and there is plenty of seating from couches to regular tables. If you're going to be there for a while drinking be prepared for a hefty bill as nothing is inexpensive here. The awesome lake view helps to ease the $$ pain though. This place lends to awesome people watching as well since this area is a big tourist draw, so overall you can't really go wrong by stopping in here for a weekend libation."

I wasn't greeted by anyone because you have to go up to the bar to order, which is pleasant for my kind of personality. They have very loud music to fit the vibe of the room and plenty of places to sit! Most importantly was the food; I was absolutely amazed by it and it was so delicious! I ordered the sisig and it was the best thing I ever had. I also, ordered a side of Caesar salad, but this was no ordinary piece of salad. It was presented gracefully and tasted extraordinary. The staff is very kind and fast paced with receiving orders. I am very glad that I came to this restaurant and hope I can revisit this place in the future!"

First we were sat ALONE in the outdoor patio which we really enjoyed, we then had a wonderful waiter who was very funny,super helpful and gave us some great recommendations on flavor combinations for desserts. The food was insane and each course was brought out at the perfect time. We both get full very quickly and the time in between each course gave us enough time to digest a bit but we were never hungry. We were super full by the end of the night and spent $230.78 including tip and we ate a good amount of food(We got the Japanese milk rolls,grilled octopus, the Halibut, the NY Strip, Brussels Sprouts, crushed potatoes, 2 apple frangipane tarts, the sticky toffee pudding and the chocolate caramel Breton. We also got 3 cocktails). Thank you for making our day so special, We will 100% be coming back!!"

Prior to my going,  I did see many favorable reviews regarding the Eggs Benedict however, none mentioned Braised Collar Greens.  Yes!  Eggs Benedict with Collard Greens.  I'm a HUGE fan of vegetables but let's just say that after trying it at Eberly, I'm NOT a fan of Eggs Benedict with Collard Greens.    I'll be back, Eberly."

They had multiple seating areas and a bar when you step in with plenty of space to walk around. The whole restaurant is designed elegantly and has wood features on the bar. I am really curious to see what it's like functioning normally.  The event had a lot of food, they served us BBQ with a full spread. The brisket, Mac n cheese and potato salad were my favorites. I have no idea if it was catered or if the restaurant made it, but it was really good.  They had a DJ downstairs with awesome decor and lights. Upstairs is Cedar Tavern, which I think maybe partners with Eberly or is owned by the same people? It was a good drinking area, with games and a mechanical bull. They had Symply Courtney hosting the mechanical bull rides and he was very entertaining. We talked to him after the show and he was super nice as well.   There was also a guy doing lasso tricks with a rope! I did not catch his name but, he was very talented.   The rest of the staff was really awesome too.   Overall 10/10 event, would definitely do another NYE here and am super curious to try the restaurant on a normal basis."

After a long 15 months of not meeting in groups, my original core ATX friends decided we needed, nay, had to meet up.. Eberly was unanimously chosen out of 4 options.  I have always loved the interior of this location, yet to nab seats in the Atrium :(, one day it will happen.   Our evening was just perfect, from the Service, Meal - Starters to Dessert, Wine to Post dinner drinks at the bar.   The reason for 4 stars not 5, the vegetarian pasta entree didn't deliver, the menu description had potential, what I was served paled disappointingly in comparison to everything else that graced our table.   I just noticed that the menu has changed just like our season has. Dinner date anyone? :)"

My water cup was never empty and they continuously checked in on us to see how we were doing. The short ribs were so tender and melts in your mouth. The crispy potatoes were huge and more than enough for two people. Overall this was a great experience and I can't wait to go back and try the pasta."

The rolls were buttery, hot and fresh- check them out for an appetizer.  I had the halibut- so delicious but pretty expensive for one piece of fish.  I would definitely go back for the sweet service and amazing vibe."

                "description": "We came here for a special occasion, and I will say the service side of things was fantastic for that. We were given a card signed by the entire staff (and printed with today's date so we knew it hadn't just been pulled from a stack) and two free glasses of champagne that we could tell was nice quality. At the end of the meal, they also brought out two small plates of dessert on the house, and it was delicious! Tasted sort of like an apple crisp, and really beautifully plated. I'm kicking myself for not having taken a picture of it.  I also really have to compliment our waiter, who said he had some level of sommelier training and had contributed to the wine list. He pointed us to a bottle of 2016 \"Sucette,\" a grenache from \"An Approach to Relaxation,\" a small vineyard in Australia. I'd never had a pure grenache and had never been a fan of GSM blends, but this bottle was absolutely lovely. It's hard to find online, and I love it when I can get a bottle at a restaurant that I can't just pick up at my local liqueur store...makes it more worth the mark-up.  So, service was five stars, all the way. Really nice.  The letdown was the food. First, they were out of the short rib. Guys...this was a special occasion, and I came all the way from Dallas for the short rib. Don't do me like that! I mean...the thought of walking out honestly crossed my mind. Instead, I took the waiter's suggestion and ordered the halibut. It was...fine. No short rib. We also shared the Wagyu sirlion, which honestly wasn't all that remarkable either. For sides, we did the asparagus (very nice) and the shells and cheese (also nice). Oh, and we started with the octopus, which also was nicely prepared. And then, yeah, heck, we went for it and ordered a full dessert in addition to the free mini desserts they gave us. The Chocolate Bar was...eh. Chocolatey? Nothing memorable, really.  At the end of the day, our bill was as sky-high as you might expect with a bottle of nice wine, two entrees (one being Wagyu steak), two sides, and a dessert. However, we both left feeling as though the food really hadn't lived up to the cost. We agreed that if we were going to drop that much money on a meal, we would have much rather gone next door to Uchi...and that's just not a great feeling.  I really do have to compliment the staff and their phenomenal attention to our special occasion. They earned those three stars all on their own. I wish the food had supported a higher rating, but it just fell short of expectations."

If you're looking for a nice restaurant, cool vibe, great food and don't mind the price tag that comes along with it, this is a great place for a date or dinner with friends.   Our group of friends went to Eberly most recently for a birthday celebration and we had the Japanese milk rolls, salmon poke, grilled octopus, short rib, wagyu steak, and shells and cheese. Everyone loved their entree! The grilled octopus and salmon poke blew us away - great starter dishes that I would highly recommend to any group going here.   The dessert was also great, we had the shortcake followed by a round of espresso martinis.   Great food, great vibe, great service. Will definitely be back!"

                "description": "I am honored to have experienced dining in at Eberly. This restaurant is simply amazing. All their food is fresh and high quality.   For appetizers, I would recommend all the starters. Although, if you have to narrow your choices, my top picks would be the Japanese rolls (dinner rolls), the steamed mussels, and the croquettes. Honestly though, everything is so amazing here that you won't be disappointed.  As for the main course, the short rib with polenta was incredible. The meat was fatty, soft, and full of flavor. It melted in your mouth.   Our server for the night was really great too and took their time to ensure we had all our dining needs met.   Unfortunately, what's preventing me from giving this restaurant a 5 out of 5 is that around 1030 after finishing our meal we wanted to go to the bar in the restaurant for some drinks and we were unable to do so. The bar was basically empty and the bartender told us we had to ask the host if we could sit for a drink at the empty bar. We went to go ask the host if we could sit and they said they would find out. We stood at the front waiting for 15 minutes for them to come back with an answer and they said \"you can sit at the bar but can only have 1 drink because we close at 11.\"   It took them 15 minutes to basically say no to sitting at their empty bar. Also, why would you tell us there's a drink limit? What if I can drink more than one drink in 15 minutes? I am disappointed I didn't get to finish my night at Eberly's bar.   I do recommend their restaurant but probably not the bar since they don't like to seat people at their empty bar."

It reminds me of Mad Men meets a speakeasy and I AM SO INTO IT.  My group's order: Cocktails: - Brooklynite - So smooth and delicious! Little tropical escape in a glass without the sugar punch. - Tristessa - Deliciously smokey and sweet, oh so good. - Sixteen Jackies - Favorite drink of the night! So pleasant and gentle you can barely taste any alcohol! - Autumn Rhythm - Classy, sophisticated, and the ice even has Eberly etched on it!  Food: - Japanese Milk Rolls - Its not hard to make bread absolutely divine but this really is something that I am now craving everyday... - Potato Leek Croquettes - Crispy but smooth on the inside with a pack of flavor in every bite. - Agnolotti - Vegetarians rejoice, these tiny pasta pillows are so delicious and tons of veggies to pair with it! - Asparagus - Sides can feed 2 people so share with the table! Cooked to perfection and so juicy. - Halibut - Fresh, moist, and every bit as healthy as you want it to be! - Braise Short Rib - Slightly dry unfortunately but otherwise epic flavors and the polenta was cooked to perfection. - Sticky Toffee Pudding - Wow this really was a perfect way to end the night! Please try this!  Long story short, GO TO EBERLY."

The reason I give it only 4 stars, is the the food was just good, and not great. When you are paying almost 100 dollars a person including drinks, you expect the food to be excellent. We had the fish and the wagyu sirloin. There was nothing wrong with the food, but it just didn't wow us. The wagyu tasted like a normal filet. Very lean but tender. It wasn't any tastier. I would have much rather have a prime ribeye for the same price."

The interior is gorgeous, especially if you are seating in the glass enclosed room.  10/10 for ambiance and design.  The cocktails are also great!  I've never had a drink here I didn't like.  Unfortunately, the food is where things go a bit south.  The portions are quite small and I find the quality to be inconsistent between dishes.  The price is also pretty high compared to other restaurants in the area.  That being said, the service has always been exceptional.  I think this place would be a lot better if they knocked a few bucks off their food prices (or improved the food)."

                "description": "TLDR: This is a great spot for a celebratory evening, but is overpriced and shouldn't be your \"go to date night\".  We went to Eberly to celebrate a friends job promotion. The ambiance was great. We sat in what felt kind of like a beautiful greenhouse. Plants everywhere, cute decor, and perfect lighting. The service was also great. Our waiter took great care of us the whole time. Everyone enjoyed the cocktails and drinks they ordered too.   The menu is not huge and every entree is over $21 a person some going up to $42. This price was okay for a celebration dinner, but it felt like a lot for the portion sizes.   Also, we ordered a side of the crushed potatoes and they were covered in mint. I personally dislike mint and the menu did not say the potatoes would be topped with it or I would not have ordered it. I was surprised and disappointed by my side order."

                "description": "A magical circus of a place.  Never mind they have a real circus wagon out on the side, out of which they serve Italian food.  Never mind the strings of colored lights that make the back yard look like a carnival midway.  Never mind that the Vortex theater is right inside.  So if you are a paying customer, just beyond the velvet door curtain of the Vortex, there really ARE sword swallowers, lesbian ring masters, dancing dryads in water pools, and mega-gods of universal destruction.   Actually what is behind the velvet door curtain changes every few weeks.   When you go it may be nuclear rainbow unicorns, cybernetic tap dancers and the Flaming King of the Empire of the Ashes.  There will always be something interesting behind the Vortex velvet door for sure.  However, it is just as magical out in the bar.  The bar magic goes on all night rather than ending at the one hour and forty minute mark.  Of course, part of the magic is EtOH.  EtOH produces far more intoxicating illusions than anything that goes on in the main hall of the Vortex.  (EtOH is chemical-ese for ethyl alcohol, otherwise known as booze.)  The Butterfly Bar serves first rate EtOH.  Most of the house drinks are girly cocktails of classical or recent provenance. These are fine for what they are.  However, they do one wicked little number called the Whippoorwill which is fine bourbon, cold brew coffee, New Orleans style chicory and foam with secret flavor ingredients.  The Ghost of Sherlock Holmes appears and takes you down all the secret passages of the house.  The magic is generally enhanced by broadcasts of best-of scenes from past Vortex productions, projected on one wall.  There are projections of obscure documentaries on another wall. These have no sound, and I can promise you, you have never heard of any of them.  There is a vending machine on the wall that will sell you thirty dollar forks, knives and spoons that will save the world.  (I am not making that last detail up. Check it out for yourself.)  There are cats who run the establishment and have more authority than the bartenders.  One particular kingly and somnolent feline decided he was going to take his nightly nap at my table on the bench.  He claimed his space where I otherwise would have preferred to sit, and owned half of my table for the rest of the night.  He occasionally roused himself for twenty seconds just to make sure no service dogs had entered the establishment. After that, he returned to his regal slumbers.  The most magical parts of the establishment however, are not the food truck, the colored lights, the video loops, the drinks or the cats,   The most magical parts of the Butterfly bar are the patrons.  This is one of the most fantastical people watching spots in Austin.  It is a world of twenty nine different genders. It is a world of eighty nine different art forms. It is a world of magical costumes to die for. It is a world of back stories that makes your Ghost of Sherlock Holmes seem relatively tame.  The imaginary characters on the Vortex Stage have nothing on the real-life characters that populate the Butterfly Bar  So come to the Butterfly Bar and watch all of the limits of your plain-jane everyday reality dissolve.  Bring your magic hat even if it is just an old Chicago White Sox cap you got as a kid at a ballgame.  After half an hour, you will be able to reach inside that baseball cap and pull out a talking marmoset."

I couldn't taste any mango as it was all masked by the strong tequila. I'm not sure if all margs are like this, but it could have been because the ratio of tequila to everything else was off. My friends and I all agreed that the taste of alcohol was a bit too strong for a drink like a margarita.   I did like the ease of ordering drinks. We were eating at Patrizis and I liked how you could order and pay off your phone and they'd bring it straight to your table within 5min."

                "description": "Came here for the first time about a month ago. It's definitely an \"East Austin\" vibe, like a crazy backyard with statues and lights and mismatched patio tables.   I like that they do have a hostess at the front gate to seat you, so you don't have to do that awkward wandering around the yard looking for a table and feeling like everyone is staring at you. They also check IDs and take your temperature at the front.   Currently, all the ordering is done via your cell phone. Scan the QVC code, and then view the menu and place your order to your table number and they carry out your drinks. Note that when ordering liquor, it requires you to order food with it, so they have a menu of $2 bar snacks. After the first round, we notated that we had already ordered snacks, and were not required to buy more with every drink purchase. But they did check for the snacks when the drinks were brought out.  I've only tried the margarita and a dirty vodka martini, $9 and $10 respectively. DAMN. Those margaritas are GOOD and STRONG. I had 2 and i was....feeling no pain. My martini was also PERFECT. Worth the money, and if you get there during happy hour, the margs are only $5! I did also enjoy the little $2 package of trail mix with MandMs.   One thing I noticed was that the cup size seemed to change, one time i went and they were served in these short plastic cups and another time these taller plastic cups. I was a little concerned that there are inconsistent portions but I can't be sure.  Will definitely be back, those drinks are FIRE and i want to try the food truck. Also plenty of non street parking which i appreciate!"

Before riding there on my bike from 4 miles away,  i mapped out the route on Google Maps beforehand and Google said it was closed. the phone recording on the bar's answering machine said they were open for business. Still wanting to confirm,  i tried ordering some food/drink over the website and again it let me order food/drink.  So i arrive to the bar and there is a piece of paper stuck on door that said \"closed.\" About 4-5 others were standing around also surprised that it was closed. Butterfly Bar management lacked a modicum of courtesy to its potential customers by omitting  to mention on its website/ answering machine/ FB  that it was indeed closed on a non-holiday. Surprise!Customers are going to rely on that answering machine msg and actually take an Uber or ride their bikes several miles to get there. It would make sense to at least turn off the answering machine completely if you are not going to bother to change the outgoing message. I doubt i will venture out to Butterfly Bar again. Luckily, the very professionally-run Salty Sow nearby gave us excellent refreshments and earned the $100+ we spent that night."

                "description": "My friend and I came here on a blind double date for the first time on 9/17 at around 7:30 p.m. and thought the vibe was great until our waitress came up and introduced herself, but unfortunately I have forgotten her name( server: inside B) . She asked for a card for the tab and we asked if we could do two separate tabs to which she basically told us that we could be on one tab and figure out the rest on our own. Then as I offered up my card with a bit of hesitation she made a comment about how some of us in the group didn't know what it was like to go out prior to Covid and open a tab. Her facetious comment was directed at me being that I recently turned 21 and was the youngest. Next we received our drinks, I understand that some drinks are made bigger than others, but when my friends were brought their drinks they were all filled to the top, weheres mine was filled 3/4. I let it go and asked if we could get some more water and our waitress said ok and never came back until it was last call and my friend asked again, then she brought the water. Let me mention that we were not belligerent, we were in a space by ourselves and we had each ordered a single drink and had food. When we asked for our check, my friend asked our waitress how her night had been, thinking that if it had been busy then maybe she was just a bit frustrated and we should be understanding of that, instead she said it had been an easy night, then why rudeness directed at me? All people  in my party (with 2 being practically strangers) noticed the difference in attitude towards me compared to them. Overall it was very upsetting as a POC to get this clear difference in treatment from another POC at an establishment that loudly advocates for POC. I still tipped her, because we are in a pandemic it's the right thing to do, but I felt so strongly about this that it made me write my first yelp review."

Kind of hidden from the main road, the Butterfly Bar has one sign and a gate that you follow to an outdoor garden full of twinkle lights and laughing people. There's a stage where there's often performances and a little indoor cabin part where you order drinks. It's almost pitch black outside at night, but makes for a fun date and casual atmosphere.   I ordered a mojito and it was delicious and strong. I would 100% recommend going here if you're in the area! So fun and unique."

Great service that is quick and active, not the typical where you're standing there trying to make eye contact for 10 minutes.  Patrizi's out back so you got great food with good drink; not best selection of beer but local Texas.  Got a projector on the wall for special showings, but expect a hangout on most nights and not a get-some-work-done type of venue.  Overall a good spot and easy to find parking out back."

Getting into the parking lot kind of sucks if you are coming from Manor because it is such a small little entrance, if you have a bigger SUV, it might be tight for you. Otherwise, this place is amazing! There are a lot of different picnic tables outside and some w/umbrellas and some without. Also, some of them have heating lamps for when it is cold. They have a food truck here apparently that is supposed to be amazing, we didn't try it because we had already had dinner but the line to the food truck was literally out the fence. The butterfly bar also has indoor seating but the outside seating is more lively and fun! I had a sangria and it was super tasty! It had OJ and brown sugar in it made w/red wine! I love this place. They have a couple cats walkin around too, don't pet them, they don't like it. Cheers!"

I was actually surprised at the selection of drinks they had.  I immediately fell in love with the cocktail menu.  The bartender working that night was great.  My first cocktail was a surprise from my husband, the butterfly nectar.  It was simply divine!  I loved the addition of the flower in it too!  Next I ordered the Blossom cocktail and it was just as beautiful and tasty as the first!  They also have a nice selection of beer and wine too.   The inside bar has a vintage vibe going on.  It was comfortable.  I loved the openness of the outside patio area.  There were several nook and crannies to set up shop outside with your friends.    I am absolutely a fan of butterfly bar and would love to come back here.  I need to continue my exploration of the cocktail menu as it is lengthy!"

I'm the latter. I love to find new spots to get a drink. Sometimes it will be months before I repeat a bar.   The Butterfly Bar is one of those places that I visit once every 6 or so months and wonder why I'm not there all the time. The servers are friendly, the patio is large and beautiful, they even have a greenhouse you can sit in for a magical evening among the garden. They have a place for everyone. Just sit back and enjoy the music, dancing, or movies.. whichever are going on at the time!   They have a great selection of wines and craft cocktails that alway please. They are a little on the pricey side as 2 margs were about $18, but they were perfectly mixed and not too sweet, so I'll take it.   Definitely stop by with an empty stomach, too, because Patritzi's is killer food-truck Italian spot and it's right there.. waiting..for you!"

A truly unique, multi-faceted gathering place with folks of all different backgrounds coming together to enjoy life- be that theatre, cocktails, food, or just laid back hangs with friends. A great place for birthdays and meet-ups. A happy hour that for sure puts a smile on your face. Interesting cocktails to explore. A food truck that will fill you up with delicious local ingredients and handmade pasta. And what began it all- the performing arts theatre that has been a part of the community for 30years. It's a special piece of Austin and one of the few left that are still holding their own while the condos encroach. Much magic resides here! (Pro-tip: get a sno.co snow cone from the trailer in the lot and get it spiked! Purrrfect for TX summers!!)"

Otherwise, expect to pay minimum $14 for your main course. I love that their menu, decor and the restaurant reminds me of an elementary school.   Service was wonderful and food came out about 15 mins on a slow day. It's also conveniently located between a couple of taco restaurants if you need a quick snack!   Patio is Bob and dog friendly! There's water bowls for your thirsty pup on the side of the restaurant if you choose to bring your furry companion!   Bartender made me a cute mimosa to enjoy before heading back to the airport. Definitely coming back to visit when I'm in town again!"

Everything was fine; just nothing that makes me want to return again any time soon.  I love the indoor seating with its broody, dark interiors and the plentiful outdoor seating on park benches (hard to get in and out of if you're wearing a skirt/dress!) and when the sunset is that beautiful magenta/hot Texas orange color, this venue is perfectly situated to stare longingly at it. I also like that you order from the counter instead of traditional table service because sometimes it's nice not to be interrupted (make sure you have everything you need before you sit down, though, because if the line is long, it makes it difficult to track someone down for something).  A solid place for a drink if you're a sunset chaser."

The best feature is the patio, Manor road is a cool neighborhood and its fun to people watch. The inside feels a little cramped for a group and it can be pretty loud. The neighborhood in general is nice. If your in the area you should stop by.  They also have some good happy hour deals. 6 dollar fish and chips and 5 dollars off bottles of wine. Each day of the week has a different deal and they're all pretty good.  In terms of drinks, they have a decent selection of beers on tap. Theyre selection extends beyond the basic austin starter pack too which is nice.  In terms of food,  Its a step up from bar food, but i definitely wouldn't call this a gastro pub. The fish and chips are good but definitely greasy and the portions are inconsistent.    The burger is pretty good. The patty is pretty thick and they put a jam on top thats sweet which stole the show. I think the jam was made of onions. I only wish they put more jam on top. It has a similar effect as ketchup. be warned, the saten burger is a little tough."

The only parking available is street parking behind the bar in the neighborhood, but you don't have to walk too far. (Less than 5 min)  This bar has a throwback school vibe with chalkboards on the walls and mini composition notebooks for your receipt. They have a good craft beer selection and their food is delicious and higher quality than your average bar food. We ordered the wings and pretzels. The pretzels are a bit more oily, however it being bar food, filled my greasy food craving. The mustard seed it came with was a great pair (although i highly recommend adding a queso dip!). The wings were delicious as well and were mild spicy. There is patio seating out back and picnic tables out front, as well, so there is plenty of space for a group."

                "description": "Came in for the first time the Sunday of the World Cup final.  Friend suggested it would be a fun place to watch. They opened early and there was already a line.  Think it was worth it.   While small the space was great and the food and drinks on point. Loved the smokey blood Mary. Got the potato hash vegan style and it was tasty.   Only thing that was a miss was the way they handled the crowd. Couldn't order food and drink until after a time past open which isn't their fault but there wasn't enough staff to handle the crowd. Food went to wrong people and no one to check on diners.  They did the best they could but poor planning.   Will give them another go on a normal day and think things will be five star worthy."

                "description": "I had been meaning to check this place out as it is literally down the street from a friend's apt on Manor and having investigated almost every other place on the block, my FOMO was kicking in when I would see this place packed to the hilt every time we drove by. Luckily, I came on a quiet weekday evening and barely made it for their HH (the bartender was nice enough to honor it since it was but a minute over).   I like the vibe here, it is very trendy eastside but w/o the pretension or self-importance of other places nearby.   I had my sights set on the Montreal fries as I am a poutine enthusiast (and purist, to be truthful) , so I will establish right now these are not traditional poutine, but a conceptualization. First off, the serving was massive and I probably reached my sodium quota for the week by finishing every last bite, but I'm not a quitter and setting this heap of short ribs, gravy, cheese curds, and fries in front of me was instantly \"Challenge: Accepted!\". It took me almost an hour and a half whittling away one bite at a time and having to take literal breathers in between, but it was ::MISSION ACCOMPLISHED:: (in the unironic non-Bush sense) and I had 0 regrets.  In the 90mins of unleashing my hardcore Fatty for all to see, I got to interact w/the staff and other patrons and I have to say, there were no judgements (aamof, I got several nods and eyebrow raises of approval at my endeavor). I'll admit, everyone I encountered was a very Austin-y version of splendid! We laughed, I cried (when I finally finished the Montreal Fries), and even rebuked the very handsome bartender's insinuation I would even think about a to-go box!   All in all, I enjoyed my visit here and can see myself coming back on an off/quiet night. The seating inside is pretty cozy and the patio is smallish as well, so I can only imagine how chummy you have to get with your fellow \"students\" when the Friday bell sounds and weekend recess is in effect!"

                "description": "What a great little spot! Stopped in during HH on a Thursday and posted up at the bar. Super friendly bartenders and just a great vibe overall. Went ahead and sampled some beers, grabbed a Dogfish Punkin Ale - they guy even threw some sugar and freshly ground cinnamon on the rim! This is the only way you should be drinking a pumpkin beer!   Ordered the fish and chips - $5 bucks on HH! These things came with some serious garlic fries.. I want you to take what you think is a lot of garlic, then multiply it by 83874... Somehow still delicious, the tarter sauce on the side deserves an award.. It was like a tarter/greek tzatziki sauce hybrid! I should have asked for some to-go. No idea why they give you ketchup as well.. Doesn't really fit the plate because of the fry seasonings and garlic. The fish was tender and crispy... perfect balance.   If you haven't had a chance to check this spot out, throw it on your list!  One last thing - if you do order the fish and chips.. Don't go get your game on for the night without brushing and gargling a gallon of mouthwash, throw some gum in for good measure! Be responsible, people!"

                "description": "This really is a great little pub. Their beer selection is stellar and happy hour is solid. Monday, all full sized pints (not the high ABV offerings) are $4, which is great. The food is really good as well.   We tried the wontons which were good, though there were only 3 in a $10 order. The kale salad included was fantastic.  We also got the special for the day which was a tempura scallion pancake filled with Korean beef. Really a fantastic little dish. This one impressed me.  We also got the fish and chips. the fish was of high quality and the fries were tasty. Two small gripes, it was fish and frites (though the crispy fries were delicious), and while the outside of the fish was perfectly crispy, the inside of the batter was a touch soggy. The goat cheese tartar was unlike anything I've had before: subtle in flavor and with the consistency of butter. However, when you spread it on the fish and it starts to melt, it was really good.  So, a couple of small gripes about the food can't keep this from being a 5-star. Every time I visit, I am reminded of what a good gastropub can be."

Props to the bartenders for making legitimate lemon drops instead of hating us for ordering them.  They had bar service, and line was never longer than 3 people or crowded. We didn't have to wait for a table at all when we arrived. We sat in a table nestled in the trees and although I saw reviews that complained about the birds, the trees were a nice back rest, and the social distancing was comforting! It's definitely not a fancy or experience-based spot, but it has a time and place!   Pro tip: If you get stuck on the wrong side of the really long fence in the street, one of the panels to the right of the entrance is unattached and you can step through!!"

From the guy at the door to the bartender, everyone was super kind and helpful. We ended up ordering the watermelon frozen margaritas - I could be wrong but I think they change up their frozen cocktails quite often. If you come across it on your visit, I would definitely recommend it. They had a variety of beer options and even though I didn't order any food, their menu looked appetizing.  They have a cool vibe with an expansive patio setup. If you get the choice between small/large cocktail, get the large. The price comparison is $7/10 and the large seemed like a way better deal. The birds above can be a little bit of a nuisance so try and sit somewhere with less tree above. They were also very Covid safe and instead of having everyone order in the bar, they had a makeshift bar setup outside where you would place your order. I recommend grabbing a patio seat here on a beautiful day!"

The inside is small with a five bar feel, which I'm fine with, the outside area is probably nice on days where it isn't raining but I sat out there during cloud cover and it was just alright. The parking lot gets flooded after rain so take that into consideration, The bright spot of this place was their potato wedges. Not even kidding. They aren't your typical wedges and I was delighted at how good they were. I'd return just for the those, to be honest. If you want no frills and to keep entirely to yourself, this is probably your place. Social butterflied would be best served somewhere else."

                "description": "A revisit to one of my favorite spots in Texas, the Growler Bar - 2022 review.   I love coming here when it's not busy, which I'm finding is becoming more and more difficult as time passes. The place has built up a solid base of loyal customers that seem to return week after week and I can't blame them. There is consistency at work here, the staff is always excellent - they make great recommendations to the ever-changing list of beers on tap, the selection of beers is constantly rotating, and best of all - the food is delicious. We often consider ordering take-out for only the pizza/pizza rolls here.   This place has adapted to changing times, they have more outdoor seating so we're able to socially distance ourselves most of the time and feel safe during our visit. I'm happy to see this place thrive."

BUT, the wings were not ready and had to wait longer. By the time I got the phone order home, the pizza and pizza rolls were cold, tasted very average and doughy.   I hope the high rating is for the beer, because the pizza and service was far below any one else...."

There's also plenty of tables outside with umbrellas for those with dogs or don't mind the scorching Texas heat.  The pizza is delicious. I can't remember the name of it but it had Canadian bacon, bacon and a sriracha bbq drizzle on it. Crust was delicious, the bottom wasn't soggy near the center.  Also tried the pretzels with beer cheese. Mmmmmm.   A really big beer selection available as well.   Service was great. You order at the bar, get a number and they bring to your table.   Def worth a visit if you're nearby."

                "description": "In my previous review, I neglected to mention something important. This is one of those businesses which require you to pay first and they hit you with the gratuity percentage upfront before you receive your food and service.  The gratuity should come at the end of the meal and service, not at the beginning and I have found this practice puts more money in the business' pocket at your expense.  Now with that said, their pizza, wings and pizza rolls are quite exceptional. they have an extensive beer selection which is always changing around to keep up with the seasons. So if paying upfront along with the gratuity doesn't bother you then we do recommend the fare, however I find it a turn off. Especially since they forgot half of our order and didn't get it to us until we were ready to leave. So basically, one star for the payment practice, but four stars for the food and beer."

We had a beer called Nola- next time we go I'll get a growler but since we weren't going straight home and forgot a cooler that had to wait. Their beer cheese looks like gravy.. it doesn't taste like gravy though- highly suggest! We will definitely be back next time he visits. Nice large patio and clean bathrooms as well."

                "description": "Decent selection of craft beers, but one thing unique about this bar is that they do not allow customers to sample any beers, unlike most of their competitors.  I undetstand the policy to a certain extent, especially if you had very knowledgeable bartenders, but that is not the case here.  During my most recent visit, one person I was with asked for an IPA that was very hoppy, But instead got something but was very sour and totally did not like the taste of the beer. She was stuck with paying for the pint, despite the bartender's error.  The pizza (bbq chicken) was decent, but pretty bready - took away from the tasty toppings - left me feeling like we were served a glorified frozen pizza - we were hungry so we devoured the pizza, but we were disappointed and will thing twice before  ordering it again.  They had some live music, a young man with the guitar singing cover songs, did a very decent job. It helped make the dying experience enjoyable.  It was a great night to sit on the patio, with a nice breeze, some decent music being played, and the company of good friends.  Perhaps they could think about modifying their policy so that you're entitled to one beer sample, as long as you order a full beer.  The bartender stated the reason for the no sample policy was because of Covid... I just do not buy it, given the fact that None of the bars/restaurants that I have gone to the last couple of months have this type of policy."

Unfortunately I didn't get a pic of the wall of beers since I ate outside to enjoy the cool Texas breeze. The pretzel sticks were hot from the oven. The carnivore pizza had enough meat for four pizzas so come ready to eat. I must say the Hefeweizen was very good and close enough to remind you of Germany if you've been. They have have local bands playing nightly so there's also entertainment. The locals know and if you ever take a trip to the area now you do too."

First time coming here - you order at the bar, they give you a number, and then you take it to whatever table is available and that you choose. Look at the food menu before you come because the food menu is only visible at the counter/bar that you order from. The only bummer to the whole experience was that the number they gave us was not the number they gave the kitchen so the food got lost for a little bit because they were looking for a different number. We got it figured out and it was still delicious!"

They split the calzone so it was two separate smaller calzones instead which was awesome. The only thing we recommend is the calzone and pizza rolls might have been slightly over cooked as the top of the crusts were very dark and tough. Probably because they cooked it in the same oven and temperature as the pizzas which makes sense. But this wasn't an issue and the food was still great. Loved our experience"

Wonderful selections of beer, cider, wine, kombucha, etc..  For food, go with any flavor the wings (lemon pepper and garlic parm are my favorite). The pizza rolls are divine and freshly made. You also can't go wrong with the pizza.   They also have live music and outside seating. Perfect place for date night or to chill with friends. I HIGHLY recommend it."

The pizza is actually quite good (and I'm a midwestern pizza snob) and the service honestly really makes it. Their servers are so friendly and all throughout the COVID restrictions, they followed the protocols and managed to still make it a fun place to go to. We even hit up a couple of Trivia nights with friends on accident and scored some gift cards and had a blast. My only reason for taking a star off were the wings. We tried them a couple of times but the thick, rubbery fat and lack of crispiness were big turnoffs - seemed like they weren't fried but maybe baked? In any case not good. We've got plenty of other deliciousness there, though, so we just order everything else!"

This last time, the beertender sat taking our order (yes, he was sitting behind the bar) and had no suggestions or enthusiasm.  There is no way to order without going inside the bar. During covid, there should be options for this!  The pizza is okay. If you are looking for pepperoni rolls, Pinthouse are much better in my opinion.  We may return for specific beers, but it won't be on our regular rotation with other options in the area."

                "description": "My review is mostly based on service.  I came here with the husband on a Monday night because I wanted a post-dinner beer. I marked this place in my bookmarks as a place I wanted to try based off the reviews. I generally try to be open-minded about my experiences at new places, but honestly I was just rubbed the wrong way here. We walked inside around 7 pm and I only noticed the list of cocktails on the wall behind the bar. I looked at the tap handles to see if I could tell what they had and the bartender finally came over. I figured I'd ask for something easy and see if they had Dos Equis on draft and was told they didn't with a snarky attitude that I guess he thought was witty or funny. I asked where the list of beers was and he stared at me and just pointed up...ok where am I supposed to be looking? OH. Apparently I'm supposed to know there are individual beer names hanging not only above the bar seats, but also sticking out slightly over the seating where you have to get up to see them. I tell him I haven't been there before and wouldn't know those were there. I order the beer he suggested (Alstadt Kölsch) based off of me asking for Dos Equis. He asks if I want to open a tab and I say no. His response: \"Only one beer?\" with what may as well have been an eye roll. You would think with me telling someone that I'm a new patron the attitude would be better. He probably doesn't care since A) it probably isn't his business, B) I'm sure they have regulars and C) he was probably in a hurry to come outside to vape with his friends on the patio that says \"No Smoking\".  Side note: if you want to sit outside be prepared to listen to cornhole games underneath the same covering as the seating which causes it to echo so loud you can't hear your own conversation."

We decided to visit as they were not busy and were following the separation guidelines. The service is always friendly and it was even better on this visit. Our guest puppy was treated to snacks and fresh water. We sat on the covered patio and watched rerun sporting events and just enjoyed being outside.   I've been an LB patron since day 1 and I remember when it was difficult to find a local venue that offered a large variety of craft beer options.  LB has changed a lot of the years as they now serve cocktails and their patio has been expanded. Venues come and go (see Sheas and AJs across the street) but LB has a loyal following and has remained our go-to venue to have a brew or two and some pub grub.   It's a misnomer to call their food pub grub as you can order a pretty darn good pizza, meatball casserole, fried calamari, artichoke dip, or our favorite their homemade fried pickles. Yes, they pickle on site!   Nice folks, great beer, good cocktails (check out their specials), and food."

The hurricane that I order that was off of there board on drinks that they made was not a good drink.   The garlic bread we ordered was overdone and almost fully burnt on the bottom.   We ordered pizza also. One side was barely done while the other side was burnt. They put a lot of Italian season on top the pizza after it was cooked. Some times you just get a bite full of seasoning, not good.  First bits we thought the pizza had a good flavor but the more you ate the pizza the less tasty it was."

                "description": "Seek and ye shall find. This tiny hidden spot in old Leander checks off lots of my boxes - but doesn't impress. First off. This is a nice place dont get me wrong. I have been 3 times now just to see maybe it was an OFF day. Good menu , sports , decent tunes. So - those are pretty solid. Let me start with the menu. Pub grub for the most part with $10 pizzas unlimited toppings. So- naturally this is what i ordered each time. Each time it comes out it looks amazing and I'm excited. Like a Pointer Sister ( I 'm so excited ) . But the pizza never tastes cooked. The dough is mushy. Not a big deal. NExt time around I tell them to leave it in a bit longer for me. Comes out -- same. Not a deal breaker. Just need to change what I am eating. My belly prob says same thing. Next lets move onto the staff. For the most part the lady running the joint is on point. Friendly- helpful and witty. The remainder of the staff is quite the opposite. I have noticed this during a lunch visit with us being one of 2 people in the place, and in the evenings like during the sports games and crowds. Just abrasive . Again- I'm not there to make friends. I'm there to have a cold beer ( maybe 3) watch baseball or the slew of people who still have to think if they need to be wearing a mask when they enter an establishment( smh). So - The beer. They have a pretty typical tap list with 1-2 silver and gold medal choices. I saw Aldelberts there last night.. sweet!. But behind the bar is a ghostbuster lunchbox treasure chest of cans and bottles. WARNING! don't try to figure out what's in there. Hard to see them all... and after learning  how friendly the bar staff(see above ) is - I gave up asking and went with an IPA. The crowds are not bad and for the most part follow distancing rules.. but - nothing enforced. This scares me. While I know its MY choice to patron , I would still like to see ppl adhere to the 6ft. Outside- good seating - tv;s good parking and over all fantastic. I will prob go back, just not order the pizza and maybe try and get a spy camera behind the bar to see the other options as -- that's what life is all about. Options. Thanks for eating with me today, and I'll see you next time.  -M"

Once people started arriving the manager said she didn't have enough boxes to play the game I wanted all of a sudden. We had ubered to the bar and now are forced to leave. I guess there is a hierarchy in customers and you have to be important to be treated well. I'm baffled."

Something changed at the spot and for me no longer has that comfortable feel. Seems has if over serving is not monitored as you will have several loud and obnoxious folks who aren't being controlled.   This was the second night in a row that I was ignored while sitting at the bar and watching the bar tender hang at the end of the bar with is buddies.   What was once a nice calm place to eat and enjoy some craft beers is now a place for the high volume drinking and the vocally high volume people.  Bring back Luigi's for the food and leave everything else."

It has one of the best escargot in town, in my opinion. Our waitress was lovely and very knowledgeable. Unfortunately, we were seated inside and the music and noise level kept increasing over the evening.  They do have free parking at a fairly large lot across the street.  It was pretty expensive so this is definitely not an every-week-type-of-place but would generally go back for other special occasions."

                "description": "Not for me.   I appreciate that you can reserve outdoor tents for your party of 4-6 that have three sides fabric, one open to the common area. It looked like there was also a fan built in for the warmer months. I also appreciate that our reservation (which started at 6:15) let us stay at the table till 9:00 when the next reservation showed up. I feel like this is likely rare and due to the fact that we were a larger party drinking and eating a lot.   I didn't love the service - drinks took 30+ minutes to make it out to the table, yet over-attentive clearing staff kept trying to take the items that did arrive away long before they were finished. We also had to triple check on some dietary restrictions. From an accessibility standpoint the website and menu were nearly impossible to read.  If you don't have a reservation (or once it's over) you're welcome to hang out in the cabana area at the back, but it's 100% smoking, which was not great for some in our party.   It's worth noting 20% gratuity will be added to any party over six. With the prices as high as they are ($15 for a cup of soup), expect to drop $50+ easily eating here. Given the price vs quality of food, service, and prevalence of smoking I definitely won't be back. It was loved by many in my group, however, so I can understand why it has a strong following. Just not for me.  Also, if you're surprised that this place has over 1,100 reviews on Yelp yet remains unclaimed, here's a segment from their website that they wrote in response to a complaint: \"We're not corporate, and don't need to sanitize and compromise our ideas to please the masses... We're not the Olive Garden. Our outlook is that by trying to please everyone, you end up truly exciting no one. We may alienate some people, but we make other people happy, and in the meantime, we honor our own principles and imagination.\" Sounds great in theory, but does mean you get the \"go F yourself\" feeling from some of the staff. If you love that, you'll probably love Justine's."

No problem, we grabbed drinks at the bar but waited maybe 10 minutes and were offered a table! We were seated at a cabana like tent outside. There was even a little chandelier, super super cute. Service was fine.   The food was good and they had all of the obvious French dishes one would expect. The escargot was quite delish, especially the buttery garlic sauce. The complimentary bread was disappointing. I think it was stale, tough crust, chewy. I would have recommended dipping the bread in the escargot sauce otherwise. The beef tartare was great, looked and tasted fresh. Thought it was a little weird fries were sides for most dishes.   Parking was a little bit of a pain. There is a parking lot but it was full and muddy and I was in heels so I had to be dropped off outside the restaurant. There is street parking but seems that area gets busy."

It was a bit humid the evening we went, but they had fans blowing in our little tent-thing that helped. The decor (and all the PLANTS!) was gorgeous - I can see it being an amazing place for happy hour with the girls or a cute date night!   The food slapped. Notable dishes are the escargot - trust me and dip the complimentary bread in the leftover garlic butter. Just do it. We also loved the mussels, steak frites, and bolognese (AMAZING meat sauce). For drinks, their Paloma was very good.  My only critiques are 1) my ankles got eaten alive by mosquitos during dinner, which I can't blame on Justine. Just be aware if you're a mosquito magnet like me! 2) the service was kinda spotty and our server had an attitude when we asked for more bread (I feel like that's a pretty fair ask? We only asked for more bread one time."

I've stopped by a few times around dinner-time only for there to be an hour-long wait and on top of that, they don't take rezzies for two :(   Last night, we decided to stop by on a whim. We came a little bit later than usual around 9pm.   I thought the ambiance and the service was the most amazing thing. Justine's is an Austin gem!   We came in, put our name on the list and grabbed wine from the bar. We sipped under the green pagoda and then was seated where we promptly got started with apps (escargot and French onion soup). The Escargot was buttery, garlicky and French onion soup was absolutely spectacular! Please, everyone, try their French onion soup!   I had the Marmont rose which I was obsessed with (it has almond notes).   Through the entire visit - I never felt rushed. I'm usually mindful that restaurants want to turn over tables so I was quite shocked and pleasantly surprised when our server took our apps order, let us finish, and then took our entree orders. It was a slow and mindful pace and in a society that's \"go-go-go, \" this was refreshing.   For our entree, we ended up getting the steak frites, moules frites, and bologonese. The moules frites was my favorite entree.   If we were sitting and talking, our server would just pass by and let us relax. I appreciated the small niceties here.   I AM ABSOLUTELY OBSESSED WITH JUSTINE'S!"

Well seasoned and with tasty caper, minced onion, high quality olive oil and a vinegary flavor I could not place.   Escargot was excellent buttery/garlicky as expected.    Butter spread missed the mark. Was supposed to have sea urchin but that flavor and color was undetectable. Trout roe was nice but an ocerall mediocre dish for $15.  Steak tartare with ratatouille was good but not in the top that i have had. The chop was a little large and found some hard fat chunks that weren't edible. Ratatouille was nice but the vegetable colors were washed out brown more than vibrant.  Steak frites was an issue starting out because the online menu lists it as $40 yet on the handout menu it is $48. Online menu should be updated and current! Steak was cooked properly and tasty but somewhat chewy. Fries were heavy pepper flavor, not enough salt for my taste and was hoping they'd be cooked well and extra crispy but were not."

                "description": "I have to say I was looking forward to dining at Justine's for years and was utterly disappointed this past weekend. So let's talk about what went right first. I will say the mussels were pretty good and the wine selection was solid if you like French wine. Now let's discuss everything that went wrong. It started with ordering drinks at the bar while we waited for our table to be ready. I give them my partners credit card for a round of drinks then come back with no card? I tell the bartender that she didn't give me the card back and claims that she did...Needless to say my partner had to cancel his card only to get a phone call after we left that the bar had the card all along! What kind of establishment can't keep track of patrons cards then blatantly lie about giving it back? This experience alone put a huge damper on the night but to make it worse my partner hated his burger and the charcuterie board was less than appetizing so much we had to ask to take it off our bill. The menu wasn't also very descriptive on some of the menu items which probably led to some of the bad selections but the worst part of it all was how hot the dining area was. I guess we were sitting under some type of tent but there was absolutely no air circulation which in Austin can make for an uncomfortable dining experience. I expected far better quality given how expensive everything was so with such disappointment I can't recommend ever coming back here."

                "description": "We were excited to come to this spot after seeing it on a list of places to visit while in Austin and they just so happened to have reservations available tonight. We were seated promptly and ordered a bottle of wine recommended by our server which was great. We ordered quite a lot of dishes -- the escargots, grilled octopus, French onion soups, duck confit, steak tartare, and mussels. The food was very good and I especially enjoyed the escargots. However, the service was extremely slow and the food took a LONG time to arrive. After we had been served out appetizers and French onion soup, we waited almost 45 minutes for the entrees that didn't end up coming out, so we flagged down our server to ask if we could cancel as we were full and tired (it was almost 10pm and my friend was falling asleep at the table). Luckily, the manager came out and offered to box the food for us as well as gave us a discount on our bill. This is a cute little restaurant and the food was pretty good so I would definitely be inclined to give it a second chance the next time I'm back in Austin but I would probably have our server put in the whole order at the same time instead of waiting for intervals as we finished eating each course pretty fast and had to wait and wait for the next dishes to come out."

                "description": "Enjoyed my experience here but didn't find it to be exemplary. Parking is super confusing if it's your first time but their lot is right next to the Central Machine Works parking lot directly across the street from Justine's.   I ordered the French 75 to drink and the octopus and escargot as appetizers. The cocktail was good but nothing special; very sweet and I was expecting bubbles considering the champagne but my drink was served in a martini glass rather than a champagne flute and not fizzy at all. The octopus was good but again, not spectacular. I wouldn't order it again. The escargot unfortunately smelled better than it tasted. They were good but what made them better was dipping the complimentary bread in the butter they sat in.   For dinner, I ordered the poisson béarnaise. The market fish was cod and the market price was $32. I thought this dish was pretty spectacular. Served with a delightful béarnaise sauce that was creamy, frothy, rich, and a little bit sweet, I couldn't get enough. I was straight up dunking everything on my plate (veggies, fish, everythingg) in the sauce. I even dipped some bread in it and it made anything chefs kiss amazing. The waitress even said the herbs in the sauce came straight from their garden! I thought the veggies that accompanied the fish were great and the cod was good as well. However, I found myself wishing it were a more sophisticated fish on the plate for the price point.  Overall, had a good time. I would consider visiting again but foregoing the apps/cocktails and heading straight for the entree."

We had quite a number of celebrations in June and July , which were incredible... we recently went back with a few friends this past week... I guess we have never gone during the week because we didn't recognize the hostess... her attitude almost ruined it, she snapped at my friend and said she was organizing the seating and made us feel like we were an inconvenience ... she seemed overwhelmed by the heat, grumpy... lucky the other younger hostess changed the energy , talked about her favorite mezcal cocktails and walked us to our table."

                "description": "Surprised it took me so long to go to Justine's, I know that it's a favorite restaurant of two of my close friends who swear by it.  I went on a Thursday night and was promptly seated at one of the outdoor cabanas. It was quite nice, except there are always bugs flying around outdoors, perhaps netting would be a smart idea. I also added more privacy by closing more of the cabana curtains facing other guests.  Started off the night with with the house red wine to put myself in a pleasant mood. Very good for a house wine.  To start, had the saumon cru appetizer. Can't go wrong with this, delicious and recommended.  I personally ordered the Steak Frites and was unfortunately disappointed. The frites were over fried to the point it was too crunchy. I ordered medium rare for the steak but it cooked a bit longer than needed and I found it rough and tough.  What saved the night was the Moules Frites. The frites were still over fried but the mussels were absolutely delectable. The flavor of the broth is rich and goes well with the taste of the sea from the mussels. This will definitely be ordered again if I were to come back."

The staff wasn't very friendly at all and of course didn't have good customer service quality's.  The lighting inside was very dim and dark - more like a bar setting but the variety of appetizers was great. The D.J. was playing some good tunes and when our food came out - They had the best wings and Cheese Waffle fries. We had a couple of drinks and ordered a couple more appetizers but then we saw the WORST - A RAT ran above us on the beams and then my husband and cousin saw another RAT in front of him running along the opposite end!!!  And we all know if there is 1/2 rats their are more to follow. Obviously this is an issue that they are aware of. Needless to say we grabbed our stuff and left! I felt so disgusted and nauseous!!!  Coming out the restaurant we met a couple (locals) outside and they told us they have heard as well about infestation of rats. So if your looking for a good restaurant- Don't come here!!!"

I would go back for sure, pretty cool atmosphere as well.  When I went I had done research and everything. There are other places to go to but, this was the best for a Sunday. I arrived just a bit before happy hour and enjoyed myself.  I had the Jackalope burger and it was plenary to eat. With the toppings I didn't even need anything else. I usually get honey mustard and mayo, I didn't need it but, I did put mayo on it. There were plenty of pickles and the burger meat was tasty.   I had a frozen margarita, the frozen was out after that and I switched to a hibiscus margarita. I know your thinking hibiscus flower, yea it was even pretty like the flower. I also had the huge Heldarado as well. Man let me tell you now have a few people would help you finish but it was good.   It was just great company we had fun there I met a couple cool people there and it was rememberable. It's kind of what we are looking for when we go out to eat or something. The server was good even when they switched out for shifts, the only thing I will get you don't want us they could use a few more extra service. Great experience I definitely go back."

                "description": "Food was good when it came out correctly but had to send back what was put in the computer versus what I asked for.    Tonight October 30, 2021. I put a food order in for honey jalapeño wings, an order of waffle fries and a dos xx draft. Total came to 22 and was given order number 80 around 8:00 Pm. Order came out as a burger and side of fries which after checking your menu, should've only been 14$ plus what ever the beer was which I'm sure isn't 8$ for a draft beer in a plastic cup.   I informed the food runner it should've been wings and he showed me where the food was rung in as a burger instead, no harm no foul a simple misunderstanding or so I thought. The bartender who rang it in informed me I ordered a burger when I \"shouted\" my order at him and said I like that with fries. By my calculations, if I did intact order the burger with a side of fries it should've been 11.5 for burger plus 2.5 for fries. Not almost 16 I'm assuming plus 6$ for a dosxx.   I get it it's Halloween weekend. But if you can't fully hear the order then just make sure with customer before finalizing and putting order in and over charge them if in fact you thought I ordered a burger. But also don't give attitude when customer asks for the wings and believes the wings only come with 8 like you PDF menu states. Not from Austin but will not be back anytime soon. Unfortunately I paid in cash or I would ask for a refund for the difference because I'm entitled to that I believe. I understand customer isn't always right. But food costs can't be that high that you need to argue about the wrong button being pressed on your end.   And yes this is the exact same review I sent to the contact us for on the website, I'm sure nothing will change with how orders are put in on busy nights, but just make sure you get your itemized at this establishment so that you know before you walk away from bar."

                "description": "IF I COULD GIVE THIS PLACE ZERO STARS - I WOULD.   DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU ARE TRYING TO HAVE A GOOD TIME.   We came here during a BACHELORETTE.  I understand circumstances are weird due to COVID-19.  I get that. We ALL get that. We are in Austin visiting for our best friends bachelorette and on our second night here we decided to take the advice from our waiter at Caroline's and go to The Jackalope.  We went there at 9pm just to check it out and our bartender, Bart, gave us complimentary drinks. We were so thankful, we paid for the giant mixed drink and went next door for a few hours and then went back to The Jackalope because the bride requested it. We sat down for 20 minutes even ordered some drinks (which they never brought) and they were playing the jams -- so naturally we started dancing around our table.   Even the other bartender, Dimitrius, was hitting on one of our bridesmaids HEAVILY and hanging around with us while we were dancing - not even one whole song went by before Dimitrius told us we couldn't be dancing and that we needed to be in our seats. We said okay, that sucks but sure. So we sat down and made sure our butts where planted -- next thing you know some random came up to us and started twerking at our table then on jumped on the couch and started twerking and spreading her legs in the air. Again - SHE WAS NOT WITH US. None of us even knew who she was. Immediately, some angry bartender (that clearly needs to get laid) with a ponytail ran over to us being loud and demanding that WE get out meanwhile Twerker conveniently slinks on back to her table    I can understand if we were the ones doing THAT and you wanted to kick us out - FINE.  But that was not the case. No one wanted to even hear us out, one of our bridesmaids does not drink and she was very civil in trying to explain to Ponytail Bartender but he literally was non-stop raising his voice to us. He even yells at Bart to come over - and this fool just straight up decides to \"go with his boys on this one\" and preceded to gesture us to get out  Ponytail could not WAIT to kick us out, let me tell you. Like there's some underlying issues there  He yelled at us saying \"You're not even ordering drinks! You're not even ordering food!!!\" NOPE. Wrong again, Ponytail.   We DID order food and drinks but your stubborn hating ass didn't accommodate us  Meanwhile Twerker (aka THE PROBLEM) is still running rampant inside the bar   Also, the pink haired lady was GOD AWFUL. Not helpful whatsoever.  Bart you were the biggest disappointment, and Ponytail -- you just suck. Thank you for ending our night horribly and giving us a HORRIBLE first trip experience.   I do not recommend this place whatsoever for anyone who is looking to actually have a good time."

I wanted to get a drink and I was hesitant to order something to eat. This place looks old and it has a funny bathroom smell but aye so many good yelp reviews so why not. I got the wings and the fries and was super impressed. The mango jalapeño I think was really fresh and good and the fries where hot. I would go back and im sure once this Covid is over it would be a live bar as well."

They have multitude of whiskeys and beers to pick from.  Plus the outdoor seating and dog friendly atmosphere make this a chill spot for mingling with friends or soaking in the awesomeness of the state capital of Texas.  They also sell awesome shirts.  Sadly the Excite Bike shirt I saw the bartender rocking wasn't available so I settled for the blue shirt.  Please get more of those in!  The Wheel, keep on spinning!"

Came today to have a celebratory vaccine cocktail. It looks like they used to have a $4 whisky of the day... well, it's now $5 but the winning bet is to make it as a cocktail for $8. An $8 old fashioned? Can't say I'm mad about that. Jenny behind the bar was super friendly and I gotta say it's nice to sit at an actual bar again."

The bartenders are cool folks with lots of great knowledge. The music isn't too loud - a good volume for talking but still bumping :-)  Unfortunately though... its quite expensive, and the staff isn't super transparent about the pricing. For instance, the whiskey of the day is supposed to be $5. I got it with ice, and was charged an extra dollar. This might be trivial, but it sucks getting charged without warning, especially for something that shouldn't get an upcharge (even if the on-the-rocks pour is slightly more liquid)... kinda like getting charged for napkins. And in general, everything's pretty pricey for a neighborhood bar.  I guess I'm a little too old school for all the new hotness in Austin. But I don't see any reason to visit The Wheel when you have so many other places that are both inexpensive and cool."

No TV, limited beer selection that runs out quickly (both IPA kegs tapped out on a random Tuesday night), and no food.  You come here to let the night get away from you and order some strong cocktails.  Lots of outdoor space is cool and bring your own food is actually a plus in my book.  Beer selection 8 on draft, but good prices at $7/ish per big pour.  Everyone is nice and vibe seems 20s-30s clientele. I liked the Wheel for what it is, a good starting point nearby my apartment to begin a drinking night."

The bartenders are extremely friendly and seemed genuinely interested in conversation beyond just your tip.   They definitely specialize in cocktails so I would probably look elsewhere if you are looking for a nice draft or bottle of Shiner. I had 2 different specialty cocktails, both of which were good but definitely on the pricier side ($10-$15 each).   They have a large patio space for meeting up with friends and the indoor bar is intimate enough to make it a decent  first date spot worth checking out."

Ok, so this place is just super adorbs in a very approachable, contempo-rustic, \"shhhh, don't tell anyone or else the ubiquitous \"they\" will ruin it for the rest of us\" kinda way.   The barkeeps know their stuffs, their cocktails are legend (wait for it) dary without the arrogance or pretension you might expect from a place of this caliber; I think the lack of self-importance this place and the staff exude is one of my favorite things about it!  If you are looking for a low-key place to drink handcrafted, amazing cocktails (the Madison, I'm just saying) in front of a draught-tap water fountain amidst a menagerie of interesting EastSide Austin folk, then come here and enjoy (you can even have ADP delivered!). Just please remember...mum's the word, the password changes daily, and if fratty bros or hipsters catch wind of this place...I will look for you, I will find you, and I will give you the spiciest side-eye of your life!"

It is located off Martin Luther King right next to the Austin daily Press.  The inside bar are is small and quaint.  I love the side patio and this is where I spent a beautiful evening sipping on some cocktails and enjoying a sandwich which was delivered from next door.  I had the Molly and the Layla cocktails and both were excellent, refreshing and went down nice and smooth.  The patio has a gorgeous fountain with tons of beer taps spouting out water ... it was cool and creative feature to the atmosphere.    The bartenders here are super nice and professional!

The bar tenders are super friendly and the place is eclectic, dark and decorated in a vintage style. They also have the best t-shirts I have ever seen at a bar.

The indoor area is intimate, dimly lit, and has a sort of prohibition-era bar feel with its tin ceiling, newspaper clipping wallpaper, and red lighting. Outside, you'll find a large patio with lots tables, and a great fountain made from beer taps. The drinks... well, my beer was way too expensive for what it was (a fairly generic IPA), and their selection for beers was limited (on draft: 8 taps, 1 IPA). HOWEVER, I know that's mainly due to the fact that The Wheel's specialty is whiskey. If whiskey's your drink of choice, I'm sure you'll love it here. They have $4 daily specials, and a number of specialty cocktails.  I'm glad I gave it a shot, and I'll definitely recommend it to my whiskey drinking friends, but if you're looking for anything besides whiskey (or maybe a nice cocktail) I'd steer you elsewhere."

                "description": "Techo Mezcaleria and Agave Bar is a great speakeasy on Manor Rd. If you are a fan of mezcal and/or tequila, this is the place for you. Small bar with a patio too (with a heater). Ian is a great bartender and took care of us. You should definitely try the \"stuff in a cup\" (Ian's favorite mezcal cocktail with passion fruit). The spicy mango mezcal margarita was also enjoyable or you can sip one too. Great spot to to ring in the new year."

                "description": "This place is very confusing on how to actually fine. I thought it was connected to meet Madrid. But it is not. Actually go next-door and then to their backyard and then go up and you are at the spot. It's very small it's almost gives you a speakeasy feel. The bartenders were super cool and we really enjoyed our time there. It was a group of seven of us and we took up most of the bar. Drinks are very good as well. If you're not a tequila fan this is not for you but you should still try to experience it at least once. They have frozen on the rocks and other delicious cocktails."

                "description": "LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! I have been driving by Techo everyday for years, and we frequent the area for the other restaurants and bars, but for some dumb reason beyond comprehension, we never gave them a try. We are completely hooked now! The space is cozy, intimate, and inviting. The drinks are just out of this world, and SO strong! The flavors are unique, and even if you aren't a mezcal fan, some of the drinks completely cover up what's even in it! They had a cool nook tucked away next to the bar that we are hoping to sit in once things open back some more, and we would love to hang out inside and enjoy their cool vibe inside! The patio is tucked away upstairs, and even though it's in a busy area right along the street, you don't even notice! They have TONS of misting fans outside that made the 102 degree heat totally tolerable for once!   They had dog bowls out, so I would venture to say they are dog friendly, which we plan to take advantage of very soon!"

I had their mezcal margarita and the flavor was so good, I will definitely be back!"

                "description": "I hesitate to write this review because I love that Techo currently feels like a secret, locals only Mezcal bar. But they have my favorite margarita in town, incredible ambiance and authentic tasting experiences - that you just have to KNOW about it. This is the first bar I bring visitors too - usually right when they open, so we can snag seats at the bar and get guided Mezcal tastings from Techo's very knowledgeable and easygoing staff. I never leave without ordering at least one of their Frozen Guava Agave Margaritas with the chili salt rim (do NOT pass on the home-made chili salt, it is the perfect pair for this sweet/tart drink).  Every one of my girlfriends love that drink! My boyfriend also loves that he can get a strong mezcal centered cocktail from their list (which has 10-12 house cocktails that are great). Their Micheladas are also a crowd fave.   When you start to get hungry - walk to Salty Sow for happy hour apps or down to Patrizi's to share some crazy good home-made Italian food from a food truck! You'll have a line at Patrizi's - but it's a great option for your visiting friends, who have probably never had an Italian food truck experience."

Tried my first mezcal margarita there and have a new favorite cocktail (normally prefer an old fashioned).   Fried crickets are a nice add on as well.   Will definitely go back. A date might be more impressed by this than another random brewery!"

                "description": "Techo Mezcaleria reminds me of why I still love Austin: the unusual, hidden gems that are tucked away all around the city.  Most other folks already hit the highlights. It's tiny, seats maybe 10, and you enter through the Schoolhouse Pub gate, despite Techo actually being on the second story of Mi Madres. Word of caution: Mezcal ranges from \"lightly smoky\" to \"I'm drinking liquid smoke.\" Personally it's not something I can have a lot of, we had three sample sized shots and that was plenty between the two of us. Just be forewarned.   Our bartender Ian was awesome, we had a nice, rambling forty minute conversation about mezcal versus tequila versus whisky. Unfortunately, we went on a Saturday when there wasn't a happy hour, so we didn't get a chance to sample the margaritas, but that gives us a great excuse to go back."

I feel everyone gave him the \"just a dumb drunk pass\" but the more I think about it the more I think if he was drunk like that maybe he shouldn't have been served anymore or asked to leave. Also this was around 6-8pm not your average time for people to be so belligerent. Drink pictured is the violeta."

They have a good sized drink menu and also offer frozen drinks, which is always a fun addition.   They have a fantastic selection of Mezcal and Tequila and it's a fantastic spot for a date because they have a few nooks inside great for a few to sit. The ambience is also very romantic-very dim inside with lots and lots of candles everywhere. The place itself is upstairs of SchoolHouse (there are stairs outside to the right of the restaurant). It is pretty small, only seating maybe 20 inside and about the same outside.   However, worst case scenario if you arrive and they're packed you can head downstairs to SchoolHouse for a drink!  This is a must visit and will impress others when you introduce them to a what-feels-like hidden gem."

The inside is dark and mysterious, I really liked all the Jesus candles.  PS - don't be deceived by the bathroom, the door is tiny but the bathroom behind it is pleasantly large."

We did request \"Complicated\" by Avril Lavigne, which did stump them.

Just like it says, two pianos and two piano players (and sometimes additional musicians) taking song requests for $ that they'll try to play to the best of their ability while also entertaining the audience.  Beware that if they hear you are celebrating something you might be called up to perform.  The fun and liveliness of the crowd and music are infectious."

                "description": "First. USE THE YELP DEAL FOR DISCOUNT ON THE COVER!  Dueling pianos are a must for anyone who has never tried the experience. It's definitely something you need to do in a group.   Make sure to remember a few key items before you head out here. First, don't forget the cash! Request are taken by writing down your song title and artist on a piece of provided piece of paper. But no request is complete without some cash along with it. You'll be hard pressed to get your song played without it. But $$ doesn't always guarantee your request, as what happened with our group when we requested some seemingly common tunes - Streets of Bakersfield was out top request. In fact we requested a few times with several dollars. But nothing.   The vibe here was fantastic. Most everyone participated and it was just an overall great time.   As the night progressed the crowds grew and it became super crowded. So much that I started to get a little claustrophobic and anxious that I needed some air.   I will say that most of the tunes were similar. And we heard Journey probably 4 times in 2 hours. I wouldn't expect the musicians to repeat, but whatever!   Come here for an hour or two and call it good. Anything more and you'll get repeat performances."

My gals checked into Yelp and only paid $3 for admission. Thanks, Yelp! I'm a huge fan of dueling piano bars and this was definitely one of favorites. The piano players are definitely talented and can play a wide range of songs. The crowd interactions were fun and I just sung my heart away for an hour or so. It gets really crowded so it can get a little cozy with your neighbor, if you can find a table. Despite all of this, I would still go again. I did request a song but the piano players didn't know how to play it so that was a little disappointing.   The next time in Austin, I'll definitely want to pay Pete's another visit!"

Some of the pianists played the drums as well!! We used the yelp check-in to save on the entrance fee. They serve alcohol only. I didn't see any table with food. We ordered our drinks from the bar coz we didnt see a lot of servers. We will be back when we go to Austin again!"

                "description": "First time visiting a Dueling Piano Bar and I was amazed even though there were things that could have been better.   The performers are very talented. They could play multiple instruments and sing all kinds of songs.   There was a $3 cover fee on a Tuesday night. We stayed from 9-12pm and there were probably around 10 people in total. Getting charged to enter into a pretty empty bar was a bit bazaar not to mention that we also needed to tip to get our songs picked by them.   I asked for Taylor Swift's Forever and Always. At first, the guy performer asked me if I wanted to wait until the lady performer comes out since he didn't know how to sing that. Then once the lady performer came out, she sorta ignored (or due to some miscommunication) the song, and we had to tip her again for her to see the song and sing it. It turned out that she didn't know how to sing it either. It was understandable that they couldn't know every single songs out there. I would appreciate more if they communicated better about this so that it could avoid us tipping the second time.  The drinks selection was sorta limited.   I can see this place being very lively on weekends as other people described. But I would not come back on a weekday. Definitely want to come back on a weekend again."

They're dog-friendly (with treats) and have both indoor/outdoor seating. They also had TV that was playing soccer, and strong wifi. I love that they have flight options 4 for $10, as well as pints. It wasn't busy when we stopped through on a Saturday afternoon. They don't have food here, but if you ask the taptender...he'll tell you what food options are nearby.  Service was kind and efficient. Their beers were across the board--good. My favorite was their Aine Hefe! It was floral and super crisp for the warm weather after a long hike. They seem to do a lot of English style ales, which aren't my favorite...but you can definitely find options that suit your taste buds. They also give free stickers upon request. BOOM!"

I was actually surprised to see them so decently priced this far out in the hill country.   They do provide half pours in their standard sized glasses, just make sure to ask for a half pour when you order. I was happy to see they allow food from the outside as well which makes staying easier as you can bring your snacks in haha.  Not on overly crazy amount of seating, but definitely enough for 5-6 medium/large parties. They also seemed to follow the trend of allowing owners to bring their dogs inside which is always cool and fun to see.  They also have merchandise for sale and their shirts are super sick...did I mention their logo absolutely rocks!?"

Careful with that last one, it's delicious, but at 11.4% ABC, more than one can sneak up on you pretty quickly.   Acopon just had a really great vibe, and the fact that it's dog friendly is icing on the cake."

Located in Dripping Springs and in a small space felt right.  On the day we visited they had 4-5 beers on tap I believe.  I'm a larger guy, so a Bellibone was ordered up for me.  Suz got an English Bitter Gaspipes.  I enjoyed my larger, it was crisp and cool. This is a great nod to Emil Christian Hansen and the use of his Saccharomyces Pastorianus, which he first isolated in 1904.  A year before the greatest footy team in the world, Chelsea FC was started.  And he was also a Dane.  Suzie drank her Bitter and coo'ed.  We would of stayed longer, but staring a gigantic Manchester City flag was making me ill.  Just Kidding Dudes, I'm still ill after that 6 goal slacking you gave us this past February.  Drop in, grab a pint.  Bring the pup and stay awhile."

The Homunculus is a mild english ale that is so light but dense with flavor it could be dubbed king of session drinking. The Rowan was complex and well balanced, dank and rich while the Rat King DIPA may well  be the best one I have had in a very long time, where the malts are less weighty or chocolate but more supportive. Well done! Forget any reviews that call out IPA snobs, Stout heads or wherever you are from, there is something for every beer lover here."

Their goal is to have at least one ale available from a fresh cask each week.  Are English ales their sole focus?  Definitely not! There are a variety quality brew styles.  You will find them here.  Their specialty though will be ales.  Acopon is just a stones throw down the street from the Barber shop in downtown historic Dripping Springs. On the Sunday afternoon I ventured here, this was a quiet and sleepy part of town. The tasting room and production are located in the same small historic building. The tasting room is comfortable, and inviting.  It feels lived in, like a proper English drinking hole should.  A nice change from the hipster modern sleek brewery tasting rooms popping up all over Austin.  The staff member behind the bar was knowledgeable and friendly.  They also have canned mead, cider, and wine options for non beer drinkers.  Outside food is welcomed.  They have some tables available outside to sit at, and are dog friendly.  I enjoyed one of their flights.  All of the beers in my flight were well structured.  I liked some better than others.  The Rowan was a stand out for me.  Good solid beers."

A longer review: We were there during the Songwriters' Festival so this may explain the plastic cups, even so, if you care about your beer you can't serve it in a plastic cup. It defeats the whole purpose. But, looking beyond that, the few beers we tried were good. I particularly liked the porter.  The service was slow with three people behind the bar but it seemed that only one person was really doing the work. (There was a younger lady behind the bar but as far as I could see all she did was stand there and scowl at people.) So, a mixed experience. We'll probably try it again (I suspect the beer really is good) when there isn't a festival going on, and hopefully have a drink in a real glass."

They had a wonderful live duo-band outside, but so wished there were more seating to enjoy it.  My ONLY constructive feedback for the owners is to offer (more) simple snack options - and, most importantly, provide LEMONS!  I just love craft beer with lemons. They had zero, so I'll chalk it up to new beginnings!  Worth a stop to have a unique cold one!

First noticed the harsh increase in wing prices (before the shortage) a couple years ago. I understand prices increase, inflation blah blah.   But they used to advertise it as wing Wednesday, and they were cheaper that day. And it was fun. Now, the overpriced wings come out with very little sauce, and the sauce tastes/looks different than what it used to?(referring to blazing sauce, my fav.) Meh, guess the crowd is changing."

                "description": "I finally got a chance to checkout Cat's infamous hideout, and it did not disappoint. It's the typical neighborhood dive bar that I expected it to be, but that's not a bad thing.  Some of the best things happen in a place like this!  TRUST me, it's nothing but fun, fun, fun, with a capital F-U-N!  It's a good place to do some day drinking, or hang out until the wee hours of the morn'.  As Tina R said in her review, lots of interesting characters lurk in this place.  Including \"that\" guy who likes to butt into your conversation, and then carry the conversation and not give anyone else a chance to talk.  But I won't dock 'em a star for that.  Every neighborhood bar has \"that\" guy in it.  It's a package deal.  Inside is kind of dark and it takes a minute for your eyeballs to adjust if you enter during the daytime. But after a few minutes, all is well and you'll soon be jamming out to the old school jukebox. You won't find any Touch Tunes here folks - yes, it still uses CDs (who would have imagined CDs would ever be considered old school?).  Here's the most important part of this review before I blather on with all of the interesting factoids:  If you learn nothing else this year, learn this my young Padawans: Many people say it's hard to find, so here's a tip - if you cross the railroad tracks on the access/frontage road, you have just passed it.  Turn right on the last street that you see right BEFORE you get to the tracks, and then take another right turn into the parking lot.  DON'T cross the railroad tracks!  There's a decent outdoor patio with plenty of picnic tables, and a few of them are shaded.  10 dollar minimum for using a credit card (pet peeve of mine).  Wi-Fi password \"cheapdr1nks\" all in lower case.  12 local and regional craft beers on tap (I counted).  They have about 30 brews in cans and bottles, most of them are from the ATX or at least regional.  The big name brews are only available in bottles and cans, not on tap.  It's a little pricey for a dive bar - pints of Thirsty Goat were 4.50  Full bar - liquor and eraythang!  Six TVs, and a large projector screen (yes I counted).  Yes, they do have food - I didn't partake, but they have tacos, a couple of salads, burgers, sammiches, and the usual bar appetizers.  Every one of the picnic tables on the patio has Cat's name carved in it (she's the current duchess but has fled the city, so it won't last long. Get out there and claim it boys and girls).  Rumor has it that this picnic table vandalism is why she had to leave the ATX, but who knows the real truth?"

                "description": "I love wing wednesday! They have great wings and all sorts of flavors. They do charge you for everything, which is quirky. It's not expensive at all, so it's really not upsetting. Just a funny thing I noticed. You're charged for condiments and celery. When you're paying 75 cents for wings and cheap drinks, it's a drop in the bucket.   The patio is great and so lively. It is fairly busy. I would even suggest getting there as early as possible because parking is limited. There is a weird gravelly lot for overflow parking, but I have a little sedan and not a 4-wheeler to get over the ditch that is there.  They do allow smoking outside, so if you're sensitive to that then the patio is not for you. At first it bothered me, but had a great time catching up with friends and eating up those wings!"

Its divey dark spot with plenty of room to chill and hang out. The bartenders were cute, funny and poured some very nice drinks. The long island is only 6 bucks and they had a host of cheap drinks but thats what we were drinking. Now...onto the fooood.  The wings...wangs...were delicious! I got the spicy BBQ and my friend got lemon pepper both well done (I hate a soggy wing). The only downside is that for 7 bucks you only get like 5...well damn! However I saw that they have a wing special every wednesday for like 25 cents or something like that so don't quote me.  Will have to come back on a wednesday."

                "description": "So we are in Austin for a family holiday because daughter #2 has a home 4x the size of ours (for the same amount of money!) But I digress...  Daughter #1 is here, too. She once lived in in Austin for a minute; but that was five years ago and so much has changed since then.   She asked to go somewhere quintessentially Austin. Not much of that left, especially in the northern parts, but we researched a bit and came up with The Hideout Pub.   Only juke box music during our visit, so not sure if they ever have live music, which we were hoping for. Regardless, the drinks were good and CHEAP. I mean $5.50 for a Moscow Mule cheap. And that's not even Happy Hour price.   We also had burgers. The Austin burger, ($13) with grilled onions, mushrooms and goat cheese, to which I added the sweet and delicious Moonshine BBQ sauce. Big burgers that come with fries, onion rings, tater tots, salad or chips and salsa. I got the onion rings, she ordered the tots. Both delicious. We couldn't finish our meals and brought half of it home.   Atmosphere is strictly dive bar. Love it! But not \"biker bar\" as I saw it described somewhere. Dark, low lighting, neon, plain seating, wood floors, tv screens all around. There's also an outdoor, multilevel seating area.   Our server was as sweet as pie, with a faint cute accent to boot. Mixed crowd, mostly keeping to themselves.   New neighborhood if this was my permanent neighborhood."

So far I've had burgers, grilled chicken sandwiches, and fish-and-chips that were all above average for dive bar fare. Well-made drinks and a good selection of beer round things out.   Plenty of TVs tuned to different games as well as non-sports stuff, so everyone has a corner to gravitate towards if they wish. Servers are smart, friendly, and efficient.  I'd be here more often if they welcomed dogs in their outdoor area, but aside from that gripe there's not too much to find fault with here... cheers, and see you there!"

I always ask for extra crispy and they did not disappoint. We also got a burger with fries and onion rings. Burger was great but huge. The onion rings were so crispy; probably close to the best I've ever had. The place is really dark and play some questionable and loud music though. They do have a large outdoor patio that gets kind of busy when it's warm but there's usually always somewhere to sit! I definitely recommend this place, it's a great option to the trendy touristy places that are all around Austin. True neighborhood bar."

My only criticism would be that beer shouldn't be served in a small (almost) wine glass at $9/beer. That's just too rich that it limits me to one.  If it were a pint the value would be better. Four Stars instead of Five."

                "description": "Straight outta Belgium! I love it!  I popped by this place for a beer and found it interesting that I previously and unknowingly walked right past when meeting friends at the TexMex joint next door.  Service here was great during the day - when I stopped in. I presume the guy running the bar was the owner but didn't get into a convo about that. He appeared to have moved from San Francisco a few years back from what I gathered and he was very beer knowledgeable which made for my sour selection.  We spoke of some other sours in the area and such. He was a genuine guy having a genuine conversation. That small chatter right there made me feel like I could call this a regular watering hole in a town usually piled high with trendy pop-ups.  He celebrated 3 yrs just recently and I can see why he's still here. It reminds me of a small establishment I visited in Brussels last year right adjacent to Mannekin Pils (the famous peeing baby statue for those unaware). It had a sense of community and Mort Subite also has that. Maybe it's a Belgium thing but I felt like I was right back there when I sat here.  I really enjoyed myself here and although I had but one drink (i was doing my own beer exploration day), I will be back."

                "description": "Great talk bar with inviting, chill atmosphere and access to the only Belgian beer pipeline in the state, iirc. Like all bars, the bartenders set the standard and, hence, the five star review. Anthony and Piper are a great team and are professional, warm and inviting with customers. The draft beer selection is exceptional and you'd be hard pressed to find an equal rival in the city. Directly across the street from Elephant Room on Congress and 3rd, you get a great mix of residents and tourists, alike. There's outdoor seating both in the front and back (including a solid American fare trailer in the back -- good philly cheesesteak). But I digress, it's all about the ambiance, beer and good people at Mort's."

                "description": "The only thing good about this place was the variety of Belgian Beer, which is what they're known for. They had 2 of our favorites, 1 of which is incredibly hard to find in Austin, La Trappe. I do appreciate the beers in the proper glass. The front patio gives nice European vibes. However, the service is horrible. I wish I had gotten her name, tall thin woman, medium length blonde hair. Very rude and short with our group, the birthday boy with us had questions and she wasn't happy to help. She told him to stop talking in the middle of their conversation. Then when we went to close our tab the bill was $135 for 4 beers. Four beers, by the glass. Now some of the beers are pricier than others since they're imported but we were aware of that as the prices are listed on the chalk board behind the bar. We also don't mind paying good money for quality beer. We questioned the tab and the person behind the bar investigated and said the tall thin woman, who was short with us earlier, charged us for the two large bottles of some vintage or specialty bottle, which is not what we ordered nor what she served. She eventually fixed the tab but it was a very sketchy 'mistake' and the entire experience was memorable in a terrible way. We will not be back and are disappointed since we went in very excited to try it out. I don't recommend this bar."

Can't believe I haven't seen this place while walking around dt.. a real hidden gem if you're looking for Belgian beers.  They have a nice selection of Belgian ales on tap, most I had never heard of which was nice to be able to try all new things. They also have some higher % beers in the frig which appear to be some of their fancier ones, eager to have a go at these next time.   Real cool spot, good for going in and trying some new Belgians to get an idea for this particular subset of beers, right in the heart of Austin."

                "description": "This place gets two-stars because of their selection. Being from Belgium, I enjoy looking up places in America and Mort Subite might be the only Belgian place in Austin.  To my big disappointment, besides the selection they have, there's not much attraction for a native to come here, unless you want a badly poured beer and rude service.  The first time I came to Mort Subite I can no longer remember, probably because it was underwhelming but after a lot of people told me to go there as a Belgian, I figured to give it another chance as I was pretty excited to have a La Chouffe on draft. When I noticed that the bartender was pouring this high ABV beer wrong, I asked him if I could give him some advice on how to pour it better. His answer was simply \"no\" and walked away while he handed my my check. Completely mesmerized, I still tipped him, and walked away. When I explained to my friend what happened, he said I needed to have given context.  So I went back in, ordered another La Chouffe and as soon as he placed the glass under the tap, not holding or tilting it, I apologized for earlier and asked him again if I could give some advice as a Belgian who has had many years experience working in bars. He immediately stopped the pour and  looked at me. When I explained him to hold the glass, tilt it and pour the beer on the spot where your finger is, and how that technique is very common and necessary to pour high ABV beer, he just stared me dead in the eye and continue to pour as he started, wasting a lot of beer and giving me a shitty poured beer.  I send management an email since I thought that they would love to be aware about this before I put anything online but after almost a two weeks of no response, I feel obligated to share this experience."

They also have an Indian food truck behind their outdoor beer garden.  Delicious food that goes surprisingly well with the Belgian beer."

Came in on a cold Wed January evening and my friend and I, save for whom I can only assume was a regular, were the only ones in the bar.  The bartender was very friendly and appreciated that we concurred on beer suggestions for my friend.   I really loved that they serve the beers in their correct respective glassware (especially the Kwak, which is worth ordering for the glass apparatus alone!).  The prices per serving are a bit on the higher-end of the Belgian Beer spectrum from other bars I have had the same beers at, but honestly,  I liken this sitch to the line from \"The Prince and Me\"...\"you can really taste the extra 10 cents\".   For a place that's French for 'Sudden Death', it isn't nearly all that intesnse, but when I had my first pour of their Gulden Draak 9000 Quad, I did kinda feel like I'd died and gone to Belgian Beer heaven!"

Again, takes a long time to get served as each pour is perfect and looks delicate.  Menu doesn't change often on draft and was 90% the same.  However, this is some of the freshest draft Belgians I've ever had, and have some rare varieties that you mainly only see in bottles.  Prices are very high and 150% of any other bar in town, but this is the quality stuff and high abv.  Now that they have a food truck out back with some good looking Indian, Mort Subite might be worth adding to my list of usuals when in that Belgian mood.  You should expect a long wait at the bar, high bill, but overall a great beer pour."

The staff is also a big reason I keep coming back.  I just finished my first run through the Big 50 Club (50 different drafts) and there is more on tap than just those on that list.  Pretty cool!  They don't have food, but the pizza place next door delivers to your table--a slice, whole pie, salads, fries, chips n queso, wings, chicken fingers, subs, etc...so it's not only pizza.  Outstanding!"

                "description": "Laid back atmosphere. Good beers/drinks. Nothing fancy, doesn't cater to one click or another. This location is new and they have it worked out fairly well. Only minor rub is that the outside patio gets direct sun, which is going to be a bit of bitch in the dead of summer, but for now it's fine. Outdoor bar, plenty of screens.  \"Jukebox\" (fancy MP3 player is nice). Allows you to bump something that is playing that isn't quite to your liking. Drink prices are fair for sure considering most watering holes are serving watered down and overpriced cough syrup.  This place is clean and seems well kept. The manager is almost constantly walking the place and fixing things. They went out of there way to find me an outlet to charge my phone.   Note: Pet friendly even having a water bowl for your four legged family as needed. Just please mind the leash, one guys dropped his momentarily to grab a beer and his dog tore through the kitchen/bar area, it was hilarious."

To the juvenile waitress with an attitude: you're in customer service. That means you serve customers WITHOUT the massive chip on your shoulder. If you don't like your job, find something else to do, but DON'T take your mistakes out on your customers.  The waitress got our order wrong and pitched a massive attitude when we kindly asked her to fix it - it was a DIET COKE!!! Slammed the new drink on the table and didn't speak to us the rest of our stay there.  THEN denied it all when approached by my husband, who had to escalate the situation to a manager. Horrible, horrible, horrible. Grow up."

Heads up, you won't be playing on your phone past your first drink. It may as well be Cheers personified. Customers and staff alike are all so friendly and hilarious, you'll get roped into ridiculous convos and debates. It's inevitable. The staff (myself included) will adopt you as our own. 15/10 would recommend."

Bartenders aren't too worried about giving good customer service, and their drinks are pretty lame as well. Could easily get their \"cocktails\" at the Bombshells down the road, with more of a kick and better attentiveness and service. The only reason I'm not leaving 1 star instead of 2 is because they don't care if you're drunk- they'll keep serving you! Lmao and the board games are a nice touch!"

It's perfect because my wife and I will grab two beers to go, drop a tip, and walk the square/walking trail up the street to get our steps in on our Fitbit. It's always exciting because the beers change daily to weekly. We've hung out inside on occasion which is perfect for card games and relaxing. The apparel for sale is typical of a REI/Bass Pro Shop. Expensive but quality.   Bar: rotating beer, wine, white claws  Bonus: Very dog friendly! And one of the only places open late."

Luckily there are a few outdoor tables and chairs for overflow but even the sidewalks get crowded with people just standing around drinking. One evening we managed to make it in and see what all the excitement was about and it's a cute little beer and wine bar/outdoors gear store. Cute merchandise but pretty pricey. The bartender told us occasionally a food truck will park behind their store so you can enjoy yummy eats with your drinks, otherwise no food menu. I liked the atmosphere of this place... cute little date night drink spot on the square. But I am a little confused by why it's so crowded all the time. The beer and wine list is good, but not anything spectacular. I don't get it. I'm sure we'll be back at some point if we can find a place to sit."

I didn't try the beer, so I can't comment on that, but the clothing selection was good. They carry Howler Brothers apparel, which is a company out of Austin that my fisherman husband likes, and Texas Standard clothing, which is a TX-based brand with cool (not kitschy) Texas-themed clothing that gives back to Texas non-profs. They also carry another local brand - Kermode Outdoors - which is new to me, but evidently founded by Georgetown residents. The store has a great vibe and the bar is a place I could see spending a few hours on a Saturday afternoon. Stores like this are what I look for whenever I shop local - a place that sells unique, cool stuff that someone has spent time thinking about.   4 not 5 stars because I didn't try the beer.

                "description": "Every time we come to Austin we stop by Perla's no matter if its for Breakfast, Lunch or dinner. This time we stopped in for lunch. We got there an hour before our appt and host was very accommodating and sat us early. Not to mention we had our 4 month old in a stroller. We took the option to sit outside because the weather was great and they have an awesome patio. The waiter was very nice and very knowledgeable on the whole food menu and drinks. We wanted get something light since we have been eating so heavy on our vaca.   We split 3 dishes a ceviche, the lobster bisque and the wedge salad. All the 3 were very light, tasty and delicious!! It was exactly what we were looking for.   I would absolutely recommend this place!"

                "description": "Food was decent, but the parking situation ruined our experience and we likely won't return as a result.   There is a parking garage behind Perlas where they supposedly validate your parking. Apparently there is a new system in place in the parking garage that requires you to scan a QR code to pay for parking then somehow you get it validated at the restaurant. However, when you pull into the garage there is no QR code. So I walked to the restaurant to ask how to validate parking. They gave me the QR code but I had to have my license plate. So I had to walk back to my truck to get license plate. By the time I got back to my truck there was already a parking ticket on my truck!   I reached out to the manger of this parking garage, Travis, to explain the situation, but he refused to waive the parking ticket even though I showed him a copy of my receipt from Perlas which proves that my parking should have been free not to mention the confusing process."

                "description": "Service was professional and prompt. The server, Donovan, was quite excellent at providing suggestions and information without need to go back and consult a chef or manager. What this says is that the restaurant (and chef) ensure the employees taste what they serve so they can provide info to diners. This is one mark of excellence.   The setting is beautiful. Since it was a pleasant autumn day, we opted for outdoor dining and enjoyed our decision. It's hard to write about the vibe but this is closer to a low-key fine dining. It isn't fancy but the food and service make it close.   We had grilled (or broiled) oysters and they were as good as the ones I had at Felix's in the French Quarter. We also had a sampler of oysters in the half-shell and we were guided by Donovan who knew the types of oysters and sources and showed us that by flipping the shell, the underside gives clues as to the waters they originated from.   Tuna Tartare was excellent (I've only had it as good in Aspen, Co for 3x the price).  Then smoked octopus and grilled red snapper. Both of those were outstanding too.   Price is reasonable for the quality but our bill was over $175 (we ate a ton and didn't care) this restaurant is right on price considering the quality on the plate and from the staff. We will definitely go again."

Jacob, my server, was incredible and every dish he recommended was beyond amazing! It was totally worth the flight. This is huge for me because customer service in my opinion, has declined drastically, so when I rave about an experience such as Perla's, it's #facts! This evening I enjoyed some glasses of Chenin Blanc, from South Africa, some delicious oysters (Jacob chose all of them), fried okra, crab cake and the famous potato crusted sea bass and a sea salt dessert! Thanks Perla's for the amazing experience! Thanks for the warm welcome from the staff outside and the lovely hostesses inside. I'll certainly be back and cannot wait! Be safe. Be blessed. Be kind and enjoy good food! Perla's"

                "description": "Been waiting a while to go here, and finally got to make it while it was still nice out; We thought there was supposed to be a happy hour, but it turns out/doesn't seem like there is one anymore unfortunately.  Naturally, we got a few appetizers, oyster shooters and oysters, plus the octopus that came with a savory sauce and potatoes. I'm not a fan of bloody mary's so the shooter wasn't my favorite since that's how they were prepared, and kind of spendy at that. The oysters were a small bit still good; again,  no happy hour pricing.  The octopus was my favorite, grilled perfectly, same as the potatoes, covered in herbs and a butter/mayo sauce that paired nicely.   We both got fish, mine had a bit of spice to it, and the ahi was very nice and fresh; Overall, pleasant meal, more expensive than we would've liked but glad to have tried it. Personally, I think it's better to just get some appetizers/drinks and save the entree for somewhere else; while it's definitely good, I think it's overpriced and could make something comparable for a fraction of the cost."

                "description": "Our first time here for an occasion with my wife's second cousins. Two guests split a dozen oysters and loved them. We split the calamari and it was among the best we've had in Texas. Top two, maybe top five ever. My wife had the redfish on the half shell and loved it. I ordered an oyster Po Boy but was disappointed in the size of the oysters and was very salty. The shoe string fries were fine by my tastes despite what some reviews state. Kind of high price for what we got for lunch but that's what you get now with the CA invasion of Austin. Seafood seemed fresh which is rare in Texas."

The last time we went was for lunch on a Tuesday and we waited about 30 minutes for an outdoor table, but it's always worth it! The place has a really cool vibe and the staff is very pleasant and we appreciate the mask policy. The oysters are delicious! We usually get the calamari, octopus and fries as well. I will say the octopus is a tad too salty for me, but otherwise the food is good."

However, it was really nice outside so the sweet staff moved us out there upon asking. We came for my birthday dinner and it was a very relaxing, chill, but a little upscale vibe. We all wore jeans and it was totally acceptable. The food was 10/10. The calamari was light and crispy at the same time- just perfect. The creole oysters were packed with flavor, and the main dish lobster bucatini was literally the best dish I've ever had. It was delicious and that alone is enough for me to return. We split it which I think was perfect because I could barely finish my half after the appetizers.  We will definitely be back!"

First, I wouldn't recommend dining with family. It is too expensive and there's not a lot to select on the menu for the younger ones. It's definitely a date night or girls/guys night out vibe.   Red snapper dish was ok. Brussels sprouts were good, had a sweet taste. The prawns were good and I do recommend the calamari for an appetizer.  Complimentary hush puppies were a nice treat, too.   Cocktails were a little watered down for the price. Wine was decent.   Loved the outdoor seating area. If I go back, it will be for a glass of wine and calamari on the patio."

Parking wasn't easy for the area and I wish I had known the restaurant validates. I could have saved $10. Overall the service and atmosphere was satisfying. The brunch menu is not huge but the few items available still left me struggling to decide. I chose the lobster omelette and it was one of the fluffiest omelette's I ever had. Each bite was full of crab. I initially thought the lettuce was a garnish but took a bite and it was a salad with some of the best dressing I ever had. Oh and the grilled oysters are a MUST!

We arrived when they were just opening, and luckily we had a reservation - it filled up really quickly after a bit. The space has a great vibe and a great view - even though it's not on the roof, the space offers a lovely view of the city and river and the open concept of the bar makes for a perfect environment to relax and enjoy some sunshine. The space is filled with countless plants and pink decor, which I truly appreciated - it felt quite posh and eclectic yet incredibly put together at the same time.   For drinks, I opted for the ladybird spritz, perfect for a refreshing afternoon cocktail. Featuring rhubarb, aperol, and cava, it was light yet flavorful, really being able to taste the rhubarb throughout the entire drink. Quite good! My friend went for the sundown cobbler, which she also really enjoyed. Since it was happy hour, we snagged some food too. We both split the pita bread with chimichurri and the hummus. We were given a bunch of pita bread, which was much appreciated! The pita was good, but not the best I've ever had (a little dense for my liking). The chimchurri was OK - the ratio of oil to spices was a bit off so it felt like it was swimming in oil. The hummus was quite nice and featured a nice touch of cashews and chili oil. I appreciated the inclusion of various veggies in addition to the pita for a change of pace! The hummus overall was good, but again, not the best I've ever had, but still filling and delicious and balanced our drinks well. While the prices of the cocktails were quite discounted from normal, they were still a bit steep, but to be expected when you consider the ambience of the place.   Overall, we enjoyed our HH at P6! I really enjoyed by spritz and the hummus / chimichurri was a nice balance. The prices are a bit elevated, but to be expected in relation to the space. If you're looking for a nice HH spot for visitors to Austin, I would definitely suggest P6!"

This place has such beautiful decor and is on the rooftop/patio, so there is a beautiful backdrop of Lady Bird Lake. You will definitely be taking tons of photos here.  We made reservations just in case, but we pretty much had the whole restaurant to ourselves for the first hour P6 was opened. Everything looked delicious, so we ordered quite a bit:  Vegetable Frittata: This was perfect for a light meal. Lots of veggies and the eggs and butter lettuce was perfect.  Shrimp and Grits: Soooo bomb. Every bit of this tasted great. Just wished they would have removed the shrimp tails as most other places do.  Patatas Bravas: The potatoes were great for a side/appetizer.  Sourdough Garlic Bread: I love a good garlic bread, and this totally delivered. And I like that fact that it was pull-apart bread.   Everything tasted amazing and we really enjoyed our time brunching here."

But we convinced our way out to the patio early in the night which was better (but a little chilly). Why would we want to come to a rooftop bar if we can't be outside, ya know?!  The servers were nice - we had multiple throughout the night. They occasionally came and checked on us. The place was packed on a Friday night.  We all had a lot of fun here and the drinks just kept coming! They were tasty and swanky.  There weren't many parking options other than valet that I saw but I can't remember how much that was. We had to walk through the hotel to get to the rooftop. The hotel looked very nice with mood lighting and modern decor touches.  Overall though, P6 was great - moody and fun!"

The weather was perfect and our waiter was so nice. He gave us tips on what to do and where to go. I've been recommending this place to everyone that visits Austin!"

With this being downtown it's in a good location to catch the sunset and then adventure parts of downtown. This is a popular spot so being able to get a good seat or table before the sunset may be difficult. The crafted cocktails are very good and the waiting staff does a good job at helping you pick a drink"

If you like sunsets, book a seat that can see such.  It's worth it.  Service was good.  Staff was friendly, and when the outside got chill, they kindly reseated us indoors.  Props for that!  You can get a meal or just get drinks.  Just book before you go or pray for the one table free, like we found."

                "description": "Rating: 3.5 stars  My friend and I decided to stop here for brunch on Sunday. We didn't make a reservation ahead of time but were able to be seated right away indoors. (If you are interested in sitting outdoors - we were told reservations book out 1 week in advance so make sure to plan accordingly)  Even though the indoor space did not have the same ambience as outdoors it was still very nice and well decorated.   Service was very friendly and efficient.  For our brunch we decided to order:  --PATATAS BRAVAS: Well fried with a great flavor. Definitely a great brunch item to order! My only complaint would be they didn't really give us many potatoes since the portion covered less than half of the bowl it came in.   --FRITTATA: Ours was a veggie frittata that was filled with flavor and topped with a great tomato based purée. It did come with a giant handful of lightly coated romaine lettuce which seemed a bit mismatched. Additionally the portion of the frittata was slightly too small for the price.   --PICKLED PEARL ONION HUMMUS: Really good portion of food. The hummus is just bursting in flavor. There was also a ton of bread and veggies it comes with to dip into the hummus. Definitely a solid order!   All in all, a nice brunch option for the weekend if you are staying at The Line."

The cute, Instagrammy interior is only topped by the incredible backdrop of the balcony view over the river. We got a shady table by the edge and kicked back with a rosé and carpaccio. The plating of the carpaccio was gorgeous, and it had a beautiful mix of salty and fresh flavors. The pita chips that came with it were perfectly crispy too!  This was the best view we were able to get while in Austin, and can't wait to come back! But next time - we'll make it in time for their amazing happy hour deals."

                "description": "Really enjoyed brunch the other day here on their patio that overlooks Ladybird Lake. Had a reservation for 6 and the hostess was able to accommodate my request of sitting outside, which I really appreciated. The ambiance is very pretty and totally Instagram worthy with their pink overhangs and colorful couches/decor. They also had semi-large fans for each outdoor table which was much needed in this Texas heat.   The food was really delicious and not too overly priced. For brunch, most of the plates were pretty small so, if you're hungry I would recommend ordering 1-3 plates and sharing if you have the ability to do so. We tried the Greek Yogurt Parfait, Patatas Bravas and Hummus and it was all sooo good! Will definitely be returning here."

We came during happy hour, which is literally one hour, 4-5pm, and I ordered the Sundowncobbler and Homemade Pita bread. Im not a huge drinker, but I really enjoyed my drink and loved that there was fruit in it. The pita bread was incredible! I loved how soft and warm the pita was. It was perfect with the chimichurri.  Parking- You can park in the garage for the hotel, but they only validate for the first hour I believe, which is only $5. Luckily we found street parking next to the garage which isn't nearly as expensive.  Payment- I actually really loved that you paid online! It makes it very easy to split the check amongst friends without bothering the servers!"

                "description": "Views are excellent... IF you even get a table anywhere near them. This restaurant is poorly executed in my opinion. They have beautiful views of the river but there is no guarantee that you will even be able to see it from your table (even with reservations) and yet you're still paying \"fancy view prices\".   My experience: - Arrived at The Line Hotel (which is way cool btw) to find that there are no signs on how to get to P6.  - The elevator is super sketchy and in the back corner without any airflow at all (seemed like an afterthought or service elevator). - Originally was sat at a \"table\" (their seating are little vignettes of couches/patio furniture that is NOT comfortable AT ALL and really impractical to eat at) nowhere near the view. The tiny view that we did have was completely obstructed by a shade they rolled down. - We asked to be moved to a \"table\" with a view and were finally re-seated but still had a difficult time seeing the view as we were further back at a SUPER low to the ground vignette.  - The staff was friendly but the drinks and the menu items were overrated. - Stayed for an hour and a half, took some pictures, and went somewhere else to eat more food.  My order: - Sundown Cobbler cocktail - Yummy, but tasted mostly like sprite. - Paper Plane cocktail - Yummy, smooth, easy drinker. - Whipped ricotta - Way more food than we expected but the olives and the nuts were better than the ricotta. It lacked a lot of flavor and mostly just helped to fill me up.  Long story short - NOT worth the hype."

Strongly recommend for a predinner or after dinner spot."

Giving this 5 stars for the service- I highly recommend ordering the summer Sandie it was delicious!"

They were fully booked on opentable but I called ahead and the hostess kindly reserved us a spot right by the water.  If we're being honest you mostly come here for the view and the ambiance.  However, everything I ate and drank was also really great.  Pro tip: try to arrive between 4-5 so you can order your first drink off their \"happiest hour\" menu.  My only complaint here is parking.  You can self park for up to 3 hours in the parking garage of The Line hotel and get it validated for $10, or you can find street parking yourself.  I personally don't mind hunting for street parking, but if you're coming with a group make sure your party knows what to expect.  It is downtown after all!"

P6 is beautiful for snacks and light drinks, but there was absolutely nothing I would return for (except the views). Each dish is shared with the table. For a table of 3 ladies, we ordered the Riviera Pastry Basket, Patatas Bravas, Spanikopita, the Seasonal Vegetable Frittata, and a pitcher of White Sangria. The Pastry Basket, Patatas, and the Frittata were incredibly dry and bland-- overcooked. I love a good crisp, white sangria, but this sangria tasted like water mixed with fruits...   Stay for the views, stay away from the menu."

You're paying for the vibes and views, FYI. -Good pastries - loved the pastry basket -Friendly staff - shoutout to Gabriela (I hope I got her name right, the hostess!) who was so kind -Fun drink options / quick service  -Tables felt spaced out well   Cons: -You have to pay $10 for self-parking, and that's the validated price  -There's an automatic gratuity regardless of party size (not a big deal) and 3% \"Covid surcharge for health and safety measures\" which none of it goes to staff.  I'd be great with it if it included hazard pay, but considering they were all wearing their own masks and they were only spraying down tables, it seemed pretty shady to me.   Overall, good for a special occasion I'd say."

                "description": "Okay this is my favorite coffee shop in the Austin area period.  I love how big and spacious this new location is, but the coffee is WHERE IT'S AT.  Definitely come here if you're looking for the perfect date spot, study/get work done, or just to enjoy a nice morning coffee and breakfast.  We ordered a hand pour over, a Chemex, and a double espresso.  The double espresso came out first and this one definitely packed a punch - don't let the espresso size cup fool you.  If I was just here for the caffeine content, this one definitely would've done the job alone.   The hand pour over came out next and the presentation was super impressive!  They bring you the entire carafe with the dripper on top, so it's definitely a lot.  Considering this is only $4, you definitely get your money's worth!  This one was so flavorful and the fruity notes definitely stood out while drinking it.  Now the Chemex...just wow.  For $5, they bring the entire Chemex setup to your table and you pour our of it as you drink.  The fact that they trust their patrons with the Chemex really speaks volumes about how much they care about the presentation piece!  Looks aside, this coffee (I believe we got Ethiopian) tasted amazing and on-par with the pour over.  Don't let me forget the breakfast tacos.  This was such a treat.  I got the Migas breakfast taco and this one was stuffed FULL with eggs, tortilla strips, and pico.  It was delicious and filling and for $3, this one definitely hit the spot alongside the coffee.  I also bought one of their coffee beer stouts to take home...I believe it was the House United coffee milk stout.  If taking home, you either order beer in a Crowler (two pint cans) or a Growler (64 oz).  I can't wait to try their coffee IN THEIR BEER.  But most of all, can't wait to come back here every time I'm in the area!"

It's mostly wood picnic tables. There's one table that has chairs with backs and there are a few counter height chairs with backs. I love to hang out and linger at a coffee shop. This has the space, but it's just not comfortable. Adding  some cozy areas would make this place off the charts amazing."

A little burst of crisp vinegar to cut the richness of the cheese is a bite of what I hope clouds would taste like.   We drive from San Antonio to eat here and you should too.

Sometimes when there's a new location, there's a drop in quality, but not here.   Its actually 2x bigger, nice and bright, just missing the Hip Hop Feel of the original location.   If you like BBQ or BBQ sandwiches, then this is the spot for you.   They gots a variety of meats for your meat eaters, sorry, I'm not a vegetarian so I don't know what they got for folks here.   The Nachos are awesome, prob best to share than eat alone.  If you don't know what you like, give the Trio Sampler a try, its a very nice place to start.   All the other sandwiches are massive (and good), and will prob put me in the hospital if I eats them again, so my goto sandwich is the McDowell, oh man, puts the McRib or any Pork Rib to shame, its executed so well.  Always tender fall off the bone rib mean between your choice of bun, bbq sauce, and pickles, so good.   The Sides are ok, but the Desert is the best, the OG cookie is so drip!   Give this place a try, its great!"

                "description": "We were looking for a BBQ lunch spot and SLAB delivers! The meats are smoked to perfection and because we couldn't decide on what to try we got two of the best sampler options on the menu - the slider trio (chicken, pork, brisket) and the epic DONK sammich (all the meats - chicken, pork, brisket, sausage and all the sauces). We also tried two of their sides because YOLO - Gouda Mac and the twice baked potato casserole. Legit, UNBELIEVABLY good. My favorite out of the slider trio was the chicken - sauces were on point, chicken was tender and juicy. The Mac and cheese was EPIC - it's a wet Mac which I love. Super creamy, smoked Gouda is just divine. Twice baked tots were also good (but my heart belongs to the Mac). If you're here for epic then go with the DONK. Single portion was HUGE but it delivers on flavor! Stacked high with meats it's also smothered in delicious sauces, crunchy onions and jalapeños. Honestly, will come back for that! Beer selection is fantastic. Get you some SLAB!"

                "description": "This was among the worst barbecue we've tried in the region. Two sandwich combos plus tip was $50. We had a brisket+sausage sandwich and a pulled pork+mustard slaw sandwich, mac and cheese, and potato casserole.  Every dish was cold to lukewarm. Brisket and pork were both cold (some lukewarm bits), extremely dry, without flavor of their own, and severely under sauced. It helped when we asked for more sauce, but the meats were so dry that they soaked up moisture, and there was little flavor imparted. The smoked gouda mac and cheese was lukewarm, pure mush, and tasted like artificial smoke more than cheese. The twice baked potato casserole was just dry, grainy mashed potatoes. The mustard slaw had spice-heat but no flavor.  I couldn't finish my cold meal so I boxed it up and took it home, while my friend forced herself enough to be full and toss the rest. Once home I reheated it in a skillet and added more of the red sauce I'd requested, and then everything just tasted like sugar.   Disappointing."

I've been to many Geeks Who Drink nights at bars around Austin and the folks who run the show here have the right combination of humor, expediency, and most importantly music taste.  As far as Lustre Pearl itself - the bar food is nothing to write home about. The tacos are nice enough but they have off nights and on nights and for $5 a taco you can do much better elsewhere. The drinks are not terribly priced but just keep in mind this is a nicer bar in East Austin so you more or less know what you're in for. As far as the space itself, it would be nice to have more places to beat the heat but the outdoor space is quite nice - just make sure you grab some bug spray before you head out the door.  Overall, this is a solid bar and a great place to hang out on a week night. Check it out!"

Lustre Pearl East also has a private event space that can be reserved. Parking is free and mostly along the street.  As for food, there are quite a few beers on draft and great food options. I order the brussels religiously and have never been disappointed... they're mixed with pretzels and topped with a savory sauce and beer cheese. Best brussels in Austin, and all for $7. I've had their wings and tacos too and both were delicious.  Of course I have to give a shout-out to the AMAZING bartenders at Lustre Pearl. They always remembered my order and welcomed me with a smile. Great people and great environment... definitely check out this bar if you're in the area."

                "description": "Lustre Pearl has a great location but everything else is forgettable at best. When I was craving a club sandwich, I eventually remembered seeing a club on their menu, so I biked over to try it. I'd been there a few times before, but like I said, it hadn't made much of an impression on me. Unfortunately, the club was a waste of money and a dinner. The menu didn't say it had mayo, but it was drenched in mayo. The bread was limp. The other fillings were fine, but the bread and the mayo ruined the rest of it for me."

                "description": "As summer rolls around and you find yourself wanting to enjoy the weather at an outside bar, one place to consider is Lustre Pearl.  I recently came by for a happy hour with co-workers and got to try a couple of their snacks off the menu as well as a drink such as the:  - Loaded Tots: these are topped with brisket, avocado, cilantro, sriracha, goat cheese, and chipotle aioli - I mean, look at my picture. I don't have to explain how good it was. You got to try this one!  - 6 Chicken Wings: we went with Garlic Rosemary and that was nice since I haven't had a flavor like that on wings before. I like the strong herbal flavor in that one.  - Adult Chicken Nuggets: we went with the Ranch Rub on this and I liked how different it was to the garlic rosemary flavor. This one is stronger and richer, a must try for any ranch lover.  - House Sweet Potato Fries: some sweet potato fries are hit or miss, and this was a hit. The spicy miso aioli that comes with it is a good pairing!  - Lustre Lemonade: as a sweet drinker who's favorite fruit is Strawberry, this is all I could want: vodka, strawberry syrup, lemon juice, and soda water. Great refreshing drink for a hot day.  All in all, I give them an 4/5 since I had a great time! Good food selection, good drink selection, various specials throughout the week, and fun atmosphere to come with friends. I suggest y'all come try them out!"

Plenty of outdoor seating, I've never seen that they have indoor seating but didn't explore too much. There is a house on the property that may have seating inside. I've had the loaded tots and the cheeseburger and both were excellent. Music is playing over the loudspeakers but not too loud. Gravel and cement flooring. Plenty of free street parking. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area."

When I got my food I went to get the utensils, loads of dirty knives and forks. I washed my own using their hand sanitizer on the side. Food was ok, had some weird strand of fluff or hair in my salad. Couldn't pinpoint exactly what it was but you have to step up the hygiene factor either way. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and come back again and hope for a better experience. Maybe that guy is usually more engaging and maybe their hygiene is usually better."

                "description": "Just go to High Noon, instead. You're welcome.  I rarely leave reviews, but I still can't get over our experience here...  Generally: Vibe was very bro-y (very San Fran). Drinks were subpar. Music was all over the place. Service was disappointing (I'll get into that later). The only thing it seemed to have going for it was the outdoor space. It was nice, esp with right weather. Tho some of the tall tables were awkwardly big, I wondered if they were built during covid to have people 6 ft apart? Either way, we were already looking up a different spot because the atmosphere was quite dull and boring.   Personally: I really dislike being treated poorly, when the alternative is so simple.... so thought I'd share here because it all happened so suddenly I barely processed it.  My 2 friends and I had been there for less than an hour, talking and sitting at the giant table minding our business. Two of us were still sipping on the first drinks we ordered, my other friend had a soda.... When out of nowhere this short rando interrupts us by loudly tapping his bottle opener on the table and just says \"YOU GOTTA GO\". We look at him, annoyed, waiting for the punchline.  He must have realized we were confused, because only then did he decide to explain himself (in a rude accusatory tone, at that) \"you can't stay here if your friend is throwing up in the bathroom\". More confused, I instantly checked in with my friend who used the bathroom, to ask if she was feeling okay, because she wasn't even drinking (she literally asked for a coke at the bar). The bro just stared at us, until he walked away..  First off, There's a better way to approach people. Period. Use your words. Treat people with respect. It's really pretty simple.   Allow me to share some tips, for the wyt bro from last night: - Rather than tapping something loudly on the table like a child, an \"Im sorry to interrupt you all.\" Or even an \"Excuse me\" as you're interrupting a conversation, would suffice.  - Rather than \"YOU GOTTA GO\" outta nowhere with zero explanation. Maybe an \"I'm sorry, to have to do this. It's been suggested that your friend was throwing up in the bathroom, and as part of our policy, we're going to have to ask your group to leave\". Use your words. - Or, you could actually do a decent job of assessing the situation and use your skills to read the room and recognize that the person you accused was not displaying any OTHER signs of intoxication because they were not drunk (or even drinking at your establishment). A check-in with our group could have also informed you to make a better decision. You could have also given a warning. There are actually several alternatives than following your ego trip.  But really, how cliché, another wyt bro doing the bare minimum, knowing he could go on in life giving zero effort to be decent. How original...  Secondly, We weren't some blacking out college students barely able to stand on 6th (who, by the way, also wouldn't deserve such a shitty response). We were sitting, chatting, coherent, physically functioning, PAYING patrons, sipping on meh drinks at your boring establishment.  None of us were making a scene. None of us showing signs of being affected by alcohol. My accused friend did NOT even order a drink there. She didn't have to be embarrassed by that bro - she hadn't even shared with us that her stomach was upset, yet. AND she had just shared that there was literally people hooking up in the other stall, like lol what kinda place are yall running?   Also, you do know there are other reasons why grown ass women (who aren't drinking) would gag in bathroom, right? Did you ever think about that? We had just walked over after having a 5 course meal at Intero. She said she was feeling odd and that all she did was gag in the bathroom. Like use your best judgment, vato. Read a book.  Third of all, we are literally sitting there checking out the new Lustre with my friend who is part owner of a bar on Cesar Chávez. We know the law. This was all so poorly handled. We didn't get into it then, because it wasn't worth the energy. But there's a reason there are other MULTIPLE signs listed for bartenders to be trained to spot intoxication: * Slurred speech * Confusion or disorientation * Loss of coordination * Delayed reflexes * Slow, irregular breathing * Unresponsiveness * Nausea and vomiting  And, if as a bartender, you're still compelled to ask a group to leave because their non drinking friend gagged, then at the very least approach people with respect.   Do better."

The tots were definitely my favorite and easily shareable. I had the chopped beef sandwich and it was pretty good - wish it came with a side for the price you pay.

So we are slowly freezing to death in the cold. But hey, it could get better, maybe we can order some whiskey to warm us up right? WRONG! As soon as I leave my seat, to go order drinks for our group, I immediately get harassed by four power hungry servers/bartenders that tell me to put a mask on even after governor Abbot  stated that no more businesses require customers to wear masks. The main reason I'm giving a one star is because we were the only customers in the bar and there were no heaters in the blistering cold, service sucked, and the staff were extremely rude when they definitely could have handled it more professionally. Just be polite next time! Unfortunately we won't be coming back. Cheers."

Ambiance: Good selection of outdoor games and music playing. Nice indoor area as well as a lot of outdoor area. Dog friendly.  Service: The service staff is relatively friendly. I have been here quite a few times and most of the time it is good, but I have had poor service as well  Food/Drinks: I wish they had a better selection of beer to my liking, but they do have quite a few taps to choose from.

                "description": "This review is a tough one for me. I'm a Lustre Pearl girl that goes back to its original beautiful old house when it was the only place on Rainey St.  How happy I was when they moved the old house to my neighborhood. It quickly became my normal stomping grounds where everyone knows my name. Cheers.  I could go into a number of things that makes this place imperfect. But honestly what's perfect is the staff and the friendly regular faces.  So now you're wondering why 2 stars???  After countless years of being customers, my husband and I were banned after asking for the lights to be dimmed.  We first asked our bartenders about these odd spotlights at the bar, who told us they were directed by Ryan (manager) that the lights couldn't be touched, against their own wishes as well. The lights were set for \"closing time\"... get your Sh*t and get out inviting kind of style.  As regulars, we like things to be regular. The same ol' food, the ol' regular drink, and the same neighborhood bar lighting. Ryan's reply was a snarky  \"Well I like it the way it is.\" Which left us to ask for the check in return.  After being a manager for 7 years myself and now an owner of my own business... if my customer asked me for an easy accommodation to make them comfortable, I'd do it in a heartbeat.   We started coming here before people even realized they re-opened. We've watched it become popular over time. My response... \"Well I like it the way it WAS.\" Call me sentimental missing the way things used to be."

                "description": "Aviator Pizza was solid, not amazing, but okay. We grabbed togo and picked it up on our way home from the gym so we could just collapse and eat some pizza. We got one white pie with arugula on top. It tasted like the greens weren't washed, and they were all wilted and slimy by the time the pizza got home 10 minutes later.   The other pizza was better with a variety of meats and veg on top. But overall the dough felt a little undercooked on both and generally was a bit chewy.   I'd be willing to try this spot again and likely sit down to eat it in person and hope that it's better right out of the oven, maybe it just doesn't travel well? But pizza is a notoriously delivered food item, so I would hope that's not the case.   All in all, i'm not that impressed but willing to give them another go."

                "description": "So ... views of photos over past 90 days at record high: 197k, but views of reviews down to 10.5k from 32k over past 90 days. I think this means I should write about pimps and gangsters in purple Cadillacs.   No ... there were no purple Cadillacs here. Sorry! And I was the only one there. But I got me a pizza and a salad (no beer). Then went next door and dropped $300 in a cash game at Shuffle 512 because a Facebook friend/fan sat right next to me and we were having fun and gambling.   If I had gone in to Shuffle 512 first, I might have won. Therefore, theoretically, this was a $300 pizza and salad. I'd leave a woah emoji, but not sure if it will show up on Yelp. I mean, the emoji comes up but I have tried it before and it was just a weird space. And I don't want you to associate me with pimps, gangsters, and weird spaces (purple Cadillac okay).   As far as the pizza goes, traditional bar pizza. Good not great. Salad pretty solid. Atmosphere very good but I was there early so not 100% sure.   Overall, recommended as a feeler to see if it's for you."

I ordered Dem Berries beer and my honey ordered a mic ultra.  The pizza was a-m-a-z-i-n-g!!!!! The bread was out of this world.  The toppings were fresh and had delicious flavors.  The staff were nice however we asked for her to change the TV to the TX/OU game but she kept forgetting.  We asked her again and finally tried to locate it however the cable they had didn't allow the game so we had to watch it on our phone.  We wished they offered nicer plates and flatware; they gave us paper plates and plastic forks but we aren't fancy people so it was all good.  The place was super clean and relaxing.  I would definitely recommend this venue."

When I asked available deals, he also said happy hour ends at 6, when the menu also said 7-9PM. I ordered a 12in/ 3 topping and 2 beers, $30. I saw the tip auto generated to $12, so I lowered it due to false information and frustration w the employees. Today my Aviator transaction is $50 for a 12in and 2beers Definitely felt ripped off."

First off the pizza is great and love the beer selection BUT after ordering I used the restroom and there was a crew member that used the restroom at the same time and didn't wash their hands. I brought this up in comments about how they were doing when I had my receipt emailed. It seems whoever answered back did a half ass apology by saying maybe they were washing their hands in a different sink or were intending to wear gloves. I'm sorry but I don't wanna eat at somewhere where a higher up thinks it's appropriate for a worker to use the restroom not wash their hands put on gloves and touch my food."

                "description": "Enjoyed our first visit to Aviator, and we'll plan to try it again on another day.  We grabbed a few beers ($5-7/each) and ordered a caprese salad ($11) to start. Unfortunately, it came out late and exactly with our pizza ($25 for a '18 pie with pepperoni, mushrooms, and roasted garlic toppings).  The beers were great, and they had plenty of local selections to choose from. I would not get the caprese salad again because it's overpriced for the small portion size. The large pizza was great size, and with the salad, we had half to take home. While the ingredients and toppings were fresh, they didn't bake the pizza to order (disappointed because we asked for well done, but it still came out a bit doughy).  Overall, it's a bit of a premium price point, but likely worth a shot at a few other menu options.   Last note- the patio area is perfect for sitting outside on a nice afternoon/evening, so hope to bring a few more friends next time."

One lady (I'm sorry I don't remember her name) tried three different propane heaters before giving up and calling out her manager Angel, who switched tanks and expertly wrangled the fickle device to make sure we were nice and toasty.  The food is excellent. I particularly like the cinnamon dessert. Best. Crust. Ever. The constantly rotating selection of alcoholic beverages is perfectly splendid. I would recommend some great beers but you likely will not make it in time; you can never tire of the same old selection! (I recommend the Pineapple IPA and the Cherry Sour). I highly recommend gracing this fine establishment during these trying times, and enjoying a great atmosphere with wonderful people and excellent food and drink. Bonus: all this while staying safe with their proactive pandemic protocols."

(They even had the amazing electric jellyfish hazy ipa- one of my al time favorites). We ordered the basil and goat cheese breadsticks that came with ranch and marinara, and went straight to the pecan cinnamon breadsticks. The dough here is amazing... it's light but manages to have that slightly chewy texture. It's seriously SO GOOD. And the toppings/garnishes are great quality. You know the food is amazing when I forget to take a single picture because I'm too busy stuffing my face. Definitely can't wait to come back."

                "description": "Ordinary pizza. After reading the reviews, I expected way better. Especially at this price point.  I brought a friend of mine after we hit the range and we had dinner. I was excited after reading reviews about the place. I LOVE pizza! And I'll eat pretty much whatever pizza you put in front of me. But that doesn't mean I can't taste it and don't have my preferences.  The dough is thick, which I like. But, as a result, it was doughy and not cooked all the way through. The curst was not crispy. Not even close.  The toppings tasted good, I'm pretty sure they are fresh. The tomato sauce is pretty good. But my pizza should have had more tomato sauce. It was light on the cheese. The rest, pretty decent.  Again, it's not that it was a bad pizza. But there's people saying in their reviews how this is the best pizza in Austin or how they were blown away or their friends were asking where they got it, etc. So I expected greatness. It didn't hit the mark. There's great potential. Just need to up their game, which includes cooking it better.  And again, at this price point, it needs to be a damn good pizza. I do want to try it again. I hope I just was there on an off day."

Dine in has always has always been a good time since kiddos can run around outside while we hang on the large (dog-friendly) patio. There are large family-style bench tables indoor, but we only dine there if we are desperate for A/C. (There are two TVs which engage the little one for long enough to eat.) Staff here is always friendly. I love it when they are not busy and I can try some of the beers. It's not huge, but it's a varied selection. (They will let you sample any time of course, but its different when there are people in line behind you.) They do offer growlers to-go (along with menu items of course).  I should admit, as many times as we've eaten here, I only get one thing, the first pizza I've ever tried: The Flying Garlic. It's the best damn pizza I've ever had. The toppings are top notch (roasted garlic!? yaaaas) but the crust is a little like kolache dough: ever so slightly sweet. No crust left behind! I've sampled the Hawaiian (add bacon) my husband and daughter always share, it too is delicious.    Lucky to have this spot nearby!"

The main reason he wanted to try it was to watch hockey.  We were immediately greeted and told to take a seat anywhere we wanted, a precursor to the excellent service that we received the entire time we were there.  The place is very spacious with a bunch of tables and bar seating, as well as plenty of outdoor seating, and a bunch of TVs. There is also what appears to be a stage space, most likely for their events like trivia and bingo. We sat at the bar and ordered drinks. It was a Sunday early afternoon so it was pretty quiet. We ordered a side of Buffalo roasted cauliflower per recommendation. My fiancé got the impossible burger with a side Caesar salad and I got the smoked pork quesadilla also with a side Caesar salad.  All the food came out relatively quickly and pretty much all at once. I obviously was too excited for the food because I forgot to take pictures of them! The portions were the perfect size and the side salads were not sad like some other watery small portions that you might get elsewhere. My fiancé enjoyed his burger and my quesadilla had a great texture and came with pickled onions, sour cream, jalapeño slices, and shredded lettuce.  Shout out to the service for being extremely friendly and fast, constantly checking in on us. We definitely want to come back to this place!"

Also, avoid that queso. As far as ambiance... It was noticeably hard to ignore a certain mildew type odor while sitting. Sit outside if you must!

Come during happy hour where flights are $7. You really can't beat that since they're heavy pours. I'd highly recommend the Texas flight.  The atmosphere and vibe was dope. They had live music and she sang EVERYTHING under the sun.. from 70s to Michael Jackson to The Weeknd. Definitely made the place awesome.   Our server was great too! Highly recommend to stop by and grab a beer."

                "description": "My girlfriend and I stopped by the Brass Tap on a Wednesday night after getting our nails done across the street. Cool vibe, big tables, seat yourself social distancing, and quite a few TVs. Servers kind of rotate between tables to make sure everyone is taken care of so they're super attentive. We had one main server though and she was sweet and personable. They had three different menus, which was kind of confusing, but we realized one was their main menu, the second was someone they partnered with, and the third was for their Smokehouse BBQ only served on Wednesday nights.   Go for the bbq! I was pleasantly surprised how delicious the bbq was. I got the two meat plate that came with two sides. The sweet potato fries and brussel sprouts were both delicious. My friend got the loaded sweet potatoes and really enjoyed it. Overall, we had a good time with some good eats! Would definitely go back again!"

Good amount of tables and social distancing is very easy on the patio.   I love the servers here. In particular Janson was great! Super kind and approachable, very attentive. Super great service.   The food is good I've gotten the jalapeño poppers and the fried pickles. Both were really good  The drinks are phenomenal and I love how much variety there is with the beer.   Overall a great time."

                "description": "This is a difficult review of the Brass Tap Beer and Food restaurant at the Domain. Why you say?  I am getting out more and the Domain is one of my favorite places to shop(carefully), eat and people watch! Sunday I met my two adult grandchildren at the awesome Domain Shopping Center. After completing our initial agenda of a haircut and some shopping we were starving. When the three of us get together and we're going to eat 99% of the time we choose a place we haven't tried before.  There sat the Brass Tap Tavern.  As always, I took a look at yelp for reviews and the majority were very positive-always a good sign! We've gone to a small handful of restaurants that are available at the Domain but in the spirit of adventure we decided to try The Brass Tap.  It was a Sunday afternoon around 430 ... so absolutely not what I would consider prime time for eating. The Decor was beautiful. The interior huge, lots of brass which is beautiful, and a very smart, but earthy feel. A large screen TV on the wall which is standard these days but often takes away from the beauty of an establishment. They also have a decent size patio available and since the tavern is on a corner it wraps around it. At that time of the day on a Sunday there was one table inside that was occupied, and probably about eight tables occupied outside where we sat down. It took us a bit to see our waiter approaching with a huge front and back beer menu, along with a very cool looking food menu. It was obvious that he was feeling rushed however he did take the time to answer a couple of questions we had about the beer menu and he took our order. I let him know we would be eating also as he was already rushing off and said he would be right back to take it. 20+ minutes later he stopped back after delivering beer to at least two tables on that trip. We decided to order an appetizer to share. Due to our elevated hunger level everything sounded delicious so we opted to get the combo platter. It consisted of Boom Boom Shrimp, House-Made Tots with beer cheese or jalapeño beer cheese and Chicken Tenders with BBQ sauce on a bed of House-Made Angry Onion Straws - $15 this was an average size appetizer. I personally ate a couple tater tot's and some onion strings. There were also three different dipping sauces, one a barbecue sauce, one a queso cheese sauce and one that was kind of tangy with a little bit of heat. My grands polished off everything else that was on the platter. Our main dishes arrived shortly after we had gotten our appetizer. My grandson ordered a half pound Angus burger called The Pub it was  Jalapeño cream cheese, smoked Gouda, Applewood bacon, lettuce, tomato, cowboy sauce on a butter brioche bun - 11\rit came with french fries. The fries looked great as was the construction of the burger and toppings. Sadly the burger was requested medium rare and arrived medium to well done. After waiting on our food over 1/2 hr. the grandson decided not to request it be redone. My granddaughter ordered the PERI PERI GRILLED CHICKEN PANINI with Goat cheese, hummus on grilled Ciabatta bread - 10. It also came with fries. It looked good and my granddaughter really enjoyed it. When I asked her what \"Peri Peri sauce was She couldn't explain. Since I didn't want something that heavy(The Panini) but I wanted to know what that sauce was I ordered  the 3 BEER BATTERED COD  Tacos. They were dressed with lettuce , cheddar jack and pepper jack cheeses, Peppadew peppers and drizzled with Peri Peri aioli - 8.5 ,my tacos were served with some chips and tiny salsa on the side. I was glad the Peri Peri was only drizzled over my fish tacos as I didn't care for it. To each his own! So our tab for our appetizer,meal, one nonalcoholic bottled beer one draft beer and one beer described as more like wine was $61.86. For us the food rang out at about a 3.9 (out of 5.0), the beverages, we really didn't think my granddaughter would like the nonalcoholic beer but she tried it and as it turns out she doesn't like it. I ordered what was described to me as NOT tasting like a beer at all but like a sweet wine (I guess I must've missed the wine list because the website says they offer it)-after two sips that was enough of that. This is definitely not the Brass Taps fault as I am not a beer drinker but since I said that out loud before ordering off a two sided menu that looks like all beer I would've wished our waiter would have advised me that they did serve wine. All  of us rated the service a 1.5 out of 5.0.    I am not mentioning the name of the server purposefully. Although he could have told me they had wine that really is all I can say related to him.  The major faux pas for us was how long it took to get anything to eat or drink."

A few minutes later the screens tuned to a soccer game. Funny. We didn't stay. Upside - they had all the beers in the flight."

                "description": "We chose to celebrate our New Year's Eve at the Brass Tap after snagging a few tickets for the 'Silent Rave' being hosted there that night. Since it was our first time attending such an event, going into it we thought things were going to be awkward, when in fact it was the complete opposite. Everyone had their headphones on, singing and dancing to one of three DJ's that were playing simultaneously on different radio channels. Even on this special night, the drinks were priced normally so kudos to that. This event turned out to be a very social affair.   If you're planning on going to an event like this, especially at the Brass Tap (Domain), I would recommend coming earlier than most to 1) grab a table to have a place to set drinks, otherwise how are you going to dance the way you want to dance? and 2) the line to get event headphones gets decently long and checking out the devices isn't a quick process.   5/5 for a fun organized event, clean venue, friendly bartenders, and a great night out."

                "description": "I stopped in while shopping and waiting for folks.  I live in Round Rock so been to that (older) location many times.  The atmosphere is quite different in each location with the RR one being more cozy and pub like.  This is more open and like a sports bar.   Now, on to the pricing.  This location seems more expensive than the RR one.  Other than Happy Hour and Friday fun day when beers and some cocktails are cheaper, the prices were high.  A well bourbon (Evan Williams) and diet was $7.50.  A draft beer was $7.50.  A Bulliet old fashioned was $16.50 (charged as a double). RIDICULOUS for a mid level sports bar (no NFL ticket)!!  So be prepared to help pay their rent at the Domain (which I understand is high).  Overall I like it as I like the one in RR. Different vibe but great selection of beer and cocktails. Great old school video games to play (Galaga, ms pacman, Dig Dug, etc).   The environment is nice and I think they have a DJ on certain nights.  Food seems like high end bar food which is as it should be.  I will definitely come back but it will be for happy hour or some other special.  #discountdave"

The happy hour started at 4pm and provides lots of tasty options.   We've been into wine lately, so we got the house red and sangria. They offered $4 shots and $7 drink of the day. The food options are priced at $5,6,7 and $8. We ended up getting the 3 Korean BBQ Pork Sliders with fries and 2 chicken tacos with chips and salsa. We were both dumbfounded by how much food you get with the happy hour specials.   Despite the lacking service at this location, we still had a okay time. Go in expecting lackluster and you won't get disappointed. ‍ They have a wonderful selection of beers as well, and a full menu. I provided the happy hour selections in my photos!"

It's definitely our \"go-to\" local bar, and we pop in and out usually at least once a week, even it's for just for a quick drink. The management is the NICEST, most gracious bunch you could ask for, and they are almost always present, making sure everyone is happy and tended to. The bar staff is all phenomenal, no matter what time you go in. The have a game room, several TV's/projectors, and even have live music on certain nights. They have a great Sunday brunch deal that really can't be beat. They pour a great drink, and have a nice pizza menu to order from as well!   They have an awesome, very large, dog-friendly patio with tv's, heaters, and misters. They have plenty of dog bowls for your pup, and a water cooler inside for you to use. They have a great sense of community too, and often have events going on that are open to everyone. Huge thanks to Miguel, Tammy, Jordan, and Audrey for always being the best bar staff in town!"

We lived walking distance away in the Windsor Park neighborhood about 3 years ago before moving further north.  This was before kids, a mortgage, and all the other amazing perks of adulthood.  We were just 2 kids in love hanging out at the bar with friends.  But then we thought we'd get married and the very next day had brunch at Nomad.  When we got our first pup together we brought him to Nomad.  Even when I was pregnant Nomad owner stopped by to congratulate us.  So see, Nomad is more than a bar to us.  It's where where our roads crossed, it's where we made friends and created a family.  We don't get to make it there often these days, but Nomad will always be home!"

Yes, I originally had fun in your establishment nearly two years ago, I wrote an honest review then, just as I wrote an honest review of what happened in your place last month.

                "description": "Update: Since posting my experience here I have received an intimidating Personal Message from one of the \"regulars\" here that basically said I misinterpreted my experience here as racism because the owner is a minority and that there are sometimes bartenders of color that work here. First off, what I witnessed was racism, plain and simple. And, for someone to try and brush it off as me \"misinterpreting\" it as \"some other reason for your friend not getting service as fast as she would like\", just goes to show the type of patronage here.  I also received a comment from the owner about not calling his bar \"overtly racist\" when it isn't. I am sorry to say I will not be removing that statement from my review as it was my initial experience there. That is the beauty of capitalism, freedom of choice, and having a review site to state your experiences openly and truthfully. I had absolutely no idea of this place before coming here, so there is no ill will or underhanded plot. However, when my friend and I experience something like that, especially in this day and age, I take the \"see something, say something approach\".   Respectfully, sir, if you don't want your establishment viewed in this light, then do not have employees who selectively treat patrons, especially new ones, in such a manner and then when confronted be a complete jerk about it. This all could have gone a completely different way had your bartender just apologized for ignoring my friend and served her. But, instead, he was the one who chose to escalate it and make race an issue. As a compassionate human person and a productive member of society, I chose the most vocal platform I had access to to bring this to the Community's, which you also reference in your reply, attention to ensure it is addressed and hopefully does not happen again. It is your customer's choice to read and heed my review and if it does have an affect on your patronage, you may need to ask instead of pointing blame outward, to look in-house.  Also, in response to my claim of racism in regards to our treatment here \"being a dangerous road to go down\", it absolutely is, but not because of the \"mob mentality\" of me and my fellow Yelpers voicing our experience. It is a dangerous road to go down to think that is in any way acceptable treatment of a customer, regardless of race, and especially because of it! It is a dangerous road to go down to not say anything and to be intimidated or guilted by having that behavior justified or brushed off. Casual racism is not ok and being vocal about it should never be called out as going down \"a dangerous road\". The danger lies in the complacency, not the action.  As for the $1.75 \"honest mistake\", please keep the offer of a refund. If that is how you define \"honesty\", yet another reason I will not be returning to this establishment.  *To clarify, I am straight out saying the bartender that served me and was a disrespectful ass to my friend behavior was racist, and since receiving an intimidating message from a regular here, by proxy the establishment, since this sort of conduct is not only acceptable here, but defensible by the regular patrons."

                "description": "Review of service*  Holy Racism, Batman.   You figure a guy that majored in cultural anthropology would have a little more of an open mind when it comes to hiring staff for his bar...  Hey Bartender... here's the best part... I'M THE GUY YOU KEPT SERVING OVER MY FRIEND who was standing right next to me. I literally walked up, not knowing if she ordered or was waiting, and within 3 seconds you asked what I wanted for a drink. This happened multiple times, we brought a group of 15 people to your filthy establishment, and sadly... the service and negative/racist mindset of the employee's shine through.   Granted... the owner of Nomad made the news a couple of months ago because he's in business with someone who attacked a guy with a Japanese sword and stabbed him with a dagger... but that's neither here nor there, or is that fact that The Department of Justice recently filed a civil rights lawsuit against the owners of many bars throughout the United States, accusing them of discriminating against non-white patrons. Would be a shame if this happened to Nomad.   The fact that I witnessed such blatant discrimination made me sick to my core, maybe the Austin Human Rights Commission should force your staff to undergo anti-discrimination training. Yes, that can happen (at your expense)   Anyways.... 1 star is 1 star tooooo many  - maybe come here if you support the KKK?

                "description": "FIVE STAR DIVE BAR!!  About two weeks ago, I checked out Surf by Surf East, which is an annual surf rock music fest, at Nomad Bar. King Pelican was the headliner. I saw them in San Antonio the last time I went to Texas, and knew this would be a great show.   Because I was staying downtown, I took a Fasten to the club.  Nomad Bar is in a mini strip mall near the Target by I-35. I saw a bus stop station nearby, but I went with ride share since I wasn't familiar with the area.   Nomad Bar has an outdoor patio area that's accessible only from the inside of the bar. I checked it out for a bit because it was such a nice night out, but went back indoors. The stage where the bands played is inside. Behind the stage is a projection screen. Most of the acts that night had YouTube videos looping in the background. The sound in Nomad is good for acts. Got some really good recordings inside.   I sat mostly at the high tables towards the front by the entrance. I split a pizza pie, which was tasty (an independent business does the food at Nomad). Drink prices were pretty good here; I stuck mostly to Dos XX. In between acts, I checked out the game room, where there are darts and an arcade game. The game room is well-lit, which is in contrast to the main bar/indoor area that's dark and dive-y (in a good way).   King Pelican were awesome that night (as expected). I would come back to Nomad the next time I'm in Austin. You should check it out."

We demolished it and ordered 2 more, each different. I'd go back just for the pizza!  I like the cozy feel to the place and that they have indoor and outdoor service. I also never had to wait long to order, which is rare and fabulous."

                "description": "Solid tavern style bar. Parking is a little bit of a challenge., but worth it. The thing that saves this place as a really good bar is the customer service, and really well made drinks. Plenty of sitting, with inside and outside sitting. I would definitely go back with friends! Side Note: Area is a little sketchy, so be situationally aware of your surroundings. I guess you could say that about a lot of places, though. I recommend this Bar!"

                "description": "Oh nooooo! Nomad what is your problem?!  Prejudice much?!! I was with about 15 folks then 2 in our party leave upset. I get word that the bartender kept serving other people (white) although my friend was there first. When said friend spoke up about it she was disrespected and told she'd be kicked out.   Hubs and another friend wanted to see this prejudice for themselves so they both go stand at the bar to order drinks. Two white girls walk up behind them and the bartender points to the girls BEHIND them and ask what they'd like to drink. Wow... Really?...  I come on here to write my review and see many of my buddies I was with wrote their review already. And lookie here, management DID NOT respond to the girl who was disrespected (black) or a buddie who was there with us (black) but seemed to respond to everyone else about the situation... Hmmmmm  Say it ain't so!!!! Don't try to respond now either buddy. Disgusting! Didn't mama teach you people are people and we all sh*t the same?!"

                "description": "Is this Dive bar with patio and small game room overtly racist? ..... perhaps. But what is racism?  Oxford states - \"Prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race\"...... The ironic thing is that the incompetent owner (Miguel) has just committed a racist act as clearly identified in his posts.  The blatant example being, the lack of communication to any of the three African American's that have left negative reviews in regard to this past Saturday's event.  Don't be too surprised, as it appears to be inline with his poorly managed business. Considering I've been phoning the establishment for two days now, only to be greeted with a recording of \"the mailbox of the person you're trying to reach is full and no new messages are being accepted, please try your call again later\"......... Well Miguel, I've tried my call again for several hours now. Perhaps you should place that book of Mein Kamph down and clear your voicemail.  What has sparked all of the recent one star reviews one may ask?  This past Saturday several friends of mine ventured into Nomad to enjoy a few drinks. Jordan, one of the bartenders seemed to be a little \"weathered\". I'm not sure if he had too many shots as I've seen him do in the past or what, but he apparently wasn't taking to kindly to the ethnicities standing in front of him, awaiting service. Instead he helped many \"whites\" and I use this term loosely, prior to them, even though they were positioned first in line. This wasn't an isolated incident. It happened more than once that evening, to more than one African American in our group.  Jordan has waited on me several times in the past, so I approached him and asked what prompted him to threaten one of my friends with being ejected from the bar.  When I mentioned that I've got too many witnesses that have the same recount he replied \"this isn't a court room, I don't care about witnesses\". Needless to say he was irrationally defensive and had no intention of calming the situation down.   The sad part is that I've visited this location several times for about a year. I initially noticed on my first visit that the establishment carried a slight Riff Raff tone and wasn't an example of \"class\". As I continued to patronize the location, I'd see female patrons wearing sandals reflecting heels that are in need of major pedicures, customers with dogs inside the bar area which appeared to frustrate some patrons, heck, even the Owner Miguel, was overly tipsy celebrating his birthday recently at the bar, and my girlfriend and I witnessed him acting belligerent and was showing butt crack, while cranking up the music more than once to the point it was annoying.  So Miguel, stop the PR nonsense and clean up your mess. As I look back through Yelp, you've been slapped with one star reviews about racism and poor service in the past. The fact it's still continuing leans more towards condoning your staff's behavior or cementing the fact you're an incompetent manager. Either way, you shall never see me cross your doors again."

I suggested to 15 that we continue the festivities at Nomad, a bar/lounge that I thought would be a great choice especially since to me, they craft the best caipirinhas in town. When I first visited Nomad, Jordan crafted the perfect caipirinha, using a top shelf cachaça, gaining my respect. Last evening, I immediately realized that he was not in good form when he began using lemon instead of lime for my caipirihna, he corrected his mistake and said, \"It's been a long day\",  and I accepted that but what was unacceptable, was disrepecting a member of my group. It's going to be difficult returning to this venue."

                "description": "If there was a 0 star option I would gladly give it to the Nomad bar. Let me set the stage regarding why I have such little respect for this bar.   I attended a post Unofficial Yelp Event event at the Nomad. I noticed one of my friends ( a black woman) abruptly leave the venue with her sister. I was told that she had a confrontation with the bartender over not serving her. I later witnessed my Hispanic friend stand by an empty bar not receiving service even though 3 bartenders looked directly at him, yes they made eye contact. A Caucasian person walked up to the bar not 5 feet from my friend and he was immediately served. After speaking with my friend to validate what I witnessed I was disgusted by this behavior and left the bar.  Please note, as a Caucasian male, I had no issues ordering drinks. I also have a complaint regarding their drinks. If you are a regular you receive a healthy pour if you are a non-regular it's a pretty lite pour. Yes I was a bartender and know the count.  The important fact is that I witnessed discrimination against my friends of color. I really don't give a flying hoot about lite pours for non-regulars.  If you read the other reviews there is a pattern here and you can draw your own conclusions. I Paul Russo will never ever step foot in this bar again."

Let's address the concerns about racism:  Fact: there is a dickhead bartender who works here. He shouldn't work here. He's an ass to everyone. He hasn't served me. I'm about as Caucasian looking as they come. He isn't racist. He's an asshole. Assholes are every where. Just look at POTUS.   Fact: my husband (Native American and not mistaken for white) is served regularly. No issue.  Fact: my husband's band mates? Not a caucasian among them. All dark/tan/not white/labels are dumb among them. They get served.   Point of interest: Motion to fire asshole bartender. Your move, Nomad.    Go see for yourself. They have a very chill vibe.

It is dive-y and in a really unremarkable neighborhood. There are flyers and posters all over the walls. The inside is kind of cramped and doesn't have a lot of seating; outside can be better although still cramped, but there are heat lamps! Roast like meat under red lights.  The pizza is like really good... again, no idea why. I think of it and dream of fluffy crust, the ideal amount of toppings, and wholesome flavor. They have twice now screwed up our order and brought the wrong pizza out - late and without apology - but I'll keep ordering it.  Dim, not overly friendly, and a little crowded... but good vibes. And good pizza, if you get what you want.  Well, the only thing is - I think they used to be the Nomad Bar and have no idea why they added the \"k.\""

I wasn't able to get the name of the bar tender, but I know Gus and Tony were the bouncers and just made things worse by also getting involved and blowing things out of proportion. They get one star because the green tea shots are actually really good (plus I can't even give less than 1 star lol), but other than that the service is terrible, and the music is garbage. The place is never really poppin anyways so honestly go somewhere else for better service, better music, and a better environment."

Unfortunately as Rainey Street has become more and more a college student place Icenhauer's has gone waaaaay downhill. Now there are long waits for drinks, extremely drunk people everywhere and in general a lack of a positive vibe.  We went in -- waited 30 minutes and never even got to the bar to order a drink while college kids pushed us aside. It's a shame as five years ago Icenhauer's was my favorite bar in town.  All things change, and unfortunately Icenhauer's has changed for the far worse."

Very engaging and fun.    My wife had a White Claw seltzer and I had a local Pilsner.  Both did the trick and we all laughed at the drunk douchebag next to us who ordered 5 \"Water Shots,\" for his party trying to be funny.  He didn't realize that even his own group thought he was too thirsty for attention.  It made for some comedic relief though.  Fun little place."

Highly recommend to anyone looking to have fun, but not  prepared for the madness of the Dirty."

I got a margarita personal one and I love it! The only thing is that if you want crunchy Dough, let them know. I have my days that I want that.  Price: very reasonable.  Environment: people know each other a d it looks they are repetitive clients. As soon as I got there I felt very comfortable. It is a layback place, perfect for Family, Sports, Pizza time with the friends and music is super classic. They were playing the 3 Musketeers and II was just great to be there during lunch time.  Service: The server or manager made sure I like and enjoy pizza. I noticed that he will ask the clients on how was everything and he was really interested in knowing."

It's loaded with all the meat toppings! The sage sausage have a kick and it's such a quality pizza for what your pay for! The crust is crispy on the edges but fluffy and  chewy in the inside. I usually get thin pizza but decided to get regular crust and I am so glad I did! The texture is indescribable good! The bbq chicken pizza is equally amazing! It's unique and the bbq sauce is perfect balance with the feta cheese, chicken, and toppings! This place is a must try! I am so happy this pizza place exists in Elgin! I am excited to try the other pizzas on there menu! Order and pay online was super easy. Pick up time was on point and the pizza was still hot when we got home."

                "description": "My wife and I were driving home from Austin on Father's day looking for something to eat. I was craving pizza, so she lit up when she saw a sign for some outstanding pizza from Aviator Pizza coming up in two exits.  We decided on an 18\" to share and went with the pepperoni and basil with black olives. The cashier, and sole employee on the front side, was very friendly and humored us as we decided through the menu. Nothing really special there, but not everyone handles our humor or weirdness, so props to her. The pizza arrived shortly (plus for time) and we dug in. It was very tasty and the crust was very satisfying. I can't quite pin the taste, but it seemed like a home-made or high end dough because the taste lingered, and in a good way. It was one of my favorite crusts. The rest of the pizza was great as well and ranks up there with the best. Aviator Pizza is nowhere close to where I live, but if I take a road trip to Austin again, I will certainly make it a point to stop in. I'd go so far to say it would be worth leaving the city limits to get some better pizza."

                "description": "4.5 stars. Quick, yummy, affordable pizza on the way to Austin! Drive-thru window made it super convenient. Love how you can get 2 different toppings on a 9\" personal pizza. Maybe not the best pizza ever (I like Via 313), but definitely good for the price.  FLYING GARLIC (garlic butter base, chicken, garlic, spinach, feta, spinach, crushed red peppers) $9.95 for 9\" - slightly preferred over the Brussels sprouts pizza bc I loved the garlic and feta. Only complaint is that there was hardly any chicken, mostly garlic cloves.  SRIRACHA BRUSSELS SPROUTS and GOAT CHEESE (red sauce base, Brussels, goat cheese, honey sriracha, mozzarella) $9.95 for 9\" - the goat cheese was the predominant flavor which I enjoyed. Not much Brussels sprouts. Maybe this would be better on a white base rather than red sauce? Still good.  9\" pizza comes w/ 6 slices. I probably would've been satisfied after 3-4, but I'm fat and ate the whole thing. Shareable if you're not a big eater. Crust is thicker than MOD Pizza, I love bread!  CINNAMON PECAN DESSERT $7- basically the size of a 9\" pizza so it's worth the price. It was yummy! However, I wish there was more icing and pecans on it (compared to other pics), but I have a huge sweet tooth. Plain cinnamon dessert is $5.50  Picnic tables in front if you want outdoor dining. Connected to the gas station (sign is easy to miss). Plenty of parking."

I called in our order - pretty funny recording (like a captain getting ready for take-off to fit the aviator theme).. nice sticking to the character of its name! We placed the order easily and were told it'll be ready within 20ish mins. It was ready for pickup and packaged when we arrived. The place was pretty large, modern, and clean for when we re-open for dine in. But there were a few picnic tables out front and no one around so we decided to hang out and eat outside. Thick good quality paper plates provided!   The pizza was decently priced and we got the large 18\" - half Hawaiian and half Margherita. Can't say I like the flavors - the toppings were alright but the pizza crust was just bland.. zero flavors and maybe taken out of the oven too early cause it was soft and not so crispy along the edges. They do load the pizza with lots of toppings though. Can't say it's the best pizza I've had - not even close - but it filled us up and it was quick. Don't think we'll be making a return unfortunately."

It's pretty unfair to paint a restaurant as a good option for gluten free food with just ONE option. A GF crust. But. It really isn't. If you are gluten INTOLERANT,  this is NOT your place. It's really not much of a choice at all. Red sauce or pesto. Thats it. So you can have red sauce on a cracker. That's how the GF crust is. A dried cracker. Burnt crisp.  The other pizza crust... is like one size fits all. They take a single amount of pizza dough for all 3 sizes of pizza. I had a 9 inch pizza and it could have been a calzone. Its was WAY too much dough. I added portobello mushrooms as a topping and got about 10 small pieces. It just wasn't good.   In fact about all I can say that is positive is the Cream Soda. Everything else was just, meh."

I was a huge fan when they first opened. Music. Community. Meeting new friends! It was great!  I have to say, I'm not a sports fan. And I really don't think we need another sports bar. But I know I'm a minority in this.  Playing important games here and there sure!  But when the TVs came, the Music died so much! The table sharing was less.  But you know what? I still feel like I'm \"home\" when I come here. And you can NOT beat the cheese curds!  So stuff your face, play some darts, and enjoy the locals! Because here we are!  Only gripe.... Plz play less sports! I don't need 15 TVs! I leave the house to not watch TV. Just saying:)  But I can't help but love them."

Definitely like any other bar, but drink specials are unbeatable and, as I stated above, they have amazing food for a bar but it will make you say \"diet starts tomorrow\" every bite.  Dog friendly outside, but only downsides are the tables can fill up quickly and parking isn't ideal."

                "description": "Everyday Black Sheep Lodge has a special on drinks which is always appreciated for a gal like me who loves to throw them beers back whether it be daytime or nighttime. I really like their Trashcan Tuesdays (all Texas canned beers are $3!) to pair with my very own basket of cheese curds, a plate of burger sliders, and some crispy sweet potato fries! Sorry but I don't share my cheese curds when I come here.  Parking can be a thing but do know that there are about a dozen spots reserved for just BSL in the back behind Cindy's (go around back around the corner). There are also a few spots directly in front by the patio area. Otherwise I would suggest ridesharing to BSL if you got a group of folks who you plan on meeting up with.  This is a place where you can bring large groups for sure as there is plenty of space in the game room area AND inside area. I love the bar area too but it can be get crowded with regulars - which isn't a bad thing but something to note.  Service is fast and quick here every time I come even during peak or major game watching. I have never had an issue with being there to meet friends, having my own separate tab, lack of service etc. Only positive experiences here for me which is what keeps me coming back!"

The wings are quickly becoming our favorite, and the mimosas are really really well balanced! Honestly that's hard to find for me... there's always too much juice or the bubbles are flat... not here! I like the spring salad w chicken.. not too unhealthy and V-tasty!! Also bringing the pups are an option on the outside patio!!"

This is not your run of the mill bar food; the tenders and wings are some of the best I've ever eaten, no joke. The fried pickles and cheese curds are delicious. The onion rings are absolutely perfect -- hot and crispy, not greasy-- and it's always worth it to get the full basket. The Chicago Dog is one of my favorites too. I haven't tried the burgers yet, but I can't imagine I'd be disappointed in the least. Very highly recommended!"

Lots of TVs so during football season I'm sure it's a full house. The drink choices and food are good, but there are a few minor complaints I have.  There are daily specials on select Texas drafts, cocktails, and other drinks. However, I wish there would be more choices of drafts because it didn't seem like they have any. But I really like the choices I tried, and they even have some others from different breweries. They also have select drinks in cans and bottles.  The food is good, but it wasn't really what I expected. I just had 8 wings to watch a basketball game. The Buffalo medium sauce was excellent, but the lemon pepper dry rub had a little too much of the powder on it, decreasing the integrity of the taste. But I must say the Buffalo sauce and the taste of the chicken wings were pretty good. Maybe a burger or something next time.  I think I'll be back during football for some games, or another time whenever I want to bring a friend. Go try it out and maybe you'll like it. Parking is available in the back by Cindie's, but get there early as spaces run out quick."

I plan to visit more and scroll through the list of options again.  There's also a number of daily food and drink specials and I believe there is a happy hour offered as well.  I typically come to here to watch [European] football  (soccer) with a cold beer and standard American bar fare.  My one gripe is that they have a pretty good burger that they just don't know how to cook at medium temperature. I've ordered it twice and reiterated that I'd like it medium and it comes out well done each time.  That's mad annoying but I'm still holding out faith that they'll get it right one day. The fries are pretty top notch.  Again, you can't loose coming here just on the strength of the beer selection alone.  I'll be back for a better burger experience soon."

The porch is chill and dog friendly though, so there's that. If you've got tons of time and don't mind being ignored and overlooked, it's worth a look. That said, you'd likely being doing yourself a favor by going to either ABGB or Loro, both of which are within walking distance."

I also appreciate the large number of TVS and the staff's ability to switch one to the game you'd like to see. During football season it can be hard to find a bar playing anything other than the Texas games, which makes sense but can be frustrating. Luckily Black Sheep has so many TVs and the set-up to accommodate many guests with multiple interests!"

The second issue: on this occasion my experience with my waitress was not the best. Didn't get seen/attended to for about 5 minutes. Then it took forever to close my tab/close out due to her not even acknowledging my table. She would go sit and mingle with other tables. (And they weren't even that busy)   Over all, the wait staff could've been a lot better. And the establishment itself should do something about their shitty parking situation. Nobody wants to pay $100 to get their car unbooted because of the lack of parking."

After a long day of exploring my boyfriend and I stopped in for an early dinner. Pleasant atmosphere and friendly staff. My boyfriend ordered the bbq ribs which came out absolutely perfect and delicious. I on the other hand orders the chicken parm which came out extra charred however not wanting to be a pest I didn't complain and decided to just work around it. The manager and the server were amazing and even tho I didn't complain they removed the charge for my entree. Overall the restaurant has a great vibe, very clean and the staff are extremely professional. I would most definitely come here again... for a less charred entree of course"

Not usually a big American-food person but I was curious why this place was so well-rated and wanted to try it for myself.   I asked the server to let me know what are the best things on the menu. She was very familiar with the restaurants' offerings and she killed it with her recommendations. Here's what we got:   For appetizers, Housemade Guac and Oven-roasted Wings are must-gets. The Guac is great because the chips are unique: baked sweet potato chips! I could munch on these all night. Thankfully, the Oven-Roasted Wings stole my attention as soon as it landed on my table. Best. Wings. The Chimichurri sauce is addicting!   For mains, our server mentioned that the West Coast Steak Sandwich is the best. One bite in, I wholeheartedly trusted her. It's cooked to perfection and the bed of greens helps to cut the fattiness of the meat. The Chimichurri Steak was also pretty good but the steak on the West Coast Steak Sandwich was better. The fries were well-seasoned, perfectly thin, and crispy. Oh, we also threw in a Brussel Sprouts Salad, which was needed to balance the heavy meal.   - Our server was knowledgeable about the menu (+1) - Everything came out so quickly, I think in less than 20 minutes (+1) - Our server's recommendations were spot on and the food was great (+1, +1) - Very reasonably-priced for how good this restaurant is (+1)   That's a solid 5-stars in my books. Highly recommend!  p.s. I dined at the bar to skip the wait, which was going to be 45 minutes (7:30 PM on a Wednesday night). Reservations are probably needed because of how busy the Domain gets."

The decor and ambiance was really nice, and we sat outside which was roomy and cozy.  If back in the area, we'd probably stop in for drinks and maybe an appetizer, but I'm not so sure about paying the asking price for full meals again."

We went on a week night which went decently without too much of a crowd."

If you have not eaten here then it's a must. I stretched my neck out for what others were ordering and it all looked so yummy. I'll be a repeat customer for sure."

It's a nice gem at The Domain where no matter what mood you're in / the size of your group, there seems to be something for your appetite. Seriously generous portions of food, and I've not had anything bad yet (and I definitely try and order some variety from the menu when I do visit). Some of my favorites include Grilled Chicken Salad, Carnitas Sandwich, The Number Six (like an upscale Chik-fil-A sandwich!), Chicken Kebabs (enough food to share or have leftovers!), Crispy Jalapeño Potatoes (seriously dream about these!), Homemade Oreo Ice Cream (always go for the larger portion!). They take reservations, which I would recommend, especially on the weekends. The service is always friendly and attentive. It's got a good sized patio and my only complaint is the last time I was there, I had a patio reservation and they told me there were no tables (even though there clearly were, but were being \"held for other reservations\")."

We had a group of 15 out on the patio and it was so nice, open, and spacious. Our server was attentive and efficient, able to accommodate all of our various requests. We were corresponding with the manager, John, for the month leading up to the shower and he was so helpful, sending us pictures, answering any questions we had. He checked on us the day of as well and really took care of us. And of course the food was a hit, so delicious- highly recommend the candied bacon. We'll definitely be returning just to eat!"

She had been hearing good things and saw great reviews, we went with another friend who also has a birthday in June.  The place was very nice, you had indoor and outdoor seating, the staff wore masks. We sat inside as it was hot, there is a parking garage, the purple one, right across the street so that was nice.  Service was great and fast. We started with some drinks and candied bacon and chips and Guac. The bacon was very good, agreed on by all three of us. The water did not come with ice which I found rather weird but maybe it's not but they keep it filled.  Our friend has the Cobb salad, Shana had the Turkey Burger, and I had Chicken. They both liked theirs, my fries were really good but unless you dipped the chicken in one of the sauces they brought it was pretty dry. Good flavor but dry.  The food was good, they raved about the chips but the guac was not as great as they were hoping. Overall it was good but not as good as many review make it sound, I admit I expect more when the food it more expensive and two of the three meals being good is great but while I am glad we went, not going to be on my normal rotation of places to go on date nights."

We started with the guacamole and sweet potato chips, which were to die for. I had the chicken Wok bowl with sweet and sour Thai sauce and it was very tasty. I did ask for sriracha to add because it wasn't spicy at all. For dessert we all split the Cinnamon Toast Crunch cheesecake, which was fantastic, although very rich. For the cocktails, I had the Crazy Beautiful, which was perfectly balanced with a little sweetness, nothing crazy. I look forward to going back!"

And one of the menu items that isn't listed on the menu or online is that they have a GF bun option! Much to my delight my meal was fabulous and fresh.

Man, Austin has definitely come a long way!! Doc B.'s stays packed because the food is delicious, they have just enough of a variety that it is not too overwhelming and they have great food options. I am a huge fan of their wok out bowls, the fried chicken sandwich, turkey burger with sweet potato fries and the brussel sprout salad with salmon. Recently, I tried the chimichurri wings and OMG....bomb! Beware, it has tons of garlic and while I love garlic, garlic does not love me, but for these wings, it's worth the night-long burps."

                "description": "I've only been here twice but, have enjoyed it both times. I think I need to explore the menu more to figure out what my favorites are. I will say that with it being the new year, I have been trying to eat lighter and one thing I like about Loro is that they have plenty of healthy options on the menu.   I ordered the salmon rice bowl. The salmon was tender, flaked off easily and was seasoned well. It was quite tasty. It came with white rice, cilantro, red onion and a sauce. I thought the sauce/rest of the bowl could have been a bit more flavorful. I honestly think this was because I ordered salmon and salmon doesn't have a lot of fat like pork belly, etc. I took a bite of a friends bowl that had ordered pork belly and of course this was a large flavor difference. Not really any fault of Loros, I just think I will order a little extra sauce next time  if I choose salmon. It definitely checked off the health part though, ha!   We got an appetizer of pickled veggies, which were awesome! They had a variety of vegetables and they all packed quite a taste punch! Very good.   Also tried the Mango Sake Slushie and it was so good! My friend said this is what they're known for. It wasn't overly sweet and tasted natural but, still had alcohol in it! Definitely would get this again.   Giving 4 stars because I simply haven't tried enough of the menu yet, but look forward to trying more of what they have and enjoy knowing they have a variety of foods to pick from depending on my mood or calorie limit of the day!"

                "description": "TL;DR; Really quality food; cocktails are solid; service is nice with an interesting concept; cool vibes. Get the chicken karaage.  My husband and I came here for a date night on Saturday and had a great time. Seating was surprisingly easy (we got there around 6:30pm? We're seated at the bar within 5 minutes). We sat at the bar, which was nice because we didn't have to go up and order food/drinks (which is what you'd have to do if you are seated at a table). Bartender and service was nice and attentive, host was friendly but not annoying.   Originally, we came for drinks and try a few dishes to share, but everything sounded so go that we stuffed ourselves with too food to get to the drinks. I did try the Typhoon, which was pretty good. The frozen drinks looked good, but was too full of food to get one.  Would DEFINITELY come back for the food. We both got rice bowls (husband got the chopped smoked brisket and I got the char siew pork belly), the corn fritters, and chicken karaage. DO NOT SLEEP ON THE KARAAGE. So delicious--the sauce they drizzle on top is *chef's kiss*, the jalapeño aioli was a perfect pair, and it was super tender, juicy, and crisp all at the same time.  Corn fritters tasted great, only critique is that the sweet corn was SUPER sticky/gummy (stick to your teeth in every aspect)."

These are all the things I would associate Loro with. Did you know that Loro is a fusion from the famous bbq of Austin TX - Franklin  and amazing sushi chef from Uchi? This birth child mix of Asian fusion bbq is not to miss or else you'll regret it.  Let's begin with how satisfy I was with the fantastic happy hour price. Don't forget to catch it on weekdays 2 pm to 5 pm. The drinks are to die for and that fried chicken was so crispy and delicious , I'll be content with just eating it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.   Definitely a must go to for one of the best happy hour deals in town !"

                "description": "I haven't been this wowed by a restaurant in a LONG time!!!! Picture THAT dish that knocks you off your feet in a big meal....now imagine every dish you have is THAT good. I'd haul it back to Austin just for the bavette!!  Must try's when you come: - crispy potatoes: every potato was crispy on the outside yet flavorful and soft on the inside. I could drink the yuzu aioli  - crunchy sweet corn fritters: the best corn fritters I've ever had??? Again the sriracha aioli was PERFECT to pair with it (overall Loro had mad sauce game) - chicken karaage: perfectly fried and plenty of juicy, slightly mala meat. Def need to get if you like chili oil  - smoked beef brisket: it's so tender, it's difficult to pick up and literally melts in your mouth  - char siew pork belly: the sauce is hoisin with a twist, and it's so savory and cuts the fatty pork belly in the best way - smoked prime bavette: oh my god? How have I never had bavette before this?? This was one of the best cooked steaks I've ever had. It was the most perfect medium rare and literally so tender I couldn't comprehend  They also hit it out of the park with their drinks - the mango sake and Vietnamese coffee slushees were AMAZING (the viet coffee will WAKE you up). Overall an amazing spot to grab a bite with friends or for a date night. Heard they're opening up in Houston and you bet I'll be first in line to check it out!"

                "description": "Now that is what you call an Austin spot. The outdoor setup is absolutely gorgeous with multiple different types of seating to match your mood. My wife and I usually go for their happy hour and the Yuzu Spritz is our favorite. The food is really delicious too but wish there were some vegetarian food options in their happy hour menu.  This has definitely become our go to Friday happy hour spot.  Couple of recommendations - 1. Parking can get full so you may have to lurk around a little  2. Food and drinks ordering is a little fast food style where yo I go inside the restaurant to order and then the servers will come find you   Overall, a must visit !!"

                "description": "The food was sooo good! My friend suggested this place since I was in town visiting. I was confused when I entered because I didn't know if I needed to check in, but it's pretty much self seating and you order your food and drinks at the bar.   Since I was only here to grab a quick weekday lunch bite, I ordered the Chicken Karaage and the Smoke Prime Bavette. They were both so good! The chicken karaage was well battered and just fried perfectly, on top of that, the chicken was topped with their version of a sweet chili sauce and some cilantro and Thai basil. The smoked prime Bavette was delicious! The steak was obviously the tasty star of the dish, but I also that they did a really good job with their coconut rice. The sides, like watermelon radish and red onion. help cut the richness of the rice and the smoked prime. Lastly, my only drawback was the sauce that came with it as it was a little too sour for my tastes, so to anyone who is sensitive to sour, take it easy with your pour!  Overall, I would definitely come back with friends to try their drinks and enjoy this delicious food again."

                "description": "If I could give them more stars, I would. Not sure why I have not reviewed Loro until now. I was likely trying to keep them to myself. Loro is the brainchild of Aaron Franklin and Tyson Cole and it does not disappoint. They call themselves an Asian smokehouse. The menu brings the best of both worlds to all those who dine there.   Happy Hour is from 2-5. They sell $4 Ty Ku Sake plus Stemmari wines on tap (Pinot Grigio, Rosé, and Pinot Noir). I love the Rosé. They have a cheeseburger that has shredded brisket with red onion jam on top! It is only available during HH or until they run out.  Pro-tip. Order it to go and enjoy it the next day.   Other favorites include the chicken Karage, corn fritters, beef tostadas, crispy potatoes, pickled vegetables, pork belly, and the smoked Prime bavette. The brisket is delicious, but only available after 4 pm. Everything comes with an Asian flair (sriracha aioli with the corn fritters, chili aioli and Thai herbs with the Karage, miso mustard and yuzu aioli with the potatoes, hoisin sauce with the pork belly, and shishito salsa verde with the bavette).  They have a nice large outdoor patio with a combination of picnic tables and smaller tables with chairs. They also have ample indoor seating. You order at the bar and they bring the food to your table. They also offer curbside service - which was my go-to option during the lockdown.  The parking gets full quickly, but there are spaces just south of them in the lot behind the building next door."

Service is different than expected but we appreciated how it worked out. You order drinks and food at the bar. They give you a pager tracker to put on your table. Runners bring out the food. They have a large outdoor seating area and a large dining room. Great collaboration of BBQ and Asian  flavors. Most are weird  combinations but what else would you expect in Austin? Solid 5"

The outdoor dining patio area had spacious picnic tables with some sections covered with tent coverings.  Smoked Prime Bavette ($18.75): The medium-rare steak was tender and sliced thinly. There were some rich flavors from the shishito salsa verde and the natural smoke.  Loro Cheeseburger ($12):  When I bit into the thick beef patty, I knew right away how high quality it was. The burger had a southern flare with the slight barbecue sweetness from the brisket layer.  The red-onion brisket jam added some more  dimension.  Crunchy Corn Fritters ($7.75): An appetizer with an Incredibly crispy outer battered shell and soft sweet corn tidbits inside. The sriracha aioli dipping sauce cut through the heaviness from the fried batter."

                "description": "I'm sorry, but I will never get the hype with this place. I've been here three times, and every time I wonder why it is that people recommend Loro. Fusion Asian food is always a huge hit or miss, and Loro definitely misses out every single time.   My friend and I ordered their chicken karaage, cold noodles, and corn fritters. All of the dishes were incredibly mediocre and left us wanting more out of the dish. The corn fritters were only edible with the sauce that they give, the cold noodles were not worth the price tag attached, and the chicken karaage was a mess. The only redeeming items we ordered were their gin and tonic and mint mojito. Those were absolutely delicious.   For some reason, their workers always seem like they don't want to be working there and I almost feel bad for going up to them to order my food. I've never come across a kind server at Loro."

                "description": "Came to Loro for a friend's birthday, and as per usual, was met with a great experience. We stopped by Friday evening around 7:30pm and waited a little over an hour for a table, but the time flew by with great company and the ambience. The waiting area was equipped with an outside bar, elevating the atmosphere and allowing us to get some drinks in while we waited.  In terms of food, we ordered the crispy potatoes, chicken karaage, smoked brisket, and the malaysian chicken bo ssam (not pictured, sorry ate too fast). The potatoes were delectably crispy and were paired perfectly with the creamy aioli sauce. Needless to say, they were destroyed within minutes.   Moving on, if there's one thing you'd have to get at Loro, it would definitely be the chicken karaage. One thing about Loro is that every single ingredient and flavor you can tell is thought out and placed for a reason. Not only do the flavors of the ginger and cilantro complement the sweet glaze of the chicken wonderfully, it also add layers of flavor that bombard your taste buds in the best way.   I would also highly recommend the malaysian chicken bo ssam which was unfortunately demolished before I could get a picture. It came with lettuce wraps, pickles, pickled radish and chicken. The chicken was tender and topped with an authentic Malaysian sauce that was smoky and had curry-esque flavors. I really enjoyed how light/clean this entree was, whilst still providing a great variety of volume and flavors.   Finally, we also ordered the smoked brisket. I feel like the only thing needed to be said is that you can tell Franklin's was involved in this establishment.   To sum things up, Loro continues to be one of my go-to spots here in Austin. I always walk away feeling beyond satisfied in terms of quantity, and happy knowing the quality is similarly as great.   5 stars."

Place your order at the bar, get a number and they bring it out to your table. Asian fusion. Upscale casual atmosphere. Turned into more of a bar atmosphere as time went on - lots of people standing around between tables. Extremely fast service. Friendly staff.  We tried a bunch of different dishes, which combined to be enough for five people. I counted nine dishes and enjoyed every single one of them! Also had a Vietnamese coffee slush, which is alcoholic, to end it. Unique and refreshing!"

Anyway the food was pretty good but I didn't get anything mind blowing. The best part was my cucumber drink it was very tasty. I think the Popeyes chicken sandwich is better than this one by a lot. Mine had gristle on it and it was pretty unpleasant.  Overall I'll probably come back again because it's so close to my friends apartment. I've just had better for the money!"

I stumbled upon the Austin Brewery Tours' website while searching on Yelp for ideas.   I had an awesome time exploring Austin's growing beer scene. I also had a great time meeting and making friends the other tourists on our tour.   I enjoyed all of the 3 breweries but the behind the scene tour at Independence Brewing Co. made it my favorite.   The price is very fair when you consider it includes your tastings and tips for your severs.   In a nutshell, a good alternative tour for those interested in the Austin craft beer scene."

                "description": "Apparently it's become a tradition that we do a brewery tour when we travel. One of the breweries I was told I MUST visit, while in Austin, was Jester King. Searched online for brewery tours that included this and finally decided on Austin Brewery Tours.  Almost daily tours, online booking was so easy, and we got a reminder, a couple of days earlier to our tour, via email.  Tour starts at noon.  Meetup time was 11:30am. At around 11:25am the van was there.  Out comes Shane, owner and tour guide. He immediately introduced himself, thanked us for being on time and proceeded to ask us our names and where we were from. Once the other people taking the tour arrived, we were all introduced and in the van we went.  During the time we were driving, he would ask us questions to get to know us better, and see the style of beers we liked. He also gave us an intro of each of the breweries we would visit. He made the time driving pass by fast and welcomed all questions we could have.  At each of the breweries, he explained the process and what we had included in the price of the tour. At Jester King, they even had a special release and he bought a sample of each (which was not included in the price but he gifted us with it) making sure we had the complete experience.    You can tell he enjoys doing these tours and meeting the people.   He even took us to Revolution - which was in front of one of the breweries we visited - to try locally made flavored gin.   So greateful he allowed us to do this quick stop - this was delicious, and gave me the opportunity to talk more with one of the ladies on the tour, exchanging ideas on recipes with the gin we had just tried.    Shane is grate at incorporating everyone in the tour and conversations.  He allows you plenty of time to enjoy each brewery and every beer you choose.   He is now friends with the staff at each of these breweries, which works on the advantage of everyone in the tour since we got excellent/ friendly service at each stop.  Best part of this all, is you meet new people, get to enjoy all the beer you can drink, and don't have to drive. Great way to spend a day in Austin.  If looking for a beer tour, look no further, this is it!"

                "description": "October 2018. 5 out of 5. We decided to take a brewery tour while we visited Austin. This ended up being a great decision. The tour is structured well. We did three stops which gave us a good opportunity to try three different breweries without having to worry about driving, parking, or any of the attendant Logistics. The tour covers all expenses including tips which is a nice touch. You can tell that the tour is well organized and that the breweries appreciate the business. That means you end up getting much better service at all of the breweries than you sometimes get with such packages. The tour guide also is able to make excellent suggestions so if you don't have a lot of experience with craft beer this is a great way to learn. If you have any interest in a brewery tour while in Austin I highly recommend this tour."

SXSW had Austin jammed with a lot to do but Shane made sure we got to see Austin and its beer community like the locals do. He was insanely knowledgeable not just about beer but also about Texas. When you've solo traveled the world like he has, you gain a perspective that makes you far more relatable too which made him an all around cool guy to hangout with.  Most important.. The beers were phenomenal! (Try the goat tacos at Lotus also!)  In town for a day, a week, or a life time - Hands down recommend this for anyone in Austin!"

He was very friendly and ensured we had a good time. Even though it was about 1000 degrees outside, he kept the van cool and ensured we were cared for.  We had opportunities to not only sample excellent beers, but also visit several food trucks in the area. His rapport with the brewery owners gave us extra attention and really made us feel special.

                "description": "Austin Brewery Tours was awesome! This was a Christmas gift for my husband and we both had a great time. Brooke was a wonderful tour guide, and she made good beer recommendations (especially considering that I'm not much of a beer drinker).   We did the Hill Country Tour and visited Jester King, Last Stand, and Skull Mechanix. Each tour had a tasting option (one where we all tasted beers as a group and the others where we each got to pick our own beers to try). After selecting beer to taste, we got to explore each brewery on our own before moving onto the next location. We had enough time to eat (plan on eating at Jester King. The food is awesome and we spent the most time there) and to drink at every place, while still getting to individually wander and see all that these breweries had to offer. We also got to take the Jester King tour, which is really cool.   I'd highly recommend an afternoon with Austin Brewery Tours!! Thank you Brooke for a great day!"

We were on a bachelor party where everyone loved craft beer, and wanted to find out what Austin has to offer. The breweries we visited were perfect since they offered a wide variety of options, and Shane kept us on time without rushing us.  It was truly a fun and professional experience. I'll be recommending ABT to others who inquire about brewery tours in Austin."

He was extremely helpful and prompt in all of our communications. Also, the van we took was clean and very comfortable.   The tour itself was AMAZING and huge shout-out to our guide Brooke, you killed it! Tremendous job moving us from location to location while never making us feel rushed, so glad it wasn't on me to wrangle the guys when it was time to go :). Also, your beer recommendations were spot on! Same with your suggestions for things to do for the rest of the weekend.   I have been on similar tours in other cities and Austin Brewery Tours is the gold standard now. I have already recommended them to a few people planning trips to Austin and I know others in our group have as well.   Thanks Shane and Brooke!"

He was great at mingling with all the different groups within our group (there were 6 groups!) and was a great tour guide in general. He mixes up which breweries he goes to which makes it exciting if you do this several times. It's definitely well worth the money to get a fun, convenient way to enjoy beers of Austin."

Shane was very easy to work with, and very responsive to all of my questions prior to getting this booked. We had 2 large vans for a group of 25 girls and it worked out perfectly. Shane picked out 3 wonderful breweries for our group with a wide variety of beers (and some with other options like ciders) - all locations had plenty of space for our large group, delicious beers, and food trucks available when the group got hungry. Overall, our group had a wonderful time. I highly recommend Austin Brewery Tours!"

Had the enchilada trio in the suizas sauce; all of them excellent. And the beans cooked with bacon??  Holy hell- AMAZING.  Great sangria- get the carafe- makes sense and you will finish it.   Trevor was our waiter- what a fun guy.  Helpful, attentive and funny - loved him. Also- do yourself a favor and get the chocolate cream pie"

I ordered a specialty margarita on the rocks and it was just ok.  The table ordered the chicken fajitas, enchiladas and carnitas plate. The fajitas were overcooked and dry. The edges were burnt and the onions and peppers were sliced way too thin and were over cooked as well. The portion was very small from my last visit, but shrinkflation huh?? The enchiladas were very good and the carnitas were the favorite. The charro beans were awesome. The rice was bland and one dimensional and the street corn was overly sweet. The salsa was flavorful but at least one needs a little more heat. The restaurant itself is really cool and clean. I will definitely go back but on a different night maybe try a different dish and drink"

We got a reservation a little earlier than normal so we could take in the Christmas lights on the nearby Georgetown square.  Paige was our server and she did a great job. She was very attentive but didn't rush us. We started with chips and salsa, followed closely by the queso flameato, gooey and yummy .  Our meals included tortilla soup, shrimp chili relleno, street tacos and one of the special plates. Needless to say we waddled out... Our experiences in the past were a little inconsistent but this time they were right on point. Looked like there were enough employees to take care of the good crowd they had. It was fairly noisy though. Lots of families and groups.  Thanks Paige, keep up the good work! As I'm prone to say when it's appropriate, this is a repeater! Happy Holidays fellow Yelpers!"

I liked the Brussels sprouts and the chocolate cake, but why would I go to a Mexican restaurant for those?  I liked our waitress a lot, as we were a big party and she did her best. But I just can't stand it when water isn't refilled timely, especially since I needed to wash down the nasty flavors I was consuming."

                "description": "Passed this place a handful of times and decided to try it out. There's plenty of street parking nearby if the lot is full. Seating was quick for a party of three on a Wednesday night. They do take reservations so keep that in mind if you have a larger party.    ORDER  Chicken Flautas (start) Nachos (cut) Chips and Salsa (bench) Tres Leches   Food Flautas were good as were the chips and salsa. Nachos were surprising as the toppings were added to the chips and they're not the style where you can dip the chips. Not the style I'm used to but could be good for anyone trying to portion control.   Overall This would be a great place to take your out-of-town visitors because the service is good and the setting. I'd come back again and check out the bar area."

My favorite part about this restaurant is the outdoor seating and ambiance. It's relaxing, quiet shaded, and you can see the water below.   The service has always been pretty good, no complaints there.   The food is very good and the drinks too, their cucumber/jalapeno margaritas are perrrrfecccct.   I agree with many of the other reviews, it's much pricier than its competitors for very comparable tasting food. Post covid, you even have to pay for chips and salsa- which is unusual at a mexican restaurant."

                "description": "To be honest, I had given up on eating at this place some handful of years ago because I felt that the place was cooking Mexican food for the white-bread taste crowd. The food chronically lacked salt, seasoning or any interesting edge to it. Can you say \"Food for the old folks home\"?  But last week a friend of mine said to try again. said it had greatly improved, so I took his word for it and reluctantly went in....and can say that I was glad that I did.  They started us off with chips and salsa. Both the green (especially this one) and the red salsas were excellent and actually spicy, thank God.   We also ordered queso flameado with shrimp and chicken tortilla soup, both packed with flavor and quality ingredients.  The guacamole the we got was passable. Not as horrifically bland as is used to be BUT still needs a healthy dose of lime juice and salt which we ordered with it. Even or waiter said that it always needs more lime and salt, so, hey,just fix it already.  Everything else was also very nice, like the great seating outside and the bar drinks. I can see that they finally got some cooks that know this type of food and I am very happy about it. I WILL definitely be back.  My suggestion. You guys are finally on a roll regarding a more authentic taste. Don't rest yet!  You are only a few bold menu changes from being something truly great!"

The cucumber margarita is super refreshing, I highly recommend it. The guacamole didn't have much flavor but the blandness of the guac was needed to cool your mouth after eating the salsa. Cool vibe inside, the patio seating is beautiful but will have to wait until it's not 100 degrees out to enjoy the view."

We started with chips and salsa as well as queso and one of the monthly special cocktails, the smoky jalapeño margarita. We also enjoyed the aqua Fruita non alcoholic beverage as well. Between the 5 of us, we sampled several dinner options including the street tacos, the enchiladas, and the relleno. They were all spectacular and even though I had no space in my tummy to finish it all, I couldn't stop.   Ryan, our server, made the experience even more special. I can always tell if a server is being nice to get a tip, which I can understand, but Ryan was honestly genuine and engaging without being intrusive.   The restaurant itself is beautiful with a generous deck that provides ample room to dine outdoors.   We will be back, sooner rather than later as I am already craving more Chile rellenos. You won't be disappointed!!"

                "description": "Our first time dining here.  We were impressed with the food. The ingredients were very fresh.  Although the restaurant says classy attire don't let that deter you from trying it out. It's in a resort so resort wear is appropriate. Some people even wore jeans and shorts. Would we come back to this restaurant during our next stay at Lost Pines? Yes!  Appetizer: baked brie (7/10) with candied pecans   Entree:  Kid's filet with Mac and cheese- 8/10. The filet was perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked.   Chilean Seabass with Duck and Brussels sprout leaves - 8/10  Waygu ribeye with truffle butter - 8/10. Steak was pretty good and perfectly cooked.   Dessert:   Kid's chocolate gelato - 5/10 slightly icy and had orange rinds in there I think. My daughter didn't want fancy ice cream and didn't like the taste  Banana's foster cheesecake - 7/10"

                "description": "Over priced but doesn't surprise me because it's a restaurant at a hotel. Ordered the Chilean sea bass $45 a la carte and it was served on top of this cherry or raspberry sweet sauce, omg horrible! Those two flavors don't go together. The sea bass was cooked perfect and very tasty!   Tuna appetizer was good. The shrimp cocktail still had some of the shell on it, very disappointing!   Jason ordered the filet and he said it was pretty good.   Loved the mushrooms.   Good wine list but way over priced.  Creme brûlée: no vanilla so it's tasteless. The custard part is too thick and not creamy and smooth like a custard."

                "description": "We got a set menu that came with a salad appetizer, entree, shared sides and a dessert. The salad was a simple green salad with blackberries and corn bread croutons. There was too much dressing though. The salad was pretty standard but the corn bread croutons was a nice twist. The salmon was amazing. I believe it was partially broiled because it was unbelievably moist but the skin was crisp. This was probably my favorite part of the meal. The dessert was a chocolate bomb with peanut butter mousse inside. It was rich and decadent, and delicious. The food was really good, but my major complaint was the service. It was a slow and they mixed up our orders and forgot my cocktail. If you have the time to relax then that might not be too bad but this three course meal was spread over almost three hours."

We had salmon, \"risotto\" (yes, in quotes), and chicken. All horrible. We left in disappointment and went downstairs to the bar hopping that a good Old Fashion would make us forget the bad experience. I'm sad to report, they have no clue how to make an Old Fashion either.  We are wishing we didn't come to this overprice, low standards place.   Save your money, go eat somewhere else.  UPDATE:  The bartender Justin downstairs was very nice about the Old Fashion and asked for feedback. He surprised us all when he came back with a much improved version after Googling the recipe. Great Job Justin!! Thanks for getting our drinks right!!"

We came to this restaurant with expectations that it would be as good or better and were very disappointed. The service was slow and the food was mediocre. For $50 plates that don't come with sides, I feel like I should be impressed. My sea bass was cooked nicely, but lacking any flavor. The Brussels spouts that accompanied it were burnt. My husband's chicken was overcooked. We will stick with the food truck next time as their tacos are $4.50 each and AMAZING!"

So, I sent it back for the third time and came out medium well though I wanted it well done. Also, the sides we ordered were cold and they took it back to the kitchen and re-heated it up. Who does that? Ive been to many steak houses and this is the first place that's done that. Not happy with the food and service here."

                "description": "We stayed at Lost Pines this weekend and had reservations for dinner at Stories Fine Dining at 8:15pm which we had tried to move up a little earlier but were told that they were fully booked. We walked over a little earlier just to stay nearby and checked in with the hostess. She was very nice and even walked over to us and said our table was ready so we were able to be seated at 8pm. Upon walking in, only half of the restaurant had guests seated. The other half of the tables were empty...but we couldn't move up our reservation? Ok. We were seated and greeted shortly by our server who was very friendly as well. She took our drink and appetizer order which came out promptly however my husband ordered a bottle of wine and somehow that took about 15 minutes to arrive as well. We were seated next to a table of 4 who was very \"vocal\" which kind of ruined the atmosphere (this isn't the restaurant's fault however it did affect our experience) so I will refer to the as the \"vocals\". Finally, we were able to order our entrees. Once ordered, our bread basket came out at the same time as our appetizer and the food runners were pretty attentive and quick as well with refilling water, asking if we'd like more bread, etc. We nibbled on our appetizers and got lost in conversation until we realized our food had not arrived yet. Checked the time, 9:15pm. \"Vocal\" table next to us had already complained loudly about the A/C in the restaurant and at this point had started to complain about the service and why their food had not come out yet either. (Let me just also emphasize that when I say \"vocal\", I mean obnoxiously loud enough that the guests from across the restaurant turned their heads in attention). They complained about the service to the manager on duty as well who was apologetic and served them with comp'd cocktails and who knows what else. Needless to say, their entrees quickly came out. Meanwhile at our table, our bread plates had been stacked up, empty bread baskets were on the table and still no entrees. Time check: 9:30pm. At this point, the kids are getting restless and still have not eaten and no one had checked on us in over 30 minutes so we asked if they could at least check on the kids' food. They said they would and disappeared once again. Servers continue to walk by without having cleared our table and running food to other tables. One of the guys from the \"vocals\" has now stood up and beckoned the manager one more time to announce that his food was cooked incorrectly. One more time check for kicks: 9:50pm. Still no updates from the staff on the hold up. We have been seated for almost 2 hours with no entrées. At this point,  with strong understanding and empathy for the staff who has had to deal with the drama at the table next door, we quietly called over the manager and server to ask if we can just cancel our food. The kids needed to be fed, my in-laws were exhausted and we were all losing our appetite with the lack of service. The manager apologized for the delay and asked if he could pack up our food for us and we kindly declined and said we would just pay for what we actually ate/drank. He turned to the server and said, \"Take their card.\" Then walked away. That was the last we heard from his that evening. With heads down in disappointment, we quietly packed up our troops just in time for the \"vocals\" to turn their heads and complain about something new.   We walked down to McDade's where we knew food was ready to serve and we could quickly buy something for the kids. I'm baffled by the experience we had at Stories considering it's supposed to be a Fine Dining experience and hope that this evening was addressed within their staff as a learning experience to find some improvement in service and management."

                "description": "Reading some of the reviews, I honestly think management took the critiques to heart and did some great changes.  I've eaten at some nice restaurants (see other reviews) so I know what good service and food is.  From the lobster bisque and wagu steak to the dessert, it was fantastic.  Great drinks and service was great!    And equally nice, the place is too pricey for families with screaming kids to dine at, usually, so it's a GREAT respite from the zoo this place turns in to in the summer.  Not a bad thing (all the families), but a break from the noise is a nice change.  Would be really nice if it was cooler to sit on the outside deck.  Will try that out when back here in the fall."

We arrived 15 minutes early and were spoken to so rudely.  There was even a comment made about closed toe shoes.  WTH.  This is a vacation resort.  They obviously were trying to pass off the restaurant as some over the top fancy place and treated us like barefoot peasants.  This should never happen in the service industry at an upscale resort."

                "description": "I'm shocked this place has such a high star rating. I've been coming to Lost Pines for years and finally decided to try the Fine Dining restaurant since our kiddo is a teenager, but we quickly wished we had eaten at Shellers. The atmosphere is generic hotel/airport restaurant blandness. We ordered drinks which took a good 20 minutes. After we ordered entrees they brought bread and the chef sent out an amuse bouche which turned out to be the best of our choices. Our food took another 45 minutes which was so long considering we had an 8pm reservation. My son ordered the buffalo steak which came out cold. He had eaten several bites when I tried it and was surprised at the temperature. Yikes! Cold steak is not good. I ordered the risotto and I saw it had vegetables but it was literally dripping with vegetables and beets on top which made it a red color after a few bites. Not sure who thought that was a good idea. Risotto should be light and fluffy and not soggy. My husband had a salad and the lobster bisque but the bisque had a weird scorched flavor and he didn't eat that either. We were just ready to go by then because it was so late and I was still hungry. The waiter was nice enough but didn't even acknowledge the fact that we didn't eat our food. I cannot recommend this restaurant except if you're just trying to escape the loud atmosphere at Shellers or Firewheel. But for the price I'd rather eat at Shellers and keep an extra $100 for myself. Hyatt could do much better!"

Staff was wonderful and amazingly attentive. More about them later...  Drink and wine menu was not necessarily large but plenty of good choices at all price ranges. Staff very knowledgable as well.  Menu is limited but more than enough choices for every taste. I much prefer this than those over the top menus that offer everything under the sun.   Deconstructed Cesar salad was very good and light, great start. Chef sent over and delightful Amuse that was very tasty as well. Breads were great.   For proteins both my wife and I went for fish, Scottish salmon and poached halibut. Excellent on both counts, moist and tender, seasoned great. Blue corn grits was VERY tasty.   Desserts were spot on as well.   Back to the staff now...they could not have done a better job.  The attention to their customers throughout the restaurant was fun to watch. Always there when needed, and always with a smile. I wish more high end restaurants would follow this model."

There's at least one steak, seafood, lamb and chicken dish available every night.  Not only are the dishes beautiful and delicious, you will also get full.  I must also mention, I thoroughly enjoyed their gellato.  The staff is knowledgeable and bring plenty of hospitality.  $25-$40 per person is reasonable for what you get here."

The waiter never said anything but a gnocchi was delivered to our table at 45 minutes with a \"sorry\" but neither of us like cream based dishes so I would have preferred they ask us if there was something we wanted while we waited and it would have been nice to receive it at minute 25, not minute 45. My boyfriend's steak was definitely medium rare when he asked for medium but we didn't send it back as we were worried it would take another hour. $16 for 3 shrimp in a shrimp cocktail!  The dessert menu is laughable with 3 items. So a 2 1/2 hour dinner that should have taken 1 1/2 and a $220 bill. I'm giving it a 2 as the hamachi appetizer was wonderful and my filet (although significantly late) was delicious."

From my experience, those with fancy good reputations are usually the miss, while those that are unassuming and quaint are hit.   Stories at Hyatt Lost Pines resort is hit. From the decor, to the menu, to the presentation, everything here is top notch.  The chef has many creative options on the menu, but the veal chop was my choice. Perfect.  We also ordered red velvet cake that was imprisoned behind a ghastly cage of chocolate. Also, perfect.

I highly recommend this place for a special occasion diner and since it is located in a 5 star resort plan on spending the night..  The ambiance is very elegant with a vaulted ceiling and wood tables  spaced far apart for privacy.  The servers were always there but not not close enough to eavesdrop..  And the food oh the food is out of this world goodness.  We tried several dishes but my favorites were the Salmon with Horseradish crust, Truffled mashed Potatoes and my glass of Frogs Leap Merlot.  Guys if you want to get lucky on the first date I highly recommend this place -  restaurant + beds = great fun!"

For Chapter 3, we shared the Bread Pudding.  Awesome.  I talked to the owner and the head chef for a little bit.  It's a nice cozy place and they take an interest on how everything is.  The menu changes from time to time, so even though I'd tell everyone to get the duck or the lamb, it may not be on the menu for you when you go.  This place is in the Lost Pines resort.  Another wonderful place, but that's another review.  This place is a keeper and I will remember it to go back to.  Just to be warned, it's not cheap, but like all good things..."

The building was nice, but wasn't what I was expecting.   The vibe here is great. A lot of young professionals clearly \"working from home\" but needed to get out of the house for a few hours. Very friendly customers and staff.   I ordered a vanilla latte and it came out wonderful. They had an awesome selection of beers on tap if that's your thing.   If I am in the area I will definitely be back for a visit."

                "description": "Not a fan of leaving a bad review for a nice place, but I think I may have been served slightly off dairy milk here today (I'm not sick, but the taste was bad). I've been here a few times over the past years and it's a really cute, quiet spot for working. Today however I was served a matcha latte with a really funky taste to it. It seemed like the matcha powder used just sat in a thick later on top of the (1%) milk, without being well combined, and the milk tasted a little off to be honest. I regret not saying something but I think I attributed the taste to the matcha mixing issue at the time. The person I went with had a coffee which tasted fine, but used a different (dairy) milk from mine. Really a shame since my drink was so bad from the first sip, we just ended up leaving. Sorry stouthaus!"

I was pleasantly surprised when I was able to order right away! I got an iced cinnamon sugar latte with almond milk which came out to about $6.25. The price is a little steep, but the flavor and milk substitute added about $2.   The coffee came out relatively fast and was pretty good! The cinnamon was subtle, but the coffee was smooth and rich. My fiancé and I both enjoyed it! I don't know if I would come out of my way for this coffee, but if I was in the area I would definitely stop by again!   The location is convenient and there are other businesses on the same strip to try out as well. I would recommend coming here and getting some coffee to go!"

Cappuccino was good but little thin, coffee was pretty good, cinnamon roll was just ok.  Overall, definitely worth a visit and really appreciate the way they're handling the business in pandemic!"

It's pretty small inside, so if it's cold outside I wouldn't plan on finding a seat, but their patio is a nice addition with a beer garden feel. It is right off the highway though so don't go expecting a nice view of trees, but with the right company I don't think that really matters.  When I went the coffee didn't blow my mind, and they also didn't have any brewed at 1pm on a Thursday which was kind of strange to me for a coffeehouse so I had to wait. But that did mean it was fresh which is always nice.   They have fake outlets (they're stickers) which is kind of funny I guess but wasn't funny to me when I found a seat and my laptop died... they also have real ones though so don't worry.   All in all a cute little place and worth checking out if you're in the mood for a new local coffee shop. Or a low key place for a beer."

They have a dedicated parking lot that makes visiting it so much easier and less stressful than many of the other coffee shops in the area. It has a decent number of plugs and space to get work done as well as a covered outdoor area. The one thing I don't like is that their chairs are not very comfortable when you're sitting in them for several hours getting work done. Even so, I think this is one of the best coffee shops in Austin!"

The tasting reservation process was pretty easy. The tasting price is very fair (5 glasses for $18) and the pours were generous. The wines were very good. I left with a couple of bottles.

I'm sure you'll love a bottle to buy and you'll have ample time and space to enjoy it on their deck or yard after your tasting. Our tasting guide, Robert, was very knowledgeable about the different wines and a joy to converse with! They do have a good truck on their premises that bakes wood fire pizzas. I didn't try any this time because we already had brunch before coming. The port was my favorite wine. You've got to try it for yourself!"

                "description": "A year later and Wimberly Valley Winery is just getting better!  Our friends are members here and we joined them to go out and pick up their wine. While we were there we had a tasting.  They now have a full line up of \"fruit\" wines like Blackberry, Cherry and cinnamon, honey crisp apple, and others. They are on the sweeter side but for me were seriously tasty! I loved the cherry and the blackberry.  However at this time of year it is the mulled wine that truly wins the day for me! If you haven't had mulled wine I suggest you get off your butt, drive the distance, and sample some right now! It is so worth it!  A hearty and loud Ooooh my Goddie toooo Hottie to this wonderful glass of spiced wine that is served hot! It brings flashes of warm fire places, deep snow, thick sweaters and holiday cheer with every sip. It is my absolute favorite!  They are adding more structures to the location, the outside area is a divine place to grab a bottle and just sit and soak up the outdoors while enjoying a good sip with friends, and the inside is a great lush environment of comfy lodge like decor.  It is a great location with good people and a great selection of wines... not only theirs but a plethora of other wines as well. We always enjoy our time here!   One last note.... try the mulled wine! It is the holiday season in a bottle!"

                "description": "This place was definitely a one and done. There wasn't anything bad about our visit but there wasn't anything great about it either. They don't even use Texas grapes so these are all from out of state and only a handful are barrel aged. They were basic and not anything special. We came for a tasting so we tried a total of 5 different wines each (10 between the two of us.) They even serve store bought wines here!!! I've NEVER been to a winery that serves what I can buy myself at HEB. They didn't tell you anything about the wines other than \"this is dry and fruit forward,\" no explanation of the grapes used, how long its aged, etc that we've become used to at other wineries. Also the alcohol content must be very low in thier wines, we went on empty stomachs and neither of us felt a thing which is not the case at other wineries we've been to. I'd give it a try if you're in the area, but don't expect much. The grounds are nice and they have a cute double decker bus they converted but for us one visit was plenty."

                "description": "Honestly, I'm disappointed in the experience of this place. We saw the reviews of this winery and thought it would be a fun part of our weekend trip, so my three friends and I came in for a wine tasting inside their bar and we were surprised about the snooty service and multiple issues we had. First off, when we were pointed to which bar we'd be tasting at, there was a dirty tissue on the ground that was at our station (which I had kicked away, not wanting to make a fuss out of it). It apparently wasn't cleaned yet before we arrived, so our sommelier wiped it down before placing the menus down. In addition, we were placed right by the exit/entrance door to their storage room where we constantly shuffled away to not block the staff coming in and out.   When she quickly put down some menus and expo markers and asked us to pick 5 wines to try and walked away, she didn't really care to pause and help us with decisions, so I stepped in to help my friends who were less knowledgeable about wines. Throughout our wine tasting process, our sommelier also made really strange comments to us, saying multiple times: \"This particular wine is really expensive, so that's why you only get a splash.\" Not sure why that was necessary to repeatedly state that? It wasn't encouraging us to purchase anything, especially when we weren't enjoying the particular tastes of our wine and she didn't bother helping us give recommendations, other than asking if we had any questions after we already picked our choices. When one of my friends asked about the bathrooms not working, she just curtly answered it was because the pressure gauge was off for the whole place due to the Wells. I understand that's not entirely in their control, but she did not have to respond in a rude way, and unfortunately my friends had to hold their bladders until we got back to our cabin bathroom.  Overall, I recommend people skip the wine tasting indoors and just go straight to the outdoor patios to check out the cute red bus that has the express wine bar service. The person in there seemed a lot nicer, and there were places we could've sat down and enjoyed the nice weather, instead of standing the whole time interacting with our rude sommelier indoors."

My niece and nephew love taking carrots for the horses and donkeys and kicking the soccer ball around. The venue is just beautiful and even when their are tons of people there it just doesn't feel crowded, the layout is perfect.    The wine is top notch. I  like sweeter wines so most on the menu suits me but they have some dry wine as well for folks who love a dry red or white.  Slushes in the summer, warm spiced wine in the winter, fruit wines in the fall ... this place has it figured out!  Grab a Cheese tray and hang out for an hour or stay all day!"

We have been here a few times and love their food.    My favorite so far is the brisket banh mi and their potato salad. The brisket is smoked perfectly and the bread texture compliments the heartiness of the brisket well.  I love the fresh veggies they put in this!  The potato salad is hands down the best potato salad I have ever had at a restaurant. You have got to try this!!  We have ordered a few drinks in the past - they have a great Happy Hour.  You cant miss it - follow your nose to North Lamar and treat yourself."

                "description": "Smokin Beauty takes the best of both worlds by combining traditional Viet style of cooking with American BBQ to give you a fusion you didn't know you needed... until now. You can find items such as the:  - Brisket Bánh Mì: I enjoy the twist of smokey, fatty flavors from the brisket as well as the creamy cilantro and soy sauce that it comes with. The fries are amazing, too! $13.95 (4.5/5)  - Leaning Tower of Texas: a brunch special that is a stack of 3 hash browns, brisket, jalapeño cheddar sausage, pork belly, sambal hollandaise (sambal is like chile peppers), and bánh mì veggies - this is a lot more filling than it looks, I definitely would suggest you share it. I thought it was pretty good. $23.75 (4/5)  - Pho Queso: you read that right, they take veggie pho broth and mix it in with melted cheese to give you a unique take on queso. The pro here is that it's vegetarian friendly, but the con is that the flavor is a bit faint and I wish they would use a beef pho base instead. It's still good however! $7 (3.5/5)  Overall, this is a great spot to visit if you're craving BBQ, but also want to try something different. They have an outdoor patio if you prefer to sit outside. They also have awesome customer service and the prices are good too. With that said, I give them a 4.25/5."

                "description": "This place was everything I had hoped it would be. Now I just wish there was another one in Houston!  This Texas Tower looks intimidating but just roll up your sleeves, topple that thing over, and dive right in. The jalapeño sausage has some sneaky heat. Perfectly crispy hashbrowns with beautifully salted pork belly. Loved every bite.  We also shared the pork belly and brisket banh mi's and smokin fries. Most banh mi places we are quick to grab the Sriracha and Maggie's Sauce but not this time. It didn't even cross my mind until days after.  The brisket has the most amazing flavor and so moist. Almost a shame to lose it into anything else. But a perfect addition to any menu item.  Such warm and friendly owners and staff.   Parking was easy on a Sunday afternoon.  CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK FOR MORE!!!"

                "description": "I really wanted this to be a revolutionary experience. The concept is so cool, but their menu is a little repetitive and the food was just good. Not saying that this wasn't an awesome meal, but I really wanted it to be something to write home about. And it just wasn't.   The banh mi sandwiches were very dry but the meat was insanely tender, though   lacking a lot of flavor. The cost is a little higher but the portion sizes are large and generous.   The real show stopper here though, is the bbq sauce. It's the right mix of Asian flavors and classic bbq sweetness.   It's worth the visit to see this take on two fairly different cuisines mashed together. But don't expect to be wowed away. It doesn't scream fusion to me, it just seems like they took some of the most popular parts of each cuisine and put them separately on the plate."

                "description": "Smokin Beauty is a fusion restaurant that combines Vietnamese and BBQ cuisine. They have lots of indoor and outdoor seating. They even have live music on some weeknights. You order at the bar counter and take your number to the table, and they bring out your food out to you. We sat outside, but the service was slightly lacking as we had go back into the restaurant for multiple items like silverware and napkins. The meat tasted good, I would favor the pork belly over the brisket- the bread was hard and crispy for banh mi. I definitely would view them more as a BBQ joint versus Vietnamese, although they do have some interesting drinks with Viet twists. Overall, a good place to go especially if looking for late night food. They have they own private parking lot as well."

Served on a crunchy, fresh baguette, the meats were perfectly smoked and flavorful, and the pickled vegetables were crisp and colorful. If you prefer a bit of added heat, ask for jalapeños and sriracha. I also tried the slaw which was fresh and bright with Asian flavors.  There is plenty of seating outside. The decor inside is plenty nice with dark wood decor. The restaurant sports a full bar. This is such a great little neighborhood spot."

There was no parking so had to park with my hazards on and had asked the bartender if she could bring it out to since I had my dog in my car, she said yes. I guess she forgot cause I walked in 20mins later to ask and it was there. Got home to eat my food and it was okay. Honestly tasted better the next day, but probably wouldn't go again with so many other options available."

Smokin Beauty is in the Vietnamese area of North Austin, and is a Vietnamese/BBQ hybrid.  They're a small place but have good outdoor seating and parking, and the weather this Friday night was perfect for eating and dancing.  The food: I ordered their brisket and pork belly salad with a creamy cilantro dressing.  The brisket had nice smoke and a good bark, and the pork belly was soft without being mushy or all fat, and really lightly flavored, showing off the meat.  Fresh, crisp veggies made it perfect  They also have Banh Mi on the menu, and a Viet BBQ plate with Texas BBQ and Viet vegetables."

I told her we always carry mail past the pits and always wanted to try it. I ordered the brisket banh mi with potato salad as well as an happy hour cocktail. My friend got a two meat plate with slaw and potato salad. The salad was incredible, we both agreed. He loved the pork belly so much!  For the price point, it was absolutely worth it! Discussing the passion Matt and Tao have for opening this business during a pandemic is inspiring nonetheless. Stop on by!"

                "description": "Delicious joint serving a unique combo of Vietnamese and traditional BBQ. I loved my experience here, the food was absolutely delicious and lots of interesting drinks to choose from as well. It's also not often you see a bbq place serve brunch on the weekends as well, I will definitely be back to try that.   Some must tries are definitely the brisket and the sausage. The brisket was incredibly fatty and tender with tons of smoky flavor. I loved the sausage as well, the bites of melted cheese in the middle were to die for.   The bahn mi sandwich was pretty good too, the fatty pork belly goes super well with pickled veggies and cilantro. The sides were great as well, I would recommend the slaw for sure.   If you're looking for some drinks I would recommend one of the mimosa carafes. $20 and you get a full bottle of champagne mixed in. We got the guava one but I would love to try lychee next time.   I definitely think bbq and Vietnamese are a match made in heaven and would highly recommend everyone try Smokin Beauty!"

                "description": "Smokin Beauty perfects Vietnamese flavor meets Texas bbq fusion food! I loved the concept from the start and my belly was happy with the results. My boyfriend and I shared the brisket banh mi with slaw as a side, as well as the Viet king meat plate with potato salad and fries. Also ordered the Vietnamese coffee at the end.   Definitely recommend the banh mi - the bread used has the perfect texture - soft and bursting with flavor on the inside and crusty bite on the outside. The brisket was yummy and the pork belly was absolutely unctuous! Def getting the pork belly banh mi next time. Although neither of us are usually huge sausage fans at bbq spots, this sausage was amazing. So flavorful and stood its ground against the brisket and pork belly!  Sides - all were awesome accompaniments. The fries were nice and crispy, the slaw was a refreshing reprieve from the rich meat, and the potato salad had a delicious Asian twist to it.  If I had to provide any feedback, I will note that there was a frozen fry in the mix of the other fries and was quite jarring to bite into lol. But it happens. Also thought the Vietnamese coffee was pretty pricey at $7 even though the rest of the meal was fairly priced.  Overall, I would recommend this spot and will be back!"

                "description": "We came here on their pop-up mini mart fundraiser for AMA and APA in March 2021. We were very excited to support a local vietnamese startup! All of their vendors were very sweet and they took pre-orders. Next time I go, I need to pre-order  everything was all gone by the time we got there. It starts at 12 and we got there at 130. If you want good parking, get there early!! I suggest taking a smaller car if you're a bad parker. Their parking lot situation is a nightmare for a horrible driver like me.   We ordered the Thai tea boba, Spinach dip, brisket banh mi, king burger, and double cheese brisket burger.   Boba: I know this isn't a boba shop, but I was quite disappointed in the size of the drink. It was basically half the size of a normal sweet tea drink. The drink was fresh. It was hot when it got to me. I had to stir it to make it cold. I usually get it served already mixed and cold. Their tapioca was cooked so well. Usually some places have dry and crunchy boba. Not here! Their boba is well cooked and is very gooey.  Spinach dip and fries: wowza! That tasted fresh. We looked at the spinach while eating and not all of the leaves were fully wilted. That's how you know that they didn't use frozen spinach! You can taste the spinach and the fries are very flavorful. I love the way that they seasoned everything. I might be completely wrong though   The food was amazing in general, but to call it fusion was a bit conflicting for us. We looked at the brisket banh mi and the coleslaw to need a little bit more tweaking. The coleslaw was quite runny and very liquidy. The banh mi needs more veggies. We weren't quite sure if it had the pate. If it did, it was easily overpowered by the brisket. We personally felt that it needed more vietnamese oomph. The french bread was on point though  We prefer the soft bread over the crunch. Other than the fusion part, that dish was DELICIOUS.   The other two meals were amazing. We loved everything about them. Burgers were cooked well and the buns were sooooo soft!   We are a vietnamese family and we love Smokin Beauty! We think you did a great job with the restaurant and are extremely excited about your future. We're definitely coming back in the future and becoming regulars. My brother has asked for us to come here on birthdays and introducing our parents to this place!"

                "description": "Vietnamese BBQ? Sure, why not? I liked the idea - pickled vegetables, baguettes and smoky meat is hard not to like. Definitely feels fushiony as there's the drink menu but also boba and vietnamese coffee, side dishes that champion more so counterparts to texas bbq. It's a unique cultural mishmash that you just need to try for yourself.  I got a viet style king plate to split and overall it's pretty good. It's definitely a lot of food that I think can be pretty easily split between two people. Brisket, hefty chunks of pork belly and a whole cheddar sausage, baguette chunks and two sides. I would recommend getting an extra side of baguette if you're splitting because you are a bit bread light otherwise. Overall, while each meat was good and smoky, they were all a tad bit on the dry side today. Of the three, I think the pork belly was the best. The sausage has some kick but not that much, with a thoroughly emulsified texture. The brisket has the bark and smoke ring but even the moist was a little dry by the time we got it. Maybe just an off night but it's not disappointing with the sauce.  The sides I think are the best part - the creamed spinach is on point and the fries are crisp, with some extra crunch factor that I love and is great textural contrast to all the tender meat and the spinach. The sauces (jalepeno ranch and bbq sauce) are good too."

                "description": "If you are looking for a Blood Bros equivalent and find yourself in Austin, you need to stop by and see Smokin Beauty. This is a marriage between Vietnamese and Texas BBQ that makes a lovely couple.  When we arrived we were really looking forward to trying the Banh Mi's, but after talking to the gal behind the counter we were definitely sold on getting the King plate. We reasoned it would be the same as getting a Banh mi, only it will be less bread yet virtually the same ingredients. That was fine with us since we were heading to a conference and didn't want to get weighed down. But this allowed us to get a real birds eye view of their style and taste, and also to sample all the meats- the brisket, cheese jalapeño sausage, and the pork belly. And oh my, when the King plate came out, we were quite impressed. The brisket is one of the moist and softest I've tasted. The pork belly was nicely charred,  yet amazingly soft and smoked so well. The jalapeño sausage was also good and had a great kick to it.   However the advantage of getting the king plate was the two sides, which included the smokin fries, where they put on generous helpings of brisket, cilantro, onion, and cheese. That was so incredibly good. Combine that with their bbq sauce and the creamy cilantro sauce, and both of these fuse together to really bring out the tastes or the meat. Would definitely recommend this place!"

                "description": "Smokin Beauty is a great example of combining two cuisines properly to make something fun and delicious.  We ordered pickup and the process was pretty smooth.  Online ordering is easy and you can see what orders are ahead of you and their status.  You tell them when you're at the restaurant, and they'll walk your order straight to your car.  Staff was great!  I ordered the King Banh Mi with a side of creamed spinach.  I also tried their Smokin Fries as well.  The meats are great, and while the King Banh Mi was a ton of meat, I felt that the sandwich it was a bit overloaded.  Eating it was messy and everything was falling apart.  Still would recommend it if you wanted to try all the meats at once.  Like most BBQ, the meats can get salty and heavy, but the sauces, carrots, and cucumbers offer a nice refreshing taste.  Between the meats, the brisket was my favorite.  It was very tender; the fibers easily separate as you pinch down on the meat.  It had a nice fattiness as well.  The Smokin fries come with the brisket, so I would definitely recommend those as well.  The fries didn't get soggy either, which was impressive.  The creamed spinach was also really good.  The spinach wasn't as pulverized as in normal creamed spinach, so you get a nice texture and slight bitterness from the leaves.  Would definitely get this again.  Smokin Beauty's menu has a wide variety of items, so can stop by a lot of times and still try new things.  Can't wait to be back."

                "description": "I rarely give 5 stars but this place deserves it!  It's a little bit out of the way up north but the food was definitely worth the drive.  There's an outdoor patio area with a smoker as well as an indoor area that's designed like a bar.  This place is self service so once you ordered your food, you'll need to get water and clean up after yourself.  Since it was my first time here, I got both the bellies and waffles for brunch as well as a brisket banh mi to save for dinner later.  The waffles is more like a funnel cake style dough and I love it!  My friend got the brisket hash and honestly, I wished I had gotten the brisket hash cause it was amazing!  The brisket banh mi was the best banh mi I've ever had.  I don't like traditional banh mi sandwiches cause they're normally cold and I don't like cold sandwiches.  The banh mis here are made with warm meat and toasted.  Even after I microwaved it later it still tasted amazing.  I can't wait to come back again and get another banh mi to go!"

We had their in-house beers, the lager and pilsner, both good, the other is a dunkel which we didn't get to since they serve the beers in a 32 oz mug, for $11, great deal.  We had the currywurst, antelope, and duck sausages, the currywurt came on fries instead of a bun and was my favorite but the duck was soooo good, sweet and juicy.  We'll definitely come back, the atmosphere is friendly and the beer is tasty. Next time I'll try a schnitzel!"

The prince may also not understand the going rate for schnapps these days. I was interested to see what $8 of schnapps gets you. The answer is a single shot of schnapps. I'm from NYC, so I hate when people complain about prices - but that one really cut me deep.   I'd recommend kokos maybe if you're with work colleagues in a large group and just kind of need a place to sit, and at some point may get a beer."

                "description": "Yikes, this place is not ready for primetime.  Went with a pretty big group of about 20 people. We were all paying for our own food and drinks, which should be a pretty normal thing, but it absolutely wasn't. But I'll get to that.  I arrived late and our server was very quick to learn my name and take my order, so props to him. He helped me pick a beer to order and it came out pretty quickly. Unfortunately, someone else brought the beer and was going around the other end of the table asking who had this beer. When he got to me, I told him I didn't know if it was even my beer because the server picked for me. Not a great start.  I was hungry but thought $9 was pretty ridiculous for a braut. But my friend was enjoying his and he had it within minutes of ordering, so I said what the hell, I'll try it. 20-30 minutes later it still hadn't arrived, so I told the server to cancel the order and just close me out. Then it got worse.  \"What did you have?\" I don't know man, just the one beer you picked. He told me he had no idea how to split tabs which is just insane for this sort of a place. After a few minutes of him staring at his POS, I told him I'll just figure out who's paying and I'll Venmo then. Then I watched each person from our party ask the same question as they wanted to close out.  I also watched various staff come out with different food and drink items and constantly not know who was supposed to be receiving it. And not just within our large group... sometimes they brought food to our table that was for a different table. Just complete confusion on where things go. You know, what should be very basic for food service before you open.  I know it's a new place, and I did enjoy the vibe, but geez it was way too stressful to deal with everything that I won't be going back unless I hear they've properly trained their staff."

                "description": "I can absolutely see this restaurant being a hit for people who live downtown. The beer brewed in-house is priced fairly and tastes delicious. The location itself is cute and Instagram-worthy. The fries were awesome. As a casual place to grab a quick beer, munch on some appetizers and taste some interesting sausages, and then move on to the next venue, I think Koko's works great. For yuppie trash from suburbia who want a filling meal (points at self), however, it's hard to justify the trip due to the small portions, high prices, and spotty service.  First off, I'm almost certain that my server was high. I personally have no objections to anyone doing what they need to in order to get through their day, but from completely forgetting our orders immediately after taking our orders, to sending our our apps, entrees, and desserts to the wrong table each time, his vibing unfortunately kinda killed ours.  And I'd probably excuse all that if the schnitzels and bee sting cakes slapped, but they were pretty unremarkable in all ways except price. $22 for a small-end-of-medium plain pork schnitzel and a small scoop of potato salad and $10 for a tiny slice of bee sting cake that just did not hit. I've had bee sting cake before, and this one was quite dry, had less cream in the middle, and had nearly no honey-nut topping on top. Not a great way to end the meal.  Some of my complaints will probably be resolved as the restaurant settles and finds its groove, but man I don't know about those prices. Maybe $22 for Jägerschnitzel with sauerkraut and käsespätzle, but not for plain schnitzel served at street food portions.  Again, I think Koko's fills a niche as a great place to grab a pint/liter of delicious German beer while snacking on fries and just vibe, but as a restaurant, I don't think it offers enough value to be worth it. Especially not if you're a German food fan who lives over 30 minutes away."

                "description": "We visited with a group of 4 adults and 3 hungry kids on a Saturday afternoon. Unfortunately you cannot order any food unless you have a table... and that is where is problem starts. We waited for 30 minutes for a table, but never received a notification even though there were 3 tables available (+ 6 tables marked as \"reserved\"). No other group waited to be seated (i.e. not crowded). One patron told us to just grab a table and not wait for a notification since \"This is the only way you will ever get a table\". When we tried that the waiter appeared to tell us that we could not do that but had to put ourselves on the waitlist (which we already did). When I asked him wether we would have had to make a reservation online ahead of time he told me that he doesn't want to talk to me. Really?!  We walked next door to Central Machine Works where they had plenty of space.  Look, I understand that the place just opened and might not run smoothly just yet. So I hope you make something out of this feedback:  (1) if your tables are freely accessible it does not make sense to have a waitlist since people can just skip the line. (2) If you do not have enough staff to service everyone close down some tables (3) Let people know what the wait time might be. (We we're told 15 minutes. After 30 minutes we were told it's another 30.) (4) If a customer asks a question at least try to answer.  Lastly: The House Lager tasted pretty decent and the food menu looks interesting. Wish we could have tried it. (Or that the kids could have had a pretzel while waiting.)"

We came at lunch and though I was initially hesitant to bring in kids, there ended up being plenty off other families in there. The menu was upscale American. Given it was lunch time, we went with hamburgers and sandwiches. The main dishes were all really good and a decent portion (not too big, not too small). The sides we got were a bit under seasoned though. Lastly, there should really be a hamburger on the kids menu.   Overall, really enjoyed this place.

Despite both being relatively small, there's plenty of seating.  Choose from high-tops to semi-circular booths to high-back swivel bar stools.  And they have an outdoor patio as well, but not much of a view.   The League is a great place to meet a friend for drinks, a casual date, weekend brunch, watch Sunday football, or to just to ride the bar solo.    Excellent food with new, weekly specials, including a burger-of-the-week. On Mondays they have 2-for-1 burgers for dine in - can't beat that!  They also have cocktail specials to go along with their food specials (in addition to their menu and drink standards).  I wish they had a bigger beer wall, but the selection is serviceable.   The League is one on my regular spots and I've yet to be disappointed with their food, drinks, or service."

Sometimes we eat here and sometimes not.   Upside; Bartenders are always friendly and welcoming, they have great happy hour prices on drinks and apps. Also weekly food specials.   Food can be hit or miss. Between the two of us we've had everything on the menu. Club sandwich is always as hit and so is the spinach artichoke dip. Burgers sometimes a bit dry. The salmon is usually perfectly cooked. Fish and chips over battered and greasy. Prime rib sandwich is hit or miss.  Burger of the week this visit was Frito Pie Burger. I had the garlic butter grouper, which was a huge portion, but lacked seasoning on both the fish and couscous. Garlic butter was on the side, but was just melted butter with a chopped garlic at the bottom. No other seasonings.   We will continue to come hang at the bar and eat here occasionally."

                "description": "5 stars for service and 2.75 stars for food. My 4 stars are on the generous side.  We dined here this afternoon. The server was very nice and took care of us. I'd give her service 5 stars.   For our food we ordered the chicken fried pork chop, the full rack of ribs, the southern burger, and the kids Mac and cheese.   Our little guy loved the Mac snd cheese. It was decent and definitely not out of a box. It didn't come with anything else but was only $5.   Hubby had the Southern burger with truffle fries ($2 up charge). The burger was solid. It could have been a slight bit juicer but it was a good burger. The \"truffle\" fries were not. The fries were limp and soggy and sprinkled with Parmesan but had no truffle flavor at all. Actually when you picked up a fry the cheese all fell off too. Pretty bad fries to be honest.   Older son ordered the baby back ribs and enjoyed them. They were your standard fair. Similar to what you'd find at Chili's but they cost $30 and come with a side of mashed potatoes.  I had the  chicken fried pork chop. It was very over cooked and dry and was topped with jalapeño gravy but there was no heat or jalapeño flavor at all. The gravy made the pork chop less dry though. I subbed Brussels sprouts instead of mashed potatoes ($2). They lacked seasoning or flavor. I like the taste of Brussels sprouts so I ate them but they had no other seasoning that I could detect.   The food was all fine. Not bad but at their prices I would definitely not run back."

I had the prime rib sandwich with truffle fries, and OMG! Every aspect of it was amazing and paired well together. I will say I was underwhelmed with the salmon deviled eggs... it just tasted like eating cold eggs with no signature flavor."

                "description": "The League is a cool watering hole and sporting some excellent food for the denizens of Avery Ranch.  Two for One burgers on Mondays is a great deal.  We usually pop in for a late lunch early HH and sit at the bar. Check out their small bites menu the meatloaf is pretty darn good. Fish n chips are AOK there are better fish n chips in the area but you can easily split this bountiful dish.   The League pours a good cocktail and their bloodies, according to Plus 1, are right up there with the best. There are rotating taps for you beer snobs (like me).  There is a patio off to the side and a good-sized dining room. It does get crowded hence our late lunch HH visits.  Pro tip during football season Friday nights are packed pre-game."

It all started with a very aggressive an unkempt server with a bad attitude. We ordered the burgers which came under cooked and had soggy buns on the bottom.   The server was very rude when we asked to have the burgers redone and later literally threw a to go  box at me !  The manager got involved and was very gracious to comp the meal ,but i will not go back again because of the bad experience with a terrible server!"

Right as we we're done eating, a truck pulled up behind the building visible from patio and there was a strong sewage smell, it must've been some kind of clean out. Horrible.

Service was good and the place was small but cozy and clean.   We ordered the fish n chips and a burger with onion rings. The burger was fine, very average and a little bland. The fries that came with the fish were also ok but a little cold. The onion rings and the fish is the part I wanted to love but didn't. Taste wise they were good. However, they had so much batter on them it made me feel sick after just a few bites. I know these were heavy items to order for lunch, but the ratio of batter was just too much."

Poppers weren't really cooked, maybe they were just uber cold because they sat out, see below.  Order was to be ready at 6:58 and brought to my truck. I though ok they are behind...at 7:10 I went in and saw it just sitting on a table next to the door.  No clue how long it was there. They said I could just grab it and go.  Disappointing Brussels spouts we're amazing, the only reason they get two stars.   The last visit they brought it to my truck but the food was mehhh."

                "description": "Wow. I wasn't expecting to love this place so much but it was a fantastic experience all around.  The outdoor gravel patio is like sitting in someone's backyard under huge oak trees. They have simple lanterns strung from the tree branches and umbrellas all around. I loved the ambiance.   We ordered the tasting menu and the wine flight. The wine pairings were one of the best I've ever had. I'm not a fan of white wine but the owner picked the best French wines that paired perfectly with each course.   The first course was a hamachi crudo- perfectly light with subtle flavor.  Second course was a green bean salad- this was my favorite of the night. The beans were lightly pickled then charred and served on a yogurt queso fresco sauce- HEAVENLY. I make a mean green bean but theirs was the best I've ever had.  Third course was shrimp and vegetables. This was my least favorite, and it was still amazing.  Fourth course was the char siu and watermelon. Perfectly cooked and the balance of flavors was delicious. I was so full at this point but I still soldiered on.  Last course was ice cream with almond crumble. I'm not a fan of ice cream but this was really good.  Our server Quentin made our experience an unforgettable one. We'll be back for sure."

                "description": "The tasting menu was really good-- a lovely birthday dinner evening in a beautiful space (located right by a creek, so lots of mosquitos unfortunately).   FOOD: Delicious and thoughtful menu. We did the tasting menu for a birthday, and it took about 2 hours (we're quick eaters, too). They asked very intentionally at the beginning if we had any allergies and dietary restrictions, which was really thoughtful. Slight side note that the plates and serving ware was quite cute, which is just an ancillary sort of plus.  SERVERS: Speedy and really quite nice. They had recommendations, provided bug spray, were knowledgeable about the beverages. No complaints.  AMBIENCE: Currently (Oct 2021) only outdoor seating. It was well-lit and covered overhead. Quite good dinner date spot.   BATHROOMS: Gender neutral bathrooms indoors. It's may be a 50-ft walk to the bathrooms? Two single-person bathrooms. Clean, stocked. No complaints.  PARKING: A few (Like 10ish?) parking spots in a lot, otherwise I think it's street parking."

                "description": "Lenoir is a cozy outdoor space with delicious food. We came in with 14 people and they accommodated us in the back. We arrived on time and got seated promptly. We had a 5 course meal and only one wasn't to my liking. The char shui was moist and flavored well. I was a little skeptical at first glance but it turned out delicious.   My only gripe was that dinner took 2.5 hours. It cut into our other plans that we had that night. So, if you have a big party, plan accordingly.   PS - Because it's near a creek, please careful of water bugs... As I was cutting the char shui, one crawled across my lap napkin. Imagine a screaming woman frantically waving her knife around as her first initial reaction. Yep, that was me. *Raise hand* I almost stabbed my friend while trying to get it off me."

Go for the HH for 1/2 bottle robes and great mixed drinks the watermelon chiller was pretty and refreshing.  We got the cab franc bottle and was light and paired well with our meals. - HH bread with pimiento was interesting  -HH shrimp boil was different with fresh shrimp and okra and corn and something crunchy on top  - lamb vindaloo was not spicy but tasty and oddly accompanied very well with the sliced watermelon  - mp bass with Goan crab curry was delightful and complex flavors to create a light main entree  Service was so friendly and just stellar and we enjoyed our culinary experience for 2 hours on a Thursday night and in no way felt rushed  Romantic and fun place to be.  Highly recommended!"

                "description": "The best meal we've had in Austin. We ordered the tasting menu ($58) and 2 bottles of wine.   The tasting menu kept us excited and pleased the whole way through. The opening items (an Amuse bouche of falafel-like crisps with a lovely sauce and a sashimi with a tangy sauce) were so good. Blew us away.   Personally, the third item, gnocchi, was not my favorite. It is made from corn flour, not potato, which is slightly off putting. My friend described it as enchilada in bite form. I liked the spinach.   The steak was amazing. I liked the texture and the taste. It had a lovely chimichurri like sauce with leeks. The cucumber salad bopped too.   Finally, the dessert -- light and pleasing. Highly recommend trying the tasting menu if you come."

                "description": "While visiting Austin, I chose Lenoir for a romantic vibe with a setting that felt uniquely \"Austin.\" We went with the chef's tasting menu and didn't look back. We received a selection of 5 dishes that we mostly would not have ordered on our own, and we loved each one. Each dish was full of pleasantly surprising flavors and they were all beautifully presented. The tasting menu also left us happily full without being overstuffed.   To go with our meal, we chose a bottle of wine from their ample selection. They also offer a few cocktails, beers, and some wine by the glass, but getting a bottle seems to be the way to go.    Our server, Dustin, was fantastic. He was very willing to hear any and all dietary restrictions or quirks, and was happy to work with the the couple that I mentioned. He was clearly passionate about everything on the menu and his excitement for what we chose showed. He even gave us great tips on places to check out in Austin later that night.   Dining at Lenoir was a highlight during the few days we spent in Austin, the food was phenomenal and the atmosphere was wonderful."

                "description": "Noticed they were doing their Chef's Tasting menu (five courses) for only $29 during January so booked a table the last weekend of the special.  The wine patio was a perfect happy hour spot pre-COVID, and so it's no shock that with a few finishing touches like a tent and heaters, it would make for a wonderful dinner experience, too.  Anthony was our server and he was so on top of it all night long. In addition to taking care of the dietary restrictions of some of the group, he also was very generous with the wine pours!  I can thankfully eat everything, but just want to give a hats off to the kitchen for accommodating the two gluten-free diners. They even made a special dessert for a friend that is allergic to eggs!  The menu was pretty stacked with seafood options which made it light but satisfying. I am not a huge oyster fan, but Sweet Home Alabama were theirs tasty! The tuna pappardelle was interesting...someone's hot take was that it reminded them of a more sophisticated tuna casserole. Impressive there was no dairy in the dish but it had a creamy, cheesy texture. My favorite was the seafood stew-esque dish with the delightful bread for dipping.   The $40 wine pairing was a steal! Not only were the pours accompanying each dish full (not a sissy tasting pour), but Anthony would just magically top off our glasses like a vino ninja, so I felt as if I had prob consumed an entire bottle by the end. And, definitely not mad at that!  While the half off special may not be a thing any longer, I still recommend visiting Lenoir for a nice dinner out, with all the precautions in place/being observed."

                "description": "Service: 5 Atmosphere: 4 Food: 3.5  Came for the January chef's tasting menu ($29) outside. Been wanting to try this place for some time so there were definitely some expectations after having seen and heard about it. Overall it was a good experience, but the food was not as great as expected.   Started with an oyster on the half shell - how can you go wrong with that? They did it perfectly.   Next up was a winter salad, which had beets, roasted butternut squash, some tomatoes, and beer infused peanuts; the peanuts were delicious, and the squash was nice; I didn't care too much for the texture but the flavor overall was decent and fresh.   A cooked \"salad\" was next with roasted broccoli, mushrooms, walnuts, and grapefruit, with melted taleggio cheese on the bottom. Interesting mix of flavors and textures, saltiness of the cheese and bitterness of the grapefruit were different, but the broccoli were very large pieces. Nice to try but probably not something I'd eat often.   The main dish was a baked fish with shrimp, arugula, and sliced radish in a tomato soup. TBH it was kind of underwhelming for the main dish and a bit too bitter and salty for my taste. The shrimp and fish were nicely cooked but not my favorite on flavor.   For dessert was a coconut cake, and a rice pudding. I didn't try the cake, and I know that rice pudding should be al dente, but this was a bit undercooked. It was nice of them to whip it up since I couldn't have the cake due to gluten, but it just wasn't that great unfortunately."

                "description": "This is a nice place with date vibes. The food was great , me and my partner decided to do chefs menu, pescatarian version. Started with hush puppies, strawberry aguachile, avocado tostada, large crab stuffed fish and citron cake.   One thing I'm confused about still is if we got one order of each or was it two servings as everything came in 1 plate for 2 people to share.   We additionally had Pullman bread and peach, strawberry cocktails. Everything was great.   Advice: ask if you opt for chef menu do you get 1 or 2 serving of the item when 2 people are eating. I believe we got only 1 per item to share in which case you are better off ordering from menu yourself rather than chefs choice."

I realize they can't remove patrons! But, we didn't have to wait that long and they seated us in a little area while we waited and gave us a pitcher of water (and two glasses!).  We opted for the the chef's menu and wine pairing. We really, really enjoyed it. the ambiance was specular, outside under the Live Oak trees and lanterns. The servers were excellent. We will be back to try other items on the menu. Honestly, we felt like we were on vacation."

They are offering 50% off their chef's tasting which is a 5 course tasting. They serve things family style and had an upgrade to a fish dish for an additional $25. Overall the dishes were good, though the beginning dishes were a little spicy and acidic. I very much enjoyed the whole fish that they mostly deboned. Dessert was a flan and churro-esque cookie that was a light way to end the meal.   During COVID it felt safe dining as it was outside and it was well spaced. They do have a covered area which unfortunately we didn't get to sit under. There was some light rain during the meal which they provided umbrellas for, but awkwardly we had to hold it up ourselves. Most tables had an umbrella but ours didn't."

Lots of shade and misting fans to keep down the heat and umbrellas also. Lights strung up to really make the ambiance perfect for dining.  The service was top notch. Thank you Clinton for anticipating our every need and knowing and recommending perfect wine pairings also. You and your team are on top of everything and it's greatly appreciated, especially because you have a friendly and respectful attitude. No snobs here.  Finally, the food was outstanding!!!! Way to go chef. Farm fresh and full of flavor in every bites. Our party of 4 tried 3 small, 3 large plates and 2 desserts and there wasn't a morsel left of any of them. So much flavor!!!  The wines were also outstanding. All natural and bursting with flavor that paired perfectly with every dish.  We will definitely be back and with friends!!"

The outdoor patio seating is spacious and comfortable, with fire pits at the ready should the temperature drop. The food - just outstanding!! The chef's tasting with wine pairing runs at $40 a person, a value I dare you to best. Service hit on all marks. Parking is a bit limited. I can't wait to come back."

                "description": "Looking for the most adorable friend/significant other date site in Austin? Look no further than Lenior! The food was amazing, service was excellent, and the atmosphere is so classy and Austin-y! My night started with the server asking about our drink choice (obviously) but I had never tried any of the wines on their list and requested a recommendation. She was so patient and kind when choosing our wines and allowed us to sample them before committing.   Here is my order (Chef's choice 5 course meal): - Nebbiolo - Choice of wine for the night. It was light, earthy, and perfectly paired with most of my dishes throughout the evening! - Amuse-Bouche - A delightfully light and airy fish with herbs and greens. Honestly, I wish I knew what exactly this was but due to the volume of the place and the masks, I could not always hear my waiter! - Roasted Butternut Squash and Beets - This salad was DELISH and made me feel so healthy to start off the meal! Typically I don't like peanuts on my dishes but these were so seamlessly worked into the meal that I didn't even notice! - Tuna casserole - Never would I ever have ordered this of my own volition but lets just say, trust this chef!! It was incredibly fresh pasta that was light and packed a flavor punch. Not your grandma's tuna casserole! - Braise lamb shank with chickpea stew - OH MY GOSH! This was absolutely delicious. The meat just fell off the bone and did not taste game-y at all! 10/10 recommend - Coffee Flan - Perfect ending to the perfect night.  TLDR; Find Lenior and give it a try! Take a date, a friend, or impress your parents with your swanky new find!"

                "description": "This January, I discovered the Wine Patio at Lenoir.  I had been to Lenoir in the past, but inside in a tiny little space.  When I was looking for a place to celebrate some family milestones, I found that Lenoir had outdoor dining.    Since I'm not willing to take my chances with indoor dining at this point, I'm much more willing to \"take my chances\" as to what the weather will be like for outdoor dining and make a reservation.  Also, with most restaurants doing take-out, I'm thinking, if the weather is bad for our reservation, we'll just get take out instead.    As it turned out, I've been able to dine out two lovely meals at Lenoir.  The first was a Sunday evening meal.  We ate early in the evening, and that was great, because we were able to find parking right there at Lenoir, and we had the place to ourselves at first.  We were seated under a tent with propane heaters all around.  The tent is open on two sides, so it's still getting plenty of air circulation even though we had a roof over our heads.  While Lenoir has adapted their dining format to include a la carte ordering, we chose to go with the traditional Lenoir chef's choice tasting menu.    Everything about that evening was magical.  Just going out to eat for a celebration was special.  Then the weather was just fine for dining outdoors, and the wine patio area of Lenoir is so beautiful and romantic.  The tent is decorated with beautiful hanging potted plants, and the uncovered area was dotted with fire pits and chimineas.  Our servers were knowledgeable, personable, and masked at all times.  The food was all delicious and it was a truly special evening.  Through Yelp, I heard that Lenoir is running a special $25 5-course evening dine-in meal through the end of January.  I was looking for a reservation, and could not find any available times that meshed with my schedule, but I saw they now had lunch!  We went for lunch on a foggy, misty day.  We were a little concerned that we would be crowded with too many people within the covered area, and once again, was prepared to get take-out instead of dining in if it looked crowded.  As it was, it must be a well-kept secret that Lenoir is open for lunch, because we had Lenoir to ourselves for most of our meal.  It was once again a super lovely experience.  My husband had a crab stuffed omelette, and I had a winter salad topped with roasted beets, butternut squash, and chicken and the most amazing combination of spices.  For dessert we split a piece of Meyer Lemon Cheese Cake. Everything was super delicious.   When we told our server how we found they had lunch when we were unsuccessful finding a dinner reservation in January, the server asked when we'd like to come to dinner and that he would talk to management about getting us in.  As we were leaving, we were told we have a reservation for early Friday evening.  I can't wait to be back.  Lenoir is a lovely place to safely dine outdoors on some of the freshest best food that Austin has to offer."

                "description": "Great happy hour deals on drinks and wine. The pinky tuscadero and first blush cocktails as well as the capri sunset mocktail were all refreshing on a hot day. Although it was very hot outside, they do have a big tent that covers the tables and they also have fans with misters as well as candles on each table followed by citronella candles placed just about everywhere which is a must because not only are there trees everywhere, but Lenoir backs up to a creek. The mosquitos are out for blood this year (no pun intended), but if you are hoping to escape them by dining indoors, then Lenoir is not for you until the end of September as the inside of the restaurant is completely gutted. I also stinks because on a rainy day, you are SOL; which happened to us so this was our second attempt to dine at Lenoir. However, please do not be discouraged as it is very nice dining outside and romantic if on a date. Just make sure you bring some type of bug spray. Overall, we were impressed and after starting with the pullman bread, we all decided on the tasting menu which is such a bargain, it really can't be beat.  We were impressed with all of the choices except the chicken liver, peach tostado. I love chicken liver, foie gras and pretty much any pate, but somehow the combination just did not go over well. The dorade with blue crab, pullman bread and hush puppies were my top favorite dishes. Vanessa D. was our waitress and she was lovely. I will definitely come back when they are back to indoor dining and the tasting menu has changed."

                "description": "Restaurant is very pretty and the outdoor area is charming. Service was ok, but not great. The choices on the menu were very limited and odd. We shared a few plates, but didn't really care for most of it. The shrimp dish was tasty, but small shareable and overly spicy. The noodle choice was horrible and I don't recommend. The salad was good, but difficult to share. I really wanted to like this place and looked forward to going, but left disappointed."

                "description": "This place blew me out of the water and I'm not just talking about their seafood! Came here for date night as we were looking for somewhere outside where we could enjoy the weather. Stopped in for their happy hour and enjoyed the sweet potato Pullman bread along with the smoked fish tartine. Both dishes were fantastic and paired well with first blush cocktail and blood orange ipa which were both on the happy hour menu. The star however was the whole roasted dorade entree dish we ordered. Not only was it super flavorful served in a delicious curry sauce but it was beautifully presented and most of the bones were picked out for full enjoyment. The ambiance really pulled the entire experience together for me as illuminating lights hung throughout the trees and the smell of fire burning in the air. Highly recommend this place if your looking for a special date night or Valentine's Day plans."

                "description": "My husband and I go here pretty often as it is super close to our place and we love their food! They have a great menu and our favorite thing is the fried pickles! They have rotating specials, soups and flatbreads. The servers and staff are all very friendly and hard workers. I also bring friends here and they have all loved it as well! They have great deals on their happy hour and a good variety of beers and wine that are not crazy overpriced. I have loved everything I have ordered and they have great portion sizes! We usually come for lunch or dinner, but we recently had brunch which was also fabulous. I had the chilaquiles and they were amazing! The portions are also super generous so I've left with leftovers multiple times. If you're a sports person, they have a ton of really nice TVs and always have games on. I am honestly so happy this place is close by and will continue giving them my business! I would also like to add that like many places these days, they have also experienced shortages with staff and when that happens, we have seen the managers out on the floor helping out and also working their butte off! This restaurant has amazing food, service and is such a great place to have a nice dinner, go hang with friends or just pop by for a drink! Thanks for rocking it Cover 2! Oh and the Round Rock location is also awesome as I went their with a group of work friends once they also had excellent service and the food was equally as delicious!!!"

                "description": "When Chief was here bar service was stellar. I have been coming here since it opened. Now bar service is lackadaisical, inattentive, distracted and sub standard.   I like this place. The food is good the beer selection is passable and I can watch any sporting event live or read a book or both. But these two are killing the place for me. Ordered a beer and sat for 20 minutes with no one asking me if I might like to order food. Had to literally flag someone down to order a meal. That is not how this business works.   Wearing a mask under your chin until you walk up to a customer is not how this works either. And the tall one did that all night long. Now looking for a different place to spend an evening eating a meal and enjoying a beer."

Person who had seated me brought me a drink then nothing. Though a minimum of 5 different servers were standing right next to my booth.  I understand a restaurant may be short staffed but limit your seating if you cannot handle it.  I've had the similar experience here multiple times.  Last time I patron any of the restaurants in this local chain.  And \"the remedy\" after speaking to a manager when I asked for the check for my half drank coke...oh no need to pay for the coke.

Apparently you get service that way.   Literally just walked in and got sat, was busy due to a UT game no problem. And then we just sit and wait and wait and wait. The supposed waiter for our area literally helped everyone around us and kept skipping us. Idk if it was because we didn't have UT gear on or I was basically the only black person there at the time but ppl that just walked in the door got greeted before we did.   We just got up and left. There's no way the dude in the area didn't know we had not been helped as he purposely kept ignoring the table and was serving EVERYONE around us.   Terrible service."

We fancied burgers and thought that a sports bar would serve delicious burgers! What a mistaken idea!! We started with a cup of onion soup: it was edible, not delicious, a little strong on the acid side, but ok. Then came the burgers: a 3mm leather sole burnt to death!! Awful! Horrible!! My husband had to leave the restaurant and was sick in the car park!! The fries were smothered in fat... yak! The waiter on the other hand was a sweetheart!! VERY professional! When I mentioned it wasn't good, he immediately offered to comp them, which he did! I am tempted to say that he had been through a similar situation before, maybe several times!!! He didn't hesitate and didn't offer an alternative: he KNEW the food was bad! Shame on management to allow this to happen! It's a Burger after all, and we are in Texas!! Land of Beef!!

                "description": "Cover 2 off research always hits the spot it's got the best shoe string fries I can't seem to find anywhere else in Austin . Even though they may just be French fries and not a main course there is something so satisfying about them . My favorite dish is the buffalo chicken sliders , I personally get the blue cheese on the side with ranch to dip . These are amazing and have the perfect thin not to thick cut of chicken that's battered nice and crispy but stays juicy tossed in tangy but not spicy buffalo sauce. The bread doesn't take over the sandwich so that's not all you get full on and is super soft . They also have a buffalo chicken salad that has a good amount of chicken if your not wanting a sandwich but need to cure that buffalo craving . I've only had the burgers other than that and they are equally delicious again especially with those shoe string fries that are always crispy .  This place is relaxed and a good place to have a beer while you cool off after a long day or just dining with the family.  The staff is pleasant and the deserts are huge . Well at least the brownie is . If you like bars and burgers are in the area and don't know what to eat stop in and try the buffalo sandwich it's my go to and recommendation for cover 2 . If not that than at least grab a beer and some shoe string fries and relax a minute ."

Today I stopped in for lunch and ordered the flat top cheeseburger that comes with Parmesan fries. Should have been a safe bet, right? It came out DRIPPING in grease that tasted truly awful. Even the fries, which are always good, no matter the location, were inedible, as they tasted like they were fried in oil that should have changed long ago. It pains me to leave food that I paid good money for, but that's just what I did after trying to force down a couple more bites I shouldn't have taken. I left 2/3 of the burger and most of the fries on the table. Considered complaining, and might have if the server had even asked how the food was, but she didn't ask, and she had to have noticed how little I had eaten. She just left the check by the barely eaten food.  I rarely send food back to the kitchen, and since this wasn't exactly fine dining, I let it go today. But tonight I'm regretting eating those two or three additional bites I shouldn't have taken. It truly wasn't fit for consumption."

Only ordered 2 appetizers and wait 35 mins for those.   Mention this to the server and she has a near come apart about being short staffed and it is what it is.     Very disappointing, until manager comes by.   Would give Miranda a raise.   Very nice and helpful."

                "description": "So today was my first day in Austin. I searched Yelp. I drove by a number of joints. I even walked through Whole Foods. Alas nothing struck my fancy. Heading back, I swung into Cover2. I'm glad I did.  The greeting, Silvana as server, and the whole support staff weekend terrific.  I started with a cup of French onion soup. It was just a tad too sweet for my taste. I'm also a purist in looking for a single crouton under the  hood (of cheese).   The fries and prime rib sandwich were a pleasant surprise. I will typically keg wrestle you to keep the horseradish sauce off the plate. The sauce here actually was mellowed very nicely and didn't fight the meat. The fries were great! Nothing more need be said.   This was a terrific first meal in a new town. This might become my extended kitchen it was that solid of aa performance!"

I try to give servers the benefit of the doubt cause maybe they're short staffed but after multiple issues with the same server and seeing tables sat after us putting their orders in and getting their food, I'm getting disappointed with the downhill service at Cover 2.   We received our drinks at 6:45 pm. Left money on the table for the drinks and left the establishment at 7:20 pm after our server ghosted us with empty drinks and no food order placed."

                "description": "I stopped by after reading a few Yelp reviews and what a great choice that was. I had the good fortune to sit at the bar and have Miranda take care of me. If I started a bar or a restaurant she would be my first hire (better give her a raise, Doug)!  She's friendly, professional and makes a great martini. The hospitality industry needs more Miranda's!    Now to the place itself. Cover 2 has a nice, open concept with the ubiquitous flat screens located around the bar and restaurant - it is a sports bar, after all.  The people working there are friendly and attentive while the noise level is energetic but not overly loud.    The food.  The Reuben was honestly just okay. The corned beef to Swiss cheese to kraut ratio is off (not enough kraut) and the bread was cooked to the point where it was as stiff as a board.  It tastes okay but the potential for a better sandwich is definitely there.  Ask for fries - they don't automatically come with it.   The fries were good and - just to see for myself - I ate half the Reuben and then ordered the wings.  The buffalo wings are tasty - not the best I've ever had but certainly worth sampling. Pair it with the 512 IPA and you have a winning combination.  Overall I would give Cover 2 a solid 8 on a 1-10 scale. The kitchen gets a 7, the bar an 8 and Miranda a 1o I think my math is right). If you're looking for a good sports bar that's not too sporty this is a solid choice."

No flavor in the boil and they gave some sauce on the side which was horrible."

I had the brunch burger and my hubby had the mango habanero wings, and we split the queso and chips. (And by the way, their queso was hella good, especially considering they aren't a Tex-mex restaurant!)"

Friends from north Austin would often ask when I was going to Vincent because they liked the curly fries. My friend with me yesterday, said the same thing, whaddup?  i know it's not earth shaking but it made Vincent stand out for me. BUMMER"

Wish something close had a late kitchen, but at this point I'd rather have Top Ramen than go here to get food after 10. Slow service and management that pretends to have people's best interests makes it a no. Food is good, but management that seems judgy makes it a no."

My first review came shortly after opening and we all know it takes time to get things in a good rhythm and sorted out, especially in the restaurant business.  The menu was a little odd to me when opening but has since won me over. They often have specials and have even opened up for lunch. Last weekend they had a crawfish boil at a very reasonable $7 lbs. The beer selection seems to be somewhat static, fortunately they have several to choose from, but it would be nice to have several rotating handles, given we are in one of the best craft beer markets around. I was a bit surprised to learn a local Pinthouse beer was $7. It's only a dollar more than at the brewery, but still, this isn't LA.  All and all, I like the direction this place is going, nice outdoor, dog friendly patio, food specials and hopefully some new local beers on my next visit."

Most places are these large indoor/outdoor spaces with music and food trucks. Or located downtown. Or you have to drive 30 plus minutes.  Vincent's Sports Pub is just down the road from home. It has plenty of TVs. I mean plenty. You can stand or sit anywhere in this pub and watch your game. AWESOME. A lot of thought was done here with the placement of TVs.  Service outstanding. A very friendly and nice Team. You like beer. You have choices. Lots of drafts and bottled beer choices. Great feel. Very welcoming pub. Plenty of tables. Great looking bar. Nice crowd. No jerks or muscle beer dudes. I judge a place if my wife would feel comfortable alone. Vincent's Sports Pub passes with high marks.  The food is very tasty. I had most of the apps and was very happy. Tasty. Great to share. Shrimp dish very good. Crispy. Wings have some pull and good. Nice pub menu. A scratch kitchen. I did not feel or taste it was a frozen product.  Vincent's Sports Pub will definitely be my go-to pub for drinks and sports on TV. It has a nice welcoming feel. Combination of design of the restaurant, the bar placement, the tables, food and most importantly the staff.  Plenty of parking. CC friendly. Union payment option."

                "description": "Love this place.  We were looking for a place to watch the UT game and have a bite to eat Saturday morning and stumbled into Billy's. Great beer selection included our current go-to Electric Jellyfish.   For food we started with the cheese curds. Incredibly crispy. I'd put theirs up against Any I've had in Wisconsin.  Finished up with a cheeseburger and fries. Both were Shockingly good. Not just good for a dive bar, flat out legit.   Can't wait to go back."

                "description": "Review for Billy's on Burnett  TLDR: a perfectly above average dive bar  For the food: I ordered Billy's \"The Shults\" burger. The wait time for the food was perfectly reasonable. The burger was well seasoned and well constructed. The only real complaint was the pickle on top was rather small and lackluster. The fries were fresh and crisp, and also well seasoned.   For the drinks: Billy's offers a more than ample beer menu with the common stock, as well as a decent selection of local breweries.   For the atmosphere: Billy's certainly fronts the image of a dive bar, and does so very well. Dimly lit, slightly crowded, and a prominent bar situated directly across the entrance all help establish the environment they want. The patio in the side is well shaded, and has much less road noise than I initially expected. The only complaint is the flies on the patio are out of control.   For the value: Given the location, I can't really blame Billy's for the prices. I feel like I payed a bit more than what I would have wanted for what I got, however, that feeling isn't uncommon in Austin in general, and especially Burnet.   Everything else: there's virtually no parking at Billy's, however there is some street parking within easy walking distance. And yet again, the flies on the patio are on another level."

They offer curbside delivery and walked my order out to me at my pickup time.  Once I got home I discovered they did everything I asked... Grilled onions-yes Lettuce, tomato, and Mayo on side-yes Burger cut in half-yes  The folks at Billy's pay attention to detail and have earned 5 stars and I will absolutely keep going back!

                "description": "Aaron Franklin has long touted Billy's on Burnet as a superior restaurant for the best in burgers, and once again, he is correct about food.  The folks at Billy's did confirm that the James Beard Award winner is a regular.  The menu's, order source and pickup is at the bar.  We were clearly the only \"non-regulars\" there that day.  But, we were warmly greeted and walked through the extensive menu of burgers, sandwiches, and yes, beer options.  We will definitely be backed to try many of the other options.  The prices were very reasonable as fries come with the burgers.  The burgers were delicious, juicy and HUGE.  The burgers are served open faced.  If you like to cut your sandwich in half, the basket makes this a bit difficult.  The only downside, I gained a pound.  There is plenty of parking, the inside is much larger than we expected, and yes, it is a classic dive."

                "description": "Billy likes Billy's on Burnet. It's a dark, divy beer bar with a solid food menu including many fried appetizers, from wings to okra, and myriad burger and sandwich options, even hot dogs and an entire column of veg-head choices. I myself enjoy the indulgence of a cobra burger w/fries and a fine Texas craft beer, of which there are many. The burgers are pretty darn good and the beer is cold, so what else do you need? Entertainment? Billy's has you covered with a pool table, darts, several TVs and some arcade games in the back. Other notes: there is a patio and a small parking lot, but there is street parking nearby."

                "description": "This is a good spot for trivia and food. Limited parking, so navigate yourself to Lynnwood to find a street spot. Service was really fast, even when all the trivia people arrived/ ordered all at once. If you are coming for trivia/ an event, you need to get there really early for a table. If you are coming to just hang out, double check that there is not trivia/ an event that day. A few folks walked in, saw all of the tables packed and left.   Food reviews!  -Veggie burger: solid patty, hefty amount of avocado. Not the most interesting veggie burger, but definitely solid.  -Turkey Rueben: yum, devoured quickly -Chili cheese fries: Also yum, also devoured quickly. An excellent topping to fry ratio.  -Roast beef sandwich: The person who ordered this said it was good, but wasn't going to order it again. Said it was a little too greasy/ soggy.  - Fries: They are really well seasoned but they are also really unevenly cooked. One fry is perfect, the next one seemed almost raw."

                "description": "Very disappointed by our experience for takeout tonight. My husband wanted a patty melt and I wanted a club sandwich. The online ordering and curbside pickup were easy and user friendly. The food, specifically my club was a big let down. I was expecting a traditional triple decker on toast style club. It was on a hoagie and even worse, there was a dark hair in the lettuce on my sandwich. Needless to say, lost my appetite after that, I tossed it. I added, in advance a 25% gratuity because that's how it works ordering curbside and during COVID19 I've been wanting to support local businesses and their staff. Won't be ordering takeout again."

                "description": "I went to Billy's for the first and last time on Sunday afternoon. They said they allowed dogs on their patio, so I figured I'd bring my well trained 3 year old pit/bulldog mix. Everything was great for 45 minutes. My dog met 3 other dogs and got some puppy rubs from about 5 patrons on the patio, and then everything changed in the blink of an eye.   An intoxicated man holding his toy dog stepped up onto the patio and immediately zoned in on mine. His dog growled at mine while my dog whined and wagged her tail because she just wanted to meet another dog. The intoxicated man sternly asked me if she was a rescue to which I replied \"no, I've had her since she was six weeks old.\" To which he replied \"Your dog is aggressive.\" I told him he was aggressive and he went all in and said \"if yOur dog touches my dog, I will slit it's throat.\" This quickly turned into a heated altercation where I knew something bad was going to happen if I stayed, so I removed myself from the situation.  I went into the bar to let them know that there was a disgruntled patron out on the patio that threatened to slit my dog's throat and the bartender asked who it was. I pointed him out through the window and she said \"Oh. He's a regular, that's so weird, he never acts like that.....\" and just shrugged.  As soon as I took one step out the door, this regular of yours, Stefan, got right back in my face, chest bumping  me, trying to rile me up by calling me insults and slurs. He went over the top and came out with the statement \"I can't wait for you to throw the first punch, so I can sue the shit out of you.\"  I'm a General Manager of another local restaurant and I understand the value of a regular customer, but sometimes if a regular oversteps their boundaries they need to be handled. Y'all are an establishment that's main priority is providing a safe environment for ALL of your customers, not just your regulars. Y'all could have prevented this whole situation from escalating and chose not to. I'm honestly more disappointed in your staff than I am with the situation with Stefan.  Out of my four years here, this was the worst Austin experience I've ever had. You guaranteed the fact that my friend and I will never return to be a potential regular for you because we shouldn't have to question our safety."

                "description": "I was very let down by my experience here. My friends raved how good this place was.   I walked up to the bar and explained it was my first time here and how did it work. The two people behind the bar, a heavily tattooed dude and a middle aged lady, were less than hospitable. I forget his exact words but something along the lines of what you see is what you get. I was waiting for my friend and just wanted to get a starter while I waited. I ordered the chili cheese fries. Lady says no, we don't have that bc of the water boil issue. I said ok. I asked if they just weren't doing appetizers. She said they were only doing fried things. (Correct me if I'm wrong but fries are fried, right?)  I said can I get queso and chips? - no.  Mmm ok can I get a blue moon- no.  I made a joke at this point bc it was awkward and like what the hell. I said I'm really striking out here. She said they had something similar and went to get it. Then this guy standing next to me orders chips and queso from the dude bartender. When the lady brought me my beer back I mentioned this and she freaked out on the dude bartender. I ruined the other guys opportunity to get queso and they made him order something else. Oops. Then I hesitantly asked if I could get frito pie. Finally I got a yes. But that yes makes no sense. I couldn't get chili cheese fries but I could get chili and cheese on Fritos? I walked away confused and put off.   My friend showed up and we decided to split a burger, we didn't even want to ask the employees what they recommended because of their foul, unhelpful, annoyed attitudes. Even my friend was like what the actual F. They were straight rude. We ordered a burger. The bun was soft and that's about it. Nothing special at all. Food was a 2, service was a 0 so as much as I hate to leave reviews like these, they get an overall 1.   Customer service, a smile, a friendly demeanor go a LONG way. Won't be giving this place a 2nd Chance."

What I do care about is The Uptown Burger.  Have you ever watched that one How I Met Your Mother episode where Marshall spends the whole episode looking for that one spot where he had the best burger of his life? Well, The Uptown Burger is that burger for me. LOL I came here on a whim just to meet up with my cousin and I was hungry so I ordered a burger at this lowkey spot not expecting much however, this burger blew my mind! I forgot what this place was called so I can have that burger again and just found it. I don't really love the other burgers here but I'm telling you, ORDER THE UPTOWN BURGER"

How bout two bucks off any Real Ale draft on Thursdays. Here take your 4 stars Billy. Minus one star for being a Green Bay Packer Bar (kidding).   Billy's is a chill neighborhood bar to grab a bite and have a beer or two. Their draft selection is awesome with all your favorites plus a few that will surprise you. Checkout their burger menu it's pretty extensive. I opted for a boring cheeseburger with fries. Burger was cooked perfectly and served on a bed of spiced up fries and it paired perfectly with my pint of Real Ale amber. Will definitely return but not on a Packer game day (Go Pats!)."

The raw oysters are always my favorite to snack on (tip: on Mondays, their gulf oysters are only $1). I've also tried their chowda fries which are delicious. It's everything you would expect with chowder but better because you also get fries (this dish itself can be heavy and filling). Definitely one to try if you're looking for something to warm your soul. Their lobster roll is good too. I love the lobster meat but I wish they served it as a warm, hot sandwich rather than the chilled one. Nonetheless, still delicious!   Now don't get me started on their dessert which is also worth noting here. All their desserts are made in-house but there is one that really hits the spot. This dessert has a warm chocolate brownie topped with a scoop of Vanilla ice cream and drizzled with caramel. If heaven was a dish, that would be it because it just transports you into another world. Worth saving some room in your stomach for!"

I had a half-dozen gulf oysters which were very small, and also had the shrimp and grits which was just over complicated. The shrimp was overcooked as you would expect someplace hundreds of miles from the coast where no one knows anything about seafood, and the dish was overall just rich and higher-flown than necessary.  D had something else for a main dish that neither of us even remembers, and she also had the mac and cheese which was tasty but also a little over-produced.  Neither of us would consider returning. Third star is because the service was good - Kevin was our server - otherwise, and this this is just OUR opinion as lifetime gulf coast residents, maybe two stars."

The shrimp were luscious and delicious and it was a huge portion. Service is always amazing and they've upgraded their HVAC system so I feel comfortable dining here."

                "description": "We found ourselves in Round Rock, TX on a recent Saturday, early evening, so we decided to stop by Salt Traders Costal Cooking on IH 35.  We found a couple of open seats at the bar.  Our first orders were a couple of craft cocktails, the Gin and Housemaid Tonic and The Rum Around.  Both were good, but upon reflection, for the price, regular cocktails would have sufficed.    We kind of went crazy on appetizers, having Gulf oysters, grilled oysters, crab fingers, and the crudo plate, which was yellowfin.  All of those dishes were \"off the chart\" crazy good, with the exception of the crudo ... the white sauce used was way too sweet for the awesome fish.    When we finally ended up at the main section of the menu, we ordered the fried oyster lettuce wraps and the simply grilled fish of the day, which was redfish.  The tartar sauce served with the lettuce wraps was delicious, but a bit too much was slathered on the wraps.  IMHO put a dash on the lettuce leaves and let the patron add as desired from the small cup of tartar sauce that comes with the dish.  The redfish was terrific, but no one knew why the place would have farm-raised redfish from the Indian Ocean when we have fresh redfish 200 miles away in the Gulf of Mexico?    Keeping it local, we ordered the Becker Vineyard Reserve Viognier, and it was delicious.  In closing, a special shout out to our waiter Nathan behind the bar, service was attentive but not intrusive, so nice to have a great waiter with a great attitude!"

                "description": "We've been a fan of Salt Trader's Costal Cooking in RR since their opening five years ago and not surprisingly we dine there 2-1 over Jack Allen's, our previous go-to place. We've never had a less than wonderful experience there with the diverse menu and bold bright flavors and textures of amazingly prepared seafood and American cuisine and wonderful drinks.  The newly transformed Flat Top Fish Tacos are unbelievably good as the two hearty tacos are prepared Birria style with caramelized cheese crust on the flour tortilla and with substantial amount of grilled black drum with a street corn filling along with the cup of aromatic tomato-shrimp soppin broth and tomatillo-lime rice with pickled chilis.   Other favorites include Grilled Oysters and Fried Oyster Lettuce Wraps for Starters and the  Fish Enchiladas and of course fresh Oysters and Daily Specials and Seasonal Deserts.  FLAT TOP FISH TACOS 17 crispy cheese flour tortilla, street corn,  tomatillo lime rice, pickled chilis,  charred tomato-shrimp soppin' broth"

Parking: there is a parking lot Reservations: im not sure if you can make reservations but I would suggest it. Although, the wait isn't too bad  Food: I got a very basic meal( lol), I got the the fried fish and shrimp and was not disappointed  Honorable mention: tried the New Orleans bbq shrimp and the pasta- i wasn't a huge fan- my taste buds said it was too salty foe me- but my friend enjoyed them  Drinks: i really wanted a spicy margarita and Hannah made sure that she got it to my liking, which I truly appreciated!"

                "description": "Salt Traders might be my favorite upscale casual restaurant in Round Rock. The vibe here is similar to Jack Allen's, but with a nautical twist. 100% the kind of place where you'll find at least one dude rocking salmon colored shorts and boat shoes. No shade, just facts.  I particularly love their happy hour. All the appetizers are hits (especially the chowder fries), and that $4 discount on apps is really nice. I may be wrong, but I think on either Monday or Tuesday, happy hour is basically all day. If you've never been and want to sample a bunch of things, definitely take advantage of this.  My favorite entree by far is the shrimp and grits. It comes with a savory sauce on top that really sets it apart from other places. The bowl is also huge, and so the price is more than justified. I'm particularly fond of the Bonnabel -- one of my favorite whiskey cocktails ever. Just sweet enough for a guy like me who can't drive a manual, but just whiskey forward enough that it doesn't look like I own a Fiat.   The place gets super busy at the usual dinner times and all times during the weekend. Be a pro and hit them up during slow hours for the best experience!"

North Round Rock really isn't the place you'd think of for high quality seafood and a great classy bar scene, but that's exactly what this place had.  My wife had the scallops and they were seared perfectly and tender in the middle. Couldn't ask for better.  I had a fish sandwich, but I'm picky so I did it without the slaw, which was a mistake because it needed the crunch and the sauce. I'm sure it would be a 10/10 with that.  Definitely go to this place. We were treated like gold and the food was excellent!"

                "description": "This is my second time here in the last couple years. I started with the gumbo. In my personal opinion it was under seasoned. Kind of bland. I then had the New Orleans Shrimp. Very nice. You can tell the shrimp are fresh. I then proceeded on to the Shrimp and Lobster roll. The roll was fantastic! Warm, fresh, toast yet pillowy on the inside. The Shrimp and Lobster salad was nice and cold. The shrimp burst with flavor and freshness.  My server, (Scott) was elusive to say the least. The other waiters attended to me a lot more than he did. I probably waited 8-10 minutes before he took my order. The restaraunt was probably at 30% capacity at most. I had multiple managers see me looking for my waiter and just walked on by.   Overall, the food is good and they can definitely improve on service. I understand being shorthanded, but some things are inexcusable."

                "description": "For my birthday, I chose to visit Salt Traders. We hadn't been there in a little while, and good seafood is always a treat.   My husband and I arrived in the early side, during happy hour (3:30-6:30 on a Thursday), so we could enjoy a leisurely meal. We started with drinks. I had the frozen grapefruit margarita, which tasted like a regular margarita. I loved that the salt on the glass also had citrus peel.  Our appetizer ($5 off during happy hour) was pot stickers. They were excellent, and the portion size (6) just right for sharing. The sauce was wonderful.   I ordered one of the day's specials for dinner, seared monkfish. It was served over fingerling potatoes and topped with a great salsa. The monkfish was tasty  but a bit on the chewy side... and the potatoes were barely undercooked. My husband had fish and chips, always a good choice at Salt Traders.  Dessert was vanilla creme brulee topped with peach sorbet. Excellent!   Service was excellent. We enjoyed Patrick's sense of humor and the stories he told.   We will be back again, without a doubt!"

Given that it's by the people behind Jack Allen's, Salt Trader typically gives you a small portion of their Salmon dip to welcome you.   This place is always packed, especially on Mondays when it's all day HH. If you plan on coming on Monday, definitely get a reservation or you might be waiting ~1 hour.   I've had a number of their appetizers and they're all super tasty. My favorite is definitely the fish collar. Nicely seasoned with Cajun spice and the perfect amount of crisp. You can't really go wrong with any of their entree either.   All in all, solid restaurant that I would go to again and again."

We enjoyed a variety of fresh oysters as an appetizer and then ordered a second round! Super selection so we had to try most all of them  Entrees included the fabulous monkfish special and my absolute favorite, the ciopino! I thought about the monkfish but just had to stay with my favorite, which was soooo yummy as always.  I have to give a shout out to our server, 'Hanna from Louisiana.' She was SUPER! Kept us entertained and was a great representative of the Jack Allen family-knowledgeable, super friendly and totally dedicated to delivering an exceptional guest experience. She is 5 stars for sure.  In summary, we just love love love Salt Traders!!"

We made our reservation a couple of days in advance and the only available time slots left were 4:30 and 8:30pm. We decided to do an early dinner and IT. WAS. SO. GOOD.   We got the 2 dozen chargrilled oysters, 2 dozen seasonal oysters, chowder fries. Presentation, portion, and service was great! Our waitress Hannah was attentive and very sweet! I'm not a huge oyster fan, but these were phenomenal! Between the four of us, we cleaned house and walked out with our appetites satisfied.

The manager Tyler is incompetent and does not care about the well being of his customers.   Never going back to this bar again and I suggest you don't either.   Been coming to this bar for years with no issues, ever and have spent SO much money here (I live on Rainey). The staff have always been great until...  Tonight I had a group of young girls create a conflict with my group of friends for no reason. They swarmed our table and harassed us - pulled my friends hair, STOLE MY FRIENDS PHONE and, on top of that, a man that was part of this group forcefully grabbed my arms. The bouncers did nothing to get our phone returned nor remove a girl who pulled my friends hair and was cursing me out and flipping me off. They made me sound crazy when I asked for help. My voice did not matter. I asked to see the cameras and conveniently there are no cameras located in the front (which is absurd given that this is where all the tables and chairs are). It is one thing that these mean girls tried to start conflict with me and my friends for no reason, but this man grabbed my wrists so hard that I could not move and I had to front kick him in the stomach to get away. This is not okay under any circumstance and the fact that the bouncer and manager turned a blind eye is disgusting.  I wish there were cameras because I would press charges. This is so incredibly degrading as a woman and I am still shook that appropriate action was not taken."

                "description": "Nice joint on Rainey which punches above its weight in terms of drinks and food. Rainey in general is a bit of a mixed bag but this place was surprisingly good.   They have a Cuban food focus and use an interesting ticket system with every drink you get that you can redeem for food (probably to ensure enough food sales to stay open during Covid). I had about 4 Painkillers, a properly dangerous pineapple/coconut/orange and rum drink that was delicious. Summery is the best way to describe a lot of their cocktails.   Had some of the best fried plantain chips I've ever had with guacamole and ceviche. My only complaint was I wish they had comfier seating for hanging out and it ended up shortening our time we spent there (lots of high chairs and hard back seats). They dont have a decent back deck like a lot of Rainey places do so the seating was mainly up front where speakers were blasting, including the neighboring businesses music. So it ended up being a little chaotic.   Either way its a nice spot. Service, drinks and food were great so I think we'll drop by again."

And as a bonus they have live music almost every night!!    My faves: The Painkiller - it goes down way too easy.  The Lover Boy - a killer chorizo-infused burger that will make your mouth water.   Lots of great staff and be sure to save room for the dessert! Tyler is an amazing baker who makes all the desserts for this place. The cheesecake was incredible!!   A few words about Covid restrictions - I've seen most of the bars on Rainey - almost none of them are following the protocols. I feel like this place is the exception. No lines or large groups gathering on top of each other inside. Outside seating spaced well. Staff all have on masks. That plus the food, drinks and service mean I'll be back many more times. The menu evolves some too, always like a place willing to add and try new things while keeping some of the faves on the menu.  Thank you Idle Hands - finally something good out of 2020!"

The food was pitiful. The black bean burger was an oversized sopping, crumbly mess with zero flavor and the fries were cold and uneventful. The ranch may as well been runny, salty mayo. My lady pal got the plantain chips with guacamole. They gave us tortilla chips with guacamole. My guy friend went in to ask for the plantain chips that they were supposed to come with. He took a photo with his phone of the chips and dip to show the bartender and he practically laughed in my buddies face and mocked his photo taking as a means to justify his request (he's in production and art, okay? Let the guy make art and an example of your crappy food).   The man brought us the plantain chips out a few moments later to go with the guacamole. Which was the worst guacamole I've had. Del Taco makes better guacamole. Salt? Lime? Heat? Maybe just try to make it flavorful...  Oh and the quinoa bowl-- that one veggie thing. What the heck even was that? It had no sauce; oil or spices to bind together what was basically a sad bowl of vegetables and bitter arugula.   Way off the mark with the food, guys. Good thing the music was kickin' and the mezcal ritas were nice n' zesty.   Get drinks and an earful or music and skip the food. All 3 of our dishes were very weak."

My roommate and I came from SF, CA, and on our second night we randomly stopped here because of the live music - who actually was a contestant on the voice!! WOW!!!! We ordered \"That One Healthy Thing\" and some very specific drinks made by Brennan. He is an amazing bartender! I hope if the owner sees this, he/she gives him a fat raise. Thanks Idle Hands for making our first trip to Austin above and beyond our wildest dreams!"

Someone at our table spilled a cocktail and they replaced it quickly and for free!  One cool thing about this bar is that they give you tickets every time you order a drink, and tickets add up to be free food items! Their fries and chips/queso were good. The cocktails were very strong too! Would definitely come here again!"

                "description": "I understand having hiccups in a new establishment, but I was really disappointed in some of the things they had more control over. - COVID protocols are unfortunately lacking. To order, you're required to download an app. Nobody at our table was able to access to menu from the app, and the staff seemed super unfamiliar with it, too. A couple of employees looked at the app on our phone for a couple seconds before they gave up and took our orders normally, negating \"contact-free\" ordering. - Our waitress routinely came within 6 inches of us, which is basically face-to-face when youre sitting at a high top. She would pull her mask down to speak and came over at least once with her mask on her chin. - The drinks were great!  - The live music was a nice touch and was a mental break from the whole looming pandemic thing. People were singing along to the acoustic guitar player and having fun.  - Due to COVID, each drink is required to also come with plantain chips, which was not communicated with us. We received our check and had 5 orders of plantain chips tracked on and were super confused. I understand the requirement, but a surprise $22 charge isn't cool. Additionally, they apparently ran out of chips, so we paid for 5 chips we never received.  - When we arrived, we explained that our friends were inside already at a table waiting for us. The ID taker had us wait outside for 5 minutes before allowing us in to meet them. He gave no explanation and I'm still not sure what we were waiting for."

The burger itself was overcooked and dry; I don't know if this is normal, if the kitchen was having a bad series, or if the customer can request medium-rare.  Something to consider for next time.  And there should be a next time too, because this is still a great deal: burger + side for under $10.  Sure, it'd be nice if cheese wasn't an upcharge, but that's really a minor quibble.  Inside, the décor is funky and vibey, much like the other restaurants and shops in this North Loop neighborhood.  What stands out most inside is the massive album art print from Stone Temple Pilots's Purple.  Thanks to this, I haven't been able to get \"Interstate Love Song\" out of my head for the past four days."

This is a great spot with an outdoor seating area in BOTH the front and the back (which I didn't know at first).  Their drinks are pre-California exodus cheap, so grab a beer or two or three. They also have grub. There's plenty of burgers to choose from, a coworker said their portobello burger is bomb. I got the burger special, which was arugula and blue cheese. My burger was slightly overcooked and a coworker's was well-done, so you'll have to be mindful of that; if you like yours med-rare or medium, I would call it out. I thought they were pretty generous with the blue cheese, but the burger itself could have been slightly larger; they're thick but relatively tiny. Buns are toasted. I think next time I'd go with one of the classic burgers since I felt the burger special was really heavy, the arugula doesn't bring enough balance for the funkiness of the blue cheese. The parmesian fries were alright, a tad too salty for me.  The guys behind the bar were nice, a bee got stuck in my bottle and they kindly replaced it.  PARKING: there's a few spots out front, but there's plenty of parking around the corner in the residential area.  Come for the drinks, stay for vibes."

I guess they don't care about this pandemic at all.  I watched the cook scratch his head, grab his phone and text then started to assemble a burger without a care in the world or concern for cleanliness.  So if I were you I would eat before I go to this establishment."

Definitely recommend those.  We came midday, and I'd have preferred there be a few more non-alcoholic beverages. It seemed there were usually quite a few choices, but they were out of most things. Not sure why.  We'd come again."

                "description": "We visited this place last week and are so sad that it hasn't been our go-to all along. It's located in such a chill part of Austin, so it's perfect when you feel like going out, but not going out (if you know what I mean)! They have a ton of beers on tap and handful of yummy sounding cocktails. We didn't eat here, but when we saw their blue cheese bacon burger with huge azzz onion rings on the side we were wishing we did! It was totally embarrassing, but my husband accidentally spilled his first beer on the bar and the bar tender did a great job at not acting completely annoyed at him, although he was. He even poured him another which we were not expecting at all, so that added to our great experience here! Highly recommend, but only if you're not a high-maintenance little princess because it definitely has some grunginess to it ;)"

The beers are awesome and there's a big selection.  It is pretty hot here here though, especially outside during the summer.

So it goes in the 4 stars dive bars!  Note: They have an outdoor patio in the back."

                "description": "I have been to the Workhorse Bar three times before yesterday, and those experiences were all 3-4 stars.  But this most recent visit was teetering on between 2-3 stars.    I ordered the White Manhattan, which has always been awesome!  This visit it tasted like they poured me a glass of watered down Moonshine and added a twist of Orange.  I ordered a second one just to make sure it was just not a bad pour.  Nope the second one was as bad as the first. The odd thing is they bartender who made them both, was the same bartender who has made them for me on my prior visits.     We were also quite bothered by the loud group behind us slamming their cards on the table as they played some unknown card game.  They were overly loud and obnoxious.  We were not the only customers who were annoyed.  The other pet peeve I have is when large groups of people stand at the front door of an entrance to smoke cigarettes.  On this visit there was always a group of 3-7 people puffing away well within 15 feet of the front door.  People...please go smoke out back on the patio.  The upside of this visit was the music from the jukebox.  For $2 we were able to select 8 tunes.  Music selection is random, but good."

                "description": "Workhorse is the perfect little neighborhood bar. It has a fairly large and very affordable selection of drinks, an all-around-the-clock \"happy hour\", great bar food and a nice staff! They also have a jukebox (select 4 songs for a dollar) and a patio in the back.   In the food department, they've got a good selection of sides and appetizers, as well as burgers, salads and fries. Vegetarians will be pleased to find out they have several veggie options, including two types of veggie burgers and many sides. The food is cheap and tasty. I don't know about you, but for me that's getting pretty close to my definition of heaven!   If you want available seating space for the duration of your stay, I recommend visiting between Monday and Thursday. Friday and weekends are very popular nights and you might not be able to find a cozy spot to sit, although that goes for most bars.  If you pass by the North Loop strip one evening, you should definitely drop by and have a taste of Workhorse."

It is very well managed--huge shout to the Manager Stefan who guided us through the menu and went above and beyond to make our experience a special one.  Their tasting menu is so good and well curated - every plate was perfection and no detail was overlooked.  The tasting menu comprised of the following:  Appetizers:  2 year aged country ham on mini pancakes (yes mini pancakes), Deviled Egg, Tamale and Spicy Beef. The Tamale is like no tamale I've ever had!  Main Course: tostada crudo, black cod, muscovy duck, Dry aged Akaushi ribeye/donut. Everything was delicious but the ribeye/donut is out of this world! Probably one of the best plates I've ever had.   Desert: Caramelized fennel ice cream/caraway/ orange and Butternut cake/curry spice.   Not only is the food outstanding, the ambiance was very thoughtfully curated (lighting, sound and architecture).  We are lucky to have such an incredible restaurant in Austin."

                "description": "Currently my favorite restaurant in Austin, Barley Swine offers a tasting menu that beautifully combines Texas flavors with upscale plating and technique. If you want to impress an out-of-towner with a nice meal while also showing giving them an accurate and varied taste of Texas, this is the place.  There are so many dishes with lots of components, and so it's difficult to break down every dish (particularly because the menu changes often enough that any specifics will likely be obsolete by the time you end up eating here), but I can say that in the multiple times I've been here, I've had some iteration of a tamale in the small bites, a fish course, a duck course, and Akaushi steak for the final savory course. Some tasting menus have highs and lows, but Barley Swine's seems to get gradually better with every course.   If you can afford to do so, I highly recommend adding their shiitake dumplings with soft scrambled eggs. It sounds like a strange combination, but it's a shockingly good umami bomb that should be experienced at least once. While the menu changes throughout this year, this dish has become something of a signature for them, and once you try it, you'll know why.  The service here is extremely unpretentious considering the caliber of food they're serving. Servers don't even have set uniforms. Everyone just looks and acts like Austin foodies who are happy talk about and share food with you, and I love that.   If you're as comfortable having wine as you are sipping on cocktails, then the choice between the wine pairing or having their house cocktails is an extremely difficult choice. Both options are awesome, but unless you're looking to get messy drunk in an upscale restaurant, one option precludes the others. Gun to my head, I'd probably opt for the wine pairing, if only because it potentially gives you access to 20+ year old bottles that you'd have a hard time finding. But I'll be damned if their \"Follow the Leader\" (a corn infused mezcal cocktail) isn't one of the most intriguing drinks I've had in this city.  While the snobs at Michelin don't think Austin is worth considering, I wholly believe that Barley Swine is as good as a lauded place like Gramercy Tavern in NYC, and it easily beats the shit out of some of the formerly Michelin starred restaurants in Las Vegas (stares shadily at Picasso). The atmosphere is inviting; the food is exciting; and the flavors are quintessentially Texan."

                "description": "Best restaurant in Austin.  They serve a seasonal tasting menu and have wine pairings available. Compared to other big cities, the tasting menu here is very reasonably priced, but completely delivers on experience and flavor. The wine pairings are on point as well and fully worth adding on.  Reservations well in advance are highly recommended as this place books up. They do have some self-parking both in front of and behind the restaurant, but offer valet as well. The atmosphere is fairly casual, so no need for ultra dressy attire.  The food is thoughtful, creative, and most importantly, absolutely delicious. On top of that, the staff are all extremely knowledgeable, attentive, and friendly.  We've dined here a few times now and have been blown away each time. Can't wait to come back!"

They were incredible and the bonus was getting a view of the amazing kitchen and the crew! This experience was truly remarkable and the price points were perfect! They were warm, welcoming and listened to my likes and dislikes and accommodated accordingly. Barley swine would certainly be one of the key reasons why I would move here. The food was exquisite; an experience worth having at least once a month. Enjoy!"

I'll start with the service, which is top-notch. When we arrived, we were warmly welcomed by the crew and shown to our bar seats. I wanted to sit there because you get to see into the kitchen. It was really fun being able to watch the chefs in action. Our servers were both very attentive and knowledgeable about the wine and food. You feel like it's all very personalized just for you which makes it feel all the more special.   As for the food, they're only serving the tasting menu right now, but that's definitely the way to go. It allowed us to try a bunch of different flavors, and it was nice not having to think about what to order. They start you off with four amuse-bouche dishes. My favorite was the (raw) spicy beef over a kerupuk style beef cracker. Then you get a crudo and fish course. The crudo was great but honestly the fish was over cooked. That said, their sauces are bomb so I still enjoyed it. Some of the other dishes that were particularly tasty was their beef and donut combo and the sorbet. The whole meal was nicely paced and flavors were complementary.   Definitely do yourself the favor and enjoy a meal here soon."

                "description": "On a recent trip to Austin, I tried this place based on recommendations from Austinites.   I strongly suggest you make a reservation. We arrived about 15 minutes late, called to let them know, but we were still unable to get the type of table we had originally requested. You should also know, when making reservations they request a $50 per person reservation fee that is later taken off your total bill. For two tasting menus, one wine pairing, and three cocktails, the bill was $500.  This establishment is known for seasonal tasting menus that are in constant flux. They had two (usually there were three but they had run out of one) additional dishes that could be ordered on top of the tasting menu; but to be honest, the richness of the plates was sufficient enough to curb your hunger and make you feel full. The dishes were very creative. My absolute favorite were the small bites. They consisted of pierogi, radish bagel, tamale, and spicy beef. The texture of the pierogi was perfect, and the flavor was perfectly pickled. The radish bagel was fresh, light, and crisp. The tamale was a perfect fusion of Japanese and Latin all in one little bite. I could have used way more than one! My least favorite dish was the halibut, but the wine pairing made it more palatable. The duck was perfectly cooked, but when they mentioned that it was cooked with a sous vide for 48 hours, then seared over the grill, it made much more sense of how perfect it was!! The ribeye was a over cooked, chew, and tough to break down for my taste. It was served more medium that medium rare. My absolute favorite dish of the night was the poblano Texas sheet cake!! It was served with a peach sorbet (if I remember correctly), topped with chamoy, and garnished with sunflower seeds!! This was such a creative dish! And again, I could have eaten three of these!!   Overall, this was a great experience. The servers were attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly. I was thoroughly impressed with creativity behind each dish. I also LOVED that the restaurant is ZeroFoodPrint and Carbon neutral. I highly recommend this restaurant!"

                "description": "Love love loved my experience at Barley Swine! Whenever my boyfriend and I visit a new city, we like to do at least 1 tasting menu and this one was great! In comparison to other big cities, this tasting menu is pretty affordable but still a great experience. The tasting comes with 10 courses with optional add-ons you can choose for about $10-$15 each. Including the add-on's we had a total of 12 dishes: 1. Shrimp Dumpling: Plated very nicely and also extremely flavorful. One of my favorites 2. Radish bagel: The concept of this dish is not very unique but it still tasted SO good, I loved it. Basically a bagel, cream cheese, and a pickled cucumber on top lol. 3. Smoked kohlrabi: small but tasty 4. Spicy beef: Beef tartare served on a rice cracker. Really unique flavors and textures. I didn't expect to like this one (not a huge fan of beef tartare) but this was great! 5. Crudo with Fruit Vinegar: Raw fish with smoked watermelon. The tastes in this dish were so unique and flavorful. I'd never imagine biting into a watermelon and getting that smoky flavor but it worked so well with the fish. 6. Halibut with Green Beans and Pecan: I must say this was my least favorite of the dishes but it was still not bad. The halibut just wasn't too flavorful 7. Muscovy Duck/Cured Leg: This course comes with 2 duck dishes. One is a plated piece of duck, the other is cured duck on a cracker. Both were so tasty! 8. Dry Aged Alaska Ribeye + Donut: This course also comes with 2 dishes. For one, a piece of ribeye which was small but so juicy. It also comes with a donut topped with some chopped pieces of beef which tasted great too! 9. Carrot rainbow sherbet: The first of 2 dessert courses, very unique and yummy 10. Chamomile buttermilk pie + Dewberry: I loved this dessert! Plated nicely and also so tasty Optional Add-Ons: 11. I HIGHLY recommend adding on the Shiitake Dumpling. This was recommended by our waitress as it's one of their classic dishes and I'm so glad we listened to her. I don't want to spoil anything for you because this dish has a nice surprise. Just trust me and get it ;) 12. Dry Aged Akaushi Beef Rib: This dish was tasty as well but nothing too special or fancy. I was already full with the initial 10 + Shiitake Dumpling Add-On so this wasn't necessary for us. If you're super hungry then maybe add it on.  For cocktails, we ordered the Peach Whiskey Smash, Acapulco Gold, and Barrel White Aged Negroni - all great!  In terms of ambiance and service, I'd also give 5 stars. The kitchen is open so you can see all the fun going on behind the scenes. We had several waiters serving each course, giving a great description of each, and answering any questions we had. Halfway through our meal, apparently there was some difficulty with the customers sitting next to us - which we honestly did not notice - but because of this, one of the waitresses gave us a free wine pairing with the halibut dish. I greatly appreciated that they went out of their way to make sure we were having a good experience.  Will definitely come back next time we're in Austin! 10/10"

                "description": "First time trying this restaurant. My family and I went for a special occasion and had the chefs tasting menu.  The decor was great and inviting, they have a theme of pickling everything so a lot of jars around, it looks cool with the lighting.   Staff was very cheerful and pleasure to be around, they were still following Covid distance protocols regardless of the full capacity mandate now. My family and I truly appreciated that.   The tasting menu was delicious, I'd highly recommend if your want to try and not of everything on the menu, the donuts and the braised ribs were by far the star dishes. I would highly recommend this establishment.   Enjoy!"

                "description": "Had our first experience at Barley Swine and thought it was one of the best meals I've had.  The tasting menu, all pre-defined, was varied and 9/10 with the exception of some pancetta that was tough and chewy. The snapper and crudo were fantastic, as was the duck and steak.   The setting is in a nice strip center where they've walled off the parking lot to create a little patio.  It would have been perfect it a tiny bit more secluded from Burnet or with some greenery.  My only reason for not 5* is that I guess I'm still a little surprised with how $$$$ the meal was relative to others I've had.  This smashed our \"record\" from Lenoir, Uchi, and Juniper, even with equivalent wine pairings.   It was a terrific meal, but not sure I see us going back but every other year at $160+ pp and rising."

Plus, the ambience and service at the restaurant are top-notch. My wife and I even had our first \"nice date\" here, and it's still one of our favorite places in town. We recently tried their takeout dinner package and were again impressed by the quality of the food. The beef short ribs were beautifully cooked, and the sweet potato and slaw sides complemented nicely. For dessert, we had rum spiced pudding and pecan chocolate brittle cookies. Dangerously good! The meal had a comforting and familiar feel to it but with the class and quality that I've come to expect at Barley Swine. Can't wait for this pandemic to be over, so I can try their tasting menu!"

We did the tasting menu and they were extremely considerate about our allergies/food preferences.   Every dish was unique and delicious. My favorites were the dry aged ribeye served with a scrumptious donut and meat skewer that was DIVINE, the apple semifreddo (ridiculously creamy), and the crudo. But honestly there was not a dish that we did not enjoy.   We even made a super weird request to switch out a pink knife for a blue knife and they were very supportive.   Highly recommend."

Tasting menu is all interesting (that man Bryce is some funky genius) and delightful.   If you do the wine pairing be prepared to get a lot of knowledge about natural, small production wines that are v cool and make you want to throw your Bota box away. If you are trying to have an intense conversation about your affair or break up with your baby mama or whatever do not do it here because it is a very interactive experience."

                "description": "Short hit: MUST TRY!!!!  To date, this his the highest five stars I've ever given. Without question, the best meal I've ever had, and second place isn't even close. The place is so good, that for anyone that gives it less than 5 stars, I begin to seriously question whether or not their review are trustworthy... yeah, it's that good.  Ambiance: Very unassuming. Walking up, I thought the place was quaint, but I had no idea that this place was serving up the best dishes I would taste. This is fine dining for sure, but not in a stuffy kind of way. No white gloves, no classical music, no bougieness. True to Austin, the place is casual, yet refined.   Staff: Very informative and hospitable. Everyone I encountered was super friendly and knowledgeable. Every time a new dish was brought out, we received a thorough explanation from out waitress. The information was very detailed, which I appreciated. You can tell the establishment spends a lot of time training their staff, so my kudos to the place.   FOOD: my goodness, the number of flavors I experienced is phenomenal. If I may be obtuse, I must admit, I had about seven foodgasms. There is no set menu (changes each month), so I won't go into great detail on the dishes, but the flavors were just so complementary. Speaking of complementary, I highly recommend doing the beverage pairing. At $55, it's not too easy on the wallet, but I can honestly say it is money well spent. Eaching pairing was perfect and enhanced the flavors of each dish. Side note: since I was driving, I wanted to experience the pairing, but didn't want to have my own, so I informed our waitress that my girlfriend and I would be sharing a paring. She advised that instead of sharing the 3 oz pour, for $75, we could receive 2 oz each, and honestly I thought that was the perfect amount. I was able to fully appreciate the pairing without feeling irresponsible for driving home.   Price: this place should probably be reserved for special occasions only as it's definitely pricey, but I always said I don't mind spending a few extra dollars on food, as long as I feel that it's justified. In this case of Barley Swine, I am pleased to report that the food and dining experience is well worth the price."

The menu included:  Cured Antelope with turnip and koji yogurt Spicy Tuna with kale and daikon Carrot mouse with beets and sunchoke chip Snapper with spicy greens and radish Grilled oyster with hot sauce jus, kohlrabi, and coppa Muscovy duck with sweet potato, bok choy, fried bun Aged Akaushi ribeye with broocoli, marrow salsa macha Fennel sorbet with gin and orange Sweet potato cake with pecan, coffee, cardamom  I would absolutely do it again (perhaps with slightly less aggressive pregaming lol)."

The entire bar is outdoors but the bar area itself is relatively covered in case it begins to rain. It's also a rooftop setting which gives it an awesome ambiance and makes you want to stick around for a while.  Our bartender (I believe his name was Brandon) was super nice and chatted with us. They have a giant Operation game that actually works, as well as giant Connect 4 and giant Jenga. A few TVs are behind the bar showing sports. They have an old cigarette machine once you reach the top of the stairs and I'm pretty sure it still works.   The entrance is on the sketchy side especially when you're 4 females walking in around midnight on a Wednesday. The sign outside on ground level is tiny and only says Shiner. Inside the door is an ATM machine. Then it's a loft-style staircase all the way up to the roof/bar. Once you climb the stairs it's like Disney World. I definitely would have spent another evening here if we were in Austin longer."

My bandmates and I played a SXSW show here on 3/16/19. When loading in, the entrance was unstaffed and we simply loaded our gear up the stairs. No problem.  Loading out was entirely different. As I'm coming down the stairs, clearly loading out with gear in hand, I witness a door person yelling at my bandmate \"Get the f*** out! Get the f*** out!\" and aggressively walking towards him. His tirade did not end there. Keep in mind, it's obvious that we're loading out as we're leaving the establish with guitars, amps and various other gear. And we're doing so directly in front of the door person. He knows very well who we are.  As I'm walking back in, the bar manager is coming down and I calmly tell him that the door person is being needlessly aggressive. Instead of attempting to de-escalate the situation, he begins arguing with us, claiming that we hadn't been ID'd. First, they weren't ID'ing at 4:30 when we arrived. Second, even if you believe him, there's no excuse to respond by yelling, screaming, cursing and intimidation.  What he failed to realize is that under no circumstance is it necessary or appropriate to react in that way. Period.   This place, at least on this occasion, is staffed and managed by people that can only be described as unprofessional and unhinged, and in absence of even the smallest amount of self discipline, potentially dangerous.  There are better places to see shows. There are better places to get a drink. There are better humans at virtually any other establishment.  Don't waste your money here."

The good: a friendly enough bartender that served us $1 whiskey and soda's. I mean come on, that's a great deal. But I was left really disappointed with the brisket nachos. This is a BBQ town right, so where was the brisket? I could barely find it in my plate of chips and cheese. It was good enough for bar food, but I really expected better. Then again, they did have free live music. This place is smack dab inbetween a 3* and 4* review, but the subpar nachos sways me today to give them a 3*."

They were out of sliders and pepperoni rolls. The tacos were OK but not great.  Beer selection was good.   We came for the atmosphere and were underwhelmed.   Win or lose a Steelers bar should be rocking.   Cheers for the turnovers, but no encouragement or even yelling at the TVs."

The brussels spouts were tasty too.  My friend had the pastrami sandwich and she kept raving about it; the pastrami was high quality.    | Cocktails |  Again, a big win.  They were doing a bartender drink contest with several whiskey cocktails and I went for the Peach Tree.  Although petite it packs in taste and was not light on the whiskey!  | Atmosphere |  The patio is typical strip mall-ish.  It's nice that it is dog friendly."

                "description": "Service here was good and loved the bar area. Brunch cocktail selection was above average. The Vietnamese espresso drink and Bloody Mary were great.   Food is what knocks this down a bit. I got the biscuits and gravy which was wayyyy to much biscuit for the amount of gravy given. Getting the chicken added is a must.   The carnitas poutine was super salty. I get that both things are meant to be like that, but this was just too much. I wish there was more pickled onions and jalapeños to balance it out.   The happy hour menu and times looked pretty good, so I'd definitely return to try that out."

                "description": "First, this place is perfectly nice and probably worth going to again if I am back in the area but would easily be convinced to try something else.  My evening began with the Ancho Margarita.   Unlike some places this chili inspired drink isn't like drinking hot pepper juice and is delicious.    The fried cheese curds with ranch dressing were tasty but nothing particularly gourmet as a novice home cook could prepare this with the same results.     The disappointment came with the main meal.  The French fries were cold.   From our vantage point we could watch the kitchen workers.  They kept a big bowl of French fries that the kitchen leader would use to place portions on out going plates.   They rarely sitting it under a heat lamp, so they were cold and unmemorable.   This is probably the easiest and cheapest thing on the menu to prepare well.  The rest of the meal was perfectly ok, but noting that stuck out as particularly special.    The ambiance is nice, but extremely loud when there's a full house so you have to raise your voice to be heard across the table."

We had a little difficulty finding good selections on the menu. Citrus pancakes sounded good, but they were out of them. The Bacon Beignets were the highlight, warm, freshly made and tasty. Reuben was good, with nicely salted corned beef and delicious German slaw. Pimento burger was too rich for my taste. Service was good. Overall experience was good. Would be 5 stars, but menu was not great for us. If you find things you like on the menu, then you should try it out."

                "description": "The meal was much more attractive than it was delicious. Everything was fresh but lacked flair in the flavor department. This is the kind of place I would come to for dinner but I wouldn't bring anyone here to impress them or to treat them. I only say that because the impression of this place I got from the ambiance and the menu was that I would be in for a stellar meal. I ordered the Brie Burger believing the brie and the flavor profile would offer pizzaz but I was not razzle dazzled. It was just the feel of eating a better than average burger.  The carnitas poutine got me a little eager to taste more flavors as I had that to start.  It could have rivaled a couple of poutine offerings that I've had in Montréal aka the poutine capital of the world (sorry Quebec City).  I am happy that all the greens were fresh to round out the meals well.  I felt like portions and servings were well balanced.  If I lived in the area, I'd dine here again."

We were in no hurry so we had another beer and looked over the menu.  It was obvious that Oast was short staffed and everyone was doing double duty. Thank the pandemic!  Nevertheless, tHe staff was very friendly and the service was adequate.  However our burgers were not very hot and my pretzel bun was stale. The fries were very good. In better times, this will probably be a very nice dinner option."

However, it's laid back, chill atmosphere, and modern feel makes it a great spot for almost any occasion.  The food was pretty good. I did get something i could make at home. However everything was cooked nicely apart from the bacon. It was a little bit too charred for my taste. Potatoes were tasty, eggs standard, and the rye bread tasted more like a sour dough. But still good.   Mimosas were a good deal as well!   Overall we had a great time and most likely will return again!"

We came here because we found some good reviews on Yelp, but have to say I was a bit apprehensive about how long it's been since the last review posted for this place.   This restaurant seems to be a family go to place where people just eat and never care to leave a review.   This place a gem! We came in for an early dinner and were surprised by how good their food and drinks are.   I wasn't really found of the butternut squash soup but we were in the mood for trying so we did it.   I do recommend this place for anyone.  Specially if you are looking for food away from Downtown like us.   Enjoy!"

His service gets 5 stars (and we made sure his tip showed it). We started with the bacon beignets which were not really like beignets. They were crispy on the outside and more like cake donuts on the inside. Only got like two pieces of bacon in the whole serving.  The food came to the table very room temperature. My father had to send his biscuits and gravy back to reheat (no one wants congealed gravy). My mom and I got the boring breakfast plate. I asked for my eggs over medium and they definitely came fried hard. Also the house cured bacon was bland and extremely dry. My Aunt's chicken cacciatore pasta tasted good and we liked the strawberry pancake we ordered for the table a lot.  Overall, service was the highlight but the brunch options are not worth a second visit."

The chicken and waffles were really strong, and the chicken was almost like hot chicken which was a pleasant surprise and carried the dish but no complaints there. The carnitas poutine and the Cubano were certainly enjoyed as well"

                "description": "Oasthouse has been my periodic GrubHub treat when my standbys on another delivery service aren't available for several months. What more does one need in life when brie pimento burgers and coffee rubbed carrots with green peppercorn ranch are on the menu? I don't even mind that my average order for one meal is at least 35-40.00 with delivery. Sometimes it's just worth it for something so yummy.   I was excited tonight to share an Oasthouse experience with my daughter and was pretty disappointed at both a mediocre meal and pettiness on my bill. Even though I was happy to spend the 45.00 plus 20.00 delivery charges and tip to reward ourselves after a strenuous and stressful day of work, I felt shortchanged pretty quick when I couldn't even see the pimento on my burger, got an overly dry bun and was charged 2.00 after the fact for some perceived \"extra\" change to my order.   Whether this was an upcharge because they were out of mashed potatoes (usually substituted for fries since I'm gluten free) and gave me the more expensive brussels sprouts. Or maybe they changed me for the extra pimento I always ask for (#swoon) but didn't get. Since they didn't say what it was for I'm left wondering.   All in all, my highly anticipated Oasthouse indulgence fell kind of flat on a day when I really needed it. I guess nobody's perfect."

Cool atmosphere and decent prices for food and drinks. We ordered 2 carafes of mimosas for only $8 each, which I thought was a great deal. They bring out your champagne and orange juice in separate carafes so you can measure out how much you personally want of each, which I appreciated.   I was not blown away by the food, but everything we ordered was still solid. Two of us ordered the all day breakfast plate that came with eggs, uncured bacon, a slice of toast, and breakfast potatoes. Everything was good, simply nothing stood out. The other two people in our party enjoyed their eggs Benedict and strawberries field salad. Good service and she stayed attentive the whole time we were there catching up. Overall, good experience."

For entrees we've had the chicken schnitzel, cheesy meatball sub (featured), and the strawberry fields salad which were really tasty. My personal favorite is the chicken schnitzel. Other reviews mention the drinks being so-so but every drink I've gotten has been quality with the alcohol. The hotter melon was recommended by Henry and was very refreshing.

I ordered the Truffled Prosciutto Bruschetta, consisting of creamy truffled ricotta, argula, mission figs and local honey topped by a generous dollop of prosciutto.  It was a dreamy combo of textures and flavors.  On the side I had the seasonal tomato soup, thick and creamy.  My husband was briefly disappointed when Megan reported that the ribs were sold out.  However, she recommended the Wagu steak and frites.  The steak arrived warm and beautifully sliced with a giant side of shoestring fries, delicate and just fried to perfection.  We topped off the meal by splitting a peach crumble adorned with vanilla bean ice cream - a desert to die for."

                "description": "Hmmm.. okay here is my truth. I came here with my husband and another Yelper. We were told the place shuts down at 10 pm so we had a few hours that we can stay here. I guess the 'Rona comes out at 10:01?  We found a table and ordered a counter near the front. When our drinks were brought out, we were instructed to take them off the tray ourselves. There was a slight confusion over two drinks (which one was which) and I watched the server shuffle both drinks around.  Even though we were supposed to be the ones touching them? Got it.   I did like the large selection of drinks and there was a food truck on the property. I didn't try anything so can't comment on the food.   Overall, I would come back maybe when the 'Rona is done. Some of the staff on site were not the friendliest. Also, be careful if you have to use the restroom, only 1 person is allowed in at a time. I was glad I didn't have an IBS flare up while there because that could have equaled a danger zone."

Some of us like to sit at a bar, NOT make small talk with the owner, get served up professionally and just chill. The outdoor patio is great for my smoking friends and it's covered against rain and the hot ass Texas sun. Pool is cool, bathrooms are decent.   What else do you want?  Also, I heard they have a rotation of pretty sick DJs that come through. I plan on going this week!"

We had one drink and left. In the scheme of dark, dank, and dirty bars, the Grackle is a contender. I'm thinking that public health in Austin doesn't inspect businesses that don't serve food. The Grackle isn't alone in the shithole bar, pub, concept. It wasn't the worst I've seen but it's close. We were expecting a dive bar vibe but this was not even fun."

He was understaffed and didn't have the intellect or maturity not to take it out on his customer.  There are many options in Austin with good customer service. Don't waste your time with a shitty beer selection and rude arrogant bar owner.  I from Austin and been here for 40 years. I don't need more shitty people ruining my town. Time for the Grackle bird and its owner to leave town.  I will never go to this bar again. Go to the many great bars on East 6th. Avoid this place like the plague."

The serving action will commence as the bartender shuffles off his brooding reverie and we'll ALL be deep in our cups!  Nay nay!  Only those who know this gentleman can immediately get drinks for themselves AND their friends.  Sure is nice to have friends in low places and you'd be hard pressed to find lower. So, I left.

We had been there for about half an hour before someone came up and told us there was no outside booze allowed in the bar. We said, okay it's a gift, no one is drinking it, out car is miles away we took a Lyft. Within 30 seconds the conversation went from, we can't have outside alcohol in the bar, to, literally, \"I don't give a fuck get the fuck out\". That's literally how the bar guy spoke to us. After a 30 second conversation. I can't even believe that that's how they spoke to us within 30 seconds of saying that you can't have a bottle of booze that's a gift in a bag to get us to leave.  Of all the times I've been kicked out of a bar, that was the lamest, most stupid reason ever. If that guy is reading this, you're a fucking douchebag and a fucking idiot. To not even attempt to find a solution to the situation is absolutely pathetic. Put the bag behind the bar. We'll grab it on the way out.  Literally go somewhere else for drinks. The guys that run this place are fucking dicks. What a pathetic experience at a bar on a Friday night."

He ordered Build Your Own Pizza: pepperoni, salami, mushrooms, and red onions. I ordered the meat lasagna...large enough portion to feed two people. Love the marinara used in the lasagna. It was very light, fresh, and not sweet. (Some places add a lot of sugar to their pasta sauce not Tony C's). Not ordered this visit, but make sure you get the mozzarella sticks, made fresh in house, not Sysco Foods frozen. Photos of those beauties are in my previous review."

We're from Houston, but have been here to visit several times and...THEIR PIZZA IS BOMB!   Great family place-covers all bases and tastes. Friendly, fun atmosphere with 50's and 69's music playing often. Pizza is even good for takeout, which is quite popular, as well! They also offer salads and LASAGNA! (Marinara or Alfredo sauces) - see my photo of the menu for details!  TONS of seating - long tables for large groups. Nearby, newly-opened LaQuinta Hotel's guests , including sports teams, families, conference attendees, and other large parties, will love coming here, not just for the seating and atmosphere, BUT FOR THE PIZZA!!!  We visit Austin regularly, and always make it a point to visit-whether we dine in, or bring it back with us-that is, provided it makes it back...whole, lol."

                "description": "Absolutely phenomenal pizza!!! The wifey and I arrived 30 minutes after they opened, we were the second customers there. We ordered the chicken Parmesan pizza as recommended by our cashier and an order of garlic knots. It was a great recommendation.   The garlic knots came out first. They were so warm, soft and garlic buttery! They came with their house made marinara, which was sooo good! Those poor garlic knots were gone just as quick as they arrived.  When the pizza came out, it looked amazing but I was a little concerned the chicken Parmesan might be a bit dry because it kind of looked that way. Let me tell you, the pizza was spot on! The chicken was well seasoned and cooked, definitely not dry. The crust on the pizza was amazing!!! I'm craving it again as I write this review!  The atmosphere was also laid back. They had beautiful wood bench seating, which could accommodate a large party/gathering if the place is not to busy. Service was also excellent.  Honestly, the best pizza I've had in a while! I highly recommend this place if you're in the mood for delicious pizza!"

Ordering online and pick up is easy! I scheduled my pick up order in advance so I wouldn't forget.  Food was delicious. No complaints. Really enjoyed the sauce that came with the garlic knots and calamari. Gelato was satisfying. Looking forward to trying another pizza soon!"

                "description": "My husband is a pizza snob. Seriously. The staff here recognizes us now. I would say that's a pretty good sign that we go here often.  Here's what I don't like about this place: cheap, thin napkins and stingy thin plates. Also, If you have unwrapped straws, please buy a dispenser for it. It's really not sanitary in the first place, but with COVID, can you purchase wrapped straws please? I do appreciate the conscious effort to recycle. Please ditch the cheap paper goods and maybe use reusable metal pizza pans for plates or something. Also, I don't think I ever see lids for the cups. Again, perhaps consider plastic reusable cups.  What we do like: mozzarella sticks, pizza rolls, THE PIZZA, did I mention the mozzarella sticks ;) I don't like them trying to upsell ranch, but I get it. Also like the availability of pizza boxes for leftover pizza and lids for sauces.  We'll be back. Don't worry about my 4 star rating and comments about the paper goods. If we lived closer, I wouldn't insist on dining in."

We shared the largest size pizza, split a fried ravioli app, and gelato. We also enjoyed a few drinks on HH.  We usually go to slapbox for local pizza, but dare I say it, this place has better pizza in my opinion! Not as greasy and it's closer to us. Their HH runs from 5-7. My boyfriend got 2 October fest beers and I had a glass of PG, a frozen bellini and a sangria, which were all $2-3 off depending on the drink. The frozen bellini was very good and I don't normally drink frozen drinks. I did not care for the sangria at all, though.   Everyone was very friendly. In regards to COVID, everything was very clean from what I saw.   Shoutout to the manager, Catalina! She was very genuine in her table checks and we both believe she's a great asset to their team in QC."

We also orders the garlic knots which were also fantastic but look more like cinnamon rolls than garlic knots. Then, we tried the vanilla, chocolate and strawberry gelato. The vanilla is more of a rich vanilla bean flavor so it's an acquired taste (my husband loved it, I didn't care for it)  my daughter loved the chocolate (said it was better than Baskin-Robbins) and I had the strawberry. The strawberry was so delicious. Sweet, soft and airy with the perfect amount of tart to it. The restaurant was industrial looking, open concept and very clean. All the staff were friendly and attentive. Wish we had one of these where we live!"

Service was great, place was clean, and they seem to be taking COVID restrictions seriously.   The pizza was pretty good. Not as good as Slapbox/600 Degrees but just a notch below (on par with Pinthouse). Came out quick and was hot. Beer selection was pretty good - had a local brewery Oktoberfest.   All in all, worth returning and will try to nudge my kids into agreeing to go here instead of Hat Creek next door."

Food: we tried the toasted ravioli, garlic knots, Italian chopped salad and pizza. The food came out quickly and was very tasty. While the prices were not cheap, I do think you get a good value for what you pay for.   The only improvement we'd suggest is letting customers open a tab and be able to order both food and drinks on it. We were told they're already working on this though!"

I ordered the 12\" carnivore pizza and it definitely satisfied my cravings. The carnivore has salami, pepperoni, sausage, meatballs, pizza sauce, mozzarella, and calabrian peppers. There were a lot of spices, which made it quite flavorful. If you like meat on meat on meat...this pizza is for you!   Service was great! I went inside, instead of using the curbside option, to pickup the pizza from their takeout counter. They greeted me right away and had my pizza ready on time. I appreciated their organization. The inside of the restaurant looks really cute with long family style tables, TVs, and a warm atmosphere. I look forward to dining in the restaurant next time."

The next time I want to try the Blackberry beer. The name itself is appealing. Since it was close to dinner I figured I should order food instead of going home and cooking. I got the fish and chips. You can order the 2 piece or 4. I got the 2 piece with cut fries. It was cooked good. The fish was flaky and not oily. The pubs tarter sauce was good.. the fries were very good too..   The service was very good. There was a sign to sit yourself which I did and within 1 or 2 minutes my server stopped by to get me started. She showed me the ropes and got my beer and food quickly. I was really surprised at how fast my food came out. I can say it was just under 10 minutes but I was still surprised at the promptness. There was quite a few customers but the servers were on top of it. They talked to the customers as if they were family.   The place was clean and there was good parking. The beer menu had several types of craft and IPA beers. I'm  pretty sure I will return when I have time. My total cost including the food and beer was only $14, amazing! Thank you Dig Pub for being in Cedar Park and giving up another place to get a beer and some grub in a friendly way!"

My friend went through his mental list of places and came up with The Dig.   We arrived there and fortunately got there in time, it was a slow night and the kitchen was about to close so we quickly made our choices. I saw that they had Scotch Eggs and I'm a sucker for Scotch eggs, but unless you're a vegetarian/vegan what's not to like about an egg wrapped in sausage that's then deep fried?  I also ended up getting their Buffalo Chicken Sandwich because...actually why do you need a reason?  The egg was good, a little thin on the sausage side but the mustard dip added a little more savory. The sandwich had a good amount of spice but the sauce was pretty runny so it was messy but otherwise good.  They do have a lot of taps and I appreciate that they try to have a little bit of everything and focus on locals. I get that they have to strike a balance between locals who want a beer that's cold, yellow, fizzy and domestic and crazy whale chasing beer nerds that are into barrel aged, wild/lacto, hopheads but for my visit it was a little more on the tame side. I had a sour from Prairie and a local mead which was great and at the time, that was about it."

The right side of the restaurant looks pretty nice and lively and the left side of the restaurant looks like they gave up or ran out of money on decorating and just put a few tables out. They also have an outdoor area but no shade so I didn't want to sit out there unprotected, otherwise, it would have been nice because I had my dog. It was a bit busy so unfortunately had to sit on the left side (maybe everyone else there agrees the right side is better and that's why they all preferred to sit there). It didn't look or feel particularly clean and I'm a clean freak so I didn't particularly enjoy sitting there.   The service was fine; the waitress was nice. The food was pretty decent, but nothing outstanding or memorable where I feel I have to come back again. It was fresh though and I appreciate that for comfort food, it wasn't soaked in oil. I think the ambiance had already turned me off so I didn't enjoy my food as much as I would have it was clean.   They are known for their beer but I don't drink beer so take my review with a grain of salt. Clearly I'm not a dive bar kind of girl (unless it's out for drinks and bar hopping) but plenty of people are fine/really like those types of places so if you do, you'll enjoy this place. I'm not knocking this place and I would come back if friends wanted to go but I like more of an ambiance when I go out to eat."

                "description": "Been checking this place out online for months now and finally got an opportunity to go in person today. Wow. What a superior waste of time! It makes sense now why it was so empty when we went in.  You would think that as we're just coming out of a pandemic, pub and bar owners would be over the top happy to have people show up to eat and drink their food.  Well, not this owner! I'm still in shock how rude he was to me and in so little time of me being there! His bar waitress was super sweet and answering questions as it was our first time there. The plan was to order some grub, and craft beer and go sit outside on the picnic tables on this beautiful Sunday.  I was into my second question about one of the brunch items, when he rudely interjected himself into our conversation by trying to answer my question for the waitress where he clearly had not actually heard my question at all. I then corrected him by repeating what I actually asked. He then tried to defend his ignorance by stating something else about the food they serve that was a complete contradiction to half of the menu items. You should of heard the way this guy talked to me, there was absolutely no reason for it, completely unwarranted.  Plus he made himself look like a total idiot in front of everyone and it was so obvious. The more obvious thing was that he didn't want our business. When I say our, it was my husband, 2 yr. old and me. Maybe he felt threatened by our kid? He wasn't misbehaving or doing anything crazy. The nice waitress was chatting with him and everything was totally fine. And then out of no where the owner was just a total dick to me!! So of course we left, I mean who would stay!? But that's exactly what he wanted, for us to leave. With pleasure, Asshole!  I felt bad for the nice waitress, she seemed to be in shock also. Sure hope she finds somewhere else to work since I can bet she gets treated like garbage.  Funny thing is that I can't even comment on the food or beer which is all I was yes to try. This guy should do the world a favor, sell the place to someone who actually wants business and go take a class in The Important of People skills in the food and bev business. Mean people suck and they need to learn how to be nice or just grow the F up."

                "description": "First of all, not family friendly. Took my daughter here for a dinner with our dog ... sat outside, and ordered a couple of burgers, and after a long day I wanted a couple of cold, craft beers. Perhaps I shouldn't have expected a family friendly atmosphere, but I honestly didn't think I had to think it through too much. So, a group of men in their 30s-40s began arguing about a patron sneezing , dropping \"f bombs\". The patron went in to get the owner. I thought \"ok cool, the owner will take care of this.\" Instead, of calming the situation, he comes out dropping \"f bombs\" of his own, bragging about how he's going to kick all their asses, and how big of a Texan he is. I asked if he could watch his language in front of my family, he ignored me. So, I took it as a way to teach my daughter that this is the definition of a bunch of men that are nothing but losers. I told her, this is not the way men that have any class should act in public. There were also plenty of other women around that didn't need to hear all of this male drama while they are trying to have an enjoyable evening with their families. The guy that actually started the whole thing apologized. Owner, Eric, you should be ashamed of yourself. Dude, have some awareness ... no one cares about how cool and tough you think you are while they are trying to have dinner and spend some time with their friends and family. The people next to me just got up and left, too. You were so caught up in your own ego, you didn't even notice. I spent $42 and still left your staff a 20% tip, mostly cuz I felt sorry they have to work for such a loser. Not sure what Texas you claim to have grown up in, but not the one my family has lived in for 6+ generations. We all make mistakes .. and I rarely leave reviews or waste any of my precious time on this kinda thing .. but this needed to be said."

My visit here was to check out Bar Ilegal, a small mezcal based bar that is located in a small shed-like building in the back.  Both bars were popular as there were a good amount of people hanging out in the area. I ordered a Mexucan Mule and it was great. I liked the bite that it had in the drink. The bartender was super friendly and also suggested a couple of other bars that I should check out."

Their bar itself is not one of the biggest bars there is but the overall atmosphere seems to be a mix of chill and lively without being too much at times. Located just a stone's throw away is the elusive Bar Ilegal, which used to be a really subtle and unnoticed mezcal bar before Rainey became what it is today. Overall Clive Bar is a great place to warmup for a night out on Rainey, esp with Container Bar just across the street."

To be honest, I was wandering down Rainey Street on a Saturday night, with certain bars with lines wrapping the block. Clive Bar though, seemed chill with no line and a decent amount of people where I could still have my own personal space.   Quickly got in and into the bar, bartenders were easily accessible which is a big bonus. 2 specialty cocktails for $20, I'm not complaining. Both drinks were made with love and a little heavy hand but you'll never hear me complain about it.   Another bonus, I was able to snag a table for our group and we were set for the evening. They had an awesome DJ playing 90s + 00s hip hop and RandB. Super dope bar with a cool outside space (Cornhole available) with a mezcal speakeasy as well.   For all the lines and drunk people, I'd come back here for a chill, lowkey night."

Well if I'm honest, she was watching the game, I was people watching!  The location is great. It's on a corner and has a good view of the street below. The rustic vibes and good music made for a nice time. The bartenders were all very kind and worked quickly. The drinks were made very very well. I had their signature Mule and my friend had a Strawberry Fizz. They were $10 each and I felt worth every penny. Now by 4:00 a younger rowdy crowd came in and the relaxed vibe changed. They stood in front of the tv and those of us watching the game quickly decided to leave. I am not taking away any stars for this because  I had a really good time and the bar itself cannot be held responsible for the how people act. Just go early"

                "description": "Came here a couple of times recently and definitely enjoyed myself.  First, the bar has both an inside and outside area - the outside area is reasonably large, so that's where we spent most of our time. One point I want to make is that the bartenders were really nice throughout our visits there. They were friendly, remembered my name, and just did a great job in general.  One fun thing about this bar is that they have cornhole outside. Of course, it's only one set of boards, and you'll have plenty of other people wanting to play, so you can pretty much play a few games max. But a few games of cornhole is better than no games at all! One small negative about the place is that they had some pretty subpar BBQ restaurant serving food there (on a Thursday). Granted, it's not like the bar itself is serving the food, but I would have preferred they allowed a better restaurant to take up real estate.  Overall, I definitely recommend people come here and have a drink. And if you don't like it, you can go to one of the other many bars on Rainey St. :)"

                "description": "My review will focus on Bar Illegal. My friends and I were on the hunt to find speakeasies in Austin, and Bar Illegal is one of the easier ones to get to. It is visible from outside Clive Bar, but to get to Bar Illegal, you must walk through Clive Bar's outside area and into the small building that is roughly the size of a shed. The small structure seemed to be made of stones, and it had many cultural items representing Mexico that were spread around: religious paintings, prayer candles, skulls, and other decorations. There were only four other people not including the bartender and my group of three. I would approximate the 'comfortable limit' would be 10 people. The bartender was well educated on the topic mezcal! He got a sense of what we individually liked to drink, and he selected a different type of mezcal for each of us. I drank my mezcal as a shot since it's a little too strong for me, but the bartender suggested drinking it slowly. The prices of the mezcal were all under $10 for shot glass sized servings. The bartender was also awesome enough to suggest other speakeasies and tell us 'passwords' for one."

When my husband and I started dating in 2011 it was where we would go often.  It was a different Rainey Street all together back then.  There were only like 3 bars in the area at the time.   Clive Bar used to have the frozen peach teas that were amazing!  I still think back to those and wish they still had them.  I usually ask every summer if they will bring them back - I really really wish they would.  All the bartenders here are amazing and super nice!  I love their drink menu and they have a nice selection of beer on tap as well.  They have some infused liquors too that change out every now and then.  Honestly if you don't know what you want just ask the bartenders what they recommend and tell them the flavors you like and they might be able to whip something up for you.    I also love the openness and atmosphere at Clive.  No matter the season it is always good.  They also have a Mezcal bar that is open on the weekends in the back.  If you have never experienced this I would highly recommend trying a flight to taste.    So if you are on Rainey Street - don't skip Clive Bar - it is a must stop for sure!"

                "description": "I'm a huge fan of mezcal, so when I heard a bar had a speakeasy-ish room in the back that specialized in it, clearly I had to pop in and check it out. I do feel like it would make more sense for it to be its own yelp page, as while it is owned jointly and running under the same liquor license, the purpose (tasting high quality mezcal) and menu (just a long list of mezcals) are totally different from the main bar. I didn't visit the main bar, just Bar Ilegal.   Anyway, unsurprisingly, it's tiny (could fit maybe a dozen people before it'd start to get uncomfortable), but when we were there, around 9 PM on a Saturday, it only had about 6 people in it - I suppose a bar for just tasting mezcal is pretty niche (they do have 4 mezcal cocktails as well, but they honestly didn't look like anything particularly spectacular). The bartender clearly knew his mezcal very well, and prices are actually surprisingly reasonable for a spirit-focused bar. I asked to try the smokiest reasonably-priced mezcal he had, and got one - Del Maguey's San Luis del Rio - that I absolutely loved, a half-pour for $6.50 (I also love that they do half-pours, for if your primary motivation is \"sample new mezcals\" rather than \"get crunk\"). Based on previous experience with places like this, I assumed it was a truly ludicrous markup and that I had just found my new favorite affordable mezcal, but nope! It's a 70 dollar mezcal. So, happy that I got to try a 70 dollar mezcal (it was delicious), but also a little sad because now I'm still looking for my \"can always keep a bottle at home\" affordable type mezcal. Oh well.   But anyway, yeah, if you like mezcal, you have to check out Bar Ilegal. Really wish my favorite mezcal bar locally would do mezcal samplings like this one does."

Clive really stood out to me as having the full package.   The inside space is cozy and lodge-y. Coming from MKE, we felt right at home. The outside deck and patio space is huge. Plenty of room for everyone to spread out and still keep a game of Bag Toss going.   Later in the week, we were with a bunch of our KW coworkers and one of our party members thought it would be a good idea to try out Container Bar. Wrong. It was a like an undergrad frat house in there. SO loud, SO sweaty, SO many college kids. No offense if that's your thing. Clive Bar SAVED THE DAY.   Get the Matthew Pecan-aughey."

You can sit inside or in their pretty large patio with tons of outdoor seating and corn hole. Inside they have darts. However, the gem here is their not so hidden mezcal bar in their patio which is amazing."

                "description": "Pretty sure this was the first bar I checked out on Rainey Street. Ordered the Old Fashioned here that day about a year ago and haven't looked back since. Literally just get that drink everywhere now these days, but they make it damn good here. The inside of the bar easily makes this the place you'd bring a date on Rainey, but there is plenty of outdoor seating as well. Pretty sure they have live music on the weekends in the patio area, but it's definitely crowded as hell during those days.  Went out for the first time ever on a Monday tonight and ended up here. Ordered a round of Old Fashioneds for us to start off as usual. The drinks were more generous than on the weekends since there weren't many people on Rainey. Tom was the bartender tonight and actually gave me a free Inside Job cocktail after I talked to him for a bit. The drink was pretty similar to an Old Fashioned, so it was right up my alley. He was definitely a nice guy. Will probably be on Rainey at least a few more times as the semester winds down, and I'll be sure to visit Clive during each of those occasions as always."

                "description": "We came during peak time on a Saturday evening. This means we are seeing them at their most challenged time. And I was a little \"hangey\" having to wait a half hour to be seated. But it was worth it. The waiter checked back with us every few minutes (mandatory for a good restaurant). And our order was delivered hot and fresh in a reasonable amount of time (a little slow because they were very busy - but in a reasonable amount of time).  We had chips and queso as an appetizer. The chips were the thick, homemade type. And the queso was their own recipe with ancho cili drizzle, crema, some sort of pico de gallo, etc. Really good - exceptional.  I had a chicken sandwich. It had a lot going on (in a good way). It was not just a run of the mill chicken sandwich. And the sidewinder fries are fresh and homemade.   My wife had the watermelon, which she also said was really good.  Overall, some creative foods that were well executed, and on point service  Definitely give this place a try."

                "description": "I didn't love this place. I totally understand that with COVID, many restaurants have had to cut back their menus.   With that being said, it seemed like breakfast-y food definitely prevailed during our Sunday afternoon visit. Seeing that they do a Sunday brunch, I get it, but always pictured that included a few other options not focused around eggs or waffles.   My husband ended up ordering their burger (which isn't even obviously advertised as a burger), and said it wasn't anything to write home about. My mother-in-law had their chicken sandwich and seemed to be okay with it. Not much fanfare from my husband's stepfather or his girls.  I ended up ordering the chili and didn't have any major complaints. I would've loved to see more in the \"siesta\" part of the menu that wasn't a salad.   My other complaint was the noise. The music was so loud that we could barely hear each other across the table, which pretty much awkwardly split our party in half. At first, we tried to get past it by borderline yelling, but that got old.   In between waiting for condiments, I asked our waitress if there was any way to knock the volume down by a click or two. She mentioned that she would see what she could do, but that it wasn't guaranteed since \"people pay for it\". My brother in law ended up seeing the jukebox in the corner, and while that's fantastic, I don't think it's too much to ask to keep music at a reasonable level in a place where you'd expect your guests to socialize at their table."

We chose to sit outside but soon discovered the flies were way too many to be able to eat in peace. We couldn't stop waving our hands or the flies would land on the food.

Out of some Cabernets. They were out of everything we went to order. The server could not have been more kind and sweet. She said it was because they run out of a lot of things on Saturday nights so Sundays they're just out. Well, I did a quick review of the comments on this restaurant and this is apparently a running theme. 1. Shame on me for not checking the comments before we came, 2. Shame on them for not resolving this clearly on-going issue. I know times are tough, but just close on Sunday nights if you cannot have more product delivered. We finished our drinks and left without ordering dinner at all."

                "description": "Sorry this is a little late but I wanted to give a review. I stopped by here a couple weeks ago for dinner. The place was full, but they squeezed me in at the bar. I asked for a menu and a beer. The bar tender let me sample one of the beers on tap. I liked it so I ordered one to drink. I also ordered a patty melt with tater tots. The burger was think and made to order. I had to cut the burger because I did not want a big mess from trying to get a bite into my mouth. The burger was juicy since I ordered it medium and very tasty. I can say it filled me up. The beer was cold, nothing better than a cold beer, well almost nothing.  The atmosphere was as most sports bars are, a little noisy but people seems to know each other and they were friendly. The bartenders were busy but kept getting those drinks. The servers were also busy taking food and refilling cups of the patrons. There is outdoor seating but it was one of those HOT Days so I was glad I was inside. The parking is decent but they share with several other businesses. It was not too far away from the entrance so no need to wear the sneakers unless you want to.  Thank you Republic Kitchen + Bar for being a good neighbor and giving us another option to dine in Leander, Texas."

The only complaint I have about it is that they put the bread on the grill to get grill marks, but all I tasted was burnt toast. They do the top if the burger bun the same but it's not as grill marked. So next time I will ask for them not to do that, I hate black charred burnt toast. My husbands burger was good as well and both the tots and fries were tasty and perfect portion. They have a big bar with a good variety. I had a Hell or High Water to drink, and will definitely order that again. Delish! And last but def not least the service was great! Our server Kelsey was attentive and very sweet. Definitely looking forward to the next visit...word is they have a good weekend brunch, so we'll be checking that out."

But the mash and veggies had great flavor and tasted good!  Texas Smash is good if you like a honey whiskey, I don't.  But the old fashion was just how I like it!  Overall good place to try, the service was good. They have tvs on but I'd recommend that they put subtitles on all of them so since we can't hear them we can at least read and know what is going on."

                "description": "This was one of the worst experiences we've had in a restaurant in a long time.  The server was rude, the manager condescending (strangely, I don't remember him being so rude at Texican) and the place was dirty.  The table was sticky, and they knew it, even said there was nothing they could do about it because it was \"resin\"...it wasn't.  We ordered four entrees, and they came out in stages. The first ones to hit the table were cold.  The third followed five minutes later, and mine didn't show up for another five minutes, at which time I told them to just keep it.  The \"hash\" was runny and not at all hash, the scrambled eggs cold, bacon underdone, and no condiments available; when we asked for them, they acted like it was an imposition.    $92 worth of bad food and crap service.  Very disappointing considering the executive chef was wearing a Fox Hole chef's coat, and Fox Hole is one of my favorite places in this area; I assumed from the get it would be extraordinary after seeing that...I guess not.  Oh, and word of caution, when the server handed my fiancé the mobile payment device, she selected the 20% tip option.  Make sure you watch out for that...there is no signage indicating there is an automatic gratuity so the servers have NO business choosing their own tip amount.  Update: while we were out of town, we discovered my fiancé's debit card had been hacked.  Oddly, the odd charges started AFTER using the mobile payment device, which was WiFi powered.  I cannot stress this enough...BEWARE!"

This was the perfect place to sit back, chill and enjoy great food and company. I really like the ambience of this restaurant. It boasts a laid back feel with the dim lighting, yet has an open atmosphere. I ordered the Grilled Atlantic Salmon and everything was cooked to perfection. The salmon was cooked on the medium side to my liking and request to the server. We also ordered the James Bowie Nachos. Keep in mind these are not the typical Tex-Mex nachos, but they were still delicious and flavorful with a hint of robust BBQ flavor. There is an option to add chicken or steak and we opted for the chicken...great choice! If you love spicy (I sure do), they have a kick to them, as they are topped with freshly sliced jalapenos. Our server was excellent! She was so friendly, accommodating and checked on us frequently. She alone deserves a 5-star recognition! Try this place that offers locally-sourced, high quality food with its own, unique flavor."

I guess that means I'll have to make up for lost time. We got the Brussel Sprouts as an appetizer. There was a sweetness to it with the apples and honey and candied pecans. So good! For dinner, I got the Pan-Seared Chicken and had to say yes to that when I saw that the chicken was on top of risotto, my favorite. The chicken was a small piece but very flavorful.

I ordered the El Cesar Chavez salad with salmon and when they food came out the first bite I took I was fishing a bone out of my mouth from the salmon. So I started to inspect the rest of the fish and found 3 more bones. I informed our waitress and she kindly had it re made but when the second salmon came out I once again found 2 more fish bones inside.   At this point I did not receive an apology nor did a manager come by to check in to if everything was okay so I asked to speak to one and inform him. The gentlemen came over and apologized but really did not seem genuine about it after I explained how dangerous it was that I found a total of 6 fish bones that I could have choked on. He also attempted to blame the chef for not cleaning it right and saying \"I always tell him to make sure all the bones are out.\"   Coming from the restaurant business myself and having my husband be on the corporate side of a big restaurant chain - I was very disappointed in how this place dealt with the issue.   Please check your seafood at this place - they clearly are not ordering boneless seafood or properly cleaning they're fish."

                "description": "Probably closer to 3 1/2, but I'm feeling semi-generous.  Think mall or airport food court, but with better quality and execution.  The hard part for our first visit was deciding which restaurant to try.  I ended up trying their Japanese restaurant and my dining companion tried the grilled cheese restaurant.  First and foremost, this is not a user friendly experience.  Every one of the restaurants is a self serve counter where you use a keypad to order.  The format of the keypad/menu isn't easy to follow.  More than one diner (besides me and my companion) needed to figure out how to order a drink.  (FYI, you order the drink from the keypad, then you get your cup when they call you up for your food.) Additionally, customizing an order can be a bit of a challenge. A lot of the online ordering platforms have customization options, but Main Streat has a space to enter your requests with the on-screen keyboard. Fortunately, the kitchen staff does a great job of reading and accommodating special requests.  I had the pork potstickers, which are some of the best in town.  They're crispy, but not deep fried and the sauce has a good flavor.  I also liked my noodles with the beef skewers.  The beef was high quality, but it would've benefitted from being flipped on the grill as one side had grill marks and the other side was just grey meat.  My dining companion had one of the grilled cheese sandwiches, which she described as good.  Once you figure out that you need to order the drinks at the same time you place your food order, you'll find the drinks in the limited seating area by the bar.  HEB has its own version of the Coca-Cola Freestyle machine which offers products from Coke, Pepsi, and Maine Root.  They also have sweet and unsweet tea as well as lemonade and strawberry lemonade.  The food is high quality and there are a lot of options available (surprisingly no burger or Italian options, though).   The awkwardness of ordering and very limited dine-in seating means that Main Streat will be someplace that I'd only stop by when in the area and probably during off hours."

                "description": "My husband and I stopped in for a small bite to eat and something to drink. There is a full bar but was a little surprised to learn that there is no cider on draft. Okay, what about cans? Nope, all out even after checking in the pack. FYI, this is attached to a grocery store. I can not have beer due to a barley allergy and I am gluten intolerant. I settled on a red wine blend which came from tap. We live in Austin, it would definitely benefit this place to add cider options.   The overall setup was great and enjoyed a drink and a small bite here with my husband. I can't wait until the weather is better and people move on from the 'rona so they can maybe have some live music or events where people can hang out.  They have a whiskey Thursdays that offers some discounts. If I was a whiskey fan I would probably check that out."

                "description": "I'm going to start this by contradicting the haters who compare this to HMart and space that was otherwise not making money for HEB. When this store opened, this space was \"cafe mueller,\" heb's first bar/restaurant, and I miss it! They had the best burger in town and really good brisket.  They had an outdoor play yard for kids. A lot of the outdoor seating area was sacrificed to add the Curbside buildout during COVID.   The food hall concept also opened during COVID, and conveniently has you order at a kiosk for each vendor. Very safe. All the seating is in the (very dark and cold) bar or outdoors, and there is less of it than there used to be. Also, I don't think any of the vendors have kids portions, and half the seating is bar height, so I'm no longer interested in bringing my kids here - total bummer, as we all loved cafe mueller. With the kiosks and separate bar, I am definitely not inclined to drag my kids here - I'd have to herd them through all the kiosks and the bar to get everyone's order in, and then pick everything up by vendor, and would be unable to have eyes on my kids at the table while doing so. You now need to go into the bar for drink refills, where I wouldn't sit with my kids because of the bar-height tables.   The pickup part is what makes the food court feel like an airport - everyone is just kind of waiting around. There are no lines, unlike cafe mueller, which always had a line, but the standing around makes it feel depressing.   The food is ok. I like some of the vendors more than others. My favorite is Calle Taqueria. It's a good place to pick up lunch to go midday, or for ordering from Favor.   The one advantage to Main Streat is that it tends to have no delivery fee on Favor, since it's at HEB. However, if you order from more than one place, you get more than one runner, since every vendor is a separate order. I suppose you can make one order at one vendor, and contact the runner to go to other vendors on the same run.   HEB, if you're reading this, I know you're collecting data. Windsor Park and Mueller has lots of families. Is there a way you could once again make this space friendly to families with small kids who want to get a bite to eat while doing the grocery shopping? And more of a community gathering space, with more seating? I used to meet up with a cyclist group here, and I don't think we could do that in the current configuration, nor will I visit with my kids for the reasons described above."

                "description": "Main Streat is the Food Court inside the Mueller HEB.  For a supermarket food court, it is not great.  The gold standard for supermarket food courts in Austin is Hmart.  They have a huge roomy pleasant space.  They have six-eight magnificent restaurants each of which would be in the top third of their category in Austin.  They are all Asian but different kinds of Asian.  Restaurants that fail at Hmart Food Court are typically still better than most of the other restaurants in Austin.  That tells you how good the successes are.  At Hmart, you can get really good drinks from two nearby vendors and the TV has fun things to watch.  At Mueller, Main Streat is jammed into a leftover hallway that was not earning any other kind of money for HEB.  The stands are small because there is no room.  The cramped hallway food court is an unpleasant place to be.   You are not drawn to it to fantasize about the wonderful dishes you could be ordering.  You are supposed to eat next door in the bar or in the patio beyond that.   The bar feels like a garage. It has high chairs so you do not sit too long. It is not a nice place to linger.   The patio is okay.  The selection of restaurants is not great.   My Asian food loving vegetarian wife found nothing to love in the one Asian stall.   HEB's barbecue is functional at best.   (The gold standard in supermarket barbecue is Whole Foods. Bowie BBQ is in the top third of the city.)   The Mexican stand is ho-hum.  So the duck-fat fried chicken place would have to be amazing to make Main Streat any kind of destination.  If you are at HEB Mueller anyway and you need lunch or a drink, you could make this work.  It is not a destination draw."

                "description": "OK, whoever named this place \"Main Streat\" should be fired. Please, go word vomit on yourself and leave the rest of us out of it. Other than that, we had a mostly wonderful experience here on Saturday afternoon when we took our daughter here as a TREAT after she got her stitches out at Dell.  We're doing an overall review since we ordered from two places: Roots Chicken Shak (yet another idiotic spelling; why is grammar so uncool these days??) and Calle Taqueria.  We'll start with Roots: --Kale salad: tasty; did NOT appreciate so many breadcrumbs and definitely was appalled to see two whole anchovies on the top (that's a pretty baller move). --Fried chicken strips: Fine. The whole duck fat thing is a gimmick though because we have pretty discerning palates and you absolutely 100% cannot taste the difference. --Original fried chicken sandwich: Amazing, definitely one of the best ones we've ever had. Loved the sweet potato bun and the kale slaw.   Calle Taqueria: We're considering this place one of Austin's best-kept secrets right now because the food was some of the best that we've had in town, especially considering the price point. --Smoked brisket Quesadilla: incredible. Bursting with flavor, loved the cheesy underside. Sooooooo good. Superior in every way to the one that we've had in this style from Vaquero Taquero. --Al Pastor taco: see above word-for-word. DELISH. The only bummer here were the sides. We loved the street corn but the corn itself was limp and sad-looking. The refried beans were also...just weird. Something tasted pretty off in them.  As for the space, it's more like a little hallway than an actual food hall. It was clean and spacious and there's plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. A couple things that aren't intuitive are cups for water (you need to get them from the restaurant vendors) and that the loudspeaker doesn't extend to the outside for when your order is up (which is really dumb considering that's where most people will want to sit during Covid). BUT THEY HAVE NORMAL COMPOSTABLE STRAWS HALLELUJAH!!!!! Thank you!!! And all the silverware is individually wrapped as well. Those small touches did not go unnoticed or unappreciated. We will absolutely be back again."

I got the chicken fried rice and I could tell they used quality ingredients because the food was fresh and tasty. The rice wasn't heavily over soy sauced either. The pay/self ordering stations were a pretty cool touch, too. Would return to try the other restaurants and even the bar. Docked 1 star because it wasn't anything to rave about but very delicious. Especially before you have to grocery shop (never shop hungry)"

There also a bar where you can order drinks if you're in the mood. Another bonus- there are tables where you can dine in or sit outside, so you don't have to get it \"to go\". So far I've only had the bbq and the Japanese food, and they were both very good! I'm looking forward to my next trip back where I can give the others a try. Definitely check it out if you are in the area and want to get a quick bite to eat."

We tried many of the red wine and they were alright.    The staff is super friendly and patient.  They also have non alcoholic  daiquiri  for the kids. Just a few flavors, but the kids enjoyed them. Of course they did they are just like smaller but more expensive Slushies.   The wine itself is pretty good and a tad on the pricey side IMO. $12/glass or $36 per bottle.

Co-located at the same address on Bob Wire Road as Frontyard Brewing, this facility is an impressive one. Their tasting room had lots of space - both indoors and out.   The indoor space was open and airy with tons of natural light from floor to ceiling windows and a modern interior. The service here is also a highlight as we noticed that everyone = the servers, bar managers and the owners were ALL making sure that everyone's experience was top notch. We found them to all be very friendly and personable - like those cool neighbors that you REALLY want to hang out with. One thing I liked is that this tasting room also had great energy to it - something that is missing from a LOT of tasting rooms and even some breweries.   Outside, the covered patio is large with plenty of seating for friends, families. The yard is extensive - an amazing space to bring your kiddos and just let them play and have fun.  This really is the kind of place that you wish was only 5 minutes (and not 45) from your house - so check them out."

                "description": "I've only ordered through Uber Eats and haven't visited the restaurant so this review is based on delivery only. Everything was packaged with meticulous care. Each item fit three packages and the packages for into the bag without taking over. Not too much packaging and not too little.  I ordered a Cobb Salad, which I thought would have egg crumbles but there were 3 hard boiled egg halves. That was a good surprise even though I ordered deviled eggs too. All shall be eaten in time. I asked to sub dressing and they did. Thank you.  Not many places makes collard greens and it's always different. I don't have a favorite but some address definitely better than others. These were not spicy, not vinegary, not salty (all reasons why I don't like some places' greens). They were maybe a touch sweet butt well-balanced. The biscuits were soft and not dry at all.  I wish you could tip the restaurant, especially BOH, fire such great food. Yeah, I just ordered a salad as the main but everything was MADE by hand, not just prepped. The biscuits, salad dressing, deviled eggs, greens, tomato jam.   Thanks to the staff here! Your food is great!"

                "description": "We ate here for New Years Eve and I was blown away! I saw that it has good reviewes but I am vegetarian so I wasn't sure if it would actually be good for vegetarians. It is. There were vegetarian options on the menu which was nice. We got the fried green tomatoes for an appetizer, I had the roasted butternut squash as an entree and we shared the hummingbird cake for desert. All three items were exceptionally good. My husband had the pork rib and he liked his dish too.   I was really surprised at how much I liked the butternut squash. When I saw it as the only vegetarian option I assumed it would be mediocre. It was actually SO GOOD. The goat cheese melted perfectly with the grits and the semi-sweet butternut squash worked well with the rest of the dish being savory. I also really liked the crunchy pecans and the buttercream icing for the hummingbird cake. It was delicious! I would go here again.... the only problem is they only have ONE vegetarian entree! Also, if you are vegan I would not suggest this place because I did not really see many vegan options on the menu.    If the chef or owner sees this review I have one suggestion for them. They should add chicken fried oyster mushrooms to their menu! It would be so perfect for the southern style theme of the restaurant and it would be a great vegan option for anyone that has a strict vegan diet. Iv had chicken fried oyster mushrooms at honeymoon spirit lounge and it was SO good and I think a spin off of that dish would work well here too."

Atmosphere was  perfect, store decor was beautiful, service above reproach and management's involvement with tables was spot on.  Super impressed with food quality, flavor profile and presentation! I will definitely be back to this Diamond tucked away in the rough! Well done to all of you especially the owners Ashley and company! You guys have out done yourself !! Thank you for a delectable Saturday brunch with my fiancé!!"

                "description": "Really wanted to love this place but Was a bit disappointed.   Service 10/10- We came here on a Sunday around 1:30p and got seated right away. Service was good. No complaints there. The decoration does give me cute southern vibes.   Food- 7/10- my waffles were so hard. It seems as if they had been sitting out for a while and got hard and they were just warm. I didn't finish the waffles because the were that hard. The chicken was way over seasoned and dry. My bf ordered a bagel and said it was ok not the best but ok.   Restrooms are gender neutral- not an issues.  If you come during 11a-2p on Sunday they charge you automatically 20% service charge on your bill. Considering if you are coming with a big group it could get pricey including 20% gratuity."

                "description": "I found the food and service at Colleen's to be as pleasant as the ambience and indoor setting. They have multiple hot sauce options (one of which, as someone who loves spice, was actually spicy!), and it complemented the potato hash well. Their take on deviled eggs was an interesting one, and though I only sampled a few of their menu items, the ones that I did were of high quality.  I did find it slightly undesirable, however, that an automatic tip of 20% was priced into the bill, and a separate line for tip was present for the customer to tip onto the amount that already had tip included. Had I not been paying attention, I might have tipped twice. I personally had a good experience with the service, however considering the volume of reviewers that have mentioned the service, I find it an interesting option to strip the customer of the option to tip how they see fit."

                "description": "I will give this place 4 star rating based on the quality of the food.  But, we waited almost an hour for our food.  We were visiting the local children's museum and decided to come here for lunch.  We came at 2 pm on a Sunday so it was packed.    After a 30 minute wait,  we ordered our food at 2:30.     It seemed like the might there might have been a shift change and we got lost in the hustle.   Our waiter and the manager seemed to avoid eye contact.    When we finally talked to our waiter, he apologized.    When got our good at 3:30,  the food was tasty.   We ordered the deviled eggs which were tasty and one of my favorite items in the menu.   The biscuits were warm and flaky.     We were eating relatively healthy which I don't recommend at this home cooking restaurant.  The Caesar Salad with Grilled Chicken and Cobb Salad with Grilled Chicken was also tasty.   The Colleen's Brunch Burger was not too large but overflowed with great flavors.  The Four Cheese Mac and Salad was one of the best I have had.   I even snuck in some Fried Chicken from my son's Chicken Nuggets and they were delicious.    They were kind enough to take off 2 appetizers from our bill.  But like previous reviewers, I was cut off guard with the added on 20% service tip.  I was a little surprised with the service that we got.  The waiter did tell us about the \"livable wage\" and I felt that he repeated to other customers in the past.  I do support the restaurant industry during the COVID 19 crisis.   I do understand the cost of food and labor has gone up.  I  was also planning on leaving a 20% tip.   However, I think customers may balk at the required tip.   That being said, this is common practice in places like Miami were people don't tip.  I would return when they are not as busy because the food was tasty.  Don't be caught off hard with the required service tip."

                "description": "Southern cooking with an expert hand, Colleen's kitchen has been somewhere I've been wanting to try for a really long time, but somehow never made it over until end of the year team lunch. And ya, it's not the world's lightest lunch, but it will definitely bring a lot of joy to you and leave your belly nice and warm and [a little too] full :).  Don't sleep on the starters. The bacon wrapped dates are flavor grenades of salty, pork, fatty, crispy, sweet flavor. They play very well together and other than wishing there were more dates per order, it's very good. The fried green tomatoes are also excellent with some comeback sauce with a kick.  Entree wise, I got my southern standard fried chicken. It's got excellent crunch and is deboned, so double win right there but it's also very well flavored, with hints of cayenne undergirding the bird. The potatoes are rich and just chunky enough and pair amazingly with the gravy. Collard greens have just enough bitterness to cut through the rich heft. The shrimp and grits looked really good too and my coworkers who did get it all raved about it.  All in all, thoroughly impressed and a great place for a meal if you're in the Mueller area."

Not chicken tenders, but an actual adult person sized piece of fried chicken. It is sooo hard to find this in ATX, I've tried. They also have a thigh, for those of you like my mom who prefer dark meat. And they are both super tasty!  I wouldn't say I tried it and was like \"this is the best fried chicken I've ever had\", but I've been here twice, and both times it was solid. Also, the biscuits are among the best I've had. Again, nothing fancy about them, just a good, soft biscuit. I'm not crazy about the mac and cheese, but I am vrrrry picky about mac. If you like it creamy you might enjoy this (I prefer it casseroley.)  Our server was great. I was prepared for the mandatory 20% gratuity, and it didn't bother me none."

                "description": "Everything here is a BANGER! Great food. Great location. Great vibes. Able to get a relatively last minute reservation in.  Came here for a Sunday brunch and it's now my favorite brunch spot in Austin. I am thrilled I settled on the fried chicken and fried green tomato. They both came in a sort of biscuit slider fashion and were absolutely amazing. Didn't expect them to be so good, even on the second day. I appreciated the pickles to be a sweeter cornichon. The best side is the Mac and cheese. This is a true southern side dish styled Mac. Went great with the fried chicken. They have a section of brunch drinks as well, and the cocktails I tried felt like a sweeter aperitif, perfect for brunch. If you're having trouble picking something off the menu, I would recommend just copy into my order!  Our waiter was a bit slow, but it was a busy Sunday morning, so no worries there! Overall, 5/5 would recommend to anyone local or visiting!"

To try several things, we ordered the fried chicken dish with gravy n mashed potatoes, baked mac n cheese, and tomato basil soup. OMG - I could eat here every single week. The food and drinks are presented beautifully and tastes very homemade.   The restaurant itself is super cute and totally Austin appropriate. Keep in mind they include a 20% automatic gratuity to the bill, which we were happy to pay to our server Rose, who was very kind and delivered exceptional service. We will be back next time we're in town no doubt."

The chicken pot pie crust was so flaky and the insides weren't too liquidy, but it was just very homey overall. The shrimp and grits were also really flavorful. I kind of wish the portion sizes were bigger but it's the perfect amount if you want room for dessert there or somewhere else in the plaza.  I visited for dinner and was able to grab the last chicken pot pie, but I feel like this restaurant has more of a lunch vibe, so I would definitely visit again then to really get the full experience.   The servers were super nice in checking up on us, recommending which drinks were in season, and just chatting in general.   And a plus: they validate parking for the garage behind them!"

They lacked a lot of flavor but the sauce made up for it. They are great portion to share. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken dinner with the green beans, mashed potato's and biscuit. Portion is huge enough for 2 meals. Can't go wrong with any of the above but I'm dreaming about the biscuit. The hubs ordered the pork chop, also very tasty. Will eventually make it back in for brunch.   Covid-Indoor/outdoor dining, tables spaced out far enough, all staff wearing masks and guests required to wear masks anytime not seated at the table. They did start adding an automatic 20% gratuity which is stated on the menu and our server told us it's  \"so the front and back of house staff could earn a livable wage\""

For dinner I ordered a trio of little biscuit and cut everything in half so I could try a little bit of each one. Be aware of the fried egg in the breakfast biscuit. It really surprised me when I cut into it but made the most beautiful egg run. I ended up having the equivalent of one biscuit leftover so the portion sizes are generous.   They have a little window off to the side where to go orders can be picked up. Even more exciting, they sell cookies from this window!"

Honestly, I could have been content with just the biscuits, they were super yummy! I'm not a fan of tomatoes, but thought the tomato jam that was served with it wasn't bad! I didn't even realize it was tomato, I thought it was something else! The potato hash was good too, but I would probably try something else if I went back!  The aesthetic was also super cute! Very open and bright with fun green wallpaper with chickens and one of the areas had a bunch of old time photos. I thought the location was great as well and we walked around the Mueller farmers market afterwards!  Just a heads up, you have to wait until your whole party has arrived before being seated, even if you have a reservation, and they do an automatic 20% gratuity on your ticket. Honestly, not a huge fan of them automatically putting in the tip because I feel like it should be based on the service you get, and it wasn't super clear so if my friend hadn't said anything, I probably would have tipped twice."

Walk in and turn left to place your order at the counter.  If you want to drink .. walk in and go straight to the bar.  They have salads, apps and several speciality pizzas ... sized from individual to family. You get soda from the fountain (cherry, cream, cola, etc) or beer from the tap (too many to cover here).   There are a few booths and tables but mainly it is community seating at 20' long tables. Kind of cool I think.  TVs everywhere ... watched baseball and ESPN. I bet this place is lit on Sat and Sun for football.  So the food? I really liked the beer mates .. garlic cheese bread. Good size and flavor for just $5. I had the pear honey pizza .. add blue cheese, basil and pancetta. I really liked the way the flavors all stuck out .. sweet, herby, salty ... love it!!"

                "description": "This is a good spot to come hang and catch a game on the TV while you enjoy some craft pizzas and beers. You order the food and beer separately, food from a walkup counter and beer from the bar in the middle of the restaurant. You get a buzzer puck when you order food so the servers can locate you and bring it to your table. We ordered the Beer Mates and Pizza Roll appetizers to start and two pizzas, the Oo La La and the Shroomin' Goat. Food timing was staggered and the only real hiccup was that the Beer Mates appetizer order seemed to have gotten lost because we had to ask for it after all the rest of our order had trickled out, and it then took about 15min more for it to finally arrive. But, when it did, it was piping hot and fresh, so that's good. Food quality was very good and we enjoyed everything we ordered."

If you love pepperoni or sausage  grease then this is the place for you.   If you don't then don't get these meats on your pizza.  I hope the kitchen learns about skimming  fat off their more flavor proteins to prevent the crust from being a fatty sponge.  Happy Sunday everyone."

We started with queso and chips which was good. We had the works pizza. Good amount of topping on the pizza. The sauce was nice and thick but had too much oregano, too much of a string flavor. The dough is to soft, needs to have more chew to it. Overall good but not my first choice for pizza."

It supposed to be brisket, chopped jalapeños, pickled onions, and a chipotle sauce. Honestly, it was like pizza dough with pickled onions. I had trouble finding and tasting the brisket as it was non existent. The chopped jalapeños were hard to find and taste as well. There were plenty of pickled onions. To sum it up, this pizza sucked !!! I should've stuck to my favorite the Banh Mi with extra sausage and extra jalapeños. Lesson learned and money lost, such is life."

                "description": "Haven't been back to Pinthouse since Covid and since we loved the food we wanted to go back.  Glad they were busy but I have to say, while the pizzas and salads are absolutely great, the service seemed off. I know this is mostly a serve yourself model but it felt awkward standing with my family trying to see if anyone would help us find a seat. We stood there quite a while and once in a while a server would walk past us, look at us and keep walking. It would have been nice for one of them to smile and say 'sit anywhere' or something helpful. I knew I'd have to stand in line to order, then go back for refills, and finally to close out my tab. I guess the two things that chapped me most after  the seating thing was first, when we asked the server who brought our pizza for 1 more plate and fork and she said 'sure,' then never came back and second, I was presented the option to pay a tip from 15-25% when I closed out my tab. Now I almost always over tip because I'm in hospitality and try to support exceptional service. I did tip but felt it wasn't really deserved, sadly.  Outside the service issues, we will likely try it again as I know finding enough good employees is very tough now and we LOVE any restaurant that is part of the Jack Allen family because the food is SOOOOO good.  I hope owners will work on the service and keep the high quality of the food and beer.  Cheers"

I believe that the round rock location is definitely the best of the Pinthouses. Their beer selection is quite diverse, the food is just hands down amazing and there are also options such as cider, wine, hard kombucha (thanks hipsters) for non beer drinkers.   I'm struggling to think of one bad thing to say and just to say  something- it's the crowds on Friday and Saturday evenings.   I'm chuffed that this branch has gone from strength to strength; and I hope it continues to do so. As long as they're open, my Family and I shall keep visiting !!"

                "description": "Pinthouse Pizza was recommended by a bartender at another local brewery when we asked for suggestions for other places to visit while vacationing in the area. We stopped in at the Round Rock location and figured out the ordering process - order at the counter or at the bar, get a beeper, and your food is delivered to your table. If you have questions about the beer, I suggest you order at the bar. We ordered our food at the counter, but when I asked a beer question, I was referred to the bar. The bartender was very helpful. I ordered a flight and she offered some feedback on one of my choices. There was a combination of booth, bar, and common tables. We chose the common table to have the best view of the Red Sox/Yankees playoff game. Go Sox! The queso and salad came out first. The queso was good; the Italian salad was amazing. The individual salad was enough to share. The Shroomin' Pizza was very good too; I thought the crust was phenomenal and enjoyed dipping the end pieces in leftover salad dressing. The last thing I'd like to mention is how environmentally friendly this place is; paper products are compostable, pizza plates and utensils are metal. There's very little waste here! I would definitely recommend Pinthouse Pizza!"

From the moment you walk in, it's clear this spot is beloved by the locals. The crowd was a solid mix of tourists, cowboys, retirees, and working stiffs.  The tap selection is small, but they go out of their way represent Texas brews, even hosting a tap from Acopon, which is literally about 20 ft away. It's dog friendly, with a patio and a small performing space for musicians. This place just oozes history, it's definitely worth a look if you find yourself in Dripping."

Super cool owner too who I obviously know because of my tenure in this town.   The Barber Shop is so cool in fact that my wife and I chose to renew our vows there for our 10 year anniversary. Complete with a hail storm, cake balls from nearby Well Yeah Cakes, and a Elvis impersonator in his second ever appearance.   Beer is always cold; wine list is tragically minimal to the regret of my wife (think tiny bottles like near the airport). Yet, it's charms outweigh it's negative aspects. Heard these days there is a sammich outlet on site for food instead of ordering from nearby Pizza Cave or the shi*ty fried chicken at the gas station.   Biggest note here: It's little Rooster's favorite bar :)"

Yes, they have soft drinks and water as well. This is a dive bar extraordinaire so there is no need to get all decked out to hang out. There are plenty of draft and bottle beers with all the usual craft suspects and always a few surprises as well. The venue is dog and kid friendly so don't step on Fido and keep your cussin to a minimum.  Friendly patrons, good service, and a great beer selection that's the trifecta.

In the early, early, early, early days it was a gas station and my dad told me they'd stop here for gas when traveling cross country in the 50's. I love this place because it's got a great history, the building rocks (pun intended), and the beer selection should satisfy most any beer drinker; lots of variation. They also serve wine and some non-alcoholic drinks. Children are tolerated until 9 pm. There's an area out front to gather and stand, an inside area to order and sit down, and a backyard area -- some covered, some not -- with picnic tables and chairs. There's music on some nights, a great after-work vibe, and friendly atmosphere throughout. Easy Texan drinkin' and relaxin' all the way. Stop by if you're in the area."

They also offer ciders and the wine selections, while not vast, are good quality choices for the major wine categories. The beer offerings are superb. I've been coming here since they opened (5 years ago?), remains one of my favorite bars."

                "description": "This place deserves a five star review; it has a great selection of beers in a small town. The beer is cold, cheap, and the bar has a great atmosphere.   I went in last night (Tuesday/Halloween)for the first time in a long time. The World Series was on and I decided to grab a beer and hopefully see the Astros win with other Texans but... they lost. The crowd was small and friendly but I did feel like a party crasher because they all knew each other and were passing the guitar around. I hope this place hasn't turned into a towny bar because it never was in the past.   I'm going to have to go again to make sure or at least that's my excuse to go get good and affordable craft beer."

They've got space and seating for every type of group: Artificial lawn outside with corn hole and lawn chairs (we saw families congregating in this area); outside \"bar seating\" with view of multiple TVs (we sat here); tables next to heaters outside as well with view of the TVS (good for larger friend groups); seats inside for the faint of heart.  They offer pizza by the slice, half, and whole, which I thought was pretty unique.  We got the half pulled pork carbonara...chef's kiss! Very mild, comforting flavors. The runny egg yolks and perfectly cooked pork made this dish."

I'm a picky eater, I like what I like and if I don't I'm not gonna fake like I do , I've had nasty pizza before so it's possible to mess up a pizza but I played it safe with a regular pepperoni and 10/10  baby I even ate the crust (not much of a crust eater ‍) I got half pie which was 4 slices  (should have got the whole ) I also had a Cesar salad that was really good to the dressing was creamy not watery $8 for a serving great for one or you can split in two like an appetizer which is what I did everyone at my table enjoyed their pizza as well there were no complaints from anybody  Now however I did not order drinks because I'm pregnant so I can't tell you but my husband  got a house margarita and he actually got two so I guess it was good   now if you want to sit on the patio be prepared to share the space with dogs and smokers I feel they should have a designated area for the smokers on the patio it sucks for us that like to eat outside but also have to endure that smoke very inconvenient for us pregnant women as well but everything was perfect  We also got to chat with Logan he wasn't really our server but he jumped in in times as if he was he has awesome customer service he suggested beers for my father in law let him try to make sure he was satisfied my father in law even went to purchase the beer Logan introduced him to from the next door store thank you Logan for your great hospitality!"

                "description": "I've been to Toss a few times now and I have to say, I think this place is super underrated. With names like Home Slice in the area, I understand that people may forget to check out other pizza places, but if you haven't tried Toss yet, you're MISSING OUT. I've been for dinner before but the breakfast pizza has my heart. The crust is the perfect balance of crispy and soft, the topping options are endless, and there's a $15 mimosa deal (a full bottle of champagne) to wash it all down. Also, if you're a fan of ranch on pizza, their homemade ranch is unmatched.   Not only is their food good, but I am also always so impressed with the service. One time when we were in for brunch, there was also a large group that had rented out the entire outside seating area. I'm sure the team felt swamped but we couldn't even tell because we still felt like they were paying us more than enough attention. Regardless, our waitress continued to apologize for the \"slower\" service and even discounted some of our meal.   COVID Precautions: All employees and guests are required to wear masks when not seated. Seating is limited and hand sanitizer is provided."

Be sure to check their happy hour deals before going too because they have a lot of amazing offerings. Great casual environment or perfect for takeout. The indoor dinning is a little small, so if you want a table maybe make a reservation or go early. I will definitely be dining here again soon."

So often, I find sides of crispy brussel sprouts to be underwhelming. Not this one! I was absolutely wowed and Toss nailed it! Big fat brussel sprouts that were perfectly crispy + goat cheese, beets, and walnuts. Yum! Also have to give a shout-out to our server Emily. She's the only one who showed up for her shift last night, and you would have never known they were understaffed. Her boss was helping out, but even still, Emily was on top of it. Also, as far as the wings go, my fiancé gave them an 8/10. We had a great experience and will definitely be back for more wings, sprouts, and hopefully pizza too!"

Texas BBQ Brisket Pizza is a good pick. Brisket was tender, but a tad dry. Sauce was sufficient without being over sauced.  Tasted like a sliced BBQ sandwich with pickles and onions.  Yummy.  The margarita was solid. Good sauce.   The roasted veggie did not have enough goat cheese. Also the artichoke didn't go well with the rest of the vegetables. Recommend to hold that.   Only real recommendation, improve the parking. You don't really need 6 curbside pizza pickups?  Neighborhood has parking restrictions."

                "description": "Toss has recently became a top contender for me when considering where I should go for pizza.  The main thing here is they have a wide variety to choose from. For example, I got:  - Texas BBQ Brisket Pizza: what's interesting here is that their full pizzas are 20\"!! So, getting a half pie ain't no joke because it's still quite big. Smoked brisket, pickles, onions, and bbq sauce base? Yes please!  - Margherita: they allow you to do Cauliflower Crust for $3 more, so I went with that for a healthier, lighter contrast to the pizza I mentioned above.  - Hand TOSSed Wings: I was very surprised to see that they have 11 flavors to choose from. I got their Toss Sauce which is your classic \"buffalo medium\" as well as a side of their Spicy Toss Sauce to try out which has ghost peppers in them (warning: they are SPICY!). For the second flavor I got the Bacon Ranch dry rub which takes grounded bacon and mixes it with ranch seasoning - too good!   - Stuffed Pretzel: I got this as an appetizer before all the food came out and it was a great way to dive right in. It's stuffed with pepperoni and cheese. To dip, I suggest you get marinara and queso for the best of both worlds of saucey and creamy.  - Warm Brussels Sprout Salad: now you may be thinking... why go to a pizza place for a salad? I don't blame you for thinking that, however, let me put you on: this was phenomenal. It had no business being this good! Brussels, beets, goat cheese, candied walnuts, and a balsamic dressing? Phew. A MUST try!  - Smores: I wanted to get the cinnamon donut holes originally, but they ran out of cinnamon so by default I got this. They were fine, but I felt this was something I could have just made at home.  - Watermelon Press: I got this because I was looking for something refreshing. I am not big on watermelon, so I wasn't the biggest fan - but if you are, this is something you'd enjoy.  Overall, I enjoyed everything I got. The prices are fair, there's a lot of items on the menu, and the service was good. I also got to see a self-driving delivery robot come by! I had a great time and give them a strong 4/5!"

Their social media game is strong, they post specials on Instagram that are so delicious looking that I have to come right in. The weekends can get very busy with a super long wait, but they take reservations via OpenTable. Make sure to reserve at least a day in advance if you're trying to visit on a Friday or Saturday.  I love sitting outdoors because they have fans when it's hot and heaters when it's cold. And of course, I love looking at all of the patio dogs. The food and drinks are great! Oh the desserts have been fantastic as well. We look forward to being \"regulars\" here for a long time to come."

                "description": "One of new favorite sports bars in the area. Socially distant tables but still has that feel of being around people. Cool indoor outdoor areas and 15+ large TVs. They play all the games and are open pretty late.   Food is solid. Sports bar with pizza but also some healthy options and diet friendly with dishes like Brussels sprouts salad and cauliflower crust. Lots of wing sauce choices to choose as well as calzone which is tough to find in the area. Ghost pepper sauce is the real deal here and the Brussels sprout salad interesting with beets and goat cheese. Calzone came out quickly and can feed 2 people for sure. Warm and airy and comes with 3 toppings for $16.   Beer list is fine. Tons of cans but they have 3 IPA on draft including pinthouse and Zilker and they'd even like mainstays. About 8 drafts total and expect $7 max for a pint.   Lots of happy hour and deals every day of the week though to get your fill for cheaper. And you can always order a wine or mimosa or cider if beer isn't your thing. Really solid spot that checks all the boxes. They have brunch and dinner menus and online is to date other than the draft list which may change. Gets crowded quick during game days so plan ahead and make a reservation."

The crust was just plain bad tasted old and dry. I ordered a side of garlic butter that they forgot to put the top on and it spilled in the box. Don't try to call in an order because it doesn't work they don't answer their phone and then when you get there and pull up there's a website to go to that doesn't work so you have to end up going inside anyway. Not going back and wouldn't recommend."

                "description": "I had a lovely few nights stay at Lucky Arrow. We traveled with friends - 3 other couples and their kids - and stayed in a cluster of four cabins. It was the perfect pandemic vacation: we were able to socialize with our friends and still have our own spaces, without being indoors together. I don't think I'd have enjoyed it as much with strangers staying in the cabin cluster with me, especially since each pair of cabins shares a hot tub (which was delightful to relax in!) and all four cabins share a fire pit.  The rooms were clean and modern looking, the beds comfortable, and the air conditioning great. They have basic toiletries and good towels. There's very weak and unreliable wifi at the cabins; I recommend you come here to disconnect. I had good cell phone service with Verizon. The cabins have mini fridges but no kitchens; if you want to cook, you'll have to grill outside. Bring your own charcoal and lighter fluid!  For shared amenities, there's a lovely outdoor pool, and a big space with a large fire pit, grills, and picnic area with tables and swings (and some covered seating if you need shade). The pool has a 1-foot area with lounge seats, and lots of nice floats. We visited during the week, and it wasn't very busy; our group spent a lot of time at the pool and were often there by ourselves. There's a small walking trail, too.  It is quite pricey; I don't normally spend this much on a hotel. I'm not sure if I'd stay again if I weren't going on a group trip (with pandemic friendly housing.) If you're going with a group, call and see if they'll give you group pricing.  Warning for those who are planning to spend most of their time in Dripping Springs drinking: if you visit on a Monday - Tuesday, as I did, most of the wineries and breweries (including Bell Springs, which is attached to the resort) are closed."

                "description": "Very little privacy and poor management. Had a grounds keeper hop, that's right hop, on to our patio while my wife and I were changing. Wife was and is still pretty traumatized.  Took us forever to find management to let them know we are out and they told us they would pay for our room at the holiday inn. They did not.  Recommendation to LAR:  If you are going to run a wedding at your retreat, maybe consider additional help managing the facility. Only having 1 worker who is trying to run a wedding at your grounds isn't going to cut it.  * to managements response:  You want me to call you again? I'm sorry, but your response to my review makes it sound like this is the first you have heard about this incident. Is this correct? If so, this is disappointing because that tells me you have not taken steps forward to improve."

We rented one of the breezeway cabins with views+hot tub+fire pit. There was firewood at the cabin when we checked in. We had a fire and hung out in the hot tub to look at the night sky both nights. It was so quiet and relaxing, exactly what we were looking for. The breezeway cabins are beautiful and fun! The pillows, sheets, and bedding were comfy. The breezeway two-seater swing was cute to sit in while sipping coffee. It would be nice if the room with the couch and wet bar also had soap and a couple dish towels by the sink."

                "description": "Lovely glamping space close to the Hill Country and within an hour of Austin, but ludicrous pricing policies will prevent a repeat visit. This spartan campsite with tiny houses and yurts (with a bathroom space shared with pool guests) offers a close to the city getaway with minimal amenities. But with a per pet fee of $150 PER ANIMAL plus a nightly fee, they don't seem to understand how out of touch they are with pricing policies of similar establishments. With two dogs under 20lbs, you're looking at $350 just in pet fees prior to any rental rates for just two nights, and therefore Lucky Arrow won't be getting any repeat visits from us."

This was the perfect place to unwind and still feel safe during all this Covid madness.  The check in process was all online, so we didn't have to worry about social distancing.    The rooms were so adorable and you could tell they really put time into every single detail to make sure you have an amazing experience.  We were able to sit around the fire pit, have smores and enjoy the quiet starry night with no city noise or much light pollution.    The location was beyond perfect.  It's just far enough away from town that you feel like you are truly on vacation, but there was still an HEB and tons of food options within a few minutes drive.  The gated access to the winery next door was a wonderful perk.  Highly highly recommend staying here!"

                "description": "There are few things more excellent than Texas Spring, and we were delighted to spend a weekend of the best time of year out in the hill country at Lucky Arrow during their opening weekend.  There is a central event space and bar / pool area at the top of the hill with yurts as well as more conventional accommodation tucked into the trees below. We stayed in a 'courtyard cabin' one of four arranged around a fire pit with a hot tub. Which was bright and airy with the squishiest mattress, soft sheets and plenty of space to set up our travel crib for our three month old son (they also have them there if you're coming from further afield and need to borrow one)  We spent the weekend listening to live music and sipping cocktails by the pool, wandering the shady trails, admiring the view and toasting s'mores on the fire pit.   Close enough to Dripping Springs if you want supper /HEB - but far enough out that the stars are super bright and the night is gloriously quiet. They're well-behaved dog friendly, so we'll be back with our (only moderately well behaved) hound. And for a yurt, I only peeked my head inside one but I'm desperate to stay in one soon!"

Only complaints were that there was no map provided, nor customer service available, so we had to drive around and try to find outlet yurt at 10pm. Which was fine - we found it fairly quickly. Other complaint is that it looks like the person cleaning might of got distracted and left the room, without putting the ac back together or bringing her cleaning towel. Also not a huge issue.

We were able to have our team join us here (from Austin) to prepare for fall + 2020 goals.  It was the perfect mixture of pleasure and work-- we were close to wonderful Dripping Springs restaurants, wineries and distilleries.  We stayed at the Ranch House were we could spread out and work on our planning during the day and hit up the pool for a quick break. And,  you will definitely want to hit up the s'mores/fire pits because-- yum!  In the morning, we had wonderful walks on the property and even did a mediation session out on the outlook during sunrise.  Incredible.  It would be the perfect place for a wedding ceremony!  I highly recommend a trip out here- I definitely want to come back for a weekend getaway in the yurts or cabins... they are so cute!  Oh and take a dip in the hot tubs!  All in all a definite 5 out of 5-- we will definitely be back!  A huge thank you to Michele, Eva and team for their wonderful service!"

I stopped in during the week with no preconceived notions or ideas of what to expect. So what did I learn? Its a cool little craft beer bar with some great food items.  The night we came in they had a distributor there handing out all kinds of marketing swag, stickers and such. It wasn't pushy at all it was just laid back and I loved it.  The beer list now that is a headache - there's so many choices! OMG :)  It's around the corner for me and I have already stopped in about 3 times. Each visit has been the same for me - just perfect.  So far it isn't log jammed with crowds of people which I enjoy being able to sit without the typical ATX line w/a 20 min or more wait. Let's hope they are busy enough to stay around but not too much that I can't sit right away! ;)  Thanks for the great local vibe you put on guys. I love it!"

                "description": "Came back to try a few more things that had been calling my name from the menu. I realllllly wanted to try the soft pretzel because reviews were good and it looked amazing! The first few bites while it was hot were so good, but as it cooled off and I became satiated, it was just alright. I wouldn't be surprised if the cheese sauce that came with it was the same as the sauce on their macaroni and cheese. I think it tasted familiar. I gave the tomato soup another try, and it was just alright too. It's got a funny tangy metallic aftertaste. House pickles were fresh and interesting but I could only eat so much before they became overpowering. This time they included beets, green beans, and okra. I checked on their spiciness and was told they had a kick, but it wasn't too bad for me. I hate to say that the best thing I had was a free piece of Halloween candy from the bar. I really want to like this place. The owner was there most evenings and is friendly. However the food never meets expectations and is a little pricier than I'd consider appropriate."

                "description": "Popped by Hi Hat Public House on Saturday night due to the amazing reviews on Yelp. Have to admit it, I was kind of underwhelmed. The bar was sparsley populated for a Saturday night, though they did have a live band playing.  I got a Founders Solid Gold beer for $5.50 and ordered the pork belly hoagie for $12. The food came out pretty quick, but it felt like the kitchen staff wanted to get ouf of there and kind of rushed it together. It was just OK, not the kind of food I'd expect from a 4.5* establishment.  Nothing really wrong with the place, but I don't see how the ratings are so high. Perhaps there's people living in the building and they're just pleased to have a better than average bar in their building? I don't live here, so I don't know if I'll ever make it back in.  Bottom line: good bar, but so many bars in Austin, it didn't grab me as anything amazing."

For vegetarians, they have the best avocado toast I've ever had and that's coming from someone in LA where we are as basic as it gets. I've also had their shrimp benedict that is not currently on their menu which is so yummy. Lastly, I usually don't like micheladas but they make the best!! The mix is homemade and it taste like perfection with the new Zilker rice beer. Thank you!"

                "description": "We were walking around on what was quite possibly the rainiest weekend this year so far and went to another place which had a 30-45 minute wait time. We walked around thinking we'll have to go back to our friend's apartment and drive somewhere when we ended up at this place purely by happenstance.   The good, the bad, and the ugly:  The good: The presentation of the food is so pleasing to the senses. Just as pleasing as it is to look at it, it is equally pleasing to your taste buds. I substituted my chips for the beets and oh boy, what a great a choice that was! The guy taking the order (Oh, btw, you have to order at the bar) told me that some people don't like them because they taste too earthy. I have never understood how people cannot enjoy eating beets. The highlight of the entree was supposed to be the portobello mushroom burger served on a bed of creams with some guacamole and aioli but the side of beets totally took the center stage. The vinaigerette they were sitting in when mixed with the cheese totally elevated the dish and give it so much dimension once you really mix it in together. You really want to take pictures and tell your food that this one is for the gram. I'll let the photos speak for themselves  The bad: Portions are a little bit on the smaller side but that could possibly be because we have huge portions in Houston. Or that I have a food addiction. No one else seemed to have that problem so you can just ignore the last statement. But, the service was a little lacking even though the restaurant was pretty empty.   The ugly: This does not necessarily apply to me but my friend is a vegan and they don't carry soy milk. Their reasoning, we put it out but no one used it and we were throwing it away. Solution could be, just give it to people who ask for it?!  I think, overall, we had a really good time over here. The food was great. On Sundays, they have live music where we were told that the music doesn't get so loud that you are not able to hold a normal conversation."

Parking is street and WiFi available. Free music co Stanton with a stage literally in the corner ready to go on short notice. Specials daily and happy hour until 7pm on Tuesday through Thursday. Food looked good but I was here for the beer. Fresh draft line makes me happy so no complaints here. One TV and friendly service. Floor and tables clean and although loud it's not in your head intrusive. Really can't ask for much more from a neighborhood bar."

                "description": "Rolled in here for the first time on Saturday afternoon and had my eye on their reuben. I was NOT disappointed! They brine their corned beef for 11days and it is juicy, crumbly perfection! The kraut they use is actually on par as well, w/the perfect balance of sweet and sour.  I am not gonna lie, the reuben here might just hold a candle to my all-time ATX fav at Waller. They are different stylistically, but both hold their own.  While I was here Saturday, I did their little sampler pour of one of my fav high abv beers, Wake up Dead on nitro by Left Hand. It was just what I wanted. At 10.2%, doing a full pour is a bit much, but their little $3 sampler was perfection.   I also discovered their \"Wine Wednesdays\" during my Saturday visit and after the gracious bartender Phil (who I have affectionately nicknamed \"GreenBay\") let me sample their 1000 Stories Bourbon Barrel Aged Zin. I was smitten from first whiff and in full lust after the first sip. I knew I had to return to make a half price $44 btl mine!  As luck would have it, my schedule allowed me to come in on the following Wed. I am not going to lie, I was so looking forward to doing damage to a bottle of a 1000 Stories all by my lonesome. However, because my \"luck\" has always been spelled w/a capital \"F\", they had just sold their last btl of 1KStories when I walked in. I was heartbroken. But, the wonderfully empathetic staff here not only let me sample the Substance Cab (it was a lovely cab, but I had my heart set on the BB-aged Zin!) before offering me a glass from the last open btl at HH pricing. GreenBay even let me kill what little remained at the end of the night. Great service will always make or break any experience, in my opinion.  It was busier than usual due to it being ATX Beer Week, but even the patrons at this place were gracious. There was not a seat to be had in the house and this kind man at the bar let me have the very tightly squeezed-in seat next to him.  BTW, the reuben here is so nice I had to have it twice! It was just as perfectly delicious the 2nd time as it was the first.  I will definitely be back the next chance I get for another attempt at Wine Wednesday and anytime I need an old school reuben fix. So glad I discovered this place, its vibe, and wonderful staff!"

                "description": "First off, we wasn't planning to come here but looked what was in the area and this place popped up. When you go in, the area is a bit small. You can grab a menu off the wall and then order from the bar. They have a few chairs for bar seating and about 6 tables inside varying from a two seater to a six seater, and there are about 3-4 tables outside and then a bar top around the patio. If it is pretty warm, I would definitely recommend sitting inside. They said that this was the busiest they'd been so food took longer to come out than usual 30 min-1 hour. It was definitely worth the wait! I ordered the eggs Benedict with a cilantro sauce on top and it had chorizo as well! It was greatly prepared and was the perfect amount of food. The biscuits and gravy are also pretty darn good! You can pick how you want your eggs with it, and it also comes with bacon. We only did self serve water, but our total was $26...in the halfway mark price range. WORTH IT THOUGH! The staff are polite and try to do everything to accommodate you and keep up with other customers/work. The only reason I knocked off a star is due to the seating inside, making it hard to fit everyone!"

                "description": "Hipside Peddler was way more fun than anticipated! I went on the East Side Ride with a group of friends and Max really took care of us. He was very personable, patient and flexible with how we spent the allotted time. It was a great outing and a very different experience!  On the evening I went it was just our smaller group on the tour so we had full control of the jams, cooler and schedule. We definitely held up traffic a bit when on some of the main roads but the motorists and bystanders we came across waved and cheered us on. Thankfully there is a motor on board so it's not necessary to be fully exerting yourself peddling.  Recommend for a fun activity. Ask for Max!"

                "description": "Hipside Peddler is such a FUN thing to do because it is not every day that we get to ride around Austin on an electric assisted bar on wheels, while sippin' on an alcoholic beverage that makes you feel a little bit prettier and blasting your favorite music so loud, that you think you're at the club!! ;))   Sounds fun, right?! :))   Trust me, you WILL for sure get points for creativity if you book a tour w/ Hipside Peddler to celebrate a special occasion.   We booked the \"Eastside tour\" w/ Hipside Peddler on Saturday, 11/14/2020 to celebrate my friends 40th birthday and we had so much FUN! This was my 1st time so I had no idea what to expect but I can say that I am so glad that we were able to safely celebrate my friend's milestone birthday during this time of pandemic craziness.   Since sharing is caring here are a few of my \"Helpful Tips\", \"FYIs\", and \"Likes\"...  FYI:  *You will be peddling the same way you would if riding a bike so be mindful of your foot wear and you will be getting a mini workout while peddling.    *There are mini fans above each seat that you can turn on, if needed.   *The peddle boat driver does have a plexiglass barrier between him and the passengers as a COVID safety precaution and the peddle boat itself is all open w/out any walls.   *You can tip your peddling boat driver in cash and via Venmo.   *The \"Eastside\" tour is 2 hours long and we made 3 separate stops at different local bars for 15-20 mins each so you can use the restroom, cool off, take a few pictures w/ your peeps and/or buy a drink while relaxing at each bar.   Our awesome peddle boat driver was Matt and he also made a 4th stop at an Italian ice truck.   *Each passenger must submit a liability waiver and you can do it electronically. Once your tour has been booked, you will get the waiver emailed to you.   Helpful Tip(s): *BEVERAGES~I recommend that you bring your own ice chest already filled w/ ice and beverages (no glass containers are allowed) and there is an open area in the middle of the peddle boat for ice chest storage.  *FOOD~only snacks are allowed and I suggest you bring snacks that are easy to munch on since you will be peddling while eating them. ( ex: mini bags of pretzels, individually wrapped cookies)  *MUSIC~The peddle boat does have a stereo system that is very loud and has a usb that you can connect your phone to for music. I highly recommend that you create a music playlist of songs that help set the vibe that you're going for.   I made a playlist using Spotify of all the songs I wanted to play.   Lastly, I just wanted to give a huge shout out to Matt, who was our p.d driver because he really did a GREAT job of explaining \"all things peddle boat\" :) and putting us at ease so we could fully enjoy ourselves. This was so appreciated because each of us were newbie peddle boat passengers.   Stay AWESOME Hipside Peddler and for sure I'll be seeing you again very soon!   ~Rebecca out"

We brought our own personal favorites: music, snacks and wine, but also enjoyed the food and bevs of the places we stopped. A few of our pit stops included: Grackle, Zilker Brewing Co., Yellow Jacket Social Club, and Lazarus Brewing Company. Our guide, Rachel, was fun, full of energy and took great care of our party!   I would definitely recommend this little adventure/bar hopping tour to anyone looking for a good time for a special occasion, or just something fun to do with friends in the city!"

We booked the day before our tour with no problems (it helped we were a full sized tour on our own) and we had a blast. We visited three locations: Yellow Jacket Social Club (dive bar), Zilker Brewing Co, and Lazarus Brewing Co. we were able to spend an hour at each of the first two locations and a little less than 30 min at Lazarus. You are able to bring your own beer for consumption on the peddler. Also - bring a phone with music - an aux cord is available. It rained during our ride but it was still very enjoyable. The peddler even offered us each a poncho to stay dry. Definitely recommend the peddle tavern if you're in town with friends/bachelor/bachelorette party."

                "description": "You just can't make this shit up people lol!!  Very disappointed with our experience. Went to Austin for a bachelorette party. Was looking forward to this being a highlight of our trip. First bar was very empty and very sketchy. In the middle of a not so welcoming neighborhood (even our Uber driver afterwards confirmed we were not in a good part of town). We left our first stop about 10 minutes in due to it being a total bust. On our way to the second stop our bike started making loud clicking noises. Our driver looked like he was trying to get the motor on board to work by pushing his pedal down over and over and that didn't work either. He tried to tell us we weren't pedaling hard enough and that it was our fault the bike wouldn't move so he was just going to skip right to the last bar.... only about 30-45 minutes into our trip. That didn't seem right. Bike ended up completely stopping in a very uncomfortable area. We had a few homeless men try hitching a ride and both bachelorette parties on board had their brides pushing the bike from behind just to get it off the street. Keep in mind, we had several CrossFit competitors on board who could not get the bike to move when pedaling. Shouldn't have been an issue considering they squat double their own weight. I've been on several trips in different places and never had an issue moving the bikes I've been on even up small hills. Our party decided we would end our experience with this bike and Uber to Rainey street which was AWESOME. But this company refuses to refund us and claims the bike was in perfect working condition. There's just no way! I'm attaching a few photos of what we documented. It's something we are laughing about now that it's been a few days but we were very upset when it happened. Also, our driver/ guide didn't help at all when we were telling him that the homeless people were trying to hitch a ride on the back. And our bike was decked out in Pizza Hut signs as if they were being sponsored. All around, most uncomfortable, unprofessional, and shady experience any of us have ever had. I do highly recommend Rainey street for anyone visiting from out of town, but avoid this company at all costs. We all (both bachelorette parties that ditched our tour) had a blast on Rainey street, but hated this tour!!!"

We arrived right at opening and found SoCo Gingerbeer. The girl (maybe late 20's early 30's) did not acknowledge our presence as we were the first and only potential customers. She was also extremely unprepared. After a couple minutes standing there waiting on her (she was adding ice into the large containers) she FINALLY spoke to us. \"It will be a few minutes\" she said brashly. No smile , no welcome, it was as if we were inconveniencing her.   I felt uncomfortable and completely unwelcome but we stayed because our littles were thirsty.   Finally, after 10 minutes after opening, this gal was ready for us and she gave us samples upon our request. Also, zero empathy or apology for making us wait on her.   The samples were as hot or hotter than the temperature outside and really off putting. She sampled some hot ginger beer herself and remarked to herself in a gloating manner how great it was. It was a joke. She had a huge chip on her shoulder. Perhaps having a bad day, but I have worked years of customer service and you NEVER take it out on your customers. So unprofessional.   The customers thereafter us (a mom with two young girls) were also waiting on this chic and not treated with a welcome as well, unfortunately. The entire time, actually, this employee never cracked a smile or had any intentions of carrying out at the least, mediocre customer service. It was appalling and quite bothersome.   Suffice to say, we left. And I wonder how many others she has turned away."

I went to the Lakeline Farmers Market on a hot day and was very pleasantly surprised how refreshing and delicious the Beet Ginger Beer was great.

I got an inside word from the young lady Elaine at the booth that they are going to serve a prickly pear flavor next weekend. This time I'm going to pick up two bottles.

We got a cup, and tried the other on tap, jalapeño lime and the extra ginger- all good (though I don't like the flavor of sweet jalapeños) but hibiscus was my favorite. After downing it we went to the car and got our growler and went back to get some to go. Hibiscus was sold out so we did the extra ginger and it was soooo spicy and good. Kudos to them, they're doing good work in their ginger beer."

                "description": "I really wanted to like this place - as I need a local cigar shop- but you cannot overlook their blatant disregard for local COVID requirements.   First, the shop is quaint and located in a very cool shopping area off of HWY 12. They also have a decent selection of classic and unique cigars. That is the positive.   However, they are selfishly thumbing their nose at COVID regulations. The staff does not wear masks or require patrons to wear them when they are up and about. There is absolutely no social distancing and it is usually packed to overflowing on weekends.   When a business refuses to abide by local and state guidelines in something as serious and life-threatening as COVID, it makes you question where else they ignore health and safety protocols. I do not trust that they keep their shop or the tobacco products safe and sanitary if they are unwilling to adhere to these basic guidelines. This should be a MASSIVE red flag for anyone thinking of shopping here.   I do not trust an establishment with this mindset, nor the local authorities that refuse to enforce these rules. It is shameful."

We quarantined with each other for months. We stayed 6 feet away from one another. I know; I was there nearly every day. It's difficult for any business who had to navigate the tricky waters of early 2020's pandemic onslaught. It was new territory for everyone and significantly different messages coming from authorities in the \"know\".  And with all that being said, you have a fairly recently opened small business trying to survive.  IMHO, anyone hating on this establishment is welcome to stay away.    Great cigars, great beverages, great community support. Don't change a thing.  Levi"

When by pure coincidence I met a couple who I have not seen in years. We mentioned that we had cigars but it was too windy to smoke em. They said there was a chill cigar bar right up the street. We watched Tiger make a par on 18 and off we went.  We were greeted immediately by Allison, the manager, and given a quick tour of the venue. There are comfy seats and a small bar area that serves beer, wine, and water. The humidor is laid out very well and their cigars are stored perfectly. Allison patiently explained that there are two sections in the humidor the usual favorites and \"her\" boutique cigars. I selected a beautiful light Nicaraguan rolled cigar. This baby smoked smooth right down to the label.   The lounge itself is ventilated nicely so you are not smoking in a haze or smoking your cigar and other guys cigar as well. There was also a good beer selection. We had a blonde ale from Two Wheel Brewery in Buda. Good choice.   Smokey's is a chill venue, friendly patrons, and professional knowledgeable staff equal 5 stars all day!"

I love that many of the cigars in the humidor are made by guys in Texas, especially the ones by a veteran who lives nearby. How cool is that? Make sure you talk to Allison too. She gives you the low down of every cigar and helps you find the perfect one for you. She's really nice and very helpful in her descriptions. My husband and I are looking forward to a date night at Smokey's."

We thought their airstream would be a fun \"man cave\" addition to an otherwise very feminine wedding...boy were we misguided! Half the bridal party and many of our female guests ended up checking out the cigar bar and loved it! As a woman, I feel like creating a space where women feel welcome in what is traditionally considered a masculine space is a clear indicator of the quality and professionalism of their business.  Not only was Chris helpful, very communicative and and priced well - he and his wife were so much fun to be around! They both made our day special and unique and I highly recommend them for events. They definitely went above and beyond to ensure the day was special and went smoothly.   The airstream itself is luxuriously appointed and classy. Their cigar storage and bar amenities were top notch and I'm sure their huge tv would be great for sports games and such. Definitely a fantastic addition to my big day and I'd highly recommend them!"

I got the Po-Po. This was basically a BLT but they put an amazing garlic mayo spread on it. I think the best combination is to have it on wheat bread. It was so stellar that as I finished and looked up, my bf and two friends were only halfway done eating! Definitely going back to this place!

                "description": "On a recent trip to Austin upon arriving around lunch time we checked into our AirBnB and were in need of some lunch quickly!  Our AirBnB host recommended Gourmands as a good local spot.  We headed over and found there was plenty of parking and it was very quiet on a random weekday around lunchtime.  I like their system of scanning the menu and just ordering from the table, however it was sort of odd to not interact with anyone upon entering.  The only real greeting we received was from someone poking their head out of kitchen to let us know we could sit anywhere and order with the QR code. I imagine that would be a but different when the restaurant is more crowded though. We ordered some soup in a bread bowl and a couple sandwiches.  The food was promptly brought to us.  The bread bowl was awesome, along with the chili.  The sandwiches were also good, high quality bread and everything on the sandwich tasted very fresh!  Gourmands was a solid place to get some fresh food quickly without having to wrestle with parking and lines in some of the more populated areas of Austin. Good lunch spot!"

                "description": "Gourmands is one of my favorite takeout places in Austin. I usually get the Second Deadly Sin with fresh avocados. The salads can be weird, and I'm not a fan of the soup+bread bowls, but conceptually they are interesting.   Eating in at Gourmands is more fun if you go alone. The atmosphere is very traditional pub, so if you're seated at the bar having a meal and your drink, you'll almost always find good conversation. It's less fun to go with someone for a sit down meal, as it really is more of a bar than a restaurant, even though the food is pretty good. Quirky's not exactly the right word. It's idiosyncratic, and kind of addicting?   After Thoughts for Advanced Listeners: I want to be at a place in my journey where I can eat a Cleopatra and not feel I'm missing out on meat."

                "description": "I really wish I loved this place more because I was so excited to bread bowls, but it fell really short of my expectations. My friend and I sat in the outdoor patio area, and there were so many empty tables with eaten food left on the tables that hadn't been cleared yet. Summer is coming, so there were a ton of flies that were attracted to the food that eventually came to bother us when our food arrived.   My friend and I ordered spinach and artichoke dip to share, and I had the clam chowder and Deadly Sin sandwich combo. Firstly, the spinach and artichoke dip had so much cream cheese in it that it didn't taste like artichoke or spinach. It was really thick and gloppy, and I felt heavy just eating it. My clam chowder was really lacking in the clam flavor, and it also wasn't that good. The sandwich was okay. Nothing special about it.   I am pretty sad that I didn't love this place because prices aren't terrible, and the concept of soup in bread bowls is awesome. Not many places in Austin serve that. However, they seem really understaffed and the food itself isn't good enough to warrant a second trip."

                "description": "A combo lunch that doesn't skimp on portions for only $10?!? Hot dog! Well, more like hot soup and sandwich or salad (no hot dogs on the menu).   The soup is served in a bread bowl (French bread, not sourdough!) and they have four or five options. I went with the broccoli and cheese which was more like queso with a few chunks of broccoli in it, but heck, maybe Gourmands knows me better than I know myself, as that's probably what I really wanted anyhow! I scarfed it down and had to stop myself from eating the entire bowl of bread. The chicken salad sandwich was lovely, but because I went full hungry girl on the soup (and homemade chips), I didn't eat it until the next day for lunch. Again, a lot of combo for your buck!  The place definitely blends in with the neighborhood, it's dive-y looking on the inside with a bunch of cheerful regulars at the bar (also the type of establishment you'd see a baby on a hip and a beer in hand), a TON of tables and booths for groups, and ping pong and skee-ball in the back. They've got a small parking lot, too."

I was pleasantly surprised by how bomb the sandwiches are here; I think the chips are homemade too , which is a big plus.   My group of friends started coming here pretty frequently and it's definitely a good place to chill; they have ping pong, ski ball, arcade games...it's everything someone would want in a bar experience!"

We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip which we always do and it was literally milk with artichokes it was pretty gross. Then it took over an hour to get our soups and sandwiches. THEN on top of that i ordered the royal and they gave me mushrooms instead of meat (which I didn't order). I did tell the waiter and all he said was sorry(didn't offer to fix it). It sucks but i don't think i'll be returning there which is a shame bc i tell all my friends and always speak so highly about it."

                "description": "I am a person who loves a good pub. Dark inside with regulars bellied up to the bar and not a high turnover rate within the wait staff. That's this kind of place.   I can see this place being an awesome, standard spot to grab a drink with regulars on any given day or night, but what we came in for was their highly-rated bread bowl soups and dang - they don't disappoint. The bread was soft and the perfect consistency - sturdy yet edible, which I feel is hard to come by with bread bowls. They offer a lot of great lunch options, like a soup and salad, sandwich and salad, or salad and soup. I went with the cobb salad and their black bean soup. To be fair, the server did warn me the soup was spicy, but I was definitely sweating a bit while sipping this delicious soup. The bread was a wonderful compliment to the spice and really soaked it up so I could keep going back for more!  On the way out, we noticed a room in the back with skee ball. Yep, we will be back for sure."

They have a great outdoor patio surrounding a gorgeous tree. I absolutely loved my spicy loaded Bloody Mary, it brought me back to life. I really appreciated their drink menu in general, I mean they had Jell-O shots! Yes please! I will be back for that when I'm in a boozier mood. The food was great, it was hard to pick as so many sandwiches looked good. We went with the bacchus, Texas chili, the second deadly sin, and clam chowder in a bread bowl. The plates came with chow chow and house chips. We ate up every bite! I'll be back for sure, and next time I'm getting a Jell-O shot!"

                "description": "First, their hours of operations is beyond the usual \" close at 9 or 10 pm\", as working late hours loved this.  Second, while a very small choice of items on menu, they are very diverse.  Third, as mentioned in other reviews, service is casual/slow. But the staff is really friendly and I wasn't in a hurry.  Fourth, the portion and quality of food is excellent. I highly recommend the clam chowder. The chicken tortilla salad was good, but it was unexpectedly spicy.  Fifth, you would normally pay twice the amount at lesser restaurants. 2 local draughts, soup, full salad $24.   So, drop by. I know I will be returning.  My Star Ratings:  1 Star - my experience was majorly disappointing. Recommend keep searching for another establishment. 2 Stars - Unlikely for me to return.  3 Stars - OK. Open to coming back, but wouldn't go out of my way to.  4 Stars - Really good! This is worth sharing the experience so others will want to try the place. 5 Stars - WOW! You really need to make sure you try this place out, worth planning your day / travels to go there.  If you are curious why I have so many 4 and 5 star ratings, it is because I tend to only seek Yelp reviews at this level."

                "description": "I had come across the Beer Museum via a local blog I follow and I initially thought it was going to be one of those lame things that Austin tries to make sound cool and innovative, but turns out to be an overhyped hipster disappointment. I was so glad I was so wrong!  First off, the idea of the Beer Museum is just fantastic! A friend who is adverse to anything museum related actually enjoyed the lil displays and info-snippets when we got to experience the Beer Museum at WhichCraft. So, if you are a beer nerd, then this is the kinda thing that will capture your interest.  Second, there is not a brick n mortar location as of yet (however, you can help make that a reality by donating on the website), so as of now, this place is completely mobile. You can see where their next location will be on their website as well.  Third, Matt and Virginia, the founders and curators of this beertastic brainchild are two of the nicest people you will meet and it was great talking beer with them. Some of the beer memorabilia they had on display was just awesome!  Fourth, you can purchase Beer Museum gear and spread the gospel. Since purchasing and sporting my Beer Museum shirt, I have gotten stopped and asked about it more times than someone wearing a tshirt probably should.  So yeah, check them out and support a beer cause!"

It was crazy packed on a Friday evening but they had plenty of seating indoors and outdoors!  We ordered the Foccacio cheese sticks (basil, mozzarella and goat cheese) - a hit for us when we ordered to go previously. We also tried something different which was the Monty. We also ordered a Caesar salad- pricey for a salad in my opinion but this is a good option if you feel like you need that balanced meal!  The Monty was the least of my favorite. We have stuck to ordering the Flying Garlic Pizza after our first visit and it never disappoints. It has become a must order for us and will continue to stay that way!"

                "description": "This is the worst experience I have had in awhile with management. To begin, with follow my pics.. I ordered a major tom (supreme pizza) with EXTRA sauce thru door dash. At 7:55 within a few min I received notification it was being picked up.  I call store to inquire how is that possible if it was freshly made. The store hung up on me. So, I worked w door dash who asked me to wait for delivery to see if there is a quality issue. I did just that, only to receive a pizza that was warm but based on the cheese amount, semi chilled veggies I knew I wasn't too off base when I had my reservations about it to begin with.  I call store - ask for manager, even though I know door dash will ultimately handle. However, I just wanted to know how you can make a pizza in 5 min and say its fresh. Manager says sorry for the hang up like she's singing to a tune of a tiny violin; then tells me they don't have base pizzas sitting around (kind of like Villa in the mall that adds toppings when u order). I ask why is there so much cheese then and no sauce. Clearly cheese is added and is already rubbered up. Short answer and ultimate answer from her was another unbelivable sorry and to work with door dash.   What's sad here..Villa Pizza (mall pizza) is better than this any day. And I'm kicking myself for not going with Salvation pizza instead. Aviator down south was awesome but this Parmer Lane site is lacking customer skills and good pizza."

                "description": "2nd favorite pizza in Austin!  I love pizza. If I were choosing my last meal it would be a toss up between pizza and beer or filet mignon and merlot (or Shiraz). I digress...pizza...it must have a great crust-never EVER soggy, a well-balanced sauce, and just the right amount of cheese. Lastly, the maker must not skimp on the chosen toppings.  Well done, Aviator! My friend and I shared the \"pizza of the day\", and it was fabulous (though I don't remember the name of it). The crust had that initial crunch followed by the perfect chewiness. We each had a light beer with hints of blueberry-um...yummy!  Aviator is new to this location, and still getting established, so it was dead inside. I suspect this will be a popular lunch place for nearby companies such as Apple, Oracle, etc. There is a huge outside play area for those of you who have kiddos-great for birthday parties.  I prefer quieter places, so it misses the mark for me regarding atmosphere. You can see the pizza makers through a glass window, and the kitchen appeared clean. There are ample choices of beer and lots of great food options too. I've been twice and suspect it will be a fav of mine. Give it a try. Let me know what you think."

Aviator has a wide selection of beers (at least from what I could tell). I think the pizza is good but unfortunately I think there are better places for pizza. Weirdly, I think their normal pies (with red sauce) are kind of lackluster. I did enjoy their non-traditional pies. The chicken bacon ranch and the taco pizza were pretty great!"

I ordered two items: the caprese salad and the black olive and caprese pesto grinder.   Caprese-  Caprese salad is a simple Italian salad, made of sliced fresh  mozzarella, tomatoes, and sweet basil, seasoned with salt, olive oil, or  balsamic vinaigrette. This is a menu item that really can't be 'messed up'. It is simple and to the point. This caprese was accompanied by a side of vinaigrette.  Black Olive and caprese pesto grinder-  This item was unexpectedly good. This meatless Monday treat contained black olives, mozzarella, red onions, baby spinach, and a Roma tomato pesto base. This sandwich provided a balanced mixture of sweet (from the tomatoes and red onions) slightly sour (from the mozzarella) and earthy (from the pesto) bites. Although hearty in its contents, this sandwich was actually very light on the palate.   #supportlocal"

                "description": "Happy to see a local pizzeria that's in NW Austin and dare I say better than Pinthouse? Two 14 inch / Large pizzas are enough for 3-4 people which amounts to $50 approximately. Pricing is reasonable. Online ordering is straightforward and pick up time is 20-30 minutes after an order is placed. I noticed they had ample seating both indoors and outdoors.   Our personal favorites include: 1. Flying Garlic: Garlic butter base, fresh baby spinach, roasted garlic, grilled chicken, feta and crushed red peppers. 2. The Greek: Pesto base, kalamata olives, portobella mushrooms, artichoke, feta and fresh basil 3. Spinach and Artichoke: Red sauce base, fresh baby spinach, artichoke, and feta cheese.   Another pizza we tried was called \"South Austin\" (Red sauce base, prosciutto, goat cheese, wild arugula tossed in our home made honey balsamic wine vinaigrette) was also good but not as tasty as the other three.  The crust was the perfect level of crunchiness without being overly done. Toppings were all fresh and VERY generous. We came back a second time in the same week. It's that good."

                "description": "On this deliciously lazy Sunday, the darling husband and I knew that pizza was just the only thing that would do. Jersey Giant Pizza, he suggested? Quick, easy, cheap, and reliably tasty. Closed on Sundays, I lamented. DeSano's, I countered? His eyes lit up, but then I remembered that, although we adore DeSano Pizzeria Napoletana to bloody distraction, we should probably try something brand-new for a little variety...and for me to review! Why not? Enter Aviator Pizza and Drafthouse!  Local? Check! Solid reviews? Check. Hubby's a helicopter pilot and trying out this place is, therefore, too hard to resist? Check. Cute pizza names? Check. Yummy pictures? Check. Let's do this!   (Note: all three are takeout 9-inch pies with no mods, except for hubby's deletion of the green peppers on his Ground Control.)  The Greek: this one was my flavor profile to an ABSOLUTE T! It reminded me a bit of Joe's Pizza at Star Pizza in Houston, but better! A riotous feta, pesto, artichoke, basil, mushroom, and kalamata olive party on a crust! Hugely flavorful! This goes on the culinary Rolodex post-haste!    The Flying Garlic: very garlicky! Shocker, right? Lol! Well, we are garlic people, so we endorse this pie whole-heartedly! The buttery crust, the garlic cloves, and the feta were just unctuous!   Ground Control (minus green peppers): Hubby liked this, but he didn't super-love it. He kept snagging pieces of the Greek and the Flying Garlic. I asked him what his least favorite part was, and he said that it really wasn't fair to judge it on such a small pie. He wants to give it one more shot with a larger pizza! His theory is that small pizzas make the fillings hard to shine. Makes sense!   As I write this, though, he's literally humming Ground Control to Major Tom as he kicks back on the couch playing Call of Duty: Cold War with a warm and happy belly, so I consider this a solid win. We'll definitely be back soon to dine in! Thanks, Aviator!"

                "description": "I've passed by Aviator several times and finally decided to try it with a friend.  We came at 8pm and the place was fairly busy. Unfortunately, the ordering process itself was very confusing. You can either follow a bunch of arrows to the counter and order (with few menus available), or you can seat yourself and order through a QR code and have someone bring your food to you.  We chose to go to the counter and ordered two Bear King beers that had great flavor- we were allowed to sample before ordering which was a plus. There were 50+ beers/wines to choose from so endless options... you can opt for a flight too. We also ordered two small pizzas (BBQ Chicken and Spinach and Artichoke) that came out in ~10 minutes. The pizzas had a thicker crust and were DELICIOUS! I'd definitely order again.   There were plenty of picnic style tables inside and out, and the outdoor patio had beautiful string lights, a playground, umbrellas, and lots of open space. Parking is easy in and easy out, and the staff were friendly.  Overall, I'd recommend Aviator. Great quality pizza in North Austin."

I had my favorite type of pizza: jalapeno peppers, banana peppers, and mushrooms, with vegan cheese.  The cashier was warm, enthusiastic, and friendly.    The portions satisfy.  The tap water is delicious.    I don't have kids, but if you have kids, realize they have a huge playground outside.    A delicious meal.  Yum."

I picked this place solely on my fellow yelpers reviews. They were spot on! I didn't go in as I was in a hurry and opted for curbside. I ordered both the Pepperoni and Basil pizza, as well As the grilled chicken bbq pizza. Both were amazing, especially the pepperoni basil. I now have my go to pizza place for my cheat day when I don't feel like driving all the way down to via 313, pieous, or home slice."

My husband and mom loved it but I felt they could do morr flavorwise with all the fun ingredients they had going on.

I arrived a little after the estimated pick up time and waited a little over 10 minutes when a waitress came to our window and said they got one of the pizzas wrong and had to remake it. We ended up waiting another 15-20 minutes. Finally we received the pizzas, but they didn't not bring our ranch, which did cost extra so I asked if we could get those. The waitress was obviously annoyed by our request and went to get the then which took another 5 minutes. Pizza was cold by the time we arrived home. Pizza was still very good, but the thin crust was very oddly cut. I would not recommend ordering curbside or online"

After two other parties got their pizza before us after we were first I finally went to the front and complained. My pizza was on the side in a Togo box just sitting there. I said um is that mine cold just sitting there? The girl said oh I'm not sure sorry.    I was also charged a crazy amount for two small pizzas that a five year old could have made better.

I'm not sure if she was family of someone working there, but it was awkward that they let her ask for money and since she never left the table we felt pressured to donate money to her with no idea who she was or if she was actually using the money for the purpose she said.

So I finally got to the both still not being serviced properly. I waited 30 minutes before I got up and went to the front and asked \" So IS ANYBODY GOING TO SERVICE ME\" ?

He wa seated righ next to us. We got up to leave and let the manager know why we were leaving and she acted like she could care less.

                "description": "It was a pretty pleasant Sunday evening for me. I got out of work after being positively complimented throughout the day, just feeling pretty damn fucking good today. I decided to take a nap, then of course decided to get food to celebrate my day. I went on to take a nice hot shower, freshened myself up, and went out for food.   Initially, I was planning on going to Cheddar's but that wait time there was way too long. We're talking 45 minutes. I haven't eaten all day by the way. You know what was close by though? Bombshells. What was the wait time? 5-10 minutes. I wondered why but I didn't question it. It's kind of like when you need to take a shit, and you're just hoping to go to a nice restroom. Anyway, I was pretty surprised.  There was a younger woman who was the waitress our table. First thing she asked was the drinks we wanted. \"Three waters please.\" I was then asked for my card right away which was fucking weird as shit as I didn't receive any food yet, nor did I get an order placed for food. I just sat there and started to ponder a bit. We get the waters but no offering of a straw for our waters, which I also thought was odd. Not really working out the way I'd like for my first time actually dining in.   NASCAR was on for a bit on the TV monitor screen, and then it changed to Women's soccer for the Summer Series (GO USA!). We finally get an order in. I ordered the Grilled Tilapia entree with Alfredo sauce smothered on, steamed broccoli, and Spicy Mac 'n' Cheese. The thing was that the poor waitress didn't even know that there was an option to top the tilapia with Alfredo sauce and shrimp. She mistook it that I wanted to do two different dishes. I'm just like, \"I can guarantee something will be wrong.\" I kept quiet for a bit because I was pretty annoyed.  The food comes out. No shrimp on my dish. Eh, fine. I proceeded to eat the food and it was pretty decent. I liked the Alfredo sauce a lot. The Spicy Mac 'n' Cheese was okay at best. The steamed broccoli was good. I noticed one thing the entire hour being there--I've never once was asked for a refill on my drink, nor were we properly catered to with the courtesy of asking how everything was during the feasting of the food. I'm now really annoyed and frustrated.   The more I noticed things, I observed other tables and waitresses actually having an interaction with each other. The waitress at my table could have given two fucks about my guests and I. Cold shoulder was given to us several times, with the same waitress kissing the asses of the table served behind me to patrons that came in after we did. She was also missing for extended periods of time.  Little did she know, I actually am a frequent high-tipping gentleman with a whole lot of damn money to blow. Sadly though, she dropped the ball highly. I guess it could have been the way I looked or the stereotype that I may not be worth the time to serve--who the hell knows? What I do know is that I was still nice enough to offer a 15% tip even after all of the shitty service provided. I was thinking about stiffing her but thought to myself, \"I think she is new, and they've probably thrown her to the wolves.\" Mind you, we had to let her know that the ticket was wrong. That shouldn't be something on our end to do but we did because we knew something was already wrong to begin with. First impressions are EVERYTHING, baby.  I'll make it known that having a pretty face ain't going to cut it in a face-to-face customer service field. That has to be backed up with a great demeanor, capability, efficiency, eagerness to perform on the job, and always a solid first impression. This young lady needs to be trained more, and I think it's at the fault of the actual restaurant not properly training staff that I'm seeing all of these shit reviews about the service alone. My ass got to experience that instead of the positive side.   I'm extremely disappointed and just hope Bombshells fixes their BS quickly. This restaurant can be more than just the typical chain, especially if it was better ran with its employees. I don't fault the waitress for not knowing better because for all I know--this can be her first serving gig. However, this spot missed the mark highly. Easily, I'm a customer that can bring numerous guests with me, ordering items on tickets of several hundreds of dollars a sitting quite easily. Not going to happen now after all of the mishaps this evening. I'd rather drink bleach.  .5 stars/5 Stars: Absolute abomination. I certainly doubt that I would ever come back to this spot. I would rather serve life in prison in Angola than come back to this spot."

First of all I guess they didn't get the memo that we are in a pandemic since the rent a cops weren't wearing mask or enforcing the rule to   customers coming in and out of the establishment.  They were to worried about flirting with the waitresses.  I get it..they are kind of cute but come on..do your job!  Also there were about 9 of them working last night and only three were wearing their mask correct or even at all.  The bartender had hers around her neck the whole time while breathing directly over your food...smh..very disappointing. The wings themselves were okay but nothing to go back for.

Got seated and literally waited there for 15 minutes and still no server. I walked down to where the kitchen was, poked my head in and said hey can we get a server for our table. A girl came by afterwards and asked did she(the unknown server) come by yet we said no. Five more minutes went by and my brother had to yell at a server to come over and serve us. She was nice enough to do it considering she wasn't are Initial server. We order all our stuff drinks and food at the same time. Btw the drinks were very weak tasted like juice and syrup. I ordered the Philly cheesesteak which was nothing to brag about. My brother told the server it was my moms birthday so she offered to buy her a shot. When it was bill time my brother asked for the manager to come over to explain why we had to wait so long and to at least cut the bill down for waiting so long. She said the birthday shot was considered the \"freebie\" and that she talked to the server and that was it. No apology no nothing . I will never visit this place again.

                "description": "Literally had the worst experience here on Friday evening. First of all the service was terrible, it took about 30 minutes after we sat down to get someone to take our order. We had to go to the front and ask for a server because no one was attending to us. After that, it took another 15 minutes to get our drinks. After we ordered our food, that took another 30 minutes to come out and when it did come out, my food was missing. The waitress didn't say anything so I figured that they were still making it. Only after 15 more minutes passed by and the waitress finally came back did she ask where my food was to which I responded that I had no idea. She then went back to the kitchen and after about 15 more minutes, my food came out. While everyone was eating, they found that my nephews chicken was raw and we had to bring up that issue as well.   The manager ended up coming out and taking my food and my nephews food off the ticket but it was still a very terrible experience. I wouldn't recommend going here to anyone."

I went to happy hour here with 8 of my coworkers and the outdoor seating was really spacious and well distanced from other tables.   Highlights: Their frozen margaritas (pretty strong especially for my low alcohol tolerance lol), the free tequila sampler my group received (:, the service, and the fact that they are really flexible with splitting checks for large groups!  Needs to be improved: The food was way too greasy and there weren't any plant based options for my vegan coworker. It would be nice if they had a smaller selection of dishes that were better quality and with half the oil added."

                "description": "A great, always reliable spot! They have a ton of outdoor seating with lots of shade, and excellent deals on drinks + food. Definitely a sports bar vibe, with lots of TVs, but never gets too loud (at least when I've been there) as it's really spread out. They seem to have a nice separate outdoor space that people sometimes use for private events, which I love!  The food is good -- typical burgers, sandwiches, salad, tacos. I love that they have the option to get any time of burger/sandwich on a gluten free bun or a lettuce wrap. Their lettuce wraps are huge and keep everything together! I got the Hippie with grilled chicken and loved it -- the chicken was blackened and spicy - yum! My boyfriend got the Fat Chick (not what he ordered..whoops, but still was delicious). Fried chicken with gravy, mashed potatoes, and sautéed veggies. They have a \"Hot\" (adobo) and \"Skinny\" (grilled) version of this. Nice to see some healthy and more indulgent options.   Definitely recommend if you're looking for good food, strong drinks (and some fun cocktails), and a nice place to hang with a friend or a group!"

At first, I was thinking I was going to be walking into an Applebee's and I don't think I was that wrong but where The Park separates from Applebee's is the fact that The Park is actually has good food. Well at least their burger was amazing.   Friendly staff. Good, really good, drink happy hour. We sat outside and while a normal outside sitting decision is dangerous in Texas heat The Park actually made the sitting experience enjoyable.   If you are confused on what to get, as I was, may I suggest The Rebel burger. A good sized, well done, burger with fried pickle chips on it. My thinking is this. I'm going to get pickles anyways, I might as well get them fried as well."

The service was very friendly and she gave a great suggestion on the mushroom burger.  The fries were perfectly crispy and not to large of a serving that I was overly stuffed.  I love that their burgers don't come with mustard and mayo and will only add them if you request it.   The hubby had the park burger with onion rings, which he enjoyed buy nothing extravagant.      I did like that they were playing old music videos."

She apparently felt the need to make us aware that their back patio was 21 and up only. She told us she'd let it go this time though. The problem we have is that we had no idea. It was her employee who sat us there. It was unnecessary for her to tell us, unless she was planning on moving us of course (which she didn't). It most certainly was unprofessional on her part. It sounds like they need a team meeting to address their issues with seating. We did nothing wrong but felt embarrassed and in the wrong when we had NOTHING to do with where they seated us. Also, we have sat on that same patio with kids many times prior to without consent from a manager...My husband tried to speak with her about the situation but instead of handling it professionally, she automatically banned him from the restaurant."

Personally, the one on south Lamar tends to be better, but they both have the same menu!   Their chips and queso is to do for. Reliable and we always get this.   My hubby always always always gets the angry chicken penne. It's amazing. Probably horrible for you but it's what dreams are made of. This week I got the Works flatbread which was delicious! I honestly think I have tried everything on the menu. I loveee the garlic fries and the Mac and cheese too.   On sundays they have an all you can eat brunch buffet. Covid and just buffets in general make my weary of eating communal foods but they were handling it smartly. Don't skip out on their happy hour too!"

Not sure what happened in the kitchen but our server, Jennifer, was sweet and super apologetic - took the item off our bill. My order arrived after my husband finished his plate - took my food to go.  Kitchen/cook staff needs to be more alert on orders - especially on a slow day. Otherwise, the frozen mojito was amazing."

The mash potatoes were cold and a little hard to the touch. The gravy was cold and not very very well drenched on the mashed potatoes.

This time we waited quite a bit for our server to appear, when she finally did she just asked if we were ready. No hello, or how are you. She didn't seem enthusiastic about the menu and when we told her weren't ready yet the second time she came by, we felt a bunch of attitude. The biscuits are amazing but everything else? We ended up with some mediocre food that probably would've tasted better if we had better service. Maybe the service style is different in New Zealand but I think eye rolls are a universal language.

                "description": "Highly recommend! It's my birthday week and the girls and I motored up to Austin for wine tasting and fun! We ALWAYS do Sunday brunch so we had to do it in Austin. This place is great for large parties and it's beautifully decorated.  I had the CIDE-car, their apple cider version of a side car... Very tasty and STRONG! Biscuits were big, fluffy and flaky like they came from biscuit heaven and your great grandmomma was the one making them. The deviled eggs were DELICIOUS and I'd like to think of myself as a deviled egg connoisseur. Cinnamon roll. Better than ANY cinnamon roll you've ever had the pleasure of stuffing in your mouth. ABSOLUTELY DIVINE!!! And the chicken fried ribeye with white gravy and collards..... All I can say is babyyyyyyyyyy this was definitely the definition of Southern cooking and hospitality. Our server Katie was ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!  Here is what the others in my party had to say:  To start I had a Cide Car to drink, deviled eggs, and a mouthwatering buttermilk biscuit. My entree was the Chicken Fried Ribeye, served with a side of braised collard greens! I finished my meal off with a hot and fresh cinnamon roll! Everything was delicious! I cleared my entire plate! The service was amazing! Katie went above and beyond to build a strong connection! I definitely give everything a solid 5!  It was an amazing experience from the front door to the table. The manager came by to make sure everything was good. Katie (Server) she was so on point and made the dining experience pleasant. If you ever get a chance to go please ask for her. She took pics of us and made sure the table was happ. For me this place was a solid 5 and I will be back soon!"

We also had the pork chop that was cooked perfectly and absolutely delicious. We tried the beet salad which was tasty but a bit plain.   Disappointed in their cocktail list as there were very few options and they didn't have much mixers or fruit to muddle in. The service was also slow but pleasant."

I even asked to surprise me with any drink (with a few notes) and all my drinks were also well balanced and delicious.  Food - impressive.  Get the biscuits! Made fresh, so soft and fluffy. Comes with butter and honey. We also ordered the beets, and brussel sprouts. Both were great but the beets were delicious snd had more creative flavors. My man got the pork chop. He took a bite, closed his eyes, and leaned back. I've never seen him do this. Are you ok? Apparently the pork chop is really good. Melts in your mouth. I got the red fish which was tender, perfectly cooked and not dry. Also I don't like \"fishy\" tasting fish and this one was gentle in flavor. The risotto was flavorful and creamy too.  Parking - they have valet but it's slow. The guy was overwhelmed because he was working Alone in a saturday night downtown. Not his fault at all but def piles up.  Def a special date night spot"

                "description": "My wallet was telling me no, but my stomach was telling me yes! Some friends and I came in for brunch on Sunday and really enjoyed our time there. We started off with a cinnamon roll, which the server explained was made from biscuit dough. It was outstanding! We then ordered some biscuits for the table, and those blew us away. Hot, fresh, buttery biscuits served with butter, honey, and jam. Those might be the best biscuits I've ever had. For the entrée I ordered the Pollo Frito Loco Biscuit, chicken topped with slaw and honey. That was friggin great, super crispy chicken on a butter biscuit. Our server was great as well, he was the bartender, who made some mean mimosas for us. 10/10 would recommend."

The food was pretty good but the biscuits were hands down freaking amazing. I highly recommend!  Also got the Brussel sprouts and pork chop. No complaints with either, but not craving a second order of these either. Biscuits were definitely my favorite item out of the experience.   Nice place for date night or dinner with the parents.  Parking PSA: Fixe only offers valet parking but there's plenty of street parking/lot parking nearby. I recommend looking around versus spending even more on valet."

                "description": "It seems like Fixe Southern House has had its moment already - the empty tables both inside and outside at 7pm were both a blessing and a bit nerve-wracking. I called ahead of time to ask if they were dog friendly on their patio, and they are! I saw no reviews of being dog friendly on Google, Yelp, or on their website, so that was a nice surprise. They even brought a bowl of water for my pup. FYI, you can find street parking nearby quite easily.  The food was pretty great overall - our table shared multiple dishes. I enjoyed the homemade biscuits with seasonal apple butter and the pimento cheese and focaccia dish. The beet salad was so sweet and savory at the same time - delicious! I enjoyed the lobster and crawfish pot pie but wish I had eaten it faster when it was piping hot. The fried chicken was a bit burnt some places but did have a great crisp. The deviled eggs were deviled eggs and nothing to rave about, and the broccolini was a bit salty. I still really enjoyed my time there.  We didn't try any drinks but we did get dessert! The pecan pie was very sweet and heavy, I only had a bite. I did enjoy the blackberry cobbler and ice cream. How delightful.  Overall, a solid service and food selection make this a great stop for southern food. Perhaps an even better place to stop than some other spots in Austin for southern food due to ease of actually getting a table and nice/upscale (although not super modern) ambiance."

The service was just amazing: our waiter was patient and kind, knew every little detail on the menu and accommodated our needs very well.   Food:  Here are what we ordered and my personal takes on them.  - Fixe Biscuits: MUST GET. So far the best biscuits I have had. They came hot and fresh and have some chewy, crunchy texture. Divine!  - Deviled Eggs: Good but not exceptional. I do like them tho.  - Heritage Pork chop: I love this dish. It was seasoned perfectly: not too salty (this is very important to me). The meat was very tender and paired well with all the veggie on it.  - Texas Red Fish: It reminded me of the Thai sweet and sour fish.  - Lobster and Crawfish pot pie: MUST GET. You can taste the crawfish and lobster in it. The pie came out hot and it was just so yummy.   Dessert:  - Pecan pie - Chocolate truffle cake Tbh, I didn't like their dessert that much. They were just too overwhelmingly, sickly sweet. I like the presentation tho.   Overall, it was such a great experience. My family doesn't normally like heavy, southern food but they cleared the dish here."

They brought traditional charm into the atmosphere in a warm and hip way that made you feel at ease and simultaneously stimulated, in a good way. Such a cool place! Our server was Wyn. She was phenomenal! She was professional and friendly! Great sense of humor (dealing with our group, LOL) and made wonderful suggestions. The Brussels were spot on! (A favorite dish of mine, always order wherever I go). My friends had the pork chop and pot pie. They reported the pork chop had fantastic flavor, was cooked perfectly. And the pot pie was better than they had hoped. It was a lovely experience and I hope to return!"

Cherly was a kind and attentive server, giving us recommendations as we looked through the menu. To drink, we got the mimosa and cold brew martini-- both delicious!   Because we wanted to experience the biscuits in their true form (they have biscuit sandwiches but we didn't want any other flavors), we got the biscuit side dish. So yummy!! We split the shrimp and grits, which I thought was enough for two people.  Great ambiance and decor, along with cozy, trendy chairs! A perfect brunch. :)"

                "description": "I really enjoyed my last two lunches and dinner at this restaurant. The biscuits are horribly expensive and terribly delicious. I'm forced by my lack of self control to order them every time we visit.   I've had the pot pie, the fish fry and also the pork chop. All of these meals where great and worth going back for.   There is one issue the collard greens suck. They were gritty and this is the sort of thing that happens when the greens are not properly washed.  I'm an expert on this, growing up we grew greens in the back yard and it was always my job to harvest them, pick the greens off the stem and wash them. I can let the fact that they left some of the tender part of the stems attached but the grit. That is not forgiveable.   So my suggestion is to avoid them at all costs."

Whether you're an Austinite or a visitor, trust and believe these biscuits are worth a try.  The biscuits came with a delicious whipped butter, some fruit preserves, and local honey. They paired so well with the biscuits, and they came in abundance too! You can even buy the biscuits in bulk; Fixe really knows how good their biscuits are!  But, I knocked off a star because the other food was just average. We got a beet salad and fried chicken. Neither was bad, but neither really stood out. However, the price was reasonable, and I would come back to try the rest of the menu!  tl;dr COME FOR THE BISCUITS! They are 6/5 stars :)"

They are salty, soft, with the perfect crunchy exterior (my mouth is watering writing this). They pair these amazing little fat bombs with apple butter, honey, and honey butter - AMAZING! - Shrimp and grits - So delicious! The shrimp is cooked perfectly and the grits are creamy and dreamy!  - Pear cobbler - Did you think you were eating Southern food to be healthy?? This is a treat yourself night if I've ever heard of one! Order this and you'll be swept away to sweet Southern heaven.  Support this downtown business! It is delicious and the service is excellent!

I wasn't really feeling anything crazy but the items i got were delicious! The biscuit was fluffy and flakey and everything i wanted.   The sausages were actually huge and so filling. There was a nice flakey crunch to the outside of them which i wasn't expecting but enjoyed. The service was great and so were the portion to cost ratios! Well worth it!"

They were not outright rude, but not very hospitable. Nobody smiled throughout the evening. Definetly did not feel welcome.   I ordered the burger and fries.  It was probably one of the worst burgers I've had.   There needs to be a balance between meat, bread, and veggies.  The burger was under cooked and  too big for the bun.  The veggies were minimal and soaked in blood from the burger.    My wife had the hot chicken sandwich.  That was better, but a mess to eat.    My son had the Mac n cheese with fruit.  The Mac was a thick gooey mess with large elbow pasta. Very hard to spoon out.  Not easy for a 3 year old to eat.  Also, quite salty.   We don't plan on returning."

My boyfriend had the shrimp and grits - he really liked the shrimp on it but the grits didn't have much flavor. The best item that we had was the appetizer of chips and queso but we subbed fries instead of chips - SO yummy. The queso was spicy and the fries were so crispy.   We would probably go back for dinner and drinks to see if it's better!"

The fries paired perfectly with the ranch and the sweet tea was so good! I only had to wait 17 minutes for my food to get out. I will definitely be coming back!"

Both were pretty much flavorless and dry, even with sauce.  All in with 2 drinks, soups and meals it was $100 before tip.  The fries were great, but otherwise I don't think I'll bother visiting again.  I wish them the best and may make a trip again just to check in and see if they've sorted stuff out."

My BLT also had a weird herb flavor to it that I wasn't fond of, others may enjoy it. I personally felt it was a little overpowering.   I recommend eating outdoors as it is in a nice part of downtown round rock"

I ordered Shrimp and Grits and she ordered the Full Monty (American sampler)  Our food was all cold nothing hot or remotely warm. They didn't seem too busy so maybe they are working out some expediting issues. My grits were mediocre at best maybe if they were warm that would be different and the shrimp was fishy and rubbery. I've never had grits that were like a smear on the bottom of the bowl/plate but that's exactly what this was.  My daughter said her eggs tasted off and her fruit was clearly on the brink of, if not already spoiled. The best thing on the plate was the potatoes  I'd give them another shot just maybe not for brunch this time."

                "description": "We hadn't been by here in a little while and we're looking to go somewhere different than \"the usual\".   The good: We were seated quickly and there were quite a few staff in the restaurant to help so we didn't have to really wait that long for anything. In fact, once's we're done my wife said, \"we should start looking for the bill\" and here comes the waitress with the bill. This is really surprising in light of the challenges that other restaurants are having with staffing.   I like that this place is in downtown round rock and I like the overall aesthetic with wood beams on the ceilings and the house converted to restaurant feel.   I got a special off of their hatch chili menu and it was very tasty and a pretty decent sized piece of fish.   The not so good: While the food was tasty, I was missing some of the expected hatch chili flavor that I would expect to find when ordering something off a hatch chili menu  My wife's fish was a little tough, but again the flavor was good  If you get cold easily, make sure to bring a sweater. The temperature was pretty frigid and because of the small floor for the restaurant there wasn't really a way to find a spot where the you don't get blown on by the AC.   Wrap-up: All in all the food and service were good. A few tweaks and I think this could be a 5-star review."

Staff were friendly but noticeably uninterested as some were preoccupied scrolling on their phones and others even hanging out at the bar. Our waitress was at least attentive.   For food I ordered the salmon frittata, and the hubs got the pork belly hash and a $5 orange juice that was clearly brand made and from a bottle that probably cost just as much as the charge of the 8oz we were served. Flavor wise, my food was delicious tho slightly salty. However upon arriving to the table, the pork belly hash looked smaller than my entree. For $16 you'd expect strips of pork belly on top of the sweet potato hash - what you really get is 10% protein, 20% dry biscuit, 30% hash, and 40% arugula garnish. Redeeming quality was the perfectly poached egg.   Definitely a happy hour/small bites spot but wouldn't recommend for brunch or a full meal. For $50, much left to be desired"

What a let down. It was like one thin deli sliced ham on and English muffin with an underdone poached egg and barely any hollandaise. It was more like eating eggs on toast. Now the potatoes; they could've been great. They were fine. But the peppers with the potatoes were not cooked and more thrown in just because. Not only that the music outside was too loud to have a conversation. I wish my experience was better, but mayyyybe I'll try it again with something else on the menu? I don't know."

Upon checking in we were told there was a 45 minute wait...fair enough. We walked to Finley's to grab a quick drink. We were both surprised when we got a text only within 20 mins! When we came back we were greeted by the hostess who was an absolute doll and showed to our table up front. Let me just say - customer service was top notch. Exactly was we hoped for. Our waiter Chandler was amazing! For an appetizer we ordered the bacon wrapped quail. It was superb. We both enjoyed it very much. For our entrees I had a side Caesar salad and the Dry Aged Ribeye (with asparagus and a cheddar potato cake), my fiancé had the Pecan Smoked Pork Chop (with asparagus and a cheddar potato cake) and for our 2 year old we ordered a kids meal with Mac and Cheese and Fries.  Let's start with the Pecan Smoked Pork Chop. While it was the tastiest of our entrees it was just a bit slightly overcooked...but delicious despite that. Okay on to the ribeye. I get this is not a steakhouse so I probably shouldn't have ordered it, but I had a craving. For the $45 price tag we were very disappointed. The thin cut steak very under-seasoned. The \"cheddar potato cake\" was just okay...its basically a mound of mashed potatoes with a cheddar crisp on top. The asparagus was okay but I like the small asparagus better and these were ginormous.  I noticed the baby wasn't eating his mac and cheese and wondered why. It looked like it came from a generic box and once I tasted it I learned why. Oddly enough the dish tasted like it had vinegar in it!! My fiancé tasted it and said the same thing. We even let Chandler know when we were leaving."

Called the Passion Project which was delightfully delicious! A bit on the sweet side but yummy nonetheless. It was a cold day so decided on a cup of tortilla soup... unfortunately I was accidentally bought the tomato soup which is pictured as well... I didn't taste it but it smelled delicious. The waitress was kind when I let her know the incorrect soup was brought and quickly brought out the tortilla soup. The soup seasoned well and perfectly warmed however tasted liked chicken soup with tortilla strips. I also ordered the Urban chopped salad with salmon... it was huge! Lol! The salmon was a bit dry and not really flavorful but once chopped over the salad all of the the flavors blended well together. All in all I enjoyed  my time at Urban... the service was fast, staff was friendly, and the overall ambiance was nice! I'd definitely visit again."

We arrived a few minutes ahead of our noon reservation but were seated promptly outdoors and were told our server would be there soon. Then we waited...and waited.    Once our server arrived with waters in hand, things ran more smoothly. My daughter had a full Monte and I had shrimp and grits. The food was attractively plated and tasted great. My shrimp was spicy, and there was plenty of bacon in the dish. The only thing that seemed out of place was the redeye gravy around the edge of the cheesy grits. It really added nothing.   There are plenty of menu choices, including vegetarian and gluten free items. Prices are a bit on the high side for some things and reasonable on others. But the food was good for us so I'd definitely return. This would have been a 5 star review had we not waited so long before a waitperson visited."

This s not a fancy place but very welcoming and casual. We decided to try the covered outside area and even though it was pretty hot, the fans and breeze made it very comfortable.  We discovered they have a happy hour Tuesday-Saturday which is pretty unusual in my experience. The menu is creative and utilizes locally sourced suppliers and though it is not a huge selection, it is varied, offering some seafood, steak, pork chop, salads, soups and starters. We had  grilled shrimp, quinoa salad, tortilla soup and side salads. Service was very attentive without making us feel rushed. Live music started at 7 which was another pleasant surprise.  We were amazed how much this part of downtown Round Rock has really developed. Parking was easy, the area is very walkable and Main Street entertainment district nearby.  Urban Eats is definitely a repeater for us! Give it a try and support a great local business."

I'm not a fan of the food and service (The servers literally interrupt you during the climax of the movie to say \"last call\"!).   I wish they shook up the menu and did more creative things. As I mentioned, I go frequently, and it's just the same stuff and it's honestly not that great.   I wish they had the the truffle parmesan popcorn or churro popcorn on the menu like the Alamo in SF."

They truly take silence seriously so it's always enjoyable to watch a movie here.  The parking garage is a bit tight to navigate, so it helps to drive slowly especially around turns. It's free though so that's great. I wish they had more plant-based menu options but it seems they're slowly starting to add some which is greatly appreciated.  Special events are starting to happen again, too! I can't wait for Master Pancake and movie parties to return! So much fun."

A great movie theater taken to the next level with gourmet food and drink that is brought to you while you enjoy your movie. It's everything that you would want!   They have burgers, pizza, salads, chicken fingers, great appetizers including cauliflower wings, mozzarella sticks, great popcorn and much more. My personal recommendation is to try the milkshakes (adult versions too) makes for a perfect combo while you watch your film.   The staff and service is incredible.

I purchased online in advance (they sell out), picked my seats and showed up early for the previews. We watched the new Wes Anderson movie set in France, so all of the previews were in French and of old French films. Quirky. Our waiter was friendly and attentive, and the popcorn was good. The only things I didn't like were that the volume was really loud in the theater (a plus for some!), and the seats were fairly uncomfortable. Although it seems like a fun place to take a date, it probably isn't. They have a strict no talking policy  and promised to kick out anyone talking during the film."

I wrote down my order for a gluten-free pizza - cauliflower crust - and the server took it. Well, she vanished. The second server said he would followup on it. When the pizza arrived, we had our doubts so we asked the runner whether it was gluten-free.   The runner swore that the kitchen confirmed it was gluten-free. Well, here I am throwing up my guts because of my allergy - so, no, it was not gluten-free.   The first server was nowhere to be found. The second server tried to convince me I never mentioned gluten-free - well thank goodness I had my order in writing. I can't believe he tried to put their mistakes on me. Especially when I was the one suffering from the allergic reaction.   The manager said we should have received a square plate for a gluten-free pizza, not round. And basically, that there's nothing he can do about it.   Places that don't try to cater to food allergies - I get it. They're ignorant and need educating.   It's much worse when a place pretends it knows what it's doing but screws it up and has no system to fix it.   Here's a first step -- train the employees on food allergies? And please, if you make a mistake, apologize. Don't call your customer a liar? And don't just make it catering to vegan or gluten-free a \"marketing gimmick\" -- follow through in action."

They provide lots of interesting stuffs, including their crafted videos for each movie. The seats at this location are a bit outdated. But the service and the OG environment are absolutely satisfying. I ordered a punch drink, and enjoyed my stay there! Oh also it's not freezing cold inside so I'm pretty happy about that as well."

I was able to curate my own video dance party and because of the Drafthouse, this event was everything I was hoping it would be.  From the staff being so helpful and accommodating (for ex. every time someone bought me a shot, if I wasn't at my seat, they made their way to find me and deliver it :p), to the help from the event manager David with all the fine details. The Studio 54 themed party I had envisioned came to full fruition that evening and the incredible people at the Alamo Drafthouse really made the night so special.   All my friends and family were just in awe of how well put together the party was and again, I have the Drafthouse to thank for that.  I could go on and on because I'm still on such a high due to the full success of the party.  10/10 would recommend. THE BEST THEATER CHAIN THERE IS. PERIOD."

                "description": "The Alamo Drafthouse Cinema is one unique movie theater. I came here last week for its \"terror Tuesday\" event with some friends and since I'm not from Austin, was quite surprised with the movie theater. Upon entering you are welcomed by a giant carpet and screen from the shining and can even take a picture in the tricycle (which is very, very cool). The theater itself is well decorated and gives you the feeling of a real old school cinema that takes movies very seriously. Upon entering the theater you are handed some water which is quite possibly the most thoughtful thing a movie theater can do instead of forcing you to pay $6 for a pop of bottled water. The theater itself is pretty standard minus the ledge in front of the seat. The seats themselves are by no means nice or comfortable, think old school stadium style seats but for what this theater is going for I actually get it.   If you are lucky enough to live near a movie theater that does all these special movie nights and plays old movies, you absolutely need to come and check it out. I really enjoyed seeing \"Let the right one in\" on the big screen and hope everyone keeps enjoying terror Tuesday's!"

                "description": "I never leave negative comments. But I feel like other parents of small children need to know about what happened at Alamo Drafthouse South Lamar after our family was kicked out of a Disney movie because of my 5-year old and they called the POLICE on us. Went with my wife and our three grade school age kids to see the Jungle Cruise last night. A kids movie. About 30-minutes into the movie the manager, MICHAEL WILCHESTER, kicked us out after he had received \"complaints from multiple groups\" that were upset that my 5-year old was \"talking\" during the movie. Talking, apparently, is when a small child is watching a kids movie and says things like \"dolphins\" or \"frogs\" or laughs when something funny happens. Kid stuff. There was three 20-something hipster wannabe ADULTS sitting to two seats away from my littlest that had already shushed a 5-year old in a kids movie (embarrassing on its own) before the incident and it was made pretty clear that the manager had received a complaint from ONE group before kicking out a family of five from a Disney movie. My wife and I are respectful people and I'd be the first to say if my little guy was being too loud and quiet him down myself. What Alamo Drafthouse did was sad, pathetic, rude, and bad business practice for a company that should want to keep families that spend money coming back despite streaming services and COVID. My wife tends to go mama bear in these situations, but in this case I was the one who lost my sh*t and I don't mind that I made a bit of a scene in the lobby (a few nice ladies came up and said the theatre were being horrible to us) after my 8-year old daughter started crying and telling the manager that she was sorry for her brother. The coward wouldn't even look at her when she spoke to him. NOT OK! Austin PD were call and complete dumbfounded by the fact that they were there over a customer service issue involving children. So Alamo Drafthouse South Lamar and Michael Wilchester like to pick on families with kids AND waste taxpayer dollars by divert public resources away from real crime. Pretty sad they felt like they needed the police to help them kick out a family of five at a movie theatre because of their own inability to do the right thing and tell the complainer adults that it's a kid at a kids move, GET OVER IT! Alamo Drafthouse is pathetic. The manager, Michael Wilchester, is pathetic. Austin PD were great guys. We will never be going back to this establishment and if you have young kids I'd think twice about going there. You've been warned. Be well, y'all."

Unique movies and events alongside first-run hits.  Coke, popcorn with REAL BUTTER, and a few hours of entertainment.  What more could you ask for?  Oh, yeah, that south Austin vibe!  I live north and often find myself at Village or Lakeline.  It's like being in a different city, though, as the eclectic and \"Austin flair\" mixes well with the everyday folks coming to the movies.  We just don't get that at much up north and it's good to remember how pleasantly diverse this city is in taste and style from restaurants to neighborhoods to people.  Will I be back?  Tomorrow night - already have my ticket (go go Season Pass!!!)!"

I had some fruit loops and then some coco crispies. Both were tasty. Service was friendly and prompt. Price was a little high I thought for an adult to eat cereal and watch a kids show. I probably would be more inclined to go back again and be a return customer for the cereal party if adult tickets were cheaper, but it was fun for a one time thing. Cheers."

He has a lot of options that will work for any occasion. For our group we had a certain set of things we wanted to accomplish and Michael put together a custom experience for us that 100% delivered.   Michael is fun, knowledgeable and professional. He was prepared with anything we could have asked for and when we asked for an audible he was able to accommodate with zero problems.   I think it's also worth mentioning that his bus is immaculate, new and comfortable. That's a big deal when you spend a couple days traipsing around TX.

Michael picked us up at our airbnb in Austin and drove us out to Fredericksburg for the day.  This was such a great alternative to staying a night in Fredericksburg because we didn't need to drive.  We went to a couple of really unique spots and had a couple of hours to explore Main Street in downtown.  It was a fully custom tour based on what our group wanted to do.  Michael really made the experience - he was a super entertaining driver and had a ton of local knowledge about the area.

One time the lady at the till was wearing her hoodie with the hood pulled tight the whole time. It's like buying beer from depressed teenagers. Basically get ignored until you make the payment.

They almost always have something unusual and delicious that's hard to find on tap, like a seasonal Martin House or Lakewood Temptress variation. The prices on the draft beers are great, and there's something fun about taking a draft beer to go in a plastic pint with a straw, like a milkshake. I live within walking distance, so sometimes my wife and I will walk down there and walk back home with a beer (yes, it's legal to drink on the street in this part of town.)  They also have a really great selection of cans and bottles, ranging from IPAs to Belgians to stouts, mostly featuring Texas breweries. I've repeatedly found 6-packs there that I've never seen anywhere else.  I haven't actually tried the mixed-drink slushies, but I have bought some alcoholic gummies and jello shots when I was feeling ridiculous, and they were as good as you could expect. But really, the beer is where it's at here, IMO."

                "description": "Came here on a Sunday and was surprised they were open! My heroes on a much needed fun drink Sunday when all liquor stores are closed. Walked in and a friendly, smiling face greeted me. I let her know it was my first time there and Jodee behind the counter gave me the whole scoop on all their flavors and the most popular ones. She sure knows her stuff! I went ahead and asked for a blue coconut  flavored one (sorry I don't remember the name). She went ahead and quickly filled my order and I was on my way. It was just perfect for a sunny Sunday after mowing my lawn. I really got to enjoy sipping on it while I sat on my hammock during quarantine minding my own. Will definitely be coming back. Prices are reasonable, size is perfect and flavor and amount of alcohol in it is just splendid. I'm looking forward to trying the rest of their flavors!"

They have so many flavors to choose from and the Jell-O shots are a treat. We come here often... the last time, I got a watermelon with the triple shot of vodka added (don't judge me). It was so good! Also try the boozy candy. The peach-oh's are my fave!"

With new machines, I knew their drinks would not have that wonky flavor so many fountain drinks have with those unclean spigots. I was not disappointed!  I walked in and saw a line as I was not the only one to notice they finally opened. The gentleman taking orders was very nice and explained how the hole thing worked, considering these are alcoholic drinks to go. They have a huge variety of margarita flavors to choose from as well as some cold draft beer, a huge variety of beer in their cooler, jello shots, and gummy bear shots.  They also offer daily deals which are cheap and good.  Between the delicious drinks and awesome customer service - I will be back!"

                "description": "First, it's not a drive thru as a lot of other locations are. Now that that's out of the way, Jennie O. and I have been anxiously awaiting the opening of this place because it's conveniently located between where we live! Today just so happened to be that day!  The original plan was a pool party, but a friend's housewarming party was the reason (and the opening day, of course) for our initial visit. A brand new building, everything is shiny and clean and new! They have a solid beer selection (both on draft and in cans/bottles), including a tasty honey vanilla wheat beer that can't be found anywhere else in Austin, currently!  Oh, yeah. Frozen daiquiris. Served in cups in plastic bags for traveling. I tried the Berry Bomb (strawberry and raspberry) and I shouldn't have been surprised at the sweetness, but I felt the need to brush my teeth right away. Jennie had the PPD (strawberry, pina, and mai tai) and it was just as sweet, but had more actual/distinct flavor than mine did. They also have a variety of Jell-O shots and boozy gummy bears (all served in plastic bags, again, for traveling).  The staff is friendly and helpful. There are also a couple tables (they could maybe fit a couple more) in case you want to have your beverages in house. I think.  Long story short, Jennie and I were not disappointed. I definitely see this being a regular place for us."

                "description": "I really liked this place. I ordered a medium Becky With The Good Hair (Peach and Sour Lemon favor). The cashier let us know that the drinks were 117% alcohol before adding any extra shots. I didn't add any extra because I was concerned that the alcohol taste would be to strong. Turns out the alcohol taste wasn't overpowering but the drink was strong enough! It got be pretty tipsy. :-) Not only were the drinks delicious but the atmosphere was pretty lively as well (thanks to the background music).   They have two tables set up to sit. The place is really small but hopefully they can add another table or two in the future. When I visited I sat at one of the tables and enjoyed my drink. The only thing I felt was missing was a few snacks. Maybe they can add some in the future. Overall it was a great experience and I'm ready to go back!"

Their happy hour is pretty great. Still, I never stay longer than an hour, because as I mentioned, it is _toxic_ bro city up in this bar, unfortunately.  As for their food, their poutine is delicious. As is their Wisconsin Wurst, and honestly most of their sandwiches are up to par. The bar staff are always kind and helpful.

                "description": "On the whole I was sadly a bit disappointed in the quality of food and experience at Haymaker.  On the experience, their mobile web UI is very dated and not fully functional: we ordered online for in-restaurant pickup, and never received a confirmation via phone or email that our order had been placed. After waiting some time, I went inside to check on our order status, and they indicated it had not been received. Slightly inconvenienced, I placed the same order again in person. A few minutes later, the server let me know that the web order had, in fact, come through, and that they were producing one order and a separate, duplicate order. I asked them to cancel the original order placed through their mobile website, but their system does not allow for reversal of web orders. I had the in-person order reversed, having encountered friction while attempting to simply place an order at several steps along the way.  On the food, their grilled chicken sandwich was substandard quality at best. The meat was rubbery, and the secondary ingredients (lettuce, tomato, pickles, bun) were of pretty transparently low quality. I'm open to giving it another shot, but the first-time experience was, all things considered, an unfortunate one."

                "description": "Been here a couple of times pre covid and once fairly recently. Their outdoor space is a great spot to hang out and watch a game with plenty of tvs and well spaced out tables. They have reopened for indoor dining but when I went in to use the bathroom the space between fairly crowded tables was definitely too close for comfort.   In terms of food they have a pretty nice variety of out there sandwich/burger options along with typical bar fare. While I appreciate the variety I've found most of the food I've tried to be okay at best. Most recently I've tried the wings and Italian hoagie. The wings were super bready and the sauces weren't very flavorful. The roast beef and sausage on the hoagie were also both fairly bland.   They have some pretty solid drink specials (when I last went on a Tuesday all Texas beers were 3$) and compared to similar spots they have a really wide selection of options.   Overall, I think the vibe here is great and the drink deals are hard to beat. But between the less than stellar food and questionable crowd control I can't say I'd recommend coming by in the near future."

The place looked pretty cool so we weren't all that upset about the pool table. We got seated right away and it was very much a bar setting, for those who couldn't tell. The service was honestly not great. Out waiter seemed very impatient and just ready to get off the clock. When asking about the size of the food the waiter over represented the food and it turned out really small.

The atmosphere is buzzing with social energy, and the drink selection is solid. Quality food is not the reason you visit. It's great for groups. Parking is tight though so you might have to be creative. Service was pretty good during my visits.   Pro tip: eat before you come...grab a drink here instead."

                "description": "We came here for dinner last night as we do many nights since we live so close. I decided to try something new. I got a patty melt and it didn't come out as ordered. This obviously happens in restaurants and it wasn't a huge deal. However it was how the manager handled it that really was top notch. He went above and beyond to make sure my experience was a perfect one. He bought me a beer and was so nice. The server was great too. It's all about recovery and even my husband said that's how a manager should handle a situation when something happens. I was very impressed and of course we will be back! Thanks to haymaker for going above and beyond to ensure our visit was a fantastic one! My one suggestion is to have a wing sauce that is super spicy! I would eat there every day!  Great place."

                "description": "Management has hung it's staff out to dry yet again on a big soccer day.   Went in for the Euro2020 Final on Sunday early enough to get a seat. We had no issue getting our food order and first beers as it was still not packed in there 1.5hrs priort to game time. But low and behold, as soon as we ordered our pitcher about 15-20min before game time we essentially stopped getting any drinks and had to go up to the bar ourselves to get them. This wasn't our waitresses fault as the bar staff was so backed up and the entire place was packed shoulder to shoulder with people probably doubling what the fire code actually allows in there.  When I finally fought through the crowd and went up to the bar, during the second half, I had to bring with me my empty pitcher as they had apparently ran out of ones to use. (Ours was empty for about an hour on our table). I started out about four people deep when I got up to the bar and first thing I saw was a bartender pull about 35-40 tickets off the machine from orders that were rang in. (That also happened the next time I came up). That's how I know it wasn't the staffs problem. They were set up for failure by being overwhelmed with people. Haymaker NEVER has someone making sure they don't go over capacity, so it's just a free for all of people.   I honestly have been just a handful of times in the past seven years since the Fire Marshall shut the place down during the USA/Portugal World Cup game in 2014. And they kicked me and my friends out from our table despite getting there 6+hrs prior to game time and going through a shift change. It's amazing they don't get shut down every big soccer match. Thought maybe they'd learned their lesson but clearly they haven't.  Gave it two stars because the wings were good and our server did what she could. Management just sucks so bad. All you need is some form of a doorman to keep this place from getting out of control. That's it, but they won't do it. So the experience sucks."

                "description": "Admittedly I came here on New Years Eve for some late night munchies before the countdown, not knowing this joint was part of the Hilton Hotel. That explains why the prices were slightly high when tacos are ubiquitous in Texas.   The fish taco was actually really good. I think they might have been a close tie for tacos I've had on my Texas trip. However the old school tacos were kind of boring and a little difficult to eat because they were getting soggy.  Our drinks were really good...but really sugary. It would be hard for a drink to taste bad with that much sugar. I would commend a bartender that can make a drink taste good/sophisticated without resorting to all that syrup. I felt like I was drinking candy syrup. This missed the mark for me in creativity or sophistication.  Would I recommend this place again? I'm unsure. If I stumbled upon here, I would definitely eat here again but I'm not sure I would go out of my way to eat here"

                "description": "Really enjoyed the food and drinks here on my recent trip to Austin. I haven't been to Austin in over 12 years so it was nice to get back downtown and see what's changed and what's not.  On a quiet Thursday night, stopped in to a relatively empty house.  Guessing given it was a weekday, on a rather chilly night for Austin, and with 6th street so close by - that's why it was so quiet.    To our benefit though, as we got great service.  My prickly pear margarita was perfectly balanced, great drink to end my night on.  For food, started with the guacamole, fried brussel sprouts, and for my main I got the al pastor tacos.  Let me tell you, those brussel sprouts are were it's at! They were perfect, the flavor was outstanding.  The soy glaze that's on top is delicious.  While the guacamole itself was great, the chips were a total let down.  For a taco joint, you'd think they'd fry up some fresh chips - these were sadly not - but good enough to get that guac to the mouth.  My al pastor tacos were pretty good, but I would have loved a little more char on the pork.  The pineapple was a refreshing topping, just enough not to be overwhelming.  Again, service was great, not too intrusive and at a good pace.  Def. look forward to coming back here when I return in March!"

A friend and I split a bunch of things off their bar snack menu. The deviled eggs with pickled mustard seeds and bacon were fine, but the mustard seed was a weird addition that managed to completely mask the bacon. The carnitas tacos were bland, couldn't taste the salsa verde. The Chimichurri tacos were better, the steak was nice, but again the flavor was mellow at best.   The tots absolutely stole the show though, this is what you should order. Tater tots covered in fried cheese curds, poblano gravy, and a sunny side up egg. This was hard to finish because of its density but is so good you'll put yourself through the pain to try!"

Bad thing is they don't open till 4pm, good thing is they are open till midnight or later depending on the night.   Decent size full bar located in the back of the restaurant. Great selection of local craft beers and some that are local!  Then there are the tacos, they come out really really fast after you order them, bad thing is they come really fast after you order them .  They are lukewarm at best.  And rather tasteless, no seasoning or lack of.   Came here multiple times during a week stay at the Hilton, service at the bar was never an issue."

                "description": "When our first choice for dinner didn't pull through we were desperate to find a quick (we had less than an hour!) and tasty place to find dinner. It also needed to seat 7 of us... oh and it was a Saturday night.   That's a lot of requests, right?   Well lucky for us, Yelp found us Austin Taco Project. You would never know that this was inside the Hyatt hotel, but it is! And it's pretty darn cute.   It's divided into two sections - the bar and seated. Both of which will get you a waiter. We opted for the bar area and were super comfortable. Our waiter was amazing and everything you'd want in a waiter. Unfortunately his name escapes me, but he was pretty darn fabulous. Quick, efficient, even taking off a drink that never arrived (totally not his fault) yet still giving the drink to our friend in the end.   The tacos at this place were all over the map - and I like it like that! A little different, a little strange, but still familiar. I ordered the Umami Taco which was both vegan and gluten free (not that it matters to me) but I do love anything mushroom. The waiter indicated it was salty and suggested I add avocado to cut the salt. He was so right! I do love me some salty things but the avocado was exactly what was needed - and some lime!   I also ordered the deviled eggs . Why? Because I always order deviled eggs. And they didn't disappoint! A great treat on a hot day!   Cocktails were splendid and on point. And everything on the menu was a delight.   Definitely look to this spot for a quick cocktail and bite with friends!"

                "description": "My friends and I came here for dinner on our first night in Austin and had a decent meal. I had made a reservation in advance, but it wasn't super necessary as the restaurant wasn't crowded around 8pm.  To start, we all split an order of Tots (fried cheese curd, poblano gravy, and a sunny side egg) and the Elote (charred corn, chipotle aioli, queso fresco, cilantro). Both were super delicious, and far surpassed the tacos I ordered for my main meal. I got an order of the Umami Tofu (mushroom mix, fennel salad, and candied ginger). Having candied ginger on a taco was a super interesting experience, and honestly I'm not mad about it. Overall the tacos were decent but a little cold and incredibly oily.   I appreciate what Austin Taco Project is trying to do with unique taco creations, even if they don't always work out, but honestly my biggest complaint is about the slow service. Despite the restaurant being relatively empty and our waiter standing 15 feet away from our table for the majority of the night, he visited our table very infrequently to check on us.   Overall it's not a bad spot, but the food quality and service could definitely use some improvements."

                "description": "Parents, hubby and I landed here after a particularly harrowing travel day. We were eager to get our grub on and this place sounded nice so we trekked 5 minutes on foot to get here.  I was a little turned off by the host taking leading (?) us to the table, leaving the menus on the table and walking off without pausing to see us to our seats. He continued walking off without saying another word or a backward glance at us. It was like he went for a stroll, slowed down to leave some menus on a random table and went on his merry way. Mind you, the place was mostly empty so he wasn't like, rushing back to seat more people.  Anyway, our server came by in short order and took our order. To start, we ordered the onion dip, the ribs, deviled eggs and the elote. I definitely recommend the elote which was delicious and quickly devoured, followed by possibly the onion dip. It did double duty as saucing for the tacos (more on that later).  My parents enjoyed the ribs. I abstained.   As for the deviled eggs...I'm willing to allow may be it was just this batch but we're fairly confident this gave me the runs all night and some of the morning, too. I ate 75% of the dish while hubby ate the rest. He had diarrhea once that night.  Parents were fine because they didn't have any. In any case, they tasted a-ok, maybe a bit on the tangy side.   For mains, we shared some carne asada tacos (x4), brisket tacos (x4), carnitas (x2) and Eisben (x2).  The two types of beef tacos were just ok in our book, both leaning towards the dry side. The carne asada was a bit extra dry, hence why I decided to throw some onion dip on top. In contrast, the carnitas were really great as was the Eisben, also a pork-based taco.  For drinks, I ordered the sea foam paloma which didn't do it for me. Can't say why...I think I would just preferred a salt rim, I think.  Anyway, our server was nice and professional...got us our requests in short order so that was a plus. However, I don't think I would make this a repeat."

                "description": "We ate here tonight.  I think it was a solid experience but not somewhere I'd run back to.    We made a reservation through Yelp (nice option!) but were the only ones there when we arrived.  It was only 5:30 so it was on the earlier side.  When we left the place was pretty full.  Our server was very friendly and nice.  She was helpful in answering questions - they definitely get 5 stars for service.  The food options were ok - not bad but.  I ordered 1 shrimp taco and one of the al pastor on her recommendation.  I eat Keto so she said they could serve mine on lettuce instead of a tortilla.  I appreciated that.  the shrimp taco was $7.50 for 1 taco (See pic) and it had exactly 3 shrimp in it.  It was very salty as well.  I liked the flavor but it was salty for sure.  The pastor taco was fine - nothing special but it was more filling since I just had those 2 on some lettuce.    In the picture on Yelp and on their menu they showed an amazing looking dip with pork rinds as the dippers and since I eat Keto, I was excited but they didn't have that on the menu so I didn't get to eat any of it.  I am attaching a photo of our bill so you can see what we ate and the related costs.  This place is located inside the downtown Hilton hotel - directly across from the convention center.  They validate parking so you can park in the Hilton garage to eat here - this was a bonus for us!"

I appreciate the nice decor but the restaurant looks closed from the outside due to all the art and graphics covering the walls and windows.  The waitress we had was very rude and did not seem like she enjoyed her job. My group of 4 girls ended up ordering some tots for appetizer and doubles of 2 different types of tacos.

The service is really slow even though me and my wife are like one of 4 tables to serve here at the moment.   Why is this place called Austin Taco Project? There is nothing Austin about this place. The flavor is average and most importantly you can easily make a better taco at home for yourself.   The best taco here is not even better than the worst taco at Tacodeli/Torchys.

We went to the 6th street area and saw a small taco stand. I got a quesadilla and my friends got tacos. They weren't happy with the tacos so I told them we should check out Austin Taco Project.   We arrived at Austin Taco Project. We were quickly seated. The waitress was nice and attentive. The decor was modern and funky. We all wanted to try their tacos since that's what this place is popular for. We went with the safe choice of chicken tacos. I must say that I really liked the Pollo tacos. The chicken meat was tasty, well seasoned, and tender. The Pollo taco was very good. My friend got the beef taco and didn't like it. The beef meat was greasy and she said it didn't taste good. You get two tacos $7.25. I felt it was a decent value for two delicious chicken tacos!"

They ended up having left them off but when we asked to have without while waiting for the dish, she implied that it was made and not going to be adjusted, which was... odd)  Cons: - didn't answer their phone when I called (twice) earlier in the evening to ask about a few menu items related to allergies, meaning I had to do this at the table instead  - none of the tacos we had were that impressive... or really spoke to Austin's experience in this realm. Overly experimental in a way that kind of missed the point - not a lot going on in terms of ambiance"

And the bar?  Hand mixed, infused and crafted drinks are awesome.   Had the Putine -- or at least their spin on it -- and it was outstanding!  Tots instead of fries. Brisket.  Poblano gravy.  And, of course, egg on top.  Brilliantly delicious.   The drinks are amazing.  We had the pleasure of the bar manager showing us how they aged, infused and made ingredients for every drink.  There is a perennial favorite that uses \"seafoam\".  The bar manager let us try some -- EXACTLY like tasting ocean water.  It mingles with citrus flavors when on its drink. I had a bourbon based drink that was blended and aged in their own oak that had incredible smoky, earthy, spice flavor.  They also have a very unique craft brew list here with flights that are worth your while.   TIP: locals park in Hilton garage and parking will be validated here."

                "description": "One thing Austin is known about is tacos and really wanted to give this place the taco test.  So while I was at the Hilton Austin I walked downstairs to have dinner. Walking through some big doors and headed inside to sit down at a table.  I was pretty tired from walking around downtown so I ordered a drink, and looked at their menu. I ordered Brisket tacos, and the order comes with two.  There were not too many people here but was nice to sit and relax.   I noticed a musician was setting up for the evening.  Soon my tacos were brought to me.  I took a bite and wow it was really good.  The soft brisket had excellent flavor and enjoyed the first one.  And then my wife showed up wondering what I was eating.  She could smell the tacos and headed straight to my second one.  She at most of it before I could get it back from her. She ordered a drink too and just hung out a bit.  I was really impressed and definitely will return to enjoy more tasty tacos."

                "description": "Perhaps one of the best local pizza places in Round Rock.  Their menu is definitely creative, they have a lot of amazing pizza combinations or you can always create your own.  You can also order a whole pizza or order by the slice which my wife loved since she usually doesn't eat too much.   We ordered the Orig Mama Gallo and it came with sliced meatballs and pepperoni. The combination of meats were great. The crust and dough were amazing and so soft. Their beer selection is quite extensive, I found a local beer from a small brewery I had never heard of before. I loved it so much that I ended up visiting the local brewery in Pflugerville.  Definitely give it a shot if you are a pizza lover like I am."

                "description": "Bought some wings this weekend.  Tried out the:  Kentucky Bourbon - Amazing! Right level of heat, smoke, and sweetness  Teriyaki- Sweet and tasted exactly how teriyaki sauce should taste. Deep notes of ginger which was amazing  Lemon pepper- could have been a lot better. It was almost as if they just sprinkled a little bit of essence of the seasoning.  Honestly couldn't tell the difference between the lemon pepper and the following wings.  Taco- I could see the seasoning but they were basically naked wings. The only flavor I could sort of taste was cumin, which was kinda blah. I wouldn't call these Taco Flavor. A good idea to market these as taco flavor would be to market the as \"carnita wings\" fry them up until they are super crunchy like chicharrón crunchy then serve them with side of salsa. If you use this please credit me! Lol free wings with a year would be nice too lol ;)"

                "description": "I honestly do not know where to begin with this review......I get it, possibly short staffed, since I did see a sign out front, but management should adjust how many patrons are seated if that's the case. 1. We signed up for space available seating for six people, mind you, two were planning to order single slices. We get to the restaurant and the first thing that strikes four of us as odd is the fact that the \"greeter\" had the emotions of Wednesday Addams...zero expressions nor cordiality. Did not see a smile one from this person. She should reconsider her position, but I'd suggest she work BOH the way she appeared.  2. Our waiter/order taker person, whatever the pronoun is today was flat out.....Terrible! His name was AJ, AJ was not attentive, didn't write ANYTHING down, did not take our drink orders(he was reminded by the bar staff). After he \"mental\" took our order down l noticed the \"I got you look\", AJ did not have us. Nope, ordered sweet tea, got unsweetened, came back with an excuse, we brushed it off. Ten minutes later, came back and asked my wife and I what pizza we ordered(again, he wrote it down mentally), I asked him to guess...when I told him a number 12 he replied, \"I knew it, was just checking.\" I honestly could keep going on number two, as the service was just that....shit.  3. Nothing, I mean nothing arrived on time. My Brother received his pizza before ANY of the the reheat and serve slices came out. My wife and I got ours after he'd finished half of the pizza. After the complete shit show for service, as soon as our pizza came out we got a to-go box. I could expound on every one of these points, but I won't.   All in all the bill was $145, only one beer was ordered. I was \"fine\" with leaving a $20 tip for the service we received, but was talked into being generous. My old self would not have been so nice. Maybe folks are used to this service at this establishment, but for the money we paid I would have been happier with a PJ pizza and some good garlic butter sauce! Oh, I attached a pic of my pizza from last night...."

                "description": "Slap Box is an interesting name for a Pizzaria with an included drafthouse. I stumbled upon this spot after Google searching \"pizza near me\". I was sawyer by the 4 star Yelp reviews, I had detour from my original plan to visit Pinthouse Pizza.   There's plenty of parking in fact there's an indoor covered parking lot on the same block around the corner. Upon entry the ambiance is well wonderful. There's enough tables and an ample amount of TV's to watch any of your heart's desire for sports.  I proceeded directly to the bar to order my pizza and beer to go.  When I sat down at the bar I ordered a pepperoni pizza and some water. After the pizza arrived after about 15 minutes or so I decided to sample a couple of ciders. I tried the Meridian Hive Cherry and the Meridian Hive Rhapsody. I ended up buying the Meridian Hive Cherry. It was on the sweeter side think like a wine.  When I finally tried the pizza it was pretty good. It was above average and I would try it again. The wings were really good. The sauce was flavorful and robust. The chicken was very good too. I definitely recommend Slap Box!"

During CoVid times, we ordered to-go and ate in the plaza next door since it was a lovely afternoon.   Be forewarned, if you get a slice... it is a BIG slice!  See the La Jolla slice picture. It's huge!  The kids loved their pizza. Not a surprise there since it was your typical pepperoni.   I had a GF, vegan pizza for the first time and it was pretty good. I'm so glad they had this option on the menu so I didn't have to order a salad.   They had lots of beer options on tap but we didn't partake this time. Next time, we will. Give them a try!"

                "description": "1. Let me just start off by saying, I grew up in a small town in Chicago Illinois so you could say pizza is my thing, and quite frankly slapbox pizzacheria or whatever the pronoun for this place is today has just that(pizza) 2. My experience at the slap was quite literally the reason I am willing to go back. Although it is clear to me that they are fairly understaffed the staff that work there currently are quite a joy. When you walk in you are greeted by a very interesting fellow that has the likes of Wednesday Adams from the Adams family, aswell as the door swinging wide open. Luckily for me I really enjoyed Wednesday Adams in the movie as she was my favorite character. Also I think people should be less hard on her at the slap because she seems to be doing good at her job as a greeter. 3. Our order taker person or whatever was also a very pleasant person. When we were seated by the greeter our order taker person named I believe adam was extremely nice and energetic,it was a damn shame my friends and I did not grab his number because he was looking extra fine the day we came in. Other than that he was still very nice and made sure our food was out on time. 4. To wrap up my essay on the slap I think it would be nice for me to talk about our experience with the food. Putting my Chicago ego aside my friends and I decided to order pizza here. I ordered the El Camino and let me tell you it might have been a fan favorite of mine, heck I could go for a slice right now while writing this review. 5. In conclusion I think slapbox pizzacheria is a great place to hangout and eat some pizza with friends and family. I also think that other reviewers shouldn't set a 4 star restaurant at such a high standard the place is ran aswell as it can be with the amount of staff they are given. My friends and I will most definitely be coming back to the slap as we enjoyed our stay"

I love the dry rub ranch and recently tried the bourbon glaze which was super tasty. They have a great variety of beers on tap and attentive service. Also, a great place for take away.

The specials change enough to provide variety while the regular menu has some great old standbys.  I love having the \"No talking or cell phone\" rules!

We waited (the entire theater) for 15 minutes AFTER the movie was over to get our checks.  Complete chaos Tonight.  Very dissapointing!!"

I saw Fire Walk With Me, and it was just so great to be back in the cinema and watch something. The overall experience was fantastic. Alamo is a great theater and general and has pretty good food selection. The movies are always broad so it's easy to find something to enjoy any day of the week. Highly recommend."

                "description": "OMG the food! So good!! I wasn't expecting such high quality meals that were better than most restaurants. This isn't a dine-in theater, it's a restaurant that shows movies in a super comfortable environment. It was an awesome experience. Easy to buy tickets online and find seats, service was great, seats were comfy. We will definitely be back!!   I love dine-in theaters and was so disappointed when AMC lowered the quality of their food and seemed to stop showing certain types of movies, or too releases. So it was really refreshing to go to Alamo Drafthouse for the first time. Now I can't wait for the second time, and third time, and many more."

                "description": "From customer service to ambiance, I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to this theater. This particular theater has reclining seats and personal desk tables rather than the high bar table at other Alamo Drafthouses. I got the pizza with Brussels sprouts and goat cheese -- delicious! The fried pickles were good too. Don't expect the fried pickles to be chips, they're spear shaped... if that matters.   If there's one negative critique, it's how loud the speakers were. It seemed insanely loud. I consider myself more on the hard of hearing side... and I thought the sound level was ridiculous. It was a good thing I wasn't watching an action movie, I don't know if I would have been able to handle it the whole time.   All in all, a good experience and if in the area, I'd go again."

It was a Special Christmas Polar Express movie on the big screen, along with the price of the movie everyone received a train whistle, Santa hats, bell necklace, Golden ticket, and popper. 2 cast members came out before the feature with one dressed up as a train conductor and explained how to use the props. The kids food menu was perfect and let we grandparents order from it also. The food was warm good flavor and perfect size. The chocolate milk shakes with whipped cream topping was wonderful.  Service was great fast correct orders for all of us. I know Polar express is not new but we grandparents haven't seen and it was really good. The place has new seats and updated tables. A wonderful place to go, try it out"

It takes away from the comfortable recliner chairs you have."

The disappointment is the food and sometimes the wait staff. I have tried an array of things on the menu and they are honestly the equivalent of a cheap diner lacking in flavor. And for that quality of food, way over priced.   The staff is not unfriendly, but about every order i have made, if i edited, it was ignored. Not sure why this is. More than anything else it is just annoying.   If anything, i will not come here hungry and just enjoy the films."

It was so hot in there I was sweating. And the service wasn't good. I asked for a refill 2x and waited nearly an hour to get it after the second time. The seats leave your get hanging and they fall down on their own, so we had to keep pushing the button to raising them up... They are narrow too... Food was good but 3 hours in the heat with an uncomfortable seat did not leave us feeling the love for Alamo Slaughter Lane...  I don't know what's going on but 2 stars instead of 1 because the guy that did our tickets was nice and took care of us.   Needless to say we won't be back.  Alamo pet peeve... Everyone location is different. You don't know what you're going to get. Recliners, old time theater seats, non recliners, only recline on the front row...Small tables, high tables, a long table...  It's an inconsistent experience."

My husband and I were disappointed when they took the fish and chips option off of the dinner menu, but it has now returned and isn't quite what it used to be, but at least it's an option again. They always serve reliably good cocktails and the Mexican vanilla milkshake is one of my favorite desserts. The facilities now have reclining leather chairs that are spacious and wonderful. The staff is friendly on every visit and the food arrives in a much timelier manner than it used to when it first opened. I will continue to enjoy this establishment and I hope others will too!"

This location is strictly drinks so we usually bring food in with us we pick up on the way.

They over charge you and then supplement the charges buy saying you order \"FREE NACHOS SALSA\" if you so happen to not want the free salsa and chips they and leave on the table unopened!!! Yup you guessed it they!! Wipe the table downs and recycle the chips and salsa! I wrote a review on this \"RACIST\" place on yelp for another HORRIBLE experience! But my buddy wanted to go yo local place and he duped me Into coming here on a fight night!   I wrote this review already and I think they got it removed because it was so damaging to what they call \"business motto\"!  I WILL MAKE THIS SIMPLE!  I went to this place to watch a fight with a buddy!  I am not a big drinker!! I ordered one drink!! JUST ONE! My buddy had two drinks I believe and he also happened to also not order free bag of chips and salsa! But they made they way from behind the bar to our table! SPLENDID!!!!! Fight is over and i want to pay my bill will honor and dignity!! NOPE NOT TODAY!!   The waitress brings the bills, my bill is over charged! So i asked her why am i being charged for chips and salsa! \"Hold on lemme get the manager!\"   This Sorry excuse of a manager walks to our table and requested the issue! As I explained to him that you are over charging customers, he states \"i do it to everyone and no one has a issue but you!\"   Ok, Manager today you will not over charge me and you will correctly charge me so i can be on my way!!   He violently yells at me and tells me to get out but then remembers he has to get rid of the evidence so he voids my transaction!  Charges My friend because he paid before me and DIDNT notice the over charge!   THIS PLACE IS RACIST!! THE way that Manager treated me as if we meet him before! I am a minority!! Why would he treat me as if i am hanging around this place! I was a patron and he treat me less then human after I discovered they COVID Gorging secret!! If allowed i will add pictures of receipt! Second bad experience i was in where i found myself being yelled at by a WOODROW employee while trying to pay!! I HAD TO WRITE ANOTHER REVIEW because they may have removed my other one!! I just want an explanation on why are you doing this to customers and why are you so aggressive with black customers! He was emotionally violent and it scared me so i walked away!  I just want clarity and a non aggressive place to have a beer or watch a fight in SOUTH AUSTIN while being BLACK!! Nothing much!"

Furthermore if I was running this establishment I think people would be more inclined to drink more if they weren't freezing their asses off.

The staff is attentive, the beer selection is dope, and having a traditional low key sports bar on the south side has been great.

All in all if you are a south sided looking for sports and cools beer with friendly service Little Woodrow's south is a safe bet. Just don't expect Bella and whistles. That's not what they do."

My son and I decided to wind down at Little Woodrow's. Temp was in the 30s that night, but they have a really big and nice fire pit outside.    We arrived around midnight:30 on a Monday and the crowd was light and fairly quiet.We sat in a booth not far from the door (but also not far from the bar).  Only one bartender that night so the wait seemed a little long, but there was really no reason for them to staff two bartenders on a Monday evening.    Drinks were good, conversation was easy (no need to yell at each other because the crowd wasn't loud), and the place was nice and clean (restrooms too).  This was my first visit to Little Woodrow's, but I'd go back :-)"

It's just a serving of club and a 1/2 shot of whiskey. News flash that's not part of the recipe... It is essentially orange pill to wipe around the rim, whiskey Pour  over an ice ball/block, bitters and then it's not meant to be shaken it's meant to be stirred   Yuck!"

                "description": "Since I am the Yelp duchess of the UFC gym in Southpark meadows, I had to check out the UFC gym sponsored event at Little Woodrow's. As a side note, Cowboy Harley Davidson also co-sponsered the event. There was give aways and a chance to ride on a bike (it was stationary). I had a chance since I know the manager at UFC, to put my skills to the test and throw on some gloves and do some of my kick ass kickboxing moves. However, having been maybe drunk/heavily buzzed at the time this happened, I was more concerned of not falling on my ass and less concerned on my actual technique.   I honestly a little excited for this event because I really couldn't wait to see some of the UFC fights on the fight card. Plus I got a chance to check out Little Woodrow's since it is close to my house.   Overall Little Woodrow's is a dive bar. They don't serve food and it is strictly about the booze. You can order from the pizza place next door but if you read my review of that place I would recommend getting food else where.   Anyway, the bar also had a dusty dirty chiller machine with jager and whiskey fireball bottles chilled and ready for shots. I will say they need to clean that fan that keeps it cool before it catches on fire. haha This bar was great for watching the fights since they have multiple TVs and a huge big screen that comes down."

I've warmed up to it quite a bit. From what I can tell, it operates really well and you're gonna get consistency.  Things of note: - Large patio space with plenty of seating and TVs - I don't really care for sportsball, but they play all the big games, matches, etc. and a lot of people turn out to watch, and the community is just *fun* - Open mic standup on Mondays (it's not terrible usually!) - Attentive bartenders; have twice seen them taking care of too-inebriated patrons. - Good food truck, also have popcorn (from a local place) - Very regulated with last call and when you have to finish your drink by. They will be open at the posted hours. - Patrons can get a little crazy but they're almost always friendly.  A solid bar, by far the best in Southpark Meadows."

It might have been racially fueled as I was the onlyHispanic person sitting at the table. Nobody else's was asked to re show ID and we're able to receive service. I will never come back and I urge you to spend your money elsewhere. The staff is as unprofessional and rude as they come. They ruined my night along with everyone I was with.

                "description": "I have been coming to this bar for the last year.  Unfortunately, on my visit tonight, i found myself a bit surprised by my bill.  Tuesday night is \"big beer night\", which means that 22 oz drafts are the same price as 16 oz drafts.  Cool.  I drank  3 22oz lone star drafts.  Pints of lone star are 3.00, so, i was a little surprised when my tab was over $13.  I asked about it, and was told that lone star was different.  This had me start doing Math.  Apparently, on normal nights, 16Ox is $3, while 22oz is 5.50.  Your paying almost $.07 more per ounce on a 22oz glass than on a pint.  Even with the minimal discount of \"big beer night\", you are STILL paying more per ounce on a 22oz beer than on a 16oz beer.  Way to screw your customers  LW.  You now have one less customer."

I actually met a couple of people here and we now hang out together.  Thank you Little Woodrow's for helping me grow my social circle!  They usually have something fun going on as well.

                "description": "Pretty nice for a hidden coffee shop in a large commercial complex. Would not notice it from the road or walking past unless you know what you're looking for, as it blends in with the rest of the modern building architecture. Not the warmest building from the exterior, but they've done a good job trying to make it welcoming indoors. A variety of seating with one high top table. Most of the seating is 6+ capacity tables, so if you don't like sharing, this is not the place for you to study/sit alone. There is bench window seating, but with two walls of windows I imagine those seats might get warm in the summer. Some outdoor seating as well, for those who prefer that.  I got the grilled cheese and apple sandwich. The flavor combination was well done, but I was a little disappointed by the ratio of filling to bread and felt the sandwich could have been fluffed out a little more in terms of filling. The chips were neither amazing nor terrible; pretty standard fare.   I also got two different hot chocolates. One regular with almond milk, one Mexican hot chocolate with oat milk. Of the two, I'd recommend the first one. Good flavor and nice quantity of whipped cream if you ask for it in a mug. The default seems to be to-go cups, so make sure you're clear if you want to sit and stay a while when ordering. My friend got the Mexican hot chocolate with regular milk and the spices smelled fantastic, but with oat milk they got overwhelmed and it was mostly an oaty flavor.   Welcoming and friendly staff. Would definitely visit again."

I don't think anyone would ever have trouble finding a seat and it seems like a nice quiet place to work for an afternoon. I appreciated the fact that they had a lot of flavor options. I decided to get a Vanilla Rose Iced Oat Milk Latte and it was so good. The flavor was subtle and it was perfectly brewed. The only reason I knock it down to 4 stars is because it's definitely on the pricier side. I would expect to pay minimum $7 for a latte when you go in. While it may not be an everyday stop, I would still go back for sure.   COVID Precautions: Masks required for employees and customers."

There's a pretty well endowed breakfast menu, not huge full breakfasts, like pancakes, but for a coffee shop there's a lot of offerings.  Our coffees are consistent.  It's definitely not my favorite, but it's always good. Consistency is hard, which is why I don't have a favorite coffee shop.   The outdoor area is great bc we always have my kids in tow and sometimes there's another kiddo out there for them to mingle with.   The details: It's an older, white, crowd. The industrial decor is neat, but the chairs are really loud when you move them.  There's plenty of parking. Staff is friendly.

I love coffee but I'd honestly would get the chai next time - it was absolutely delightful. We also sampled our fair share of pastries including a blueberry muffin, pumpkin bread, and croissant. The muffin and bread were really moist and delicious, but the croissant was very bready and not a flaky, buttery croissant I was looking forward to. I think they get their pastries from a local bakery so that was cool and I would definitely try out their other pastries. Will definitely be back!"

The owner, or whoever he was, was so terrified of people I wasn't even sure if I was supposed to be there. Pictures look great, I'm sure the place can be a lot of fun if it weren't for COVID-paranoia. Seriously, I went all over Austin that day and NO ONE was halfway as petrified as this guy.  My brother tried to take a sip of his coffee but was soundly rebuked for exposing his nose and mouth for 10 seconds. I understand we need to be careful, and we were, but if you go to a coffee shop you should at least be permitted to make sure the thing is edible before you leave!! BTW, we wore a mask and were very careful the entire time being there.  Won't be back. There are many other decent coffee stops in Austin."

Great beer selection, that's all we went there for, but their menu looks amazing for coffee and small plates. Very relaxing environment saw lots of people there working or just catching up with friends. The staff was incredibly sweet as well. They have a fun little outdoor area with games to play, and a few games inside too. If you're looking for a relaxing getaway with both amazing beer and coffee choices this is the place to go!"

                "description": "Tried this place for the first time this morning. They have a fancy, space-age way of making coffee here called Steampunk that's fun to watch. They put it in these tubelike, clear canisters, and a science experiment occurs where coffee and water get sucked back and forth and eventually a really smooth coffee comes out. This was my first time trying Cuvée coffee and it was definitely tasty. Looking forward to trying lots of different coffees and teas here. I saw nitro cold brew, Mexi mocha, chai and dirty chai, and a full slate of espressos.  The hubs got a hazelnut frap, which was delicious but probably too sweet for me.   Interior here is modern-industrial-ish (aka hard wooden chairs), so it doesn't have the cozy, comfy vibe I look for in coffee shops. I couldn't envision myself working here for hours on end, but I will definitely stop by en route to other places.  Oh, they have a bar with wine and tap beers too. I saw yard games (giant jenga and cornhole) and I saw that they have trivia night here too (the geeks who drink thing.)"

My husband followed it up with the classic Good, Bad and Ugly, a pepperoni, sausage, and pepper pizza that was elevated by higher quality ingredients. I tried the mushroom pizza, which was tasty as long as you're looking for something different. An umami bomb with a mushroom purée sauce, speck ham, and rosemary.  Two pizzas + the cauliflower = 2.5 meals for us, so plan for generous portions/leftovers."

No one told us that market is only open on Sunday and it was Saturday. Ha!  So we tried this place out in their dog-friendly  backyard covered patio and we were not disappointed!  - Fresh craft quality cocktails on draft  - Super fresh ingredients in the salad and pizza  It was still pretty early so we had the breakfast brunch pie and a light fennel salad and it hit the spot perfectly. When you visit, you can order straight from the bar and Emilio will happily take care of you."

I don't care for the clam offering, but it's hard to choose a favorite among the others. I guess I'd have to give a slight nod to the 'Nduja Sausage though. Regardless of which pie you choose, the crust isn't just an obligatory substrate; it's got great flavor and texture.  The cocktails are outstanding, especially the prickly pear margarita. Sunday is Bloody Mary day, and you won't find a better one outside of the next one. The mix has got just the right amount of spice and it's filled with a skewer containing salami, pepperoni, an olive, a tomato, basil and mozzarella.  The owners and staff are great, and they recently remodeled an already great patio area to include a beer garden with 30 beers on tap."

Being earlier in the day, E 6th had not yet turned into Dirty 6th, rendering this bar a good place for a few drinks. I would expect a loud environment here, just like in any other bar down the block. Along with the drinks we were easily entertained by the hoops game, but if basketball is not your thing, you may find the claw game more interesting.   Either way the prices are reasonable, even for slightly watered-down drinks, and the atmosphere is manageable.  Cheers!"

                "description": "The fact that I am giving a good review to a place on \"Dirty Sixth\" is insane and reveals more #chaoticenergy than I want to divulge or recognize within myself.  My friend and I came here early-ish on a Friday night and each ordered a drink. Kairo (?), our bartender, was very nice and recommended we each get the same drink, in a larger size, for a dollar less. This would be intriguing, but I am a huge lightweight. Somehow, I acquiesced. The shocking thing is that, while a typical bar would make its larger, cheap drinks weak in order to turn over money and booze quickly, NOPE. These were very strong. I could not finish mine, let alone come close, but the lack of upsell and shiftiness already separates this place from its counterparts nearby TBH. Also, the bathrooms were shockingly well maintained."

So in that regard it felt a little sterile. But overall it's actually quite nice inside which was a welcomed change.  Live music at the front of the bar was a nice touch, it added some energy which we enjoy. A frozen marg and a beer was probably $10 which is a great deal. We were only in here for one drink while waiting for a table at dinner.   Nice 6th Street bar to stop in."

                "description": "If I could give it a 0 star I would. My cousin and his colleagues came from out of town and wanted to experience 6th St. I, having been to 6th street many times, I found it extremely unsettling and sketchy that the bar charged an automatic 20% tip (for 1-infinity) patrons without disclaiming it before hand. This applies if you pay cash or card. Now, for context, what if I came to the bar with a $10 bill and drank exactly $10 worth of alcohol, then I receive the bill and it's $12.00. Then what? I only have $10 cash. Now had you told me that I would be charged 20% prior to drinking, I would have only drank $8 worth of alcohol that I could afford the tip.  Don't get me wrong, it's not the tip amount, in fact, had the 20% not been added, my personal tip would have exceeded that. However, since you took that choice away from me without prior consent, it pissed me and my friends off.  We spoke with management and they explained that it was some type of tourist tax (which is not a real thing in Austin). They had no written policy to show us or any credible explanation.  Needless to say, we will not be returning.  Oh and top it off, they stand in the front and advertise $5 pitchers of beer, when we got in they only had liquor  because the all beer on tap was out of order. Smh.  The drinks were sub par and it was dead. So  basically a waste of time.  In short, we believe it was not a tourist tax, but rather a black tax and mind you we are all well dressed professionals who just wanted to have a good time.  I will say that prior to the check being given, the bar tender was nice."

                "description": "A few weeks ago I went to Pour Choices with a large group of female friends celebrating a 21st birthday. The doormen called us in from the street advertising that ladies could come inside the bar for free (men would be required to pay a cover).  After allowing most of our party inside, the doorman stopped my two friends, a lesbian couple, before they entered. They were asked:  \"Do you holla at boys, or do you holla at girls?\" (asking about their sexual orientation).   After my friends responded that they are attracted to women. Then they were told they would be treated \"like guys\" and were asked to pay ten dollars each. The incident was very upsetting for my friends, as they were singled out for being a lesbian couple. None of the other women in our party were asked this question or asked to pay cover charge.   After the incident, I asked to speak to a manager. The original doorman we spoke to continuously cut into the conversation exclaiming that his sister is gay, and that he even asks her pay a cover charge before she visits Pour Choices. The manager made no attempt to correct the doorman's assertions. The manager simply said it was just the way things are- but that he could make an \"exception\" for my friends' 21st birthday just this once.   The fact that the doorman asserted even his own gay family members were not exempt from being charged a cover for their sexuality- implied that this practice of charging gay women had been occurring for some time. Furthermore, when the manager made no attempt to correct the doorman and offered to let my friends in as an \"exception\", it further substantiated that this was a common practice.  The ordeal left us all fairly distressed. My friends (the couple) had both turned 21 in the last week and were excited to explore sixth street for the first time. Instead they were met with discrimination and a horrible memory that will last a lifetime. We were expecting to enjoy ourselves, but instead left in tears. I hope Pour Choices puts forth a sincere effort to make this right.  NOTE: I am posting my review again because my original review was taken down. I received an email from Yelp saying my review was removed because it was \"motivated more by news coverage rather than one's own customer experience with the business\". My review in no way is motivated by any press coverage. Every detail of this review is based on my own firsthand experience."

                "description": "Everybody knows I'm no stranger to Dirty 6th. Every noteworthy memory I don't remember can be credited to the badassness that is the infamous 6th Street in Austin, TX. The value that Pour Choices added to the Austin nightlife when it opened up earlier this year has completely BLOWN MY MIND. Pour Choices has seriously upped the ante in making sure that they set THE standard on how a bar should look, and how it should run.   Any night of the week you can always count on them to make your night a great one. From the music, the accent lighting, the boujee drink selection, big ass TVs to sweat your favorite games, to the friendly (and good looking teehee) staff, it's just a place you wanna go to with your friends to shoot the shit, dance like there's no tomorrow, or just have a badass time people-watching.   Sure at times when it's busy, service can be a little slow, or it's so damn packed you can't move. This is part of the business and for them being 4 months in, I think they're doing a damn good job at rolling with the punches while trying to be the best bar they can be on 6th Street.   Kudos to the staff, to the owners of the bar for creating THE hangout spot that people want to flock to on a Tuesday night. Y'all are definitely a huge reason why Austin remains to be THE BEST CITY IN THE WORLD."

Yes, it was busy, yes I had a great time. Drinks are always good, and the music is pretty good. Skip to the end of the night and I left my phone behind.  So maybe, just maybe karma is in my favor and someone turned it in. So I call. I call the number listed on google around 3pm on Saturday, no answer. No voicemail set up to leave a message. Nothing. So I assume they'll call back or maybe I called at a bad time..... who knows. So I wait and try a little bit later, around 8pm... NOPE. NOTHING. I've emailed the company using their website, and have heard NOTHING. It is now Sunday, 3pm... and still again, NO ANSWER! I get that it was my fault for leaving my phone behind, but the very least they could do is call me and tell me they don't have it. I see that they might actually care about these reviews, so maybe this will be what it takes to get a call back."

We asked if they would be interested in hosting our wedding there, and although they had not done this before, they agreed! And we were not disappointed. Their venue was naturally beautiful being in a historic building. The exposed and untouched brick walls, wooden floors,  gorgeous natural lighting, and large covered outdoor patio overlooking downtown, contrasted against their modern bar and decor provided the perfect combination of old meets new for our design tastes. In addition, their top notch sound system provided a great party atmosphere. On top of this their staff was outstanding....the bartenders were friendly and professional, and management was super accommodating to our needs! Overall we had an absolutely wonderful experience having our wedding at this venue. You should visit this place even if you're just looking for a good drink, friendly staff, and a place to chill. Thank you Pour Choices!"

I've always had a pleasant experience with the staff and I enjoy their coffee. Also, sharing the s'mores with friends is a great way to wrap up the night.   I used to visit Halcyon years ago while going to UT and my recent visits shocked me. The paint and furniture could use a refresh and the bathroom is really bad. It really makes me question their cleanliness policies and it does not give me confidence that they take pride in their business. Halcyon has been a favorite in Austin so I hope they can make some changes."

The employees are all extremely friendly and make great drinks! My personal favorite coffee cocktails are the Chocolate Espresso Martini and the Insomniac.  Despite their great selection of drinks, this place could definitely use some work. As others have pointed out, the bathroom is seriously disgusting. I can't emphasize that enough. On my last visit, there was a #2 just sitting in the toilet with a used tampon sitting in the urinal beside it. No paper towels to use as a barrier for eliminating contact with the door, just a roll of toilet paper left haphazardly on the sink.   I don't know why this complaint isn't being taken seriously, considering the fact that there are quite old complaints concerning the bathroom nightmare on this page. A dirty restroom makes me skeptical of the cleanliness of the food and beverage preparation and makes me hesitant to come here again."

Good coffee and café food menu, but apparently they also have alcohol!  S'mores: This totally brought out the little kid in me.  Nothing bougie or artisanal.  Just Honey Maid graham crackers and Hershey chocolate, but still wrapped up in original packaging, alongside marshmallows.  The ratio is 6 marshmallows in the 2 person order and 12 marshmallows in the 4 person order.  Unless you're looking for just a taste, I'd actually recommend the 4 person for 2 people, so you can really indulge.  A nice strong flame in the center so you can practice your marshmallow roasting.  Açaí Bowl: Perhaps a tad healthier than s'mores.  A huge portion of cold thick açaí at the bottom.  Some fresh huge blueberries alongside banana slices.  With a little granola for crunch.  Perfect for breakfast or even a dessert-like meal anytime."

I don't necessarily Cindy this a busy coffee shop, so if you want to to have a study/work space, it can definitely be a good go to spot. Also, they serve other beverages besides coffee if you're not a caffeine head like I am.   Enjoy your coffee inside, or take a walk at the park right across the street!"

I recently spent a few hours at Halcyon in an afternoon with some friends, and we had a great experience of being able to relax, chat, have a few drinks and catch up.  Their coffees are fantastic, and the alcoholic beverages are solid as well - I had a Mocha Latte that hit the spot perfectly (good taste and excellent temperature, what more can you ask for?). I will say the Iced Chai that I had was a smidge on the sweet side, had too much cinnamon, and was lighter than I'd expect, so maybe just skip that one.   The S'mores snack was fantastic and just a cute/ unique experience for a coffee shop/ lounge - I can't say I've ever seen something like that where you get a little campfire brought to your table and get to roast marshmallows indoors! Overall I'd definitely recommend Halcyon - great drinks, great service, and a solid experience!"

There was a drag show brunch happening at the time, which made the place super lively and fun. We went immediately to the bar and luckily found seats there. All 3 of us ordered a chocolate espresso martini and we LOVED it. Still dreaming about this perfect martini and how I can make it myself.   Will I be back? Most definitely, they make my fav martinis"

Service is great! Staff is helpful. Everyone was socially distanced and wearing masks unless eating or drinking. The smores set up is awesome! We loved making our own s'mores indoors! Hershey's chocolate of course lol. Definitely Recommend! The lattes with almond milk are excellent. I also love the chaggaccino! Happy they have milk alternatives and mushroom coffee!! Awesome!! Great little spot. They have outdoor seating as well as indoor. We came here a few times while in Austin. Definitely recommend!! The coffee is fantastic!!"

If you are going to market it as a brunch and charge me $25.00 to get in you better have me some food prepared as part of my $25.00. To charge me $25.00 to get in and expect me to pay for food on top of the $25.00 to get in is not cool. So not worth $25.00 just to walk in the door. F---------...."

It looked like they were having a good time, but we did not participate. The shop had a light stench to it from too many spilled drinks and the restrooms were extremely dirty which is the main reason I am giving this place 3 stars. We ordered the grilled cheese and a peach alcoholic drink and both were very tasty."

I can't remember which of the coffees I had. Maybe the espresso martini? Anyway, it was lovely. It had a few roasted coffee beans on top, which I enjoyed as well. The s'mores was super fun. They had some comedians performing that night. One of them wasn't funny at all, but the rest were entertaining enough."

The cashier was very dismissive and didn't seem to want to be there or help us. Further, the bartender would leave when he was the only one there and not make drinks. When he returned I asked for my drink and he responded that he already made it and then accused my friends of taking it, so I should ask them. He finally said he would remake it and continued to stand there, read the book of recipes for drinks, make others drinks, take others orders and never made my drink. When I finally just asked for a refund from the cashier he said the manager has to approve it. The bartender who accused my friends and didn't want to make my drink WAS the manager.   I get it when it's busy, but other than the six friends I was with there were 3 other people at Halcyon. Again, this is NOT the typical service they have but I was so blown away so DO NOT go to halcyon during the week."

The only thing worth eating was the chicken on the waffle and had we gotten syrup delivered, that would have really helped the chicken and waffle meal. The smoothie bowl was refreshing though so I upped my stars. The burrito was bland, skillet was bland, and the coffee drink was not good at all. We would only go here for the s'mores experience...other than that, I would enjoy the other breakfast places in Austin. Sad day!"

I was so glad to find a really, really good one at Halcyon on my recent trip to Austin. Their menu features a variety of espresso and coffee based cocktails, including a chocolate espresso martini with vanilla vodka. We stopped in on a Friday evening, and the friendly bartender was happy to customize the drink, and make me a classic espresso martini sans chocolate and with Tito's. It was rich, deep, and a perfect way to start an evening out."

The aesthetic in the place is really light and fun, and they have a lot of outdoor seating area. There were a lot of people doing work/homework of some kind, it is definitely a place where you can come and chill for a while. There was a large selection of drinks, including some seasonal options. I decided to get an iced Americano which I thought had a good flavor. Drinks were to us pretty quickly, and there was a water station four easy water access. The cream and sugar area also had almond milk, which I thought was a nice addition. Most places usually only have half and half, so a non-dairy alternative was nice to see. They sell beer, however I didn't look at the beer selection so I'm no help on that! Worth checking out, I plan to go back soon!"

This is an excellent example of a business making an effort to seamlessly live in its environment-- in other words, this coffee shop found a way to complement its outside surroundings near the Tesla factory, and almost gives off a steam punk vibe. I'm a pretty sunny person, but even I can't resist. Also, the drinks are actually good. Very glad that they were able to have an aesthetic look and comfy vibe without sacrificing the quality and taste of their drinks. I got the matcha latte with oat, vanilla, and turmeric !"

On the one hand that's great for business, on the other I want to keep them all for myself.   A lot of coffee shops can be snooty and pretentious, but this ain't that. Everyone there truly loves coffee and people. They just want everyone to be caffeinated and happy. What better a mission than that?  They roast their own beans which means you're getting a truly unique cup when you go there. All of their espresso pulls are doubles to start. That's why I love getting the 1:1 when I go to sit down. You get a single shot of espresso and a baby latte with the other single shot inside. You also get a glass of sparkling water and a Hershey kiss. Total perfection. This lets you explore and taste the espresso on its own and then see it in a drink with the milk. It's an awesome way to discover what you might like or not like about a particular roast.   Then on your way out if you liked it you can buy a bag of those beans to take home for your coffee there for the week. It's the best."

They've got compostable take away cups and utensils, which is so rare. Their tea comes loose leaf in a steal strainer, and all their food is severed on reusable plates and in mugs.  I got the Turkish tea, flavorful and now one of my favorites. I'm not sure if this is a house mix, but the tea tasted unique and strong. Unlimited hot water refills, just go up to the bar area and ask! With tea I got the tasty morning bun, kind of like a cinnamon roll but with different nuts and really big. Flakey croissant exterior with a goo-y interior, this was a really nice cafe treat!  I think tourists and locals both enjoy the distinctive graffiti art on the walls of this cafe. It's located in a shipping container area that has a nice outdoor seating place too."

I was greeted by a friendly staff and an interesting menu. The beer was fantastic and I got a cold brew coffee to go for the next morning.    For food, I'd suggest the chicken salad sandwich. It was delicious! However, the bread is toasted a bit too much--so crunchy it hurt my mouth a bit. But overall, crisp and fresh flavors that left me wanting more. I'd order it again, just asking that the bread not be so hard."

The chicken salad sandwich was OK without bread and ended up being pretty filling.  I just wish they had a gluten-free bread option for all the great looking sandwiches.  This is a great spot to hang out and grab a bite before checking out the Austin Winery or Wiskey distillery next door."

Coffee is cheap compared to any franchise out there plus it is amazing coffee they brew in-house. Don't forget to have a bite on sandwich if you come to this place. Sandwich is pre prepared still the best. They host cool events every month really doing the job of local community buildup. I love this place"

We sat at the front for the best view. Quiet electric barge, no spray. Could not hear commentary; boat may need Bluetooth speakers at the front. Good views of downtown buildings! We saw two groups of egrets settling in for the night. We saw some bats flying out of the Congress Ave bridge! Not many bats because this was in November.  We missed a few bats because the boat returned to the dock to drop off some people who needed to use the bathroom :( The tour guide could have stated that the boat had no bathrooms. It is obvious to the guide but not to the first-time visitor. Tip: go to the bathroom before you board the boat."

                "description": "I called Capital Cruises late afternoon a few days ago to inquire about the dinner cruises and spoke with Britney. She was very courteous and took the time to share more about the boats and pricing options, but proceeded to share with me that they weren't able to book me officially at the time because it was after hours. She shared that they only had one boat left for the date I requested but they would put a soft hold on it for me and I could call back to officially book with a credit card. No problem -- I completely understood that and was also very happy with her customer service orientation.  Today I reached out to follow up, and spoke with Tony. I shared my name and that I called a few days ago about booking a boat, and he asked what date I was looking for. I shared the same date and he said they were booked until a week out from that date. I let him know that I had spoken to Britney about this earlier in the week and she placed a soft hold for me. He was clearly annoyed with this and shared that that isn't their policy but yes, they actually did have a boat available. He then immediately asked for my card info -- didn't bother to share more, didn't bother to see if I had questions, etc. I asked him directly if this would be a problem booking (since I noticed from his tone how annoyed he was). He said no and that I could call back when I was ready to book. After that experience I do not plan on booking this cruise anymore. I was prepared to spent over $500 for this package with the boat and the meal options I was considering and will gladly spend that money elsewhere. Disappointing customer service."

We went in early November, so we weren't sure how many bats would be left, and there were TONS! It's truly an experience I'll never forget. Thank you to the employees and captain!"

The tour included city views with running commentary followed by the bats flying out from under the bridge for a very long time. Our questions were addressed and we saw many unusual birds and other sights. It was a real highlight for me. My only concern was that my GPS took me to the bus entrance and I was almost late trying to find my way to the parking garage and then through the hotel to the boat dock. The rest of my family got there in plenty of time but they were more familiar with the area. I got a great video of the bats so it was totally worth the hassle."

We've always had 6 folks, so it's a super economical outing and it's BYOB and snacks. They have a little thingie for you to plug your phone in for some tunes, too.  Very little interaction with staff beyond checking in, getting the quick lay of the land, errr, lake, and when they help you dock at the end, so super COVID safe, in that respect."

They don't validate park but tell you to park at the Hyatt, which was a unexpected expense. I called the day before arriving with many questions and was told several incorrect answers, according to the employees at the table. I asked about the swan boats, specifically about the 4 seaters. I was told they had plenty but they were FCFS. We arrived the only 4 seater they have was broken. I also asked about the donut boats, \"they go out every hour and you have to reserve them in person\". That was incorrect again. I don't recommend using this company. It was a waste of time."

Hardly anyone was on the lake. The staff is super friendly. They have a tent outside and a touch less payment system. Prices are reasonable and their equipment is good too. They have some outside cubbies for your stuff should you choose to leave anything at the dock. The pics are from the bat cruise in October 2019. Highly recommend!"

On the day of the event, they were there for us for whatever we needed which really helped calm our nerves.  We were fortunate to have great weather and our guests were thrilled with the evening.  We had 50 people attend and they were all thrilled with the evening and the fact that we did something a bit different than the typical sit down at a restaurant.  Definitely recommend them."

We owe them a great deal of gratitude for the UNFORGETTABLE, FIRST-CLASS EXPERIENCE in Austin!   I happened upon this bar when my friends and I were walking around downtown Austin for a combined Bachelor/Bachelorette party. From first glance, it seemed like a typical Austin bar. Later in the night, our party was moved from the roof top bar we booked at the Marriot Hotel to the crowded hotel lobby due to a severe thunder storm. Needless to say, our large party of 30+ was broken up between random groups of party goers, diminishing the original experience.   It was recon mode time! I called every available open bar in Austin to see if they were able to help our rowdy group. Denial after denial, only ONE bar was able to step up to the challenge: San Jac Saloon!! Matt was updating me prior to our arrival. He was friendly, respectful, and accommodating. When I first arrived at the bar, I was so excited to see the large space with a full bar and lounge area. I couldn't have asked for more! The party goers AND bride and groom were VERY impressed with everything San Jac Saloon provided in ways of atmosphere, drink variety, and ability to have a safe, fun celebration.  Steve was our outstanding bartender; he livened up the night with his humor and antics! It was such a wonderful experience that words cannot fully describe the sincere gratitude we owe to Matt and Steve!!   If you want to support an authentic, passionate, and all around AMAZING bar, please support San Jac Saloon.

San Jac Saloon was definitely our fav. The beers op tap were great too. This place was super crowded on a Thursday so I can just imagine how packed it can get on a weekend. There is a speakeasy type quiter spot on one of the higher floors if you dont want live music. Either ways a great spot to have fun in Austin. Must visit."

I've been sitting on these experiences for the last couple of months ago  and decided to write a review to prevent any other person from going though a experience like mine . Back in March I was uncomfortably sexualized by the bouncer Colton . When I explained to him that I felt uneasy with his remarks he decided to smack my ass in a \"playful\" way and laugh. I walked in grabbed my friends and left . Until this day it's really disturbing to me to think a individual like himself can still be employed in a high risk environment. Please stay safe"

After unexpected lightning forced us to leave our original outdoor venue, Matt and his team were extremely helpful and provided us at the last minute with a private upstairs part of the bar to host our event. Even with very short notice, Steve the bartender gave us great service and ensured everyone was having a blast. Great drinks and great people in a fun space, I'd absolutely recommend stopping by!"

However, they have this angry Irish bartender that was picking fights with several customers. Additionally, he sat at the end of the bar ignoring customers while he visited with friends. He complained when the customers gave him smaller tips and was rude the entire evening. You couldn't say anything without him yelling at or arguing with you. Not sure if this is the vibe the place is going for, but I will not be returning. I also spoke with a few of my local friends and family about my experience and they will be avoiding the place as well."

We met this amazing man with a beard (We think Brian?) he was so welcoming! He had us take a group photo AND he let us bring our puppy inside. I bought a couple shirts and we weren't planning on returning for the night since we had a reservation at FBBC at 6:00 PM. However unfortunately our two transgender friends had a bad time... It's a long story and we left a review on their page hopefully to fix the issue but we were so upset from the bad experience. So we told ourselves hey! Let's go back to San Jac they made us all feel so welcome and Jared and the other owner know how to run a bar. ID checks TOOK 2 SECONDS FOR EVERYONE We went back inside and the process was easy and we went back inside and walked upstairs. We spent 70 dollars on an Uber just to come back!! Brian was gone which made us sad because we wanted to tell him how absolutely incredible he is. But we met this very nice Irish man upstairs and he was incredible! He fist bumped one of us and we handed him a tip and man he was such a gem. The music in both areas was rockin and we felt so welcomed and at home at this bar. You see... we had some charity shirts for Jensen and Jared because I run an organization called Castiel's Angels and they needed updated t-shirts with their new television roles and charity organizations. We were told by Brian to bring them to brewery but after what happened we were like ... no let's bring it to San Jac. They took the shirts and we are confident Jared will get them without an issue. We will be back when we come back to Texas. We are originally from Nevada, Oklahoma, and California and this road trip was supposed to be special. San Jac made up for our trip and we were treated with such respect! Best bar ever!!!"

The burrata dish was very flavor full, I wish it would've come with some type of bread or crostini, I ordered it in the side and it definitely elevated the flavors.   The braised short rib was delicious, the flavor of the polenta was to die for, will certainly order again.   Strozzapreti was sadly incredibly oily and bland, it is advertised with 'Parmesan cream' which if the massive amount of oil was supposed to be that, that is sadly a miss.   All in all a pretty good experience, will attend in person next time!"

You call in for walk in wait times and they would tell you 45 mins and then when you go to the restaurant they would not let you sit. While relaying this information, the maitre d' is talking as if she is doing us a favor and yelling 'IT IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE' - (oh like this is something we would not know) So we called 5 mins before going over to the place and they told us its 45mins wait and 5 mins later (when we reached the place) - they were no longer taking walk-ins.  If that wasn't enough- another maitre'd says they are no longer accepting party larger than 5.  Btw half the restaurant is empty visibly so. I would not recommend this place to anyone I know just on the basis of the attitude of maitre d' coz if you get such a service at the door - god knows what's happening inside the restaurant."

The others had chicken pesto, Squid Ink Malfadine and shrimp over pasta and shrimp scampi over pasta. It was one of the few Italian restaurants that is open for lunch on Sunday. They also have a small Sunday Brunch menu ias well. I highly recommend North Italia at both locations. The food is always fresh. The wine was pretty pricey by the bottle but, that is to be expected."

The white truffle garlic bread is also a must. So much flavor! Service was great. The only thing that's weird about this location is that there isn't really a place to sit while waiting for a table unless you want to stand outside... which is fine as long as it's not freezing outside. It's not enough to take away a star because the food and drinks were fabulous."

Some items are hit or miss but I typically order an app, pizza, and pasta to share between 3 and have enjoyed everything I've ordered after trial and error.   The Calamari is arguably the best appetizer they offer. It's cooked perfectly and sooo good with the lemon squeeze and arugula salad on top. Any pizza has always been delicious and my favorite pasta has probably been the Strozzapreti although it is super heavy and filling. I think the location at the Domain offers larger portions at the same price point so I would recommend that one over the Downtown location tbh.   Also, they do free birthday desserts! My friend ordered the butter cake and it was divine. We love their sangria as well and a pitcher is great for a table of 3 to share."

It seems that they may be under staffed however people seated after us were getting their food. Really bummed out about this location. Not coming back. UPDATE: it is now 6:20 pm; Apps came at 6:05 pm. Update: We got the rest of our meal at around 7:00 pm. They probably shouldnt take any reservations or as many people if they are understaffed. All in all the food was good. The waiter did apologie and was professional about it-but again it was frustrating seeing people being seated before us with no reservations and getting our food before us. They should at least give people bread to fill up on while waiting."

I used to live in LA, where it was highly recommended, and my experience there did not disappoint. Neither did it here in Austin either. All their food is local, so the menu items at each location are different. I learned that when I found that my favorite dish from LA wasn't on the Austin menu! It wasn't a problem though, because the other dishes I had here were just as good, if not better. This is one of those rare places where you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Throw a dart anywhere, and you'll be happy. We ordered the Glazed Short Rib Cavatelli, Garlic Bread, and Margherita Pizza, and all three were out of this world. If you're craving Italian, this is your place. 100%."

These make the perfect meal. Everything on the charcuterie board pears so nicely with one another. The salad is crunchy and sweet, I didn't like kale before I ate this and now I'm obsessed, it's made just the right way. The tenderloin is always cooked to perfection. It pears amazing with the polenta (underneath beef in the photo) and the veggies that comes with it. I will recommend this place to everyone who comes to visit. The staff really takes the time to explain the menu and provides excellent service. I have had an enjoyable experience every time I've come here."

                "description": "From the service to the food--this place could use some serious improvements.  This was my first trip ever to Austin and I'd heard from almost everyone I know that Austin is known for the friendly people there, but this restaurant seems to be an exception to that.  We sat down here on a Friday afternoon and there were a few people at the bar but it was pretty empty overall. We seated ourselves at one of the many empty booths and proceeded to wait about 15-20 for someone to come take our drink order.  We saw a number of employees walking around talking to people at the bar, delivering food, but for whatever reason nobody came to us for some time after we sat down. That should have been the red flag that made us get up and leave but it didn't. We stayed and will likely never return for another meal.  I ordered the spaghetti that didn't come with spaghetti noodles which is fine typically but everything from the sauce to the meatballs was very bland and just not at all what I expected.   My partner ordered the meatball sub with fries and the fries are really the only thing saving this review from one star. I love a good French fry and theirs were perfect. They offer homemade ketchup which had a little kick to it and it wasn't bad. However, the meatball sub was just as underwhelming and bland as the spaghetti.  Our friends ordered cesar salad and pizza and some other sandwich (I can't remember which one, sorry). The salad had very dry chicken but everything else in it was fine. The pizza had prosciutto and arugula and figs on it and it was way too sweet for my taste buds and nobody else in the party seemed to really enjoy it either.  Food is pretty standard price--typical for a meal in the California where I live and I guess downtown Austin as well. $18 for the plate of spaghetti I got and it was not worth it at all.  If you want to spend $20 on one plate of food, go somewhere else."

Seasonal Veg Salad is filling especially if you had a protein, that and a shared app and you will definitely be satisfied.  Margherita Pizza can definitely be shared and is a great bang for your buck.   Great lunch or early dinner spot, make sure to get a table outside!"

We initially stopped in after a nearby restaurant had a 1.5+ hour wait, and I'm really glad we did!  The staff at Quickie Pickie is super friendly, and quite helpful in making suggestions for coffees and tacos as well. The tacos are pretty decently sized, so I'd say 2-3 would be a good quantity for the average person. I personally got 3 and was stuffed by the end of them. There are a good amount of small tables inside and outside so it was fairly easy for us to nab a spot even at lunch on a weekend.  Overall, I'd definitely recommend checking out Quickie Pickie if you're in the area and looking for a bite to eat!"

The staff didn't seem to be too inviting, but they were quite busy stocking the shelves and tending to the store itself. The beers on tap were great and very affordable. The grocery items were all slightly expensive, but were quite diverse - tons of vegan and dairy free ice cream options if that's your thing. Can't wait to go back and try the tacos. I think this place is a great pre-game or before dinner drink option without any frills."

They also had a wide variety of red wines and non-alcoholic drinks. They provide free WiFi (password is winebeer) and have lots of seating inside and outside. This would be a great place to camp out with your computer and work offsite. There is a restaurant that serves hot food but you can also grab some quick refrigerated bites that are in a fridge on the right side of the place. I got the Waistline and it was pretty good, it was pretty dry. They serve their sandwiches with ruffle-style potato chips. I wouldn't come back for the sandwich but I do appreciate the beer variety!"

After placing my order along with the orders of my 3 family members, we took a seat and patiently anticipated the arrival of our food. After about 30 minutes I walked up to the cashier and asked about the food, he said he would ask about it.. Moments later the long haired man with the attitude called me back to the counter and handed me a bag of cold bagals and tacos \" I called this order like 3 times he snapped.\" (This I knew was untrue because I had 4 pairs of ears intently watching and listening for every single order that was placed.) Why he was so hostile, I cannot say. When I unbagged the food I noticed we were short a bagal. I went back to the man and asked for the bagal they had forgotten. He found the receipt which had no 'classic bagal' on it. Of course this meant nothing to me other than another mistake on their part and inconvenience for me. To my surprise he actually rung up an order for a classic bagal. \"That will be 6.50$\" I looked at him half shocked by what I was hearing. \"I don't have any intention of paying for that\" I replied. \"Ok well just get out then.\" He sneered. I understand it I hard to find good labor these days. But never have I been so appalled by any establishments customer service."

It is such an Austin spot. The inside is kind of like a bodega, but they have a working kitchen and coffee bar. We arrived 5min til 2PM when they switch to their afternoon menu. The girl behind the register told us to make a quick decision because once they put the breakfast stuff up they do not pull it out again even if you were in line. I ordered a bacon, egg, and cheese taco. This is my go to order when getting breakfast tacos. I had considered getting two, but I'm glad I didn't. Those things are loaded! I took advantage of the three different salsas that you can put on your tacos as well.  Our group sat outside on the front porch. It was nice and seclusive. We forgot there there was traffic driving right by on the busy street."

                "description": "Tipster Tours is a must do if you are visiting Austin for the first time (they also offer a tour in San Antonio's downtown if you also visit during your trip since it is only 90 minutes away from Austin). There are 5 tours available to choose from (some require a minimum of a group of 6 though) and are free! This walking tour allows for you to give any tip that you want after it is done. You are under no obligation to tip anything, but it would be nice for the tour guide to get something from you.   During our visit, we only went to the downtown tour, where you meet outside of the state capitol. My husband wanted to check out another tour but during our visit, it was raining and I just didn't want to walk in light rain and mud (yeah I'm a sore sport). For most tours, you just show up at the location. There is no need to RSVP (you can see the dates and time available on the company's website).  For our tour (about 90 minutes), we had Laura as our tour guide. Because this tour is all outside, we brought our little girl dog (she told us this was her first time having a dog on her tour). For this tour, it leaves the capitol, heads to the small park across the street, then to the governor's mansion (where you will most likely see either the governor's golden retriever, Pancake or their newly adopted little puppy golden retriever), various murals, other historical places and ends at the Driskill Hotel.   We learned so many things on this tour, the 3 of us enjoyed it (I am sure my little girl was happy to mark her territory as we walked along) and would highly recommend this tour. The walking is pretty easy and so most should be able to be fine."

                "description": "Our guide, Laura met the groups on time and was easy to locate. No reservations or upfront payment is required. In fact, the tours are billed as free! However, being \"Tip\"-ster, they are appreciative of tips and in the FAQ suggest $15-$25 per person per tour. Over a 2 day period, we took 3 tours...Music, Downtown and Eastside Arts. Each tour was 1 1/2 hours. Laura was very knowledgeable and was easily heard and understood. Questions were welcomed and answered. At the end of each tour, we were given information on what we could do next. Check the website before you go, as the time had changed from the week before when I planned. The time change was bolded, so easily found. Highly recommend these tours. Since we were on a \"stay\"-cation, we may do the others they offer soon!"

                "description": "There's a great new tour guide service in Austin and it's not to be missed!  Newly unveiled in October, this company allows participants to \"pay\" for their tour once its completed by tipping their tour guide. This is a fantastic idea because it practically ensures you'll get a fun and informative tour.   Joey, our guide, was very friendly and knew his Austin history. He delivered his facts and info with wit and humor which kept everyone attentive and entertained. I highly recommend him if it's possible to request a guide. Bonus: Joey looks like \"Lip\" from Shameless.  Have fun!"

                "description": "I've done two tours so far, both with Laura. Had a friend in town to visit a few weeks ago and we did the Downtown tour, then returned yesterday with my sister for the East Side Art tour. I have to be honest and say that I didn't anticipate enjoying the art tour (art isn't usually my thing), but it was super fun and informative. Both tours were great and completely worth the time and money. Love the idea that you pay what you can afford in order to bring tours to people who wouldn't otherwise be able to participate. I definitely plan on making my way back to take the other tours!"

                "description": "We did the East Austin brewery tour with Korie yesterday and it was amazing! Our group was made up of about 12 people from 5 different countries. Korie was informative and friendly and helped with suggestions of places to go after the tour. Now I want to sign up for more of the Tipster tours so that I can learn more about the city I've lived in for 20 years!! So whether you're an Austin native or just visiting, I'd suggest making time to tour the city with Tipster."

She took us to some cool places and it was fun to learn what the venues once were and how they came to be what they are today.  My boyfriend wrote down some places and we visited them later that night.  Walking tours are such a great way to explore a new city and I love the idea of tipsters- pay at then end what you think the tour is worth.  I also feel that Laura took the time to create a great tour and was very passionate about her Austin music!"
