                "description": "We were here for an Austin FC watch party and the vibe was awesome. The band was there, they had a huge screen for the game, and the energy was through the roof.   I tried their special beer release, Mikalla Mist, and it was a beautiful, bright, crisp Pilsner! I also had their Belgian style Gold Fist. It was nice and hoppy and perfectly sour. My final beer was a stout and it was something about the Simpsons. It was also really good.  Great place, awesome tacos, fantastic beer."

                "description": "Beer is great and reasonably-priced with good variety. The food truck out back is far better than it has any right to be, with delicious mexican food at a reasonable price.   I highly recommend the fish and barbacoa tacos, as well as the burrito+quesadilla. The chips/salsa aren't too shabby either.   Haven't tried the burgers so can't comment on those.   If you want an affordable spot to come eat, drink, and be merry in the Austin area, look no further!   Plenty of space to sit inside, or if the weather is nicer, even more space out back! You order everything at the bar, get your beer immediately, and pick up your food from the truck out back if you ordered that."

                "description": "Megaflora has reinvigorated my love for IPAs, which waned heavily after I hit the quarter century mark. I think it's the hazy kind, and they mix it up with melony goodness (love melons - all kinds of melons). Your palate ends up fielding a fruity punch; no getting your jaw kicked in by puckering hops. Great shit. They made it year round too, with the badass stylized can design and all (most of those ones are seasonal only).  With that being said, please offer La Verdad year round. Please  These dudes' merch game is on point, they really need to take their little stylized logo print for the cans and sell it on more apparel. Whoever does their art is a fucking genius. I love my Cold Glory shirt and my Megaflora mask. I love my Lazer Salad pint glass cup thing. They have a bunch of badass koozie designs. Basically, their merch game is next level already, but I see so much potential. I guess they are keeping their operation relatively small scale, and there are only so many ppl who are going to buy brewery merchandise in central Texas, but I dunno. Love the art.   At the end of the day, though, nobody is going to buy any merchandise if the beer sucks. Beerworks' beer does not suck. The new Eastern Philosophy beer they came out with is a great example of Austin Beerworks' beer not sucking. When I read it was a jasmine tea infused lager (I love jasmine tea) I had to check it out. Super solid, 7.5% but doesn't taste like it. You're supposed to drink it over ice. So novel, so well thought out, and so well executed. ABW's motto (I think) is \"Hellbent on Excellence\" and they are certainly living up to that standard. I'm so fortunate to live here in Austin with great breweries like ABW. I'll be even more fortunate when I can walk into HEB and buy La Verdad year round, but that'll come in time. Thanks, Austin Beerworks."

                "description": "I  came here the other day with a friend to have a chat and really get ready to center ourselves for the week ahead. I ordered a Lazer Salad which is a double IPA.   Here is the breakdown:   The beer appears as a golden amber color with a one finger head of white  foam. The aroma of the brew gives a tropical fruit vibe with hints of tangerine and mango mixed with some  undertones of a grapefruit hop and a little bit of pine. The taste begins with a tropical fruit sweetness mixed with a  doughy taste. As the taste lingers, more and more hop comes to the  tongue starting out with grapefruit followed by some flavors of an herbal and pine hop. The body of the brew is average in thickness and creaminess  with a carbonation level that is lighter. Overall this is a well-balanced fruity IPA that if you are not careful can put you on your ass!  #supportlocal"

                "description": "Excellent brewery, parking can be a challenge during the weekend. They have some the finest craft brews on tap in Austin. I have enjoyed their Mexican style lager and other Pilsner style brews. They have some nice tropical IPA to satisfy even the most discerning of beer drinking palates. At least 8 tables outside that have shade, which provide a nice social gathering space to enjoy a sunny Austin afternoon with a beer and some fresh air as you contemplate the mysteries of the Universe. There is also a food truck that serves some decent fish tacos."

I had 2 of the cranberry frozen mimosas, which I could have sipped on all day. I was glad to see they offered other things besides just their beer. The space was perfect for our fundraiser. My kid enjoyed the play area with the hill/tunnel and there were plenty of other kids for her to play with. I'd definitely come back here to hang out with friends or family."

Your staff was amazing. It was a perfect way to pay tribute to our friend, and y'all were so great as everyone struggled to leave on time. You could have been rigid about shooing us out the door on the dot, but your staff showed great generosity of spirit toward a grieving group, many of whom were in from out of state. Thanks for creating such a warm, welcoming space for this event. You demonstrated the best of Austin, Texas hospitality and friendliness."

                "description": "I feel conflicted giving a fairly low rating given I consistently think of ABW as one of the top handful of breweries in Austin, but I'm giving this as a rating of the taproom experience moreso than a rating of their beers. I've also only gone during Covid, so I'm looking forward to giving them a try in the future when I can comfortably get the full experience.   Compared to other patios in the area I find theirs to be pretty lacking. There were no fans in the summer and no heat lamps in the winter. Their space isn't particularly large so there are fewer tables than other locations. This leads it to be uncomfortably packed on weekends, both in terms of how close tables are and the lack of distancing enforced in lines.   One weird thing working against them is just how available their beer is around town. Every HEB and bar will have at least a couple of ABW's beers available, so they lose out on the necessity of going to the taproom to try their beers. Even their seasonals get around town pretty well both in stores and on tap elsewhere.   On that note, and to not make this review totally negative, their beer is absolutely phenomenal. All their flagships are good to great examples of the style, my personal favorites are the Sun Shovel (think blue moon but with some hop prescence) and Fire Eagle (leans more towards West Coast IPA, but has enough juiciness to be really refreshing in the summer time).   Their seasonals also absolutely knock it out of the park. Sputnik (Coffee Oatmeal Stout) is an absolute must if you're in Austin in December and is probably the best beer I've had since moving here. The Heisenberg (a combination of a Pilsner and Hef) and Black Thunder (Black Lager) are two other stand outs to me.  The food truck is good enough that if you need something to snack on while you're there you won't be totally dissatisfied, but I've usually felt compelled to go elsewhere for food.  Overall, can't recommend their beer enough, but you don't need to visit the taproom to get the full experience."

                "description": "After three months of sheltering at home, Austin Beer Works was a first outing.  They did an excellent job with social distancing, wiping down each table after guests left, and mask enforcement (when not seated at table) in a firm but polite way.    No inside seating right now and the outdoor tables are shaded and a good distance apart. It is reservations only. depending on the time you make the reservation for, you will either get an hour to enjoy your table or two hours.  They go over all the rules with you when you arrive.  They have some great beers, both on tap and in cans. You can purchase some to take home with you as well!  I ordered a sour raspberry-lemon Einhorn.  So summery and refreshing!  I ended up drinking two.  My husband had an Essential IPA and the Small Spoon session IPA.   We didn't care for the Heisenberg Heff-lager (a bit too banana-ish).  The only thing that would have made the difference from 4 stars to 5 would have been some kind of food! Even a bag of chips or pretzels to go with the beer would have been awesome! We saw a food truck parked there but unfortunately it was not open."

The staff is incredibly helpful and knowledgable, but I think the best part of the experience (other than the drinks) is the atmosphere. The interior is very spacious which makes it a perfect space for a casual happy hour with coworkers while the exterior has an abundance of seating.

They do have a larger beer selection for local breweries, parking is hit and miss, outdoor seating is mostly shaded. Inside is picnic seating. There's a food truck here if you get hungry. I feel ok bringing my dogs here.   The service is just that bad that I can't recommend them as much as their beer gives them credit for."

                "description": "Super cool space and vibe!  We stumbled (not literally) upon this as we were heading back to our hotel after visiting another brewery in the area.  We were pretty full from lunch at Franklin BBQ - but they had a food truck at the ready if your stomach started growling.  We sipped our brews out side but they have a nice sized indoor seating area too if the weather gets a  bit chilly.  Super cool neighborhood vibe as I saw several families and even a softball team enjoying a pitcher after their game.  I wish I had more time here but am bookmarking it to visit again the next time I'm in Austin."

                "description": "Stopped by over here on an early Saturday afternoon before the crowds showed up. Large space with both inside and outdoor seating as well as a food truck parked to the side.  Decided to try a couple beers: Marco IPA ($6) and Friends with Benefits ($7). The Marco is well balanced but still had plenty of hops. Friends with benefits is more on the hazy side that sticks with you. The latter paired just fine alongside one of the sandwiches from the food truck.  Service was quick as there weren't many people at the brewery yet. A couple hours later the spot was packed, so best to come early."

They have indoor and outdoor seating and from my recent visit, I discovered they even sell wine here!  They had a food truck on the day they went so I'm certain there's food to wash down your IPA."

                "description": "All the 4 and 5-star reviews are spot on. Zilker Brewing is a great venue to have a brew or two and people watch from their 6th St patio.  Their indoor taproom is closed and they are adhering to the social distancing guidelines. We had a large picnic table to ourselves and were very comfortable chilling out on a breezy Sat afternoon.   I really enjoyed their Lazy Daisy Hazy IPA. It's a wonderful IPA that has a hint of sweetness and a citrus finish. Plus 1 gave 5 stars to their LA Beer American Pilsner. This is a typical Pils that drinks lite and is a perfect brew for a warm day.   Hungry? Spicy Boys Chicken food truck is onsite and is producing wonderful spicy chicken (Duh). They offer a range of sauces from sweet to hot as hades. We went midrange spicy and felt the heat.   Not a beer drinker, they offer wine, water, soft drinks, and surprise a frose' .  Solid 5-stars!"

They have the best hazy IPAs and great sours and generally interesting seasonal drafts, friendly staff, and a super yummy food truck (Spicy Boys) right in the patio area. Only thing is it gets pretty busy on weekends so it can be tough to snag a table sometimes, but it's worth it."

I've checked out several local breweries in the area and this one is at the top of my list right now. The beer is great and the service is awesome. The staff are welcoming and willing to help you select a beer if you're undecided. Spicy Boys food truck is in their parking lot, so grab a few beers and enjoy the awesome food. Plenty of seating outside with some seating inside. This place is popular, so the seating will always fill up quickly. Dog friendly as well"

The space both indoors and out is perfect, and encourages coming together. Great for groups, but would be fine for a date night as well. A few bar stools but mostly community style seating. The food truck permanently stationed out front is great. The beer is excellent, focusing on IPAs but having many other interesting seasonals. Prices are more than fair, swag is cool. Zilker has it all, ipA to Z. Drink local!"

I went there recently with my son and DIL to enjoy their beer and treat ourselves to some outstanding Laotian street for from the SXSE food truck. My favorite was the coffee stout but the amber ale was worthy of another taste.   Located in the obligatory warehouse area the facilities encourage family and pet attendance. Inside seating has a wide variety of games for those at  a loss for words. Outside seating is ample with umbrellaed picnic tables.   Also, it's within walking distance of Q2 Stadium.   Will I be back?  Youbetcha."

                "description": "First, I must profess.  As much as I love my hometown of San Antonio, Austin really has it going on regarding the microbrewery/brewpub scene.   There are so many options in the ATX and 4th Tap Brewing should NOT be overlooked. From their awesome craft beers, to their homemade pizzas, this place has it going on!  Beer - they have precanned beers, crowlers and growlers to go, as well as a handful of fresh beer on tap if you want to hang out in this cool joint/  On my visit, they had nine beers on tap, and I settled on the \"Can You Dig It\" amber ale.  It was definitely good, and I would get it again the next time I visit, but it was pretty similar to an amber ale you can find anywhere else. A little sweet, a little caramel taste to it, and just the right amount of hops - but not too much!  I didn't sample them, but they also have a could of IPAs, a sour, and a couple of different stout types.  Now, let's talk about the food! The pizza is SUPERB! They have several pizzas geared toward carnivores and herbivores alike.  If you don't see a prebuilt pizza that appeals to you, you can always build your own custom pizza.  They also have a handful of salads.  My friends from the ATX shared the 12\" \"Backdraft\" pizza for $12.99 with me.  It was LOADED with huge slices of pepperoni, jalapenos, and house made spicy Italian style sausage. The crust was thin and crispy.  Even if you don't like beer, I recommend stopping by here for a pizza - it.was.that.good!"

We booked a table a couple hours before we were planning to meet up.  Staff was super friendly. Beer was great...loved the Running Man, didn't really care for the gingerbread. Outdoor space was nice and spacious. Definitely felt safe during covid times. Food from the truck was delicious. Props to SXSE because their food is absolutely delicious. I had the beef skewers and upgraded to crispy rice. It was so flavorful and delicious.  Thanks 4th tap for the ease of booking a table, keeping things safe during covid, serving delicious beer and having such a great food truck."

They're so good you will want more.    2.) Great staff.  Really nice, accommodating, and they keep everyone's safety in mind by wearing masks and sanitizing ALL THE TIME!  So no CardiB, I won't get Corona virus here!   3.) Great vibe.  As a woman, I often think of, \"is it safe for me to drink here alone?\"  when out at bars.  I've never had this concern at 4th Tap.  4th Tap is open and bright and has lots of space to be alone or hang with guests.   As I mentioned the staff are great and wear masks and they look out for their guests in other ways, too.    4.) Great bar seats. Great bar seats are an unrated variable and let me tell y'all, I don't slide off these seats!  They're comfy and allow me to drink more beer.  Cause it's all about the beer!"

Very reasonably priced... and several little options for self entertainment including board games, a TV, and a piano.

                "description": "Solid brewery, but I wish there was more varieties of beer offered.  I opted for the flight, which is 5 for $12, but you have to go for the 3 core and can only choose 2 orbitals. It's a shame because I didn't care for 1 of the core items, a really fruity gluten-free beer. (I had a sample and didn't really like it).  Fortunately, I asked really nicely if I could swap it out for an orbital, and the employee said she could. But when my cousin tried the same, she was denied.  +2 Vitality (Core): Spring Ale-and their lightest beer they offer. Smooth and good flavor. Perfect for if you're looking for a light beer.  Zephyr (Core): American Pale Ale-A little more hop to it, but still a smooth and light option.   Long Walk-Grapefruit IPA-Light notes of citrus, hoppy, and refreshing. But in an increasingly crowded market of grapefruit beers, this one gets lost.  Mega-Citrus One-Double IPA-Basically a stronger version of Long Walk. To me, it tasted almost identical, which makes me wonder with such a limited menu, this one is offered. (But then again, why did I choose to sample it? Not too sure myself.)  Brick Top-Robust Porter. I'm not a porter drinker. At all. But once I started sipping, I really enjoyed it. This is a popular and enjoyable one.  Sample cup pours are generous and the prices are really good for the amount you get. (I couldn't finish my entire sample flight!). There indoor seating as well as seating 'outside' in the brewery area. There is a ping-pong table, plenty of board games, and apparently, rambunctious wrestling matches that happening quarterly that brings the whole neighborhood out.  I didn't get to see any wrestling happen this time around, so all in all 4th Tap offers good beer at good prices, but I'm looking for something more to wow."

They had quite a few decent beers. But for me, what made 4th two truly memorable was the little gaming area they had. Truly unique and super awesome"

They are a part of our Divine Canine \"Barks for Beers\" and with their wonderful support we are able to provide free therapy dog service in Central Texas. Purchase a pint glass and get free pours at many Austin and area breweries!  The general manager, Erin, is amazing and strongly supports us. Look for us here every May for the entire month. We bring our amazing therapy pups to the brewery to love on everyone."

The space is nice and the AC was turned up, so it was a great respite from the heat. Got a flight of their beers and not a bad one in the bunch! The bartenders were very friendly and knowledgeable and were able to make some solid and informed beer recs for my date who had no idea what beer he wanted.   There is even a piano randomly sitting amongst the tables and a random patron got up from his table, chugged the rest of his pint, waltzed over the piano, took a seat and then started playing and belting out Billy's Joel's \"Pianoman\". A pint w/free entertainment is always a plus!   Can see myself coming back in periodically to check out the new stuff on the rotation"

                "description": "Another unassuming microbrewery in a warehouse that opens into a glorious playground for adults. I wish I had gotten the names of the bartenders because they were so sweet to my mother, who is a lightweight and does not drink alcohol, but was feeling adventurous :) They even went out of their way to grab a beer they were out of on tap, but had a can of it in the back for her to try. She loved it, so she got it on the house. Incredible customer service.   There are plenty of large picnic tables in the taproom, and a whole shelf of board games to keep you and guests entertained. There is a grand piano off to the side of the room, so you know fun times are had here.   In the brew house, there is more seating, a wrestling ring (not sure I get it?), and a ping pong table! Game on.   I really enjoyed the grapefruit hints of the Longwalk as well as the tamarind acidity of the Renewal. Tasting is highly encouraged here as well. My family and I enjoyed ourselves immensely. At the end of the night, I paid a $12 tab! Great drinkin' to do on a budget!  Thanks for taking care of us and for being awesome at life!   -xoxo"

You get to taste before you buy. Then there is the back area where they brew. Ping pong, bean bag toss and a wrestling ring. Yep. We ordered pizza and they brought it right in."

We decided we didn't need to bother reserving space as many people would come and go during the day. Ultimately most people stayed as the beer, coffee, and food were great. We were also able to secure about four continuous tables which was great to host our family and friends.   I plan to come back as I've heard their beers are gluten reduced as well."

The beertender literally saw me walk in off 6th before a tech bro on the side closest to him, saw me, then proceeded to serve the other guy...the line was so short with only 2 people (one of which was me. So I walked over to the other area and he walked away. Luckily another server saw me and helped. Not sure if he was judging me bc I was wearing a mask (I'm traveling hence being in Austin)...but check your self brah. If this review was based on him alone, I'd say f--- this place.   BUT I'm basing this review on my beer experience and that is a solid 3-4 star. I had the winter warmer during my first visit and it was tastier than others I've had. More recently I had the lightning wolf IPA which was a bit more watered down than i was expecting. Still flavorful, less hazy than I thought it would be, and very subtle."

The atmosphere is great for hanging, day drinking, or even work related meetings. They have a huge patio space and the inside is also nice to hang.  Overall where they excel at, is their tacos! I got the carnitas and asada thinking $4 for a taco was too much... but then I got them and they are bigger than expected. My bf got the two chicken tacos and we ate them soooo slow just because they had so much flavor and the meat was so tender. I'd go just for the tacos every time. Hats off to the cook!"

I wouldn't say it was the best or most authentic street tacos but it hit the spot just fine. It's a dog friendly place but if you're wanting to sit inside, let's aren't allowed because it's against health code. They have plenty of seating outdoors and you can also reserve a room for reservations if you have a big party. Beer was good and they also have a 20% off promo for wine if you order a whole bottle on Tuesdays!"

                "description": "Thursday late afternoon - stopped by here to check out yet another brewery on the street. Mostly packed with people working on laptops, but the open air setup doesn't make it feel too crowded.  Was able to quickly get a seat at the bar and order from the scannable menus. Decided on the Prodigal Pills ($6) to go along with a Breakfast Taco ($3.50). Pilsener is light and crushable, though not much flavor. Breakfast taco comes out fast - packed with eggs, cheese, pico de gallo, and bacon. Thankfully not a stale tortilla and even balance of ingredients. Finished the day off with the Double Predestination IPA ($7)- definitely more of a kick, possible some overkill on the hops.   Service is a bit hectic as the bartenders work off the many tables. Fine spot to relax, especially outside where there are tables available."

Their guacamole and tacos were good and so was their beer selection. I honestly don't remember which one we got, but just had whatever the servers recommended and they were all good.  The outdoor seating area was nice at night with the hanging lights and is dog friendly (always a bonus for us!).   Street parking is close to impossible to find in the area, but there's paid garage parking. It is pricey, but the only spot we were able to find that wasn't too far from Lazarus."

I got a Disco Prophet, a strawberry lemonade sour, and a Big Sky IPA - delicious and refreshing.  But the real star was the appetizers. We got chips and fresh guacamole, which paired excellently with the beer. But the real winner was the fried chickpeas, which were like seasoned corn nuts! I've never had anything like that, and it's enough for 3-4 people to share, despite only being $3.  The place was clean, staff was friendly, and there was plenty of seating. Definitely a must-see brewery if you're in the area."

Showed up on a Thursday evening for dinner and was impressed with the amount of people who were here. There is picnic table seating out back with tents in the front for additional seating. There is also plenty of seating inside. There is plenty of seating but the like to order may take some time to get through, so plan accordingly.   I went with the torta as my meal. The bread was authentic and the fillings inside were great. If I had to change one thing I would have asked to get the torta with chorizo although it isn't listed as a protein for the sandwich.   This is a great local spot to check out and a place I will most likely be a regular at."

                "description": "This place has plenty of outdoor seating with fans that keep the flies at bay mostly. The inside was nice and they have everything you'd need to hit the spot. Tacos and beer.   The beer was pretty good. The only sour beer they had at the time was a Rosé flavored one that unfortunately tasted a little too much like wine, but was still digestible. My hazy IPA was not hazy at all, but was still fine. I wish the beers were served a bit colder.   The fried chickpeas were a good deal for $3 we thought they could serve like 10 people. The 2 of us only made a dent in like 1/5 of the bowl. But hey, they're snacky so maybe someone could down the whole thing if they really wanted to!  The carnitas taco was really good. I highly recommend it. The al pastor was alright but didn't pack the flavor punch of the carnitas. I doused my tacos in the free salsa that was in a mini fridge nearby. The red salsa was so good and added a layer of light smokiness to my tacos. But then after a while I thought I sensed some heat? I assumed it was the green salsa so I continued to douse my tacos in the red. Idk it must have been the red salsa that was hot, because by the end of my meal I was feeling sick to my stomach. Never felt that way from spice but needless to say the beer didn't taste too good after that either. Luckily I recuperated by sipping 2 glasses of their Yeti water until I didn't want to vomit anymore.   I can't place my distaste after this meal on the restaurant since it was mostly my own doing . I assume they label their salsas and I just didn't see it."

It's a little bit if everything and that's not at all a bad thing as without exception they are all done well. We saw they were open early so we went in on a weekday thinking we could knock this off our list of a full day planned. We weren't real clear on their hours entailed so there was a not so unwelcome idea of a little day / morning drinking to get the day started. We realized this was going to leave us with the opportunity to have a few small samples or perhaps one nice pour. Upon our arrival we were impressed at how the location spanned the corner of the street and had many \"compartments\" of seating areas. I'm no way were Amy of them on the smaller side. Street parking was easy enough and we headed on in.   Very impressed to be greeted with smiling faces along with plenty of good morning exchanges. We were very pleasantly surprised to see they offered an array of espresso drinks. What a welcome pivot to our plan. We ordered up and came to realize they had food as well. Pretty happy about that. There were the assorted pastry items and breakfast TACOS! I noticed there was also queso fondido on the menu and that was screaming please try me. I went to order and was told this item is generally served later in the day. I suspect my sadness to hear this news showed as there was a quick offer to fire up the required kitchen equipment to make this happen (the salamander for those curious).   The lattes were delicious. So much so we ordered up a second round. Near completion of those the awesome cheesy chorizo goodness arrived. Bubbly hot and looking superb. It was all I could do to keep myself from grabbing a chip and putting a scoop of this bubbling sub nuclear cheese in my mouth at the price of completely burning my entire mouth. With a little patience I snuck a few small bites being mindful to blow as to not scorch my mouth. OMG was this delicious in every aspect.   Right away we knew this was just fine with a latte but was screaming for a beer to accompany this perfect breakfast fast. Such an awesome selection of beers. The bartender was beyond sweet and gave us many short pull samples of the tappers. I landed on the one that worked for me. My wife found one that worked well for her. By the time the beers arrived it was clear this was not going to be a short stop. Instead it was clear this was our impromptu plan for the morning. Completely five star experience from the word go. So much so we took the liberty of an evening stop later that week. The vibe of this place was so cool with any hint of pretentiousness. I'm no expert on all the brew options in Austin but this was clearly number one for us based on all it included and the absolute outstanding hospitality from the coffee bar to the bartender to the cook who brought us the miraculously amazing queso. No matter you plans I would highly suggest  in fact nearly insist this is a stop not to be missed. This reviews has been locked in draft land fir a while but there is no doubt this place is still thriving and for all the right reasons."

                "description": "We must have visited on the wrong day.  There were just 7-8 beers on the menu and nothing really intrigued us.  I went with my favorite kind which is a stout on nitro.  I hate wasting beer but I drank just half.  Not only were the beers not flavorful but they were not cold.    I will say their tacos were really good, and the place is super huge.  For a Monday it was pretty packed at lunch, but still spacious enough to stay 6-feet away if desired.  It's not hard to find a seat bc the place is sooo big.    Wouldn't come back for the beer, but for the tacos?  Yaaassss!"

                "description": "Central District is a great place to grab a quick beer for happy hour or get some work done. They have a generous selection of local, craft beers, including some that they brew in house. If you like sours, you can get a flight and try all of them!   In addition to plenty of space for large groups or meetings, there are plenty of outlets around for getting some work done. The staff were friendly and extremely fast. Parking can be an issue in this area, but there are plenty of paid lots nearby, so it shouldnt be an issue."

I like a good sour so I did the tasting flight.  Hubby had a Belgian Quad that was very good. The sours were quite tasty, my favorite was the Key Lime Pie Gose - all it was missing was a graham cracker crust! The staff was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu, so if you have questions they can point you the right direction. Inside there were plenty of tables and you could see the brewing room.  The day we were there they were not actively brewing."

Street parking is all around and there is a parking garage across the street at the hotel.  Experience: We came here to kill time before our flight, and I am sure glad we did. Their selection of beers were right up my alley. They had a variety of fruit flavored beers. The brewers were super friendly and inviting, I even let him choose my last flight choice. I loved the ambiance of the industrial rose gold with the green wall paint, and the live plant accents. It felt like a relaxing place to go work, study or just hang with friends."

                "description": "Really enjoyed this spot. Didn't hurt that it was 2 minutes away from where we were staying and pretty much in the center of downtown.   Love any place that offers beer flights, as it's the best way to really know what you like and what your taste buds are in the mood for. I typically go for lagers or Belgian-style beers and personally loved the Lingering Sunshine and Wit-Tington.  The atmosphere is chill, laid-back, and the plants everywhere are totally my vibe. You can tell it's frequented by drinking tours as there was constantly small buses/vans waiting outside for parties drinking inside. Music also made for a nice ambiance and the girls who took care of our order upon arrival were very sweet and informative."

Was so good we came back Monday to finish off the weekend.    There's a good variety of beers so we did eight tasters and ended up with three separate glasses.  They had a special when we were there called the Apple cinnamon sour; it tasted just like apple pie.  If they reproduce it, I highly recommend a glass.    The place itself is super posh, establishment clean, service was great and staff very friendly.  I would def recommend this brewery.  Oh, met Cooper...he's one of their brewers.  He's really nice."

                "description": "I stopped here on a whim while exploring Austin via Lime scooter, and it was a solid find! A no nonsense brewery where I genuinely enjoyed every beer I tried-- A gem!   We sat at one of the handful of the tables they have sprinkled in the sidewalk outside. The street was pretty low key for being to close to 6th, so it was enjoyable on the sidewalk! You still order at the bar which was no problem, and the service was quick and efficient!   Rhythm is a Dancer stole the show for me! It's a sour, but it is muted enough that I could drink multiple without my mouth being pursed from tartness! The Kolsch was great, as well. We also tried the soft pretzel which was SO airy which I loved. It also came with a garlic sauce so not your typical pub pretzel, but a very tasty take on one!  Employee's wore masks and maintained distancing, as well, which is great. We found this brewery on a list of spots still enforcing safety restrictions, and can confirm they were!"

Bumped a star bc of their limited seating (one barrel table) outside, the main bartender was not very helpful and some of the drafts we wanted to try were out.   We sat outside and people watched and enjoyed our flights.  Really liked wit-tington ale, weiz of TX, short straw stout and violet crown. Bummed they were out of the Firenze estate."

The standout was the Wit-tington by far. The Strawberry Wayne was pretty unique and had a nice pink hue to it. The  staff was very friendly and gave great suggestions of which beers we should try. You can get a crowler of any beer, which was great for us to take home! Can't recommend CDB enough!  Really enjoyed the indie 2000s playlist as well!!!"

Customer service and courtesy are typically top-notch because...well...it's a brewery.   First let me point out this rating is based more heavily on service than the wonderful beer they served( I'd give a solid \"B\" on that spectrum).  Walk in, bartender says \"hi\" and starts cleaning mugs. We look around trying to figure out when he'll actually approach us. Ok...oh look menus, guess I'll grab one. Standing there waiting for the \"what can I get ya?\" Or \"first time? Here's our menu, let me know if you have any questions.\" Bartender jargon. Nothing. My wife says \"yeah it's our first time here.\" \"Oh, ok\" responds bartender. Finally we decide on our own we'll do a flight and order a pretzel. I'm assuming they specialize in IPAs since they have 4! He takes the order.   I return a beer because a random fly fell in one. I tell the bartender I hate to waste good beer but can I get a new one, a fly fell in mine.\" No reaction, he just asks which beer and refills it.   Good craft beer, subpar service."

My sister and I were visiting Austin, TX awhile ago and wanted to do an Escape Room -- There is one right next to this little brewery, so after we finished the Escape Room (we escaped, by the way!), we decided to enjoy some beer and celebrate.  This spot is in a less busy part of the city and there were not a lot of people inside, but I was in love with the interior decor and the ambience. Very calm, chill and relaxing.

The women-lead space and brewski selections are rockin', but they're missing a key component--wifi.  I know, I hate sounding like your typical phone-using human being, but every time I'm downtown wifi is super handy. It helps us decide where we want to go afterwards! Anyways, Central is set up like your typical clean and succulent-friendly microbrewery these days. They have board games and serve yourself water (sparkling OR still. THAT's a first!!). They don't have outdoor seating, but plenty of seats indoors. They also sell small bites and other drinks like wines and ciders. Their guest list is pretty solid with brews from Zilker and Independence to name a few other Austin loves. I got a taster of Central's own beers. We really did not enjoy the milkshake IPA that had a strong vanilla aftertaste. It was way too sweet, but to each their own.  Their restrooms are clean and they allow outside food too. SCORE! Now if only the owners would install some wifi...our taptender told us that the owners are still getting that set up. So that's a great sign! They also don't validate parking, so if you need to drive to get here...come on a Sunday when parking is free downtown. Pro. Tip."

You can of course get a flight of beer to taste multiple flavors and I'd recommend doing that...then going back and buying a pint of what you loved the most.   The service was A-1. The woman at the front was very friendly and was open to answering my 500 questions about when they opened, if I can taste different beers, what're those people in the corner with the purple drink drink drinking? In addition to that I'm pretty sure the owners were also just hanging out in there and they were chatting with different guests which made it feel very homey and inviting  Price- on par with other breweries  Great location! Especially if you're just moseying around town ( like I was) and happen to stumble upon it.   The aesthetics are on point. Beautiful Edison bulbs and plan fixtures. Both benches and tables so you can come with a large group or chill on a date."

                "description": "We went here a month or so ago in the evening. It has some indoor seating, and a loooooot of outdoor seating along with some very tasty food trucks! Perfect place to bring a group of friends, all get your own food, and then get some drinks at meanwhile brewing. You can order drinks both indoors and outdoors, so if you feel like just staying outdoors you can definitely do that! Drink options are super varied, so likely you will find something you like... Even if you're just sleepy and need coffee :) Definitely check it out if you're looking for an outdoor drink and food place to hang out with friends.. dog.. etc. It is kid friendly, too!"

                "description": "I've been hearing \"You need to checkout Meanwhile Brewing sometime\" ever since it opened, and I FINALLY got to check it out!  First off, the building is massive and almost looks like a Church...for beer (aka the best kind.)  When you enter, you are greeted by bright and welcoming decor, and plenty of plush, velvety booths as well as tables/chairs for additional seating in their \"private event\" space.  There tends to be 3-4 bartenders at all times which is great, because there really isn't a great space for lining up so patrons end up in cluster/blob.  (Not super important.)  Beer wise, there is an extensive menu with an adequate mixture of flavor profiles.  They have several non-alcoholic options include coffee and tea, as well as some mixed drinks and even a sake?!    Their Black Lager was a personal favorite - smooth and despite its dark color from malt, it wasn't overly malty.  All around great flavor and a tad too easy to drink (wink, wink)  Their Blueberry beer had a slight tartness and sweetness.  Very pleasant.   Their Hefe was slightly disappointing for my tastes - it just felt a little flat.   Regarding their outdoors space, wow.  We came during music performances in the evening, and they went all out!  I will note that it was incredibly loud and hard to hear, so if that's not the vibe you like, avoid their music sessions.  They have three food trucks on-site to help you stay awhile!  Plenty of picnic tables and loads of doggy friends to meet!  Overall, great experience and will definitely continue to make the trek out!"

                "description": "Meanwhile is a great place to meet up with friends who don't want to venture too far beyond city limits. Better yet its family friendly with a soccer field, playground set, and more open space for kids to round around.  The drink menu has a little bit of everything from coffee to cocktails and of course beer. If its a warm day I'm going with the Who Doesn't Like Pineapple because it's tart and refreshing. It'll give you summer beach vibes but without the annoying tourists and sunburn. Well maybe not the sunburn part since it's TX.  With several food trucks on site it tempts you to order something from each to share with the group. Just make sure to save room for dessert at Besame!"

                "description": "Such a fun brewery about 10 minutes from the airport! We had several beers and got food from the taco truck! I tried the Pub House Ale, the Pilsner, and the Marzen. They were all super delicious! They also allow you try samples at the bar. If you're not a beer drinker, they have cocktails, wine, and coffee to choose from. They have tons of food trucks outside that seem to rotate daily. There was a taco truck today we really enjoyed. There's tons of space indoor and outdoor for seating. It has a great vibe and is also dog friendly. Highly recommend, especially if you're waiting to check into your air bnb! Definitely check it out!"

                "description": "I'm a thirty something with a toddler and this is my paradise! Meanwhile is practically in my backyard in Southeast Austin. I can choose from a variety of beers, cocktails, wine, Frose or coffee to sip on AND they have a selection of 4 food trucks to fill my belly. Wait for it though .... I can enjoy these things while my kid expends her energy in a safe, kid friendly environment! Wooohoo I'm here for it! This absolutely is my favorite spot in town right now. Our family can't get enough of it.   My favorite beers are the sours! They have pizza, BBQ, taco and ice cream food trucks, so everyone can surely find something they love with this variety. The open outdoor space is magnificent. On the weekends recently they even have some flea market vendors out which is fun. The best part though is the playground for my little one! Also the astroturf seating area with the little hill my kid loves to do rolls down! At this stage of my life I don't think it can get much better than Meanwhile. I love this place."

                "description": "Meanwhile Brewing is massive. Meanwhile has the following food trailers: pizza, taco, barbeque, and ice cream. They have a great little stage for entertainment, a good variety of beers (as well as wine and cider), and it's extremely kid and dog friendly. There is street parking (there's a parking lot, too, but it's definitely small for how many people can fit in this establishment). We thought the bartenders were friendly and efficient."

                "description": "Update:  Since management respinded to my review and mentioned an outdoor beer station being added, I'll up to 3 stars and try again after they do open the outdoor annex, at which point I'll update ratings again.  The beer and mixed drink choices were large btw.  :)  Cool venue, so I bumped Meanwhile Brewing from 1 to 2 stars.  MEANWHILE (so aptly named), below are pictures of 2 lines to get a beer.  Neither moves fast.  Really.  At a brewery?  Is this their 1st rodeo?   What's the point of having a venue if you have to wait in line 30 min or more for a beer?!?  I'm just gonna bring my wife her beer and she can hang with friends while I simply get in line again and try and tell myself not to be grumpy that my life here will be a circle of order a beer, drink it in line to get the next beer or perhaps letting an advance beer get warm so I can be out of line for a few minutes between trips."

                "description": "One of my favorite spots in Austin. I love the venue under the live oak trees, the open space, and the playground. No hard alcohol, but I feel they make up for it with their creative cocktails and house-made seltzers.   The food trucks give enough variety that there is something for everyone -- pizza, BBQ, Mexican, and the BEST ice cream! But the best part for me is sitting back in the Adirondack, cold drink in hand, watching my little one playing on the playground with a live band in the background.   I hope we continue to get more places like this in Austin!"

                "description": "Easily my favorite brewery in town.   The food trailers here are all bomb and on point. This is an awesome spot for lunch. You can get everything from world class tacos, great pizza to Texas Monthly Top 50 ranked BBQ.   The beer is absolutely amazing. The collabs with local breweries and bars such as Cosmic and St. Elmo are all cool and tasty -AF.   The to go beer options are always great. You can have a few pints and come home with some amazing beer to finish the night at home watching a movie with.   I've seen a few shows here. Saw Eternal Champion here and had a blast. The venue is great for live music, anytime they have a live show its worth the cover to hang out and see some live tunes and have some amazing beer.   The best thing about Meanwhile for me happens to be that its extremely family friendly. They have a playground a soccer court and large open field that is perfect for flying kites. They are all fenced in so its the perfect spot for me to bring my daughter to play. My family comes here regularly and we really enjoy the family friendly aspect Meanwhile offers.   I could go on and on about how much I love the beer and just this space in general. Its really do not miss Austin location now.   Thanks for offering so much good stuff Meanwhile you rock!  edit: I almost forgot to mention how awesome the coffee and breakfast tacos by Pueblo Viejo are here."

                "description": "A hidden gem! Meanwhile is one of my favorite places in Austin! It is located in the middle of a business park, but once you get on the grounds you feel like you are truly transported. Not only do they have their brewery and taproom on site, they also have 4 food trucks! You can pair your beer with tacos, pizza, bbq, or amazing ice cream!  My personal favorite beers here are their sours. They keep their menu fresh and change it up frequently, so if you see something you might enjoy, go quickly! The best part about their location is the open space and seating area. There are so many tables and benches throughout the back and they even have a stage with live music on certain days. The environment is so fun and you will see lots of dogs and children around too. I appreciate that they have a playground for kids.   If you are not a beer drinker, they also serve cocktails made with seltzers and amazing coffee drinks! I love their vanilla latte and will opt to get that most of the times I go there!  Overall, there is something for everyone here! Between the drink selections, food options, seating area, and live music, everyone in your group will have fun! I will always recommend Meanwhile!"

                "description": "Here's a secret, a lot of folks who go to these breweries don't go because of how good the IPA or the cider is, they have a long list of other factors.   We had an IPA and a cider, they were good, not life-changing, but decent. I have yet to sample the entire beer selection but I will. And you know why? Because of everything else the place offers ensures I'll be back.  The tacos from the taco truck were really impressive, exceeded expectations actually. The pizza was equally excellent.   The set up for the grounds was spot on. The trees, the playground, the environment with families, dog owners, young people, it all meshed well because everyone had a section that fit their methods of socializing.  You can't tell me this isn't a science because significant thought (and money, I'm sure) went into developing this experience. Bravo!  Now I need to drink some more of their beers."

                "description": "This is probably one of the best breweries that opened in ATX in 2020 - during a pandemic at that! Since their opening, they've been doing gangbusters business with no signs of slowing.  Obviously, when you visit, you'll notice they have a huge space and $$ was spent to fully build it out. It's not a small brewery that grew up, it was built to be big. There is plenty of seating inside and even more seating outside on the turf + mulch area. But, be forewarned this place is busy. Saturday afternoons are packed with people with pets and families. There is a playscape so parents like this place.   Now, to their beer. Meanwhile brews consistent and good beer. They have a variety of beers from regular German Pils to New England IPAs. Nothing infected and nothing with off flavors. They always seem to have a good rotation of beers.   Don't like beer? They also have wine, cocktails and coffee! Something for everyone.   While they don't serve food, there are numerous food trucks to order from.   Even though the lines can get long, they do move pretty quickly (especially the line that is at the main entrance).   We would come here more often if it were closer to us, but getting across the river is the hardest part. :)"

There was a kid's bday party there and we didn't notice (yay for our dog). There was plenty of water to help yourself to as well as a nice list of beers. They were all incredible (even the German ones)! They also have some cocktails, frozés and coffee available. We got an iced dirty chai on our way out, since their coffee looked and smelled good. WOW! Nice and strong! I am very picky about coffee being too weak and having to add extra shots of espresso, but this was on point!  We will definitely be back! Great, friendly staff, and we especially loved that we could order beer starting at 10a on Sunday! In early and out early!"

                "description": "Easily missed if you're only looking on the main drag but this brewery is just off S Lamar on Oltorf. The beers are excellent of course but don't skip the food. Their pizza is the highlight to me. I would suggest getting slices because they are reasonably priced and it gives you the opportunity to try different options out. They have a wagu beef slice which is unique and delicious. My personal favorite is their Calabrese which I would describe as an elevated pepperoni pizza.  This is a great place to go if you don't have a reservation on a busy night because they have a ton of seating and parking.   Also check the schedule because they have live bands playing in the main dining hall."

First off, I really liked the atmosphere. there is a bunch of outdoor seating, which is always a plus.  For drinks I got a flight, so I got a variety of beers. Overall, they were pretty good, however, they don't have a lot of variety in the styles available. I also got a slice of pizza, which was much better than I expected for brewery food. All said and done, it's definitely a spot worth visiting, but isn't the best that Austin has to offer."

You can spread out and work. You can dine in and chill. Go alone or with a party and still feel like you have the place to yourself.   Food/drinks - i have yet to have a bad food item from these guys. Everything is delicious and surprisingly thought out. It will take you by surprise. And the drinks. There are plenty of options to taste and enjoy based on your preferences.   $$$ - it is a little pricier then you might expect. But truthfully, for what you get, I will continue to come back here and spend the money.    Give it a shot. I do not think you will regret it. I would recommend this place over Pint House pizza or even Dominoes ;)."

                "description": "10-24-21  As you can probably figure out, I like beer.  This is my drink of choice. And visiting breweries just takes the experience to the next level.  Quality/Quantity - Beer was mediocre. My family did not like the menu here, so I was pressured to quickly finish my beer and sadly leave.  It should be illegal to only drink one beer...  We hit Trader Joes on the way back and realized they carried the whole line of their beer, so as you can guess, I got two more six packs:)  Now, I am happier.  Atmosphere - You need a much bigger parking lot, especially since almost everyone drives a huge truck. We got lucky with a space, but had to share some of the space with the huge truck to the right and the huge truck to the left, LOL. Teri Joyce and the Tagalongs were playing tonight. They did a good job, the place was hoping. Both the inside and outside spaces are large; however, again too large for their parking lot. Can some people carpool? They also had a small outdoor stand to order beer and food. Additionally, there were plenty of seats at the bar. The team seems to be working pretty hard.  Service - The bartender was just okay. Not much to write about, I ordered, he gave me the beer, and I left; still left a tip though :)  Price - $6.50 + $1 tip  Owner Suggestion - Did I say you need a bigger parking lot? Wish I had more time to enjoy your place, but no fault of yours. Hopefully next time. Keep up the good work."

                "description": "We usually love ABGB, good food, good atmosphere, good service. It's a nice afternoon and we decided to come over for lunch and sit outside with our dog. Food was great as usual and initial service was awesome.   When we'd arrived, someone else was there with a big dog. Saw this person leave the dog unattended for a few moments and let it walk around off leash. This person leaves and everyone sitting outside can hear the staff saying someone let their dog poop by the tables, left it, and how gross that is. We agree, that's completely rude.   After a few minutes two staff come over to our table and loudly say something to the effect of  \"hey, you let your dog sh*t over here.\" We politely explain it was not our dog, perhaps it was the person here before us. Sounds like they knew that person because they walk off saying  \"x would never do that\".   I get it, super uncool to clean up after someone else's dog, but also uncool to blame us for it. We arrived, walked right by the same staff and directly to a table (no bathroom breaks). Created an uncomfortable situation which prevented us from staying longer and ordering more."

                "description": "It looks like a really nice beer garden.  The weather looked like rain so we sat inside.  They do have restrooms and they are clean.  Food is hard to decide if you are lactose intolerant.  We found a Pulled Pork and it came with a pint of beer. We also got two pizzas for the rest to share.  We had the wagyu and 2 choice of the specialty pizza cauliflower. That was a good choice.  I don't care for beer so I had a cider.   They were out of watermelon So I had cranberry.  Very tart but refreshing.  The bar tenders were all so friendly and nice.  I didn't see anywhere to get beer flights and my son had his bday.  Nothing special like a drink or come out to table.   It's a nice atmosphere with nice folks."

The food alone is worth coming for, it's upscale apps that are absolutely delicious and they also have pizza.  The con (and why I'm only giving 4 stars) is that this is a beer garden that has ONLY SIX beers available - all brewed in house. I wish they at least had some local options that made the beer list a bit longer, after all it is a beer garden. They also have a small list of ciders and wine available. The \"Industry\" Pilsner was great and a nice light beer but"

                "description": "*COVID Update*   ABGB is a must visit when in Austin. Parking in their lot is ample. Restrooms are on-site in the corner. Seating is self-served both indoors and outdoors, and there is free WiFi! Masks aren't required here, and most people don't wear them inside or outside. The menu is on a QR code, which is posted on each table. The water station is in the back.   I got the beer flight $15 as it was my first visit. The pilsner is definitely my favorite; it's a popular one! It's odd that there's only 6 choices, but it helps especially for those who are indecisive. If you order one beer, it's about $6. When I visited on a Sunday afternoon, they had live music and many couples were dancing along. I totally missed the memo to bring my boots and hat.   I tried the Calabrese and homemade sausage pizza ($3.50 per slice). Both were delicious.   Obviously with the live music, it's loud inside, but it's a fun place to hang out with larger groups."

I did a flight to sample their good stuff. It's 5 five ounce pours so it's filling! The bruschetta was good but needed more salt or balsamic dressing. It was still tasty. But the stuffed peppadews were really good. I'll need to come back to try their pizza. There's indoor and outdoor seating. Staff know their stuff. Parking seems to fill up fast. Right off of south Lamar"

It's nice because I can keep a running list of spots to check out when I find myself nearby and I don't need t hop on a zoom meeting with a client. ABGB is one of those spots. I stopped in here for a quick beer during covid and it was pretty solid, this is my first time back.   The wifi is good, clearly. I'm writing this review and it hasn't faltered at all. The beer selection is small, but what I've tasted has all been solid. Both in flavor and body, they are true to what they are brewing. Quiet and mellow atmosphere is lovely is for getting some work done and maintaining a medium focus. The garlic fries smell delicious.   The only downside is that I'm getting a little bug action. But I'm also sitting under a tree, in Texas, in June.     I'll be back and probably to eat."

Everyone is helpful and friendly regardless of how busy they are.   Food and service aside, this is just a great place to spend time with the people you love/like. Every time I've been here has been memorable.  Showed up on a Saturday afternoon with a party of 25+ and we immediately found a group of picnic tables and spent the next several hours just enjoying each other's company.   Everyone enjoyed their food and drink but what we'll remember and what I'm most grateful for is the ambiance and hospitality at ABGB.   There's plenty of places to go eat, but when you have a large party and want to make memories with an Austin feel, look no further."

The pizza was so so. Crust was fine, but it was too salty. Yep, pizza is salty, but this pizza was too salty.  They gave our salad away. It was not there with our pizza. Someone else thought they had ordered a salad, but hadn't, and they have our to them.(they admitted this) ??! Really? So we get to wait, while the pizza gets cold.  They are still working kinks out to handle the crowds. They take food orders at the satellite bars, but don't have menus there. So the bartender explains the menu instead of pouring and collecting on the check. A second person there would be helpful.  The salad? Kale salad, and it was delicious. Bits of ginger in it. Yummy.  We probably won't go back. If a kale salad is the only thing to pull you in, there are other places that better deserve your patronage."

Beautiful artwork inside and outside showcasing local artists. This place is very well upkept and always clean.   This place is busy A LOT. Expect major lines to get drinks on the weekend. The inside is a bit loud and stuffy during busy nights even with the large doors open. We love sitting at the picnic tables outside. Majorly dog friendly and kid friendly. If you don't enjoy beer they also have cocktails.  We seem to always miss the live music, but they have a large stage where you can see well anywhere you sit. Parking lot in back gets filled pretty fast, but it's easy to find spots on the street nearby.   They could use more draft options and I have not tried the food yet, but this breathtaking place is definitely worth a stop!"

                "description": "First off this place puts on the WOW factor soon as you walk in. The outside seating is what you will see as you walk into the facility. Ample room both outside and inside to sit with your friends or family members. Either way as you walk in, you want to go to the left of the building towards the Tap Room. Yes, it's labeled on their wall.  The Tap room is where you will order your beer, food, and start your tab. Once you order your food you can pick where ever you choose to sit. They do give you an LED lighted pager. So once they page your, there is a particular location where you go pick up your food. It won't be in the tap room. LOL  Their large pizza holds 8 slices. Feeds two to four people depending on your tape worm's needs. Their pizza is phenomenal!!!   They have a great home brew selection on tap and if you are not a beer drinker, they have a great hard liquor selection.  Parking is a dirt parking lot (so if it rains expect mud) and could potentially get limited when this place is busy.  Again ample seating so it's a great place for large groups."

We ordered the grilled broccolini which was out of the world along with a pepperoni, sausage and mushroom pizza. The sausage was clearly made in house and delicious, and the sliced mushrooms were fresh.  The place is expansive without being overwhelming, and there were several parties being held. Overall, we had an absolutely wonderful time."

They also have a variety of cocktails too which is great if you want something a little more lively. They also have good food. We got the pizza with three toppings. The crust was just right and the toppings were good quality. As for greens, we had the broccolini as well which had a kick of spice and umami. There were some items not available. The lines move fairly quickly too but I never felt rush. They also have a gallery featuring art works and a stage out back with live entertainment on weekends. Parking is out back so don't get too discouraged if Waze takes you to the front - you will have to go a street over to find the entrance to the lot."

                "description": "Really great vibe. Especially for fall evenings in Austin, sometimes there is a band playing.  Their white pizza that is artichoke and spinach is delicious. They also have cocktails, not just beer, which is nice if you aren't a beer lover.  The blueberry smash is too sweet for me but my friends loved it.  The bratwurst is good too.  I wanted to try their creamsicle pop but it was sold out.  Parking lot tends to be full so you may have to find street parking."

                "description": "Family and pet friendly brewery with awesome beer, cocktails and food.   Stopped in on a Thursday evening for a work event and was impressed with the amount of people here.   Walked up to the bar and was impressed with the liquor selection and beer choices. This being a brewery I was pleased to see a cocktail option. The pizza is super good here too. Definitely grab a pizza when you're here.   The only negative thing is the parking situation. Parking goes very, very quick. If the parking lot was larger this would be an easy 5/5. There is limited parking out front, around back and across the street but a majority of parking is a brisk walk away."

                "description": "First of all, the general experience was underwhelming. The only thing this place has going for it is its size and flexibility. It's an easy spot for big groups. I wasn't too impressed with the food, either with the variety of things on the menu, or the flavor of the food itself. The best thing I got was a kids' hot dog, which was an all-beef hot dog on a decent bun, exactly what I was craving, and very difficult to mess up. The pretzel and German potato salad were just ok. The beer cheese dip for the pretzel had a funny after-taste. My friend wasn't too impressed with her drink. We thought it was weird that they have a \"Rachel\" sandwich that's really a Reuben. Rachels are usually a spin on a Reuben, either made with turkey, or cole slaw, or something other than corned beef and sauerkraut that's on a usual Reuben. Anyways, they didn't get my order quite right, but corrected it. (I asked to add cheese on top of the hot dog, and at first it came out naked.) Missing a special request isn't too unusual, and they corrected it right away, so it wasn't a major deal.  But things got weird with some friends' orders. We were part of a large group. Two people were wearing political shirts. It was at the very least a strange coincidence that both their orders were not fulfilled. They waited and waited for their food and it never came. Others who ordered after them got their food sooner. There's no proof they were singled out for their shirts, but it sure looks suspicious... The staff said they'd correct it, but they were still slow to do so."

I ordered food as well and got the Rachel Sandwich and a friend got the burger. She loved her burger and I absolutely loved my sandwich! The meet was amazing, and the bread was perfectly toasted. They had a slaw as well that was so unique, I would absolutely order again. We also all split the pretzel which was decent, but would probably recommend a sandwich or pizza over the pretzel."

We ordered the Pale Ale, Mosaic IPA, Warm German Potato Salad, and a Margherita Pizza.  Let's start with the vibes: pup friendly (even \"indoors\"), food offered, fans blowing, plenty of seats inside and out and cozy Austin decor that makes you feel welcomed.   The Pale Ale and the Mosaic IPA both tasted similar, both were quite sour, more like a cider in my opinion.   The Warm German Potato Salad tasted like mashed potatoes mixed with a tinge of vinegar. The Margherita, lots of sauce, not enough toppings."

All of the pizzas are *chefs kiss*. The frozen espresso martini are hands down my fave bev on the menu. The customer service is next level. I had a friend visiting from out of town so we asked what time the fire pits come on and they immediately jumped to light them up for us. 14/10 suggest this spot!"

                "description": "They got rid of the white pizza! The new offering lacks all the things that made the former one good are missing (garlic forward + artichokes + spinach  = delicious -- replaced by \"The Fulcrum\" = weird pickled peppers, sun-dried tomato \"pesto\" that is not even remotely pesto, and rather flavorless except for the pickled peppers. Pass.   You know when someone comes from out of town and you talk a place up and then go there... and the thing you'd just recommended is a weak/borderline gross version of what you'd just talked up? And then you feel strangely responsible? :(   Bring back that white pizza, please!"

                "description": "I stumbled in here on a rainy Friday night and boy was I glad I did! This converted warehouse space is gorgeous complete with cafeteria style tables and leather couches. The outside garden has a stage, fire pits and busy tables filled with students, Texans and tourists. It's all cropped by the traditional TX sting lights above your head.    There was a DJ spinning 45s inside that could be heard both in and outdoors. It was a sound garden of absurdity that wafted through the air. Think, Rosemary Clooney but knocks offs of what he could find at Goodwill of her. (ATX, don't ever change!)  The bar is in the back and after getting the lay of the land, I stepped up to the bar in the back and asked for a recommendation. The bartender asked what I liked and promptly brought me a dark porter in a plastic cup. It was delicious! It was the perfect way to end the night.  Hours and location information can be found on their website. Now scoot along, lil' doggie! This festival of fun is waiting for you."

Some of the best beer out there I think and they've got awesome food to go with it. Burgers are really good along with all of their bar type things.  Pretty good happy hour specials during the week.   Good amount of space inside and out with a ton of parking and it is right next to Better Half so easy to hit both places without having to go anywhere."

I was lucky and somehow got in line to order at the counter before the line got too long, and the food/drinks came out quickly after that.  It's above-average bar food, with nice and crispy curly fries and in-house baked chocolate chip cookies, which were nice surprises.  The one tip I'd make about Hold Out Brewing is to Uber there.  We drove, and the parking was somewhat terrifying.  There's actually a good-sized lot out back, but it gets really busy during happy hour."

                "description": "In this town, if feels like there's a brewery popping in every corner. I'm not complaining, simply making an observation. But what this means though is that you have to do something to stand out. You can't just brew your own beer and sell it in the warehouse, those days are gone.  Hold Out has a unique and very advantageous situation. They're next to Better Half (I think they're the same owner or partners?) and make great use of the property together as well as the opportunity to collaborate.  Additionally, Hold Out has their own food. While their menu isn't as complete as Better Half's, it's pretty decent for a \"happy hour at the brewery\" trip.  But you can't asses them without considering the Better Half contribution, which I've reviewed separately and loved.  The beer is good, although it lacked range in variety as there wasn't much darker beer. A lot of IPA selections, which I'm sure the market loves...but I don't.   I stuck to the lager and a couple other beers, all with weird names but I guess that's the game these days.   I had the vegan frito pie which was way more delicious than expected and had an interesting mix of flavors.   Of course, it all tied in well because we had dinner from Better Half and I don't need to tell you how good that was. You gotta try the grilled halloumi, trust me.  All in all, good vibe, great property."

I like that then allow smaller pours such as 8oz and 10oz. The staff was super friendly and easy to talk to and ask questions. Boyfriend and I both ordered the Hold Out Classic burger and it was just that - a classic burger with smash style patties. Super tasty. I ordered the comeback sauce on the side which helped make the burger not so messy. The curly fries were good too although I felt they were a little over cooked (but my boyfriend liked them crispy). If we lived in Austin, we would definitely be returning to Hold Out! Oh and also great seating options from indoor, outdoor with a covered patio and then non-covered outdoor seating."

The food arrived an hour and a half later. I am confused how it could've taken so long for food to arrive. To make matters worse, the waiter said \"sorry for the hold out\" and laughed when he gave us our food. I held out on my laughter for that one. It should not take that long for pancakes or burgers to be prepared. No clue what was going on behind in the kitchen but the chef definitely holding out on cooking or something. Hopefully this was a one off experience, but I'm not holding out faith for this place."

Out side under cover were rows of picnic tables, beer was served inside and the food was brought out.  While the beers were outstanding, the food was unexpected, beyond the burgers which we did not try, they had a few interesting dishes such as a Crispy Artichoke  and Pimento and a Indian chickpea inspired take on the chili Frito pie, both were excellent and we are not vegetarians, we just wanted to try something new.  The smoky Rauchbier styled Marzen (?) was unusual and worth a taste but a pint was a little over the top.  Note for those who commented on slow service we were there on a Wednesday and there were no issues, I am sure a nice weekend might be another experience."

The burgers are great and the crispy chicken sandwich (during the week ar lunch) is one of the best in Austin and for the price is perhaps best value too. Have had some ciders that seemed very vinegary and perhaps not right but food is always great."

                "description": "Hold out is a fairly new spot in Austin and is next to better half so we had to check it out! They have mostly Hazy juicy IPA's, so if you love those this is the place for you! My husband is one of those people and had a great time. I love sours and got the \"syke!\" And I thought it was great. They have food as well which we didn't get to check out but it looked awesome! I grab a cute cropped tank before we left. Hold out has a covered patio with a good amount of seating and seating inside. Our favorite part by far was the bartender that helped us. We didn't get his name but he has red hair and a mustache to match. He gave us some awesome recommendations to check out in Austin. Go for the beer stay for the hospitality!"

                "description": "Good place if you're looking for a lively spot to take friends or out of towners into the heart of Austin. Good drink prices and a good selection of beers, but I didn't find the two beers I tried to be anything special. They have a great food menu and the burger is really good, but it took quite a while for my food to come out. The ordering process was also a little chaotic -- long, long lines and loud music at the counter so it's hard to communicate with staff. Parking can be a nightmare if the lot in the back is full, and the roads are very narrow and uneven when you arrive at the brewery. Ultimately I think this is a good place for those looking to get the Austin experience, but I don't think I'll add this place to my usual rotation."

                "description": "If you have never tried Adelbert's, what are you waiting for? Adelbert's is located in a prime location near Burnet and more predominately, the Domain. Skip the crowd at Rock Rose Ave and come to Adlbert's instead. Not a single thing I would change about Adelbert's!    Adelbert's serves more than just brews, they also serve ciders, meads, wines, and non-alcoholic beverages. If you have never had meads, I'd start slow with a sample, as it's very potent in flavor! The Dale was refreshing, while the Sauvignon Blanc was a crisp white wine.   If you are wanting to host events of any kind, Adelbert's is here for it. Scott, the owner and Sean, the manager are incredibly accommodating!! They were so sweet to open early and to even allow the food truck on site to help cater to us. If you are looking for a quick tour, you can ask them as well to check out their facilities."

Unfortunately, they do not allow dogs inside. As a dog owner who lives in the brewery district, this establishment is simply off my list anytime I go out with my little gal.   I do love this place but it's hard to give a perfect score to a place I can't frequent. Especially when they have ~10 competitors in a 5 minute radius and none of them share the same policy. As a result, I am updating my review from 5 to 4 stars."

There seems to be good social distancing. There's hand sanitizer on the counter. Growlers are a possibility as are CDB sodas. The people are friendly and seem to know about the beer. I only discovered this place after the pandemic it started so I've never really spent time inside. But I've been sitting on my own porch enjoying it quite a bit and when things get back to normal I hope to spend a few hours at Adelbert's."

The neat thing is that they have artwork that's for sale on the walls. The art adds character and is a large variety of different themes all from local artists.   No good is served inside the brewery but there is a really good food truck on the outside.   The beers are amazing and you can sample before you buy.  Liked this brewery and beers are very creative."

They have a Nintendo Wii with Mario kart and two old-school arcade games they also have a Foos ball table and darts.

They have an outdoors area that's shaded for those with doggos or who want to enjoy the heat and eat from their food truck. I had the Triple B, which was surprisingly crisp and floral for a belgian. They had a variety of beers which I wanted to taste, but we arrived late with one hour to spare before closing. That just means I need to pay another visit to truly enjoy the place.  They have a private parking area shared with neighboring businesses and strong wifi. The best part is the indoors games like 4-player Mario Kart (WHAT!), darts, and a bunch of board games. They also give free stickers, plus our lady taptender that day was so kind and welcoming."

However I checked out their site, saw they had some wine options and a food truck--so I happily tagged along. The bartender who greeted us gave us the rundown of everything. Served us with a smile and was very informative about the beers, of course. I had a great bottle of pinot grigio while my friends enjoyed the various beers available. I had a great time checking out the art that they have on the walls for sale. We also played a game of jumbo sized connect four and Mario Kart on the big screen. A large collection of board games are also available to borrow while hanging out enjoying your drink in the taproom. Very cool place, warm vibes. Great food truck on site as well.  Definitely will return soon and bring my beer drinking friends."

                "description": "Three words: Belgium style brews! Oh my goodness, where have you been hiding from me Adelbert's?! This is by far one of my most favorite craft breweries in all of Austin, if not in the United States. For those of you that really know me, you know that I L.O.V.E. Belgian beers...so much so that, yes, I traveled to Belgium JUST for the beers (okay, I ate some mussels and saw some pretty cool stuff too, but...). For those of you not in the know (no insult meant for those who are), Belgian style beers are pretty high in ABV, so amateurs enter gently. Just looking out for my Yeeps! :D  Adelbert's doesn't look like much at all from the outside. Tucked away in a warehouse district, it can a tad difficult to find, particularly at night - just look for the little white lights and the picnic tables outside. Park, walk through the plastic flat \"doors\" and you will discover a beautiful huge space with stacks and stacks of barrels, merchandise for sale, lots of local art hanging on the walls to purchase adds to the ambiance; plus games to play such as giant Jenga, foosball, and darts and that's one fine outing.   But the beer! Oh my gosh - the beer. Handcrafted at its best. So amazingly fantastic and such a great deal. On your first visit be certain to buy the 6 half pour (really close to full pours - yay) tastings for $13. You get to keep the glass and get $2 off beers when you bring it back on your next visit. Regular prices range from $4-6 a glass, which is phenominal in the first place for such high quality ale.   ALL great, two personal standouts for me were: *Flyin' Monks Quadrupel: 10.9%ABV, aged in rum barrels with hints of spice, deep, dark, and lovely. *Philosophizer Saison: An easy choice. 7.8% ABV, very mild carbonation with a hint of pepper. Fantastic.     To add some icing to this already oh so sweet find, the founder and brewmaster Scott and staff cannot be any more friendly or knowledgeable about the beers and brewery.   Highly highly highly recommend. Simply doesn't get better than this IMHO. Cheers!  TIPS:  *The brewery has a license so you can take a large bottle home for a reasonable price of about $9 to $12, which is average. They also sell retail at area Austin locations (visit their website for exact locations).  *Tours are available (see website for details).   *They typically have a food truck on site on Saturdays.  *Fido friendly pergola area - not allowed inside."

                "description": "Ya'll are probably already aware of my latest and greatest obsession with collecting pint glasses from assorted breweries. For our first stop in Austin, we stopped by this unassuming warehouse. As we walked in, the live jazz band was jammin' and the beer taps were flowin'.   Michael and his bearded friend were fantastic bartenders. I really appreciated their hospitality. Michael instantly could tell I was new to this particular brewery and proceeded to explain the process to tasting their beer samples. He even noted that I had a minor with me and offered a brewed hibiscus tea for him. They really cater to all ages! We paid $13 for six half poured samples from a souvenir Belgian tasting glass. One yellow wristband later, my siblings and I were playing ping-pong and giant Jenga in the back of the warehouse.  The stringed lights on the ceiling made it feel welcome and homey. They had a wall of local art for sale ranging from $30-$300! I had my eye on a Sinatra painting, and as luck would have it, it was indeed the $300 piece lol. I stared at it longingly for most of the night, but couldn't bring myself to throw down on it. My favorite craft brews of the night were the Naked Nun and the Philosophizer. Brilliant names and great hoppy flavors.  Once it got too muggy in the taproom, we ventured out to get some grub. The food truck of the night was Emoji Grilled Cheese. (See their yelp site for my review) It was mouthwatering and delicious. We visited a couple other breweries throughout our trip, but Adelbert's was my all-time favorite.   Thanks for a great time!   -xoxoxo"

                "description": "Great place to spend an afternoon. This another place where you pay a fee, get a glass and then you get 6 pours of whatever they have on tap. I could only do 4 pours due to a time constraint but what I had was very tasty. The mango wit was a standout for me as I could actually taste the mango unlike some other brews which lose that flavor in the process. Black Rhino was also very tasty. Besides the good beers the place has TVs and games and most importantly art to sell! If I hadn't been flying on that trip there were a couple of pieces I was interested in. Overall a worthy stop in Austin instead of having to drive to Dripping Springs for good beer."

                "description": "This is my NUMBER ONE PLACE to bring any one when the visit me in Austin.  Located 40 minutes West from downtown and perched on top of a cliff with sweeping views of lake Travis, this is the place I bring my guest on their last evening in Austin to watch the sunset and to serve as a poetic end to their trip.  Things I like: - The view, absolutely stunning, come hear around sunset and listen for the bell they ring as the sun sinks below the horizon. - The food, the truffle fries here are awesome and for $9 they can feed 4 people, they even have great salads and a wagyu burger all reasonably priced  Things I don't like: - Oasis is kinda far from Austin, there isn't much they can do about it, but the drive is definitely worth it from time to time - The lack of space on the balcony, if you want to sit on the balcony overlooking Lake Travis, you may be disappointed, the tables by the ledge fill up quick so you should get there at least an hour before sunset   protips: - get there early to get good seats for the sunset - avoid the oasis restaurant, they have long waits for sub par food, just eat up here instead  - TRUFFLE FRIES"

                "description": "There was so much going on at this venue, so let me break it down based on my experience -   1. Views - INCREDIBLE. If there is one and only reason to visit this spot, it's for the view. All of their restaurants overlook Lake Travis. And it's stunning.  2. Space - there are multiple venues here - restaurants, brewery, cocktail lounge, some gift shops (closed as of Mar 2022). Every space has a viewing deck, which obviously gets filled fast. There was ample space inside and outside too. Each one is on different floor. And you cannot carry your drinks to the restaurant space as they don't have license. 3. Live music - there was no live music when I visited on a Friday. But they did have some pretty neat setups 4. Food - French fries was meh! Wait time was HUGE!  5. Cocktails - Skip them. Not worth it.  Can't speak about the beer itself as I had not tried it. 6. Accessibility - about 30 mins from Austin, so not that much of a drive.   Would come here again for the views I!"

We went upstairs and got lucky as we snagged a table right as some people were leaving. We ordered some apps and some beers and spent some time taking pictures of Lake Travis. The view was awesome and a great way to say hello to Austin.  The place doesn't have much in the way of vegetarian options, but I did enjoy the appetizers and the view :)"

I was also impressed with the quality and quantity of the parmesan fries. They have plenty of tables inside and outside. There are plenty of space heaters near all tables, so you won't have difficulty finding a table. There are plenty of non alcoholic drinks too and the place seems kid friendly."

Orders their burger with truffle fries. Pretty tasty and those fries were crispyyyy! Would go back just for the views.  The beer was okay but that's not the reason you come here."

                "description": "Made our way to The Oasis during a recent trip to Austin with some friends. It was definitely a bit away from the main city, but a beautiful scenic area. The Oasis is right on Lake Travis, and features a bunch of small stores and outdoor areas in the land surrounding it. We were there on a Friday afternoon, and surprisingly not a lot of stores were open, which was a bummer. Of course though, we were there for the brewery, which we were able to make it to. They offer plentiful indoor and outdoor seating; it was a nice sunny day so we opted for the outdoor seating. It was lovely outside but it was SO windy, even after we tried to switch locations outside. It was hard to keep our food from blowing away! The view was super nice though, so despite the wind, we appreciated the scenery surrounding us.  For food / drink - of course, I focused on beers. I was a bit disappointed to learn that they didn't offer flights - they had a good number of offerings, it would make sense to do flights! Oh well, at least they offered half pours, so I was able to try 2; I went for the gose (kiwi dragonfruit) and the Oktoberfest. Both were OK, not the best ever beer but refreshing; I definitely favored the gose! My friends enjoyed their pours as well. For food, we all split some apps, going for the OTXBC trio, the bretzel, and the truffle fries. The trio was a bit disappointing - it was underwhelming and a little piecemeal (we had thought everything would be mixed together but it was just a pretzel on top of the chips with the dips on the side). The bretzel itself was tasty, but the sauce was interesting; we thought it came with queso, but the dip we received looked nothing like queso and was thick with chunks of something in it (pepper maybe?). It was tasty, but unidentifiable. Lastly, the truffle fries were the best option - they were nicely seasoned and crispy with a large volume. We all enjoyed those! The prices were relatively reasonable for what we got in terms of quantity and quality.   Overall, we enjoyed our afternoon at Oasis Texas Brewing Company. The space is lovely with a great view, but the food and drink is just OK; you're definitely more there for the experience. I would definitely make it back to OTXBC during a next visit to Austin to try more beers and take in the nice view!"

They were pretty basic, though we really enjoyed the truffle fries. We arrived around 2pm on a Friday and there was plenty of seating. Very windy though FYI."

                "description": "The Tap Room on the third floor and the Barrel Room on the second floor both achieve unique ambiance and draw slightly different crowds. We got to experience and enjoy the best of both in a way.   Amazing fresh made as well as barrel aged cocktails, a nice range of food options, and of course, breathtaking views.   The Barrel Room is rustic chic with fancy couches and a pool table. The tap room is plain rustic with a live music stage. The tap room had burgers and sandwiches to accompany the beers brewed on site. The barrel room offered pizza and wings to eat in between cocktail sips.   Oh, don't miss observing the really cool stairs in between the two floors."

                "description": "Have some family in town and wanted to take them somewhere to watch a good ol Texas sunset. OTBC has some of the absolute best views in all of Austin. Even on this cloudy day the sunset still peaked through and gave us a show.   Drinks are good but food isn't really anything to write home about. Its more about the experience you get here for sure.  They have a large parking garage and parking lot on site with plenty of free parking even on a busy night. There's also a golf cart shuttle to get you from the lot to the entrance if you need it, but it's also a walkable distance.   Really great spot to visit if you want a nice spot to watch the sunset and definitely has that wow-factor for visitors!"

                "description": "Have a visitor in from California and wanted to show our beautiful sunset by Lake Travis. This is a great place for that and the food is always good.  The space is large and everyone seemed to be following the safety rules while indoors. We were a party of 8 and we had plenty of space.  I ordered the basic burger and they usually prepare it Medium rare. I asked for medium well and wanted only mayonnaise and cheese. It was cooked the way I requested but was very dry since they did not give me Mayo. My wife ordered the Fish Tacos (3) and said they were great. She ended only being able to eat 2 and another guest finished her last one. She said she would order again next time.   All in all is was good just not great."

The whole experience overall is just underwhelming? If thats the right word. There is always the steps  1. get in line to get on to the wait list 2. once in front be told the wait is 1-2 hours 3. get in line again for the bar  4. finally get seated and wait again for slow service.   One question is Why? Why would you even go here? The wait is 2+ Hours sometimes. The food is cafeteria quality at best. They are SEVERELY understaff. Oasis Brewery has better food and literally the same exact food. The quality of the experience over all does not justify the amount of time, money and effort for this place."

The Texas skies are truly breathtaking during this time and Oasis is perfectly positioned for patrons to see all that the sun has to offer. Come 1 hour early to snag a table next to the railings in order to get the best (unblocked) view.   Food: 3/5. My date and I only ordered the Pico Verde. It was a refreshing snack but nothing special. We would've ordered more but there wasn't a huge selection and nothing that caught our eye.   Drinks: 3/5. Very limited selection of beers. It's almost weird that this place is called a brewery because there are literally like 8 to pick out of. Most people just come here for the view though so it's not a huge problem.   Overall, definitely a gem in Austin. It's a great place for dates or just to hang out with family or friends. It's so pretty here that it doesn't even matter what I'm eating or drinking!"

We were at the brewery on third floor, ordered some beer and food, kitchen was bit slower than normal (they were busy! So that's fine), we ordered 3 items and they only gave us one and the guy took my call alarm and about to walk away, so I asked him where are my other two items, and he looked confused then asked me, else you ordered? So I told him what they were, and took him a minute to look around, and it was sitting right next to the first item, but he just simply looked confused!  I wouldn't suggest to come during busy weekend, unless you don't mind of waiting longer time, and getting mixed up on what you've ordered.  Overall still a great place to take visitors."

For the beers we had Grand Cru Dark Ale and Samurai Lager.   The Grand Cru Dark Ale comes in a small cup. The server assured me that was a good amount unless I was really found of dark ale. He was right that was a good amount because that beer is strong.   I pretty sure I wasn't going to finish the beer if I had asked for a double sized cup.   Really nice experience over all.

Texas weather is just right this time of year, the views make you want to make the drive from Cali to the lone star state just to get that perfect pic over the lake with a drink your hand in the free state of Texas....but don't be disappointed when you are greeted by a not so friendly mask police manager that wants to wear his mask under his nose ....   the guacamole had zero taste the salsa was watery and had zero flavor... the chips were the bottom of the barrel... all of the guests seated around us were unhappy and didn't receive good service either but were happy with the views. The fellow guests/visitors we met were super cool and that was the best part... the drinks food and service were way below average... what is it with these places? get it together! the views bring us there but you need to pick it up from there... managers are clueless... bartenders were so rude....embarrassing for Austin...  so many visitors and this is their first impression of Austin unfortunately... we can do better.  We ordered 2 pizzas and left 80% of them on the table....Tasted frozen with ragu sauce.... I can't even begin to explain the regrets I have going here... The guy that gave us a ride on the golf cart up was very nice and now I feel he may have been trying to warn us about going there..  Bathrooms were gross and tables were nasty... nobody was cleaning up after people.... trash and masks everywhere and near the water... I follow not unfollowed their social media page and the pictures are very enticing but it's the exact opposite of what you actually get... from the drinks to the food.. Fire pit was a nice touch.. we stopped to talk to other guests there on our way out... Its a one hitter quitter for all..  won't be back... what a waste of location."

                "description": "Blue Owl Brewing is known for their sour beers. I am happy to report that they also have a normal pilsner and IPA, as well as ciders and some sort of frozen beer drink. The bartender was super friendly and let us know we could split a tasting between the two of us (one of us would get a glass cup we could keep and the other person would get a plastic cup). Since I am currently short on glasses, I chose the cup I wanted. They had 4 choices at varying prices. We really enjoyed all of the beers we had - they are definitely unique. I did the hazy IPA and a coconut IPA. They also have a ton of soft shirts for sale, which I am a big fan of. This is a great spot to grab a cold beer on summer day, since there is indoor seating, as well as a covered patio. I will definitely return to this little gem."

                "description": "Buyer Beware!!   You don't get to have a choice in whether or not to buy a souvenir beverage receptacle :(  Unfortunately, Blue Owl Brewing doesn't sell beer. It sells cups and glasses, which come with beer in them.   I paid $9 for a cheap blue plastic souvenir cup in order to get one beer. I was traveling to Austin by airplane (during the weekend of the TSA meltdown at the airport) and don't have room to carry around a cheap plastic cup, much less a glass.    If you think you might want to drink two beers you have to upgrade to buying a glass for $22, which then entitles you to two beers, at $11 each. One of which comes in the mandatory souvenir glass -whether you want it or not- and the other in an even cheaper clear plastic cup. If you want to share four beers with friends you have to buy the largest glass for $32 (I may be off slightly regarding the price) and they will give you a souvenir glass and three, even cheaper, plastic disposable cups. You can also choose to refill the same glass four times. In any case this will cost you $8 per beer which is the cheapest options if you're looking for volume.  Please note, you are not allowed to bring your own reusable glass/mug/plastic cup and buy the beer. Because, this place sells cups and glasses. Not beer. The beer is a byproduct of buying a glass.  From an environmental perspective, this is not a responsible business model. Stop selling plastic cups and start selling beer. Get a dishwasher so you a can re-use your glass inventory.  When you go to a brewery it's usually because you want beer. Not a glass. If you do want a glass you can pick one up at the gift shop. Honestly, my friend and I should have walked out after learning of the cup-buying scheme, but we had just walked two miles to get there, and watching the confusion spread over the faces of thirsty consumers who came in after us was priceless.   Locals with B.O.B. growlers didn't seem to mind. I have no idea what a growler would cost, or how many,even cheaper, plastic cups it comes with.  We won't be going back unless they start selling beer instead of glasses. The business model didn't sit well with either of us. Granted this is a subjective observation. One star for the server as she was polite and seemed a little exasperated in explaining the business model. One star for the beer, they have some good flavors here. And one more for the atmosphere as it had a nice vibe.  We both placed our cheap blue plastic souvenir cups on top of the growing stack of other cheap blue plastic souvenir cups  in the recycle bin on the way out."

                "description": "So I'm a big fan of being fair, so here goes. A friend and I stopped by while in Austin and the place was packed. I think we got there at the right time because we were able to secure a seat inside where it was considerably cooler than the outside seating.   The process for ordering was fairly simple and the lady helping me was kind enough to break it down for a new out-of-towner. We got 4 sour beers and they were really interesting. On this particular occasion I had a new experience after I finished my 2nd sour beer. I learned that sour beer gives me heart burn. 1st time ever. I was asking my friend what this fire in my chest was. She loved the sour beers she ordered and we got glasses to remember the occasion. BOB... you'll always be my first.   I recommend checking it out and if you like sour beers Blue Owl Brewing will put a smile on your face. The staff is friendly and hip, and the beer flows as does the good times.   Prohst!!!"

                "description": "We loved coming to Blue Owl Brewing!! When we came, they only had the patio open for drinking at the brewery due to COVID, which was nice and very comfortable.   We ordered a glass and got 4 beers with the glass, if you are not able to finish your 4 beers, they will let you take the extras to go in cans! I believe the size we got was $20 per person. They had about 3 different options for sizes of glasses. The girl said we could even share one order if we wanted less beers per person.  I love all the options of the beers (they are all \"sour\" and DELICIOUS)!! My all time favorite that I tried was the Jubilberry!  The only complaint I would have was parking was a little hard to find but we ended up parking in a lot close by.  We will definitely be coming back when in Ausitn!"

                "description": "The worst brewery experience of my life. Extremely long line, only one woman was working. We ordered canned beers and went outside to the patio are. She came outside and said we had to drink canned beers off the property and took away our drinks saying she could bring us new ones in glasses -- AND SHE NEVER came back. There was NO CLEAR MARKING that canned beers were equivalent to to go beers and QR code's we're on the tables with the option to order canned beers. Little to no seating and a water fan was blowing, causing the customers to get wet. I would never recommend this place!"

The staff if exceptionally nice and has great customer service. I'm not a beer fan but I do love their Peach and Blueberry beers!  Their coolest thing is for $20 you get a great glass with beer and 3 others in plastic cups. Cool concept and a lot of beer in pours.  Getting a great following and you should go!!"

                "description": "I don't know how I've failed to review this place yet, because I literally purchase something from here every week and finally got to sit on their patio during a beautiful sunny Sunday. I cannot recommend it enough -- thought I didn't like sour beer, oh boy I was wrong. Absolutely ADORE the Tangerina, Tiki Hop Totem, Plum de Plume, Limetastico and Jubilberry beers. And they had a Plum de Plume + mango beer slushee, so yum! Patio was very full on Sunday so we had to wait to snag an outdoor table but it was worth it. The staff is always incredibly nice and feels safe for COVID. Every Thursday they spin a wheel for a growler deal -- entire growler of amazing beer for $9! And their merch is so cute, definitely have a koozie collection now. Biggest perk of in-person is if you buy a beer glass (pictured here with a very cool design) you get 4 pours for $16. It really doesn't get better than this."

                "description": "A brewery that does only sours! I was so happy to find this place while exploring East Austin. You know, it's been a while since I walked around a neighborhood without my phone constantly telling me where to go. This time I did, and Cesar Chavez led me here and to so many other amazing spots!   You walk in, order a glass that you get to keep! And then you get 4 beers in that glass! The best part? If you are like me and get the cool goblet at 16 oz. you can't drink that much beer at once. You can keep your tasting card and come back for the other 1 or 2 that you maybe couldn't do at visit #1! I think the limit is about a month between visits, but I'm not sure. Honestly, we came here 3 times. One time we didn't have our tasting cards so just did 4 tasting size glasses. Yes, we are big fans and came back to Indy with 4 glasses!   The patio is covered which is great during Texas spring/summer. If you're lucky, and someone leaves and hands you their card, double bonus!   I highly recommend visiting because even my husband, who does not love sours as I do, found a beer he liked (Van Dayum), and we even passed on the love to my sister-in-law who lives in RR! (How has she not been here yet?!)"

                "description": "Spent a whole evening here due to the unusual policy of requiring you to purchase a glass that comes with 4 pours. We drank our 4 14 oz pours over the course of a few hours, but it's nice that we had the option to bail earlier and take home a can instead. The patio is nicely set up with distanced tables, fans, and hand sanitizers at every table. We brought over food from Vegan Nom, a couple minutes walk away. My partner and I each tried 4 different beers. All were delicious! This was our first visit to the brewery despite buying the beer from stores many times. I would definitely come back but with the awareness of the policy that you have to buy at least 4 12oz pours (you can split amongst multiple people though). I think the real highlight of visiting the brewery are the frozen beer drinks. They had a \"Mexican Marteeny\" available the night we went, which is based on the Teenybopper ale with some other things mixed in. Amazing, and a great final glass! The bartender was lovely and was able to answer all our questions, too."

If you don't like sour beer, verify by trying the definition of it at Blue Owl Brewing because \"The Owls are not what they seem.\" - yep, they're Lynch fans of the best show to make it to TV.  BOB is your uncle and your favorite sour beer. Come in and select a size, get 4 samples in that glass, and when you finish - keep it! The glass is yours.  Heavy rotation keeps its original and I love it. They have some staples for those trying to have a routine.  Buy some swag and get the brand out there! #LittleBossIsMyFav #BlueOwlSightings"

Sure, you can split it or take some home but sometimes I just want 1-2 beers on site and not have to buy 4. My boyfriend and I came and bought the 4 but then wanted one more. Nope, buy 4 more or none. We picked none and left. I just wish we could come and buy one or two beers without being forced to buy 4."

                "description": "If you like sour beers, youll love this place. Personally i find it gimmicy. The sour beers dont do it for me. Also they make you buy a pint glass before you can order.  The main draws are that its in a cool neighborhood, i like that the beers are highly alcoholic. Also their patio is dece, but it could use more seating. Finally, their gimmicky ordering system causes people to leave free beer tickets around constantly. I like free beer.  The big gimmick, which I find annoying, aside from the sour beers buying a glass when you to get a drink. When you buy one, you're basically comitting to four 12 oz. pours and possibly coming back in the future. There are other sizes, but the 12 oz. Is the best value and it feels weird drinking beer from a shot glass.   You can bring a glass you already bought, but overall its annoying to bring a pint glass to a bar. If i wanted to clean my own glasses, i would drink at home. Thats why youre kinda commiting to coming back by buying one.  They give you a sheet to check off the number of pours. The sheets are transferable and can be used on different days so make sure to hold on to them. Also, we usually find a sheet of people who didnt use all their pours so youll usually get a few free."

For $16, my friends and I each got a normal sized glass to take home and 4 pours of any choice (you can do 8 half pours). There are also different types and sizes for glasses, so you could opt for a bigger or smaller glas.   Beer/Sours: Great quality drinks with a wide range of flavors. If you don't like sours this may not be the place for you, but definitely give it a shot if you like beers in general.   Service: Nothing to be said here, super nice and friendly staff! Felt right at home.   Atmosphere: Great! Nothing that prevents you from enjoying your afternoon or your conversation.   Definitely coming here again, hopefully I'll collect all 4 glasses!"

                "description": "When we were walking over to this place from Lazarus brewing my wife said, \"I think they only have sours\". I was like no way, I will just grab an IPA or something... Oh man was I shocked to see that they literally only had sours. With that being said let me start this shockingly high review for a place that only has sours by saying... i do not care for sour beers. So a 5 star coming from a person who doesnt enjoy sours should say something.  I loved everything about this place. This place is in a cool location, has a great logo, has great aesthetic, and a really cool flight idea. If it wasnt all sour beers... I would live at this place.  Let me explain how the flights work here. You pick your glass size... If I were to guess I would say 4oz, 8oz, 12oz... but honestly that is a guess. Then you get 4 samples in that size. You bring up your sheet, they check off the beer and you sample it. Oh and the best part is that after you are done you get to keep the glass. Oh and the prices are not crazy. I want to say it was $6, $8, $10, but that might also be off. This is definitely one of the coolest strategies I have seen for flights at a brewery ever... Oh and the glasses all looked really neat for sure.  Now onto the beer. Like I have mentioned multiple times already, I am not a fan of sours, but I liked the initial flavor of most of these beers. We had the wee heavy, the red, the earl grey one (lazarus colab), and the cherry stout. Everything had a great crafted flavor, until I hit the sour note. I relied on my wife to drink most of these, but I was very impressed by everything for sure. And my wife was happy with everything as well.  I would suggest anyone in Austin come visit this place for sure. Definitely worth the trip and more so if you like sours!!"

I usually love the sweet, malty taste of a brown ale, but the IBU rating on this one was a little high for my tastes.  Not terrible, mind you, and I would consider it again. Just a little hoppy for my tastes.    It's in an industrial park, like many breweries are, but it was a nice, spacious, and clean set up. Service was quick too - so was parking.  On my last visit, they even had a local band playing from within one of the loading dock doors.   Bottom line, great tastes, services, parking easy, and some good live tunes.  Check them out!"

She had been, but it was my first time - although I'd been eyeing Hopsquad as it was building up and it had been on my list to visit. The parking is limited, so plan ahead. The space is bigger than it looks from the outside - as it has an indoor bar as well as an outdoor picnic table area. I tried two beers (can't remember which ones) and they were both very good. The menu had good variety, so I feel like it's a good spot to bring a group that could have diverse beer tastes. The staff was friendly and seemed to be happy working there. I would definitely visit again!"

                "description": "Design aesthetic on fleek. Open ro ALL customers--dog and kid-friendly! Strong wifi and food truck supported, Hopsquad is going places.  We walked in excited to try their beers. We heard about this spot and it was so easy to find off the main road. It's connected to Circle Brewing and separated by an easily-crossed chain fence. UGH! How convenient. Beer nerds unite! The mural art is very instagrammable and the interior is even more of a design paradise. The chairs, tables, succulents, artwork and all-around ambiance is so calming, zen and open. It's the perfect place to get work done or enjoy a sunny day with your furry friends. We were a group of four, and all of us loved the space. They also have strong wifi, so y'all know this girl would rather get studying/work done with a beer over cafe drinks any day.  The restrooms are also very clean and GET THIS...they have tampons, pads and AVEENO LOTION IN THE WOMENS' RESTROOM. Yee-haw! They have flights of four for the typical Austin price of $10. Everything is wonderful about this place. They also have a little strip of grass for dogs to do their business--and they have a poop bag station too. The food truck looks like omakase (I'm not entirely sure), but they have so many outdoor games/picnic tables as well as indoor activities like fooseball and dog treats.  The aspects that could be improved are parking. Yes, they have additional parking that's a few lots away...but immediate parking is a drag. We got lucky and squeezed in on the side by the large trash receptacles. The beers also weren't everybody's favorites. They did have a selection, but they only have a few beers on tap. However, Hopsquad is so very green still...that variety will take time. GREAT new brewery providing a hip space for all folks!"

                "description": "I stopped in this past Friday for some crowlers to-go. As this was my first visit, I tried three different offerings. First off, their online ordering is slick and seamless. Secondly, they seem to have adapted well to the pandemic with adequate spacing between their outdoor tables. I would definitely feel comfortable having some pints in their beer-garden. If you are as excited about Austin FC (soon-to-be season ticket holder) these guys are within easy walking distance to the gorgeous new stadium. I can see myself having pre-match beers here before taking the short walk to the stadium.  Now on to the important stuff: the beer!  I opted for their Kate la Quimica SMaSH IPA, Professor Pleasant pale ale, and my personal favorite style Sir Winsor ESB. I found the SMaSH to be my favorite, it was a fantastic representation of the style, 9/10. My second favorite was the ESB, major kudos for carrying this style that is far too rare state-side. It was delicious and my second favorite of that style in town 8/10 (bonus point for a well-done obscure style). I thought the pale ale was fair, I found it to be a bit one-note. Though pleasant on the nose, it lacked a similar nuance on the palate 6/10. All said, I will definitely be back to try their extensive and varied roster of brews. As a bonus, the staff I spoke with were extremely friendly and happy to talk about both their brews and Austin FC. Keep up the great work!"

As the name suggests they are very much hops forward. I am not. I came in and asked the woman about non-hop forward beers. She suggested one and I tried it. It was very hop forward. The bar, if you call it that, is very pretentious. Would not come here again if traveling through Austin."

There is a decent amount of space both indoors and out, but I could still see how this place could get packed.   We went around 5 on a Friday and it wasn't empty but also wasn't too crowded. It was nice out so we sat outside. I got a flight which was only $10 for 4 smaller beers and I could pick any of the options on tap.   I'm not a big beer drinker so I don't know that it's fair for me to detailed review each beer, but from the variety I'm sure any one that likes beer could find something they enjoy.   Great place to bring a group! They also have a little food truck/ restaurant out back that looked really good but I haven't tried yet."

The problem is that it takes longer to get a beer here on Austin FC game days than any of the other places. I know there's a big crowd on game day, but how dumb not to anticipate that and bring in more staff. A brewery exists to sell beer. And you'll wait 45 minutes in line to get one here. Hopsquad just hasn't figured out how to serve beer at a reasonable speed so they are selling half as many as they could while inconveniencing everyone."

                "description": "We chanced upon Hopsquad recently, and I don't think I've ever been more comfortable at any other brewery in Austin. I do agree that their beer is still probably finding its footing (Austin does have a competitive craft beer scene, after all), but I don't think other places can hold a candle to Hopsquad's absolutely chilled out homey vibes.   I'll do a pros and cons list.   Pros:  - I can bring my human +canine children and seat them indoors.  - the staff actually don't mind human children.  -cider and wine available for non-beer drinkers   -the staff like my canine child (and there are plenty of other dog parents who visit which means you can play \"I pet that dog!\")  - board games  - foosball table  - plenty of space   Cons  - I truly believe there are better beers out there.  - cider portions are small - from a can and a little steep , price wise  So when you weigh the two, the pros beat the cons by a mile. As for the beer- give them time. I mean, no one really cared about a few other noted breweries 5 years ago but look how popular they've become now ! Here's to Hopsquad becoming Austin's next too brewery.   - food truck outside  - plenty of parking"

Good beer and some wine, which is nice considering a lot of breweries around town don't have wine. Indoor space is large, and there are garage-like doors that stay open in nice weather, so it's as if you're outdoors but get the benefit of shade."

This is what I consider walking distance (under 2 miles) but it would be a quick Lyft or Uber if you aren't someone like myself.   First off, let me tell you about the staff here. As soon as I walked in the door I was greeted with a welcome like I was an old friend that they couldn't wait to see.  I told them I was a new comer and they were so happy to tell me all about their brews.  They explained each brew on tap and I asked which beer they recommended.  They suggested their Hefeweizen which is spectacular. Such an easy drinking wheat ale with a bit of a tangy finish.    It is definitely worth the visit.  It's animal and kid friendly with great seating indoors and outdoors. Looks like they also have a great stage for some live music and fun. Disclaimer it said they take Apple Pay but they do not.  Which is cool but a site isn't telling the truth.  Not their fault.    I will definitely making frequent stops here whenever I'm in Austin! Thank you for such a wonderful experience Live Oak Brewing! Y'all are the BEST!!!"

We came to Live Oak brewing Company on a Monday afternoon for a drink before heading out. It is spitting distance from the airport and a nice spot to wait if you have to kill time before a flight.  They offer a nice variety of beers and I think the main attraction is their disc golf course. We saw several people playing disc golf and enjoying a nice cold beer. They sell snacks like chips and pretzels but nothing homemade. I'm not sure if they have food trucks that rotate through or not.  Plenty of parking and good beers."

Service kinda sucks though. Zero personality from the bartenders every time we come. Expect it to be better at least once but never is. Not saying everyone has to be happy to work at a brewery but at least like you want to be there for your customers maybe?? It's just odd. Must really suck to work here. Many other places with way friendlier staff that make us feel valued. Also, please refill soap in the bathrooms if there's barely customers and everyone's standing around doing nothing."

                "description": "Definitely one of the best breweries in the Austin area to visit and for several reasons. Along with their normal beers that you find in the retail market, you can also try several of their specialty beers served only at the brewery. The interior of the tasting room has very ample seating for large groups of people. And should you decide to enjoy their world famous hefeweizen outside, you will find numerous tables throughout the property. What could be better than playing disc golf on a course set up on the acreage behind the brewery while enjoying their cold Pilz. There's also a food truck set up in the parking lot. If you go online you'll find they have occasional beer and music events planned. There is very ample parking and numerous outdoor tables and places to sit even at the most popular events. This is definitely a fun and relaxing place to sit and enjoy some really great craft beer with friends."

The brewery is pretty secluded and tucked away behind the airport. The large oak trees that surround it are beautiful, and they have plenty of outdoor seating under the trees that's perfect for a nice day! There is also some indoor seating and the whole place is dog friendly. They have a huge selection of beers - the pils and marzens are my favorites. There's also a German food truck (The Black Forest) that I believe is always posted outside by the outdoor seating, so you have a food option if you need a bite to eat."

Shade.  Food truck. All Covid precautions in place.  Because of the extra precautions, it does take a while at the ordering/pick up table.  Understandable.  I ordered their sour, The Gose Coriander Salt Sour (where they add a flavored syrup of your choosing to it).  I love sours but just found the flavor of this one kind of weird.   Almost \"smoky\" tasting.  I didn't finish and got their Oktoberfest instead (much better!).   Plenty of parking and nice clean bathrooms."

                "description": "Oh Live Oak Brewing Company do I love you so!  You are always friendly, safe, spacious, and shaded for me and my company when we head out to enjoy your delicious and fresh beers. I cannot get enough of the Hefe that is always served ice cold and deliciously the best on a warm spring afternoon.  You keep doing you, boo!  I have had a leaving-to-a-new-gig goodbye party here where there was plenty of outdoor space for us to hang out, drink beer, and enjoy company with coworkers here pre-pandemic. Easy parking, lots of space to move around and/or play outdoor games, and never a fuss with separate tabs and closing out your tab.  Most recently we came for a friends birthday on a late Saturday afternoon and this place was buzzing with lots of other families and parties enjoying their beers under the nice big oak trees.  I highly recommend you lathering the SPF or sunscreen if you are going to be under a tree or even if you are in the shade especially in spring or summer times.  There will be plenty of picnic tables and areas for you to choose even if it does seem or look crowded when you walk in.  I was really impressed with how the set up is at Live Oak now in pandemic times. There is one single line to order your beer(s), 2-3 servers helping at 1 long table, easy and no contact for paying or opening up your tab, and clear signage and offerings on what beers they got on tap, in bottles/cans, and to-go as well.  Everyone in line are very patience and polite in giving you 6 feet distance as you wait to place your order.  There is 1 food truck, The Black Forest, onsite that also offers contactless payment and has the best German snacks and food. I highly recommend the pimento cheese if you see it on the menu. You are also welcomed to bring your own food to enjoy as you sip on some tasty beers. I even saw a large bbq pit, if I am not mistaken, as well that you could probably use or might have to reserve(?)."

                "description": "I can't say enough good things about this brewery. Great brew selection, clean, modern-and their outdoor space is quite inviting. Plenty of seating to go around and lots of trees provide ample shade. It's so large that you can take a nice stroll and find cool little hidden spots to just chill. There's even a food trailer onsite serving pretzels and such for those who need help with absorbing that fourth Hefeweizen! So I hear!"

                "description": "I'm now conditioned to pay a visit to Live Oak before I fly out of the Austin airport. Location is key!  Everytime I've been, I got the tasters. They're a little pricey for tasters. The standard for 4 tasters right now is $10, but Live Oak's are $14. They give great pours, come in cute wooden handles, and are equipped with little paper cards with beer info in it for the true beer nerds. I've never had to wait in a long line when I've come, but to be fair I've only come during the late afternoon. My favorite hands down is their Hefeweizen--there's a reason why it won awards! I really did not like the Smoaktoberfest. I love me some smoked flavors--mezcal, roasted tea, etc. BUT the Smoaktoberfest was not a winner...it reminded me of goji berries, which I do not like.  I wish their German food truck would open when the brewery was open. Both times I've been it wasn't open, and I've wanted to get real food while I was here before heading to the airport. That was a big bummer. However, Live Oak does have some snacks for those who get hungry. I've had their Zapp's potato chips and their pretzels with the green chile flavor. They were alright, but kinda pricey. I would suggest bringing your own snacks. Keep it light though, like chips or something. Their restrooms are very spacious and clean, and I love that they have outdoor AND indoor seating galore. Great space for all group sizes, but I've never seen dogs here. I did see someone bring their kid, so I think that's okay.  There is an abundance of parking for all car sizes. The drive there is kinda shady as you turn off from the freeway (like broken windows in cars that are parked along the road, and oooooold cars that look like they've been abandoned for years), so be sure to keep valuables hidden or with you when you go into the brewery. Can't wait to go back!"

                "description": "I couldn't wait to get back to Austin and visit Live Oak Brewing.  As with my last trip, three years ago, Live Oak does German and Czech-style beers, and does them extremely well.  The brew my favorite pilsner, and normally I shun pilsners.  This time we also tried a number of their smoked beers--all were delicious.   Live Oak features a clean, modern indoor room, where you can borrow board games, as well as an outdoor seating area under large oak trees.  They also have a disc golf course.  The staff is very friendly and helpful."

The outside tables are a perfect place to enjoy mother nature.  Beers tend to be lighter and yellow, although there were a couple of darker variety.  Mostly low ABV.  Live Oak Beer would be very tasty in the hot Texas sun.  Recommend stopping by when you are on the way to or from  the airport.  It is also worth a special trip for beer lovers."

                "description": "The setup- I would give this 4 stars. Huge property with a ton of outdoor seating, and a lot of seating inside. Really nice environment.  Beer- I would give this three stars. It's a specifically German style brewery so I don't expect fireworks or anything too crazy, but I thought it was just okay. The most creative thing they do is the added syrups but I would never, ever add syrups in a beer if it was delicious. Just no. Their beer wasn't exactly delicious so I didn't mind, but I had a hard time finishing it. Too sweet.  Service- maybe 2-3 stars. I had an okay experience with the staff, but they did seem very disinterested. Granted it was busy, and the weather was really off, lots of rain that was driving people inside. However, after being to a ton of tap rooms with extremely personable staff, my bar is set higher than theirs I guess.   Overall, I would say 3-4 stars but lean towards three. Not bad, not wonderful."

                "description": "TLDR: A really pleasant brewery experience, if a bit out of the way  So right off the bat, this place is beautiful. The \"taproom\" isn't really a room, and more of a tap cavern. Lots of seating, but enough space it still feels very spacious about.  We got both appetizers and some food. for apps, we got the trio. The salsa was really really good. Queso and Guac were both good, but not exceptional. If I am being honest, I can't remember which two tacos I got, but they were fantastic. Everyone at the table really enjoyed theirs.  I had two different flights, so I got to sample a large amount of their beers. they have a lot of really original and unique flavors, while still maintaining a lot of the regulars you see at a lot of breweries. It really gives this place a lot of individuality, while not making it niche. all of the beers were at least \"pretty good\". Of the 8 I tried though, none really made it to the \"phenomenal\" level, which is my one and only complaint about the place.   100% worth the visit, and amongst the best breweries in Austin. 4.75/5"

We found this brewery just a few miles SW of Austin that just had STUNNING food! I had the chicken tortilla soup which was probably the best I've ever had. I also got a pair of chicken quesadillas while my wife got the pork tacos. Everything including the chips N queso was just great.   The vibe was relaxed and easy going, it was quiet enough to enjoy the Motown music mix, our servers were friendly, the prices quite reasonable, and food was delivered within minutes. We finished off the night with a flight of ice cream. Oh yeah -- the beer was good too. We're bringing all of our friends here first chance we get."

                "description": "Over the weekend we had the opportunity to travel down to Austin and stay at the brewery in our Airstream. This was a fabulous place! The beer that they are brewing is unique and flavorful, along with traditional street tacos and Mexican fare, which can be pretty competitive in Austin.   When we first go there, I asked for a Topo Chico, which they don't have because they have something much better!  If you want something refreshing to clean the palette before you start trying different beers, order the Hop Water! It is amazing!  I really have to commend the staff, because they were friendly, attentive to our needs, and fast.  That is a challenge in today workforce, and there is nothing worse than having great food and crappy service.   While the beer and food was delicious - the one thing that stood out as exceptional was the ice cream flight. That is a must have if you visit Beerburg Brewing. The seasonal speciality was Atole Ice Cream and it was our favorite!"

Friendly service, great outside area with picnic tables, dog park and what looked like a play area for kids. And don't forget the ice cream - Mexican vanilla and Honey Bourbon Vanilla (seasonal) were both yummy! Would never have known about this place if not for Harvest Hosts!"

The staff is friendly and takes their time explaining what's on the menu and even provides recommendations.  Their food is fresh and delicious ... every item we ordered was so tasty! I LOVE that they have homemade ice cream ... a variety of flavors and some of them that are seasonal. I'm definitely coming back to enjoy their outdoor seating,  try their other tacos and of course... ice cream!!!  Potatos bravas - nice and crisp on the outside, soft on the inside. Delicious seasoning. Great sauce to dip the potatoes in.  Guacamole - oh so fresh! Again, just the right amount of salt and lime in it. Chips were fresh too.  Brisket tacos - well marinated and cooked brisket (on the spicy side), with caramelized and pickled onions on a semi fried taco... yum yum yum  Ice cream - chocolate with strawberry was great although I did wish they had more strawberries in it. Blueberry cheesecake tasted just like it's name!  Beerburg Brewery for the win!!!"

                "description": "I came here on a Thursday evening, maybe around 7, and there were only a couple other groups there. We had the whole patio to ourselves with just our dog and the sunset! The setting is hard to beat, a nice view of the hills, an area with trees and benches, and a dog park. They have an indoor area, too!  The beer choices were plentiful and varied, and for non beer lovers they have other alcoholic and nonalcoholic options.  We ordered flautas, brisket tacos, and patatas bravas. My favorite of the three were the patatas - great flavor, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Also quite a bit for the price. The flautas were good - the shell was perfectly crunchy. But, the taste was lacking. This was the case with the tacos, too. Also, for the price, I think 3 would be more reasonable vs. 2... Though I was satisfied (not too full) by the end. Definitely order some ice cream! Both flavors we had were great - probably the best of the food tbh!  Overall a great place to hang out with some friends and have a few drinks. Very dog friendly. The food is promising, but will have to try more to be convinced."

It wasn't crowded which was nice because it was relaxing- although I'm sure that won't last long...  we tried the flight and a variety of beers and enjoyed all of it! The staff was super friendly and the place is spacious and clean.   We got the mushroom asada and the quesadillas and both were amazing. I loved the fried crispy tortillas that both came with. The plates are a little small for the price but I think it is well worth to try the food! We also got pistachio ice cream. I wanted to get a flight but we were already too full. I would definitely come back though to try more as they have some interesting flavors!!"

Living nearby we have ordered curbside here several times and each time the food is excellent, better tacos than anywhere else i have had them Today we had the brisket tacos that are nicely grilled with excellent quality meat and great flavor. Not a bit of grizzle or fat. I wholeheartedly recommend their food!"

Mostly hard seltzer's on tap, but fun flavors. Beer selection was small but covered all the bases. The food they have is small portions but soooo good! Not your traditional pupusa or cortido, but I still enjoyed it. The flour tortillas were really good. Cubano is the perfect beer food though. Such a great brewery and I love that it's in Pflugerville. TVs with sports  and a projector playing a movie we're on the inside."

Plenty of tables and areas to social distance, while supporting a local business!   While we only visited during the soft opening, we know that Willards will be a fantastic addition to the Pflugerville area!   Willards Brewery features the Mojo Austin Food Truck!! (Separate IG accounts by the way) The Cubano Quesadilla, Braised Beef Taco, and Beef and Cheese Pupusa are allllll a must have!!  I recommend the green salsa since it's nice and hot, as well!"

I really appreciate that they have a menu that caters to everyone, not just beer drinkers. I love their hard seltzer cocktails and they also have mead and a few guest taps from other breweries. The Mojo food truck is amazing - their pork tacos are to die for!  As far as the physical space goes, the patio is gorgeous and they have campfires going at night to keep you cozy. Everything is very well spaced out, too."

                "description": "Willard's is right around the corner from our home, but we tried it for the first time last night (it won't be the last). The first thing you notice as you walk into the beer garden is the nice outdoor space with a pleasant ambiance. They have picnic style tables in and outside, they keep the indoor space very open (making us feel safer during COVID era). The lights outside provide a nice touch, as well as the music- played at a low enough volume that we don't have to raise our voices to hear one another.   Now as for the drinks: their stout is amazing and smooth and very chocolatey. Their seltzers all have such unique taste combinations and are NOT overly sweet, like some of the big name brands. The strawberry tangerine reminded me of a Haribo gummy bear! The coconut papaya was delicious and I went back and forth between tasting the coconut and the papaya most. They even have cocktail like drinks that are good for those who don't enjoy beer or seltzer. My partner ordered the Hazy IPA and liked it enough to buy a six-pack to take home. George was our bartender. He has such a calm and respectful demeanor. He was really great and made the experience of tasting some of the drinks for the first time so pleasant.   The food truck is so reasonable in price and was delicious! It was so nice to have something other than typical bar food. Austin (chef) brings out the orders so quickly and is super kind! Their guacamole is really interesting and we all devoured it, their salsas are spicy and fresh, and they even have a mushroom taco with a black bean puree for those of us who don't eat meat. Everyone at our table enjoyed the food (other items ordered were pork nachos, Cuban quesadilla, and the pupusa).   Overall we loved our experience, and will definitely be back to visit this hidden treasure."

Tried the place on a Sunday afternoon and expected more patrons there were only 3 other tables. Great service from the employees offering tasting of different beers and seltzer's and you've got to try the Mojo Cuban food truck - can recommend the quesadilla for sure. Look for us on a Sunday with our Am Staf puppy named Daisy."

Soccer, basketball, etc. We want to make sure this great option for watching sports is supported and sticks around! Call ahead if you like to make sure your game is on, and invite lots of friends! Long haul: We started going as a covid-friendly option and came to love everything about it. I can't speak to the beer, but I drink the small but good selection of wine and eat the food. The food is really special, honestly. Small but perfect menu. Elevated cuisine for a casual setting. The space outside is so cute. It's thoughtfully landscaped to feel like a getaway whether you're at a picnic table or sitting around the fire. The dog watching is ON POINT too. The people make the place, as everyone that works there has been so kind to us during covid and now beyond. It was nice to have a home away from home in unexpected times, and we are still going! It's a fun place to be, so get a group together for HH or dinner!"

                "description": "The newest trend in South Austin hangouts seems to be converting former homes on a couple of acres into a neighborhood bar, most often with live music and a great outdoor patio. The Barn fits neatly into that trend. Located just a block from the Lowe's on Brodie Lane in Sunset Valley, this old house comes complete with an array of beautiful oak trees, a shady outdoor patio space, a full bar, and an empty (fenced off) swimming pool.   The full bar is open, and still includes a short list of beers and wines by the glass. Prices are in line with downtown venues. The night we visited, a folk band called Days Before Color was playing inside to an appreciative crowd. The venue's online calendar lists upcoming show dates and artists.  There are two food trucks out front by Brodie Lane, one that is mainly BBQ, and neither of which really offer a substantial vegetarian dish. Weirdly, there's a hair salon trailer out there as well. Because why not?  The Barn is family-friendly, which is a plus, but keep in mind that you will need to watch your youngsters closely to keep them safe and make sure they aren't imbibing alcohol. It's still a bar.  All in all, the Barn is a very welcome addition to the Southwest Austin nightlife scene, where we still like to keep things just a little bit weird."

                "description": "Wait, what? Double-take. Is that a barn? A bar? Food trucks? Hair salon? All of the above?! If you live in the neighborhood, you've probably had this thought more than once. By now you should know, it IS a bar! It does have food trucks! It also has a hair salon!  This is a cool little spot that they have been improving and adding to over time. It has bar games galore - cornhole (also a cornhole league), pool, darts, put put, jenga, etc. It has a small variety of drinks - a few hard alcohols to choose from, some beer, some wine, and usually a few frozen drinks. It's never too packed, which can be a good and bad thing. They do draw a nice crowd on weekends and when they have live music. They have spacious indoor and outdoor seating.   This bar is set up to be awesome, and I know the owner tries to get more people in here. He really is a nice guy! Ask about the history of the place when you're there, there's some interesting stuff! We've always had a good time here. So what is the problem? People are just slow on the uptake and they have their hands tied with advertising. So y'all need to branch out and try a new (well, not so new anymore) spot. Come hang, play, and be merry with your South Austin neighbors. You won't regret it."

Came to check it out and it's fantastic! Had to drop another review to attract more here- they haven't been open long but have an awesome set-up. Tons of space, great layout, super clean and good vibes. Family owned and run- the bartender gave me a few beers to try and clearly knows his stuff, not to mention knows the vendors and breweries, which I always respect. Delicious cold beer, they also have wine and white claw. Highly recommend- my favorite beer garden find in Austin!"

Music Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday for sure the owners are working on having live music other nights too / but just opened in October. They have food trucks right here so depending on what you are hungry for order your food at the food trucks and they will bring it to you as you enjoy a cool beverage .  Currently they only serve beer, AE ciders, wine and yummy alcoholic slushes and mimosas but full bar will be in the future."

From the moment we arrived we felt the unique vibe of a South Austin beer garden with food trailers in the lot and a modest $5 cover to have front row seats and a night of unbelievable musical talent. Beer and wine was modestly priced. Mike greeted us at the door and was a terrific host. Service was a little slow... but somehow it felt perfect to go along with the comfortable surroundings. We plan to visit again soon!"

                "description": "I was lucky enough to find this hidden gem. While stopped for traffic on Brodie Lane (in Sunset Valley) I looked to my right at the food trailers parked in the lot. Just passed my view I saw neon signs and one that said BAR.  This beautiful undiscovered oasis in the desert is called the BARn. It has a great divey feel to it, wide-open spaces, a pool table, televisions,  an outside beer garden and a wonderful variety of canned and bottled beer. It also does not have your typical red or white wine, you actually get a few choices. Its also kid and pet friendly too and it's a really a wonderful place for the whole family. They also have live music from Thursday to Sunday and from what I understand WC Clarke will be playing there soon. Look for Allyson, she is as smart as she is cute. She made me feel so welcome and is appreciative when people come in. I'm looking forward to spending a lot more time and winding down at the BARn.  P.S. The other cool part is you have the food truck park right next-door. It's a win win win situation!"

They have several food trucks outside that serve BBQ, Taco's and Jamaican food.  All are quite tasty.  They live music every night and open mic on Wed.  Mike the manager is very nice and inviting.  The best feature of this place is one of the  bartenders.  I believe her name is Jillian.  When she is working you never have to wait for a drink (even when it is slammed) , she also knows her beer and wine and is very good at assisting customers make selections.  She is also very personable and always greets customers with a smile."

                "description": "Honestly i would recommend this place. But, because they are fairly new i think they have some areas to improve and there are a few places i might go before coming back here.   The good.   This is a big indoor/outdoor brewery. Very family friendly. Big play scape for kids to run around. Can come here for food and drinks. Decent beer selection. Decent food selection. Clean and about what you'd expect to pay at a place like this.   The bad.   Though they have a decent food selection, it is lacking in execution. We ordered a variety of things to get a feel of all their flavors. Not very impressed. Let's just start with Texas bbq. Offer paper towels and some type of plates for share-ables v trying to eat out of a small serving box. We started with the queso and slaw with the burnt ends. The queso was lacking in brisket and the slaw was served without burnt ends. When we got the burnt ends, they were fatty (odd for burnt ends) and chewy. Not the crispy charred flavor one would hope for.   Let me preface on all the bbq, it is automatically covered in bbq sauce. This is not my ideal type of bbq. I want to control how much is on my meat.   Next we tried the ribs. Again chewy. Was really hoping for fall off the bone ribs. And again covered in bbq sauce. After trying a few, we could not even finish them.   We then got the chopped beef sandwich and the pepperoni pizza. I was hoping for a brick oven fire pizza. This felt more like a boxed frozen pizza with too much cheese, chewy crust, and thrown in the oven at 375 for 15 min. A bit disappointing. The brisket sandwich was probably the best part of the meal. Unfortunately it was also a bit too fatty for my liking and i only ate a few bites.   The beer was very good in my opinion. But considering the amazing bbq joints and pizza/beer joints around Austin, though i would probably come back, it would not be my first choice."

                "description": "TLDR: A little bit out there, but worth the drive  Came here on a Saturday afternoon. The first impression of both the outside and the inside is the asthetic. It is very tastefully put together (so much so It's worth commenting on). It has the right balance of \"instagramability\" with a twist of \"modern farmhouse\". The day I came out here, it was a tad crummy, so I didn't get to enjoy the outdoor area as much as I would have liked, but it is expansive. I'll certainly be back in better weather.  It's not all look though, they do have the beer to back it up. I only got to have two different ones on tap, but they were both really pleasant. on my next visit I hope to try some more, and see what they have to offer. Overall: 4.25/5"

                "description": "The beer is great but the atmosphere is very lacking. When we showed up on a Saturday afternoon, there was no seating. You had to enter (with a dog) through a crowded patio with other dogs. I luckily found 2 chairs not being used at a table to pull aside, but oh lord. There were kids EVERYWHERE. I can handle well behaved kids but there were probably 5 kids per every adult there. It was madness. They were running all over and several times the poor guy delivering food to tables was almost tripped up by them. Our dog was super overwhelmed by parents not watching their kids running up to him.  My husband went to get us beer while I waited outside with the dog, and it took him at least 15mins the line was so long. The beer deserves 5 stars but our dog (and us) were so uncomfortable with how crowded and crazy it was, that we left after quickly sharing a flight. I'd come back, but it would only be right when they opened, and not for very long, considering they're this crowded often.  I definitely don't feel like they took distancing or mask-wearing seriously....my husband and I were the only ones outside wearing them when not at our seated area.  Oh, and the sewage smell is so insane. Rotten eggs bad. Hard to enjoy a good beer with that constant smell. Reminded me of Twisted X Brewing."

                "description": "The space is a modern farmhouse look with high ceilings and clean, modern lines and the outside area has plenty of seating and trees for shade. Aesthetically it is close to perfect, but I have to knock a point off for the food. We ordered the smokehouse nachos and while they were delivered promptly, they were barely warm with cold pieces of brisket. I have to say, I'm amazed they can find anyone to deliver orders to, since you only get a table card for them to locate you, but in our case, we were seated close to the door, so he came straight to us. The beer was okay and I had the cider mimosa. Another thing I was less excited about, but didn't take points off for, was the number of children running around the place. There is a large playscape outside and as a parent whose child was once young, I get wanting to have places that are kid friendly, but that's just not my jam anymore. Again, I don't fault the place for that, but it'd probably make me less likely to return."

Good food.  Interesting beer.  Don't bother with the Mac and cheese as it's very reminiscent of Kraft that you can make at home.  The fried chicken tenders were just ok.  The sausage sampler platter was tasty.  They had other items on the menu that looked good but we didn't have a chance to try them this go-round.  The Barbados Stout was a fine stout.  The Wee Scottish was more unique but wasn't as peaty as I would like, but was still tasty."

The bagel was perfectly crispy and the egg + cheese went so well with the jalapeño cheddar bagel. My bacon was also extra crispy which I like! I also got a lavender latte, honestly not worth it and pretty pricey.   The inside also isn't very big so we had to wait for a table. They also have an outdoor area for seating, but it was too cold to sit outside.The staff is very friendly and our food came out hot and fast! Took away a star because of the over priced latte and lack of seating."

Got a cup of coffee while my friend got a beer and he enjoyed his beer! The coffee was pretty standard. Got BEC bagel and unfortunately they were out of everything but the cinnamon raisin (we got there at 11:15) and it wasn't that great. Probably just alright. Overall nice place to sit down, grab a beer or coffee and read or just hang out."

The staff is always really friendly and do a good job of making sure that you're taken care of!  My favorite thing to get here alongside a cold brew is breakfast bagel sandwich. They serve Rosen's Bagels, which is the closest thing you can get to an NYC bagel in Austin (not an exact replacement, but close enough).  It's definitely one of the coffee shops that you need to cross off your Austin list!"

I almost stopped coming here after that experience until my next hangover called for a breakfast sandwich.   Do: order breakfast Don't: order coffee"

I have ordered 2 versions of their breakfast sandwich S.O.B. And I have to say both are delish in their own way.  Vegan SOB made with beyond breakfast sausage and a house made cashew cheese. It's just stacked with flavor. Then their original SOB you can get a few different meat options I went with sausage - there some kind of aioli, avocado and taters! Such a mess but worth it!   They have craft beers you can take to go- I love that they carry the brand Untitled art. It's a traveling craft brewery that makes incredible flavors!   Dog friendly and just a must stop spot! GO!"

The flavor options, milk accommodations, outside seating, to go options all made it really inviting. Bagel with lox always a favorite and being from NJ it's a staple I usually judge pretty harshly on but was happy here during my stay in Austin. They also have cute merch, some CBD and beer items too. Local, small business. Would happily come back on my next trip."

It was easy to find from my hotel and primely located across from target on 5th street. The signage only says \"brew and brew\" so I was confused but soon confirmed that I was at the correct place. I know I desired the bagel with smoked salmon so I ordered it but was not impressed. The bagel was cold, flavorless and the smoked salmon was flavorless. I love a good culinary concoction but this just kissed the mary. It was pretty yet did not taste amazing. Presentation was nice however and service was good."

                "description": "Came here to do some work on a Wednesday afternoon. There were a good number of people hanging out, but plenty of available seating with large tables and ample outlets available. The noise level was perfect, not so quiet that you'd be uncomfortable having a private conversation, but quiet enough that you can get work done.   Coffee drink offerings were pretty standard in terms of options and prices. They have a really wide variety of beers available, as with most spots in the area most of them are localish. They could expand a little bit on their food options, especially on their non breakfast items since they seem to lean more towards the happy hour crowd.   I went for the cold brew which tasted great- super smooth and didn't need much milk to get a nice creamy taste. Be warned it is super strong, it takes a lot for me to get a caffeine rush from coffee and this really did the trick.   Overall I think it's a great place for a date spot, to get some work done, or hit a casual happy hour. I can definitely see myself coming back here in the future"

He was being a dipshit about his mask (like acting like he was wearing it, but then intentionally wearing it wrong so the staff had to say something). He took a call and didn't wear it and that woman said something so he got all in a huff and walked out. It didn't seem like anyone threw him out, to me. I did kind of want to toss him myself but guys like that always have some virus. Don't want to get close.   Anyway I've been home to Texas a few times lately. A friend told me to try this place and I've gone every time I'm home. The food, beer (I don't like coffee) and staff have always been really good. Made me feel welcomed home. They do it right.

Surrounded by many new construction projects is a small coffee and brew joint nestled on the corner - you might pass it if you drive too fast - please don't!  I came in recently for breakfast and I was saddened a little as the menu had changed from my last visit. I'm normally chill about this however my wife was excited about the breakfast offerings I described only to realize they trimmed the menu down a bit.  I went 4 stars solely due to the reduced menu from the past. I just wish they did more breakfast on the weekend.  The coffee is great (FlatTrack) and beer even better I'd say. I find going over to FlatTrack gets me a little more for breakfast vs here although the venue is larger.  This isn't a diss but a request to improve is all. The mainstream is coming and I want my local to stay."

My friend and I found this place on a whim and decided to try out this cider bar. We both got the Cider Flights and tried out their Fried Pickles and Smoked Chicken Wings.  Cider Flights: The ciders here totally converted me into a cider drinker. The flight comes with your choosing of 4 different flavors. We chose: pineapple, black cherry, texas honey, cranberry, blood orange, original, and rose.   Fried Pickles: Comes with a side of ranch. Nice and crunchy and plenty to share.  Smoked Chicken Wings: I'm still not sure if I like these are not. I'd say they are like a 3/5...or maybe even a 2.5/5. It was a little more charred then I liked. Also the sauce that came on top of the wings (some sort of celery mixture) was just \"okay\". I wish we would have ordered their pizza because the table next to us ordered one and it looked really good.   Anyhoo, the staff here was superb, the drinks were fire, and the music was rockin! Enough to make me want to go back for more."

I ended up getting a flight (blood orange, cranberry, peach, and pineapple) and a turkey club with fries.   The flight: 10/10. The peach was my favorite and I could probably drink that everyday of my life. Pineapple was a close second. They were all amazing.  The turkey club: 2/10 and the 2 is just for the fries that came with it. Not sure what was up with this. It sounded good, even LOOKED good when it came out. It didn't taste like... anything. I know it wasn't just me because a friend ordered the same thing and said the same thing. We ended up sending them back.  The service: INCREDIBLE 100/10. Our server was so amazing and sweet. Obviously we felt bad sending food back but she understood!  Can't wait to come back!"

Outside they have covered areas and open air seating all with fans and misters to help keep you cool. We're not huge cider drinkers so we opted for a few flights (4 choices each flight). Almost all the flavor options are amazing to try.   They have a parking lot in the back that they validate. It is a bit of a hassle getting in and out as it is shared with an apartment building. This location definitely has more space and a different, younger feel. The staff is attentive and create a relaxed, go with the flow environment.   Cute place to take friends."

                "description": "I went to Austin Eastciders after spending the hot day at Barton Springs in the middle of August. It's on the main road leading to Barton Springs, so it was just a quick drive over. There's a parking lot in the back that they validate and there was plenty of spots back there.  There was a lot of outdoor and indoor seating at this spot. I liked the lookof the whole restaurant. It was pretty fun and playful, but also clean and aesthetic. We ended up sitting inside at a normal table though. There was also some bar seating inside and a little cafe area for the mornings.   Service was okay, getting drinks was fast but food was a little slower. We went in the afternoon, so it wasn't too busy because it was between lunch and dinner hours. We ended up just ordering some drinks and appetizers since we weren't too hungry.   Drinks:  I split a cider flight with my girlfriend where you get to choose any 4 flavors they have. It was fun to try a couple of flavors since we aren't big drinkers, but my girlfriend likes ciders. We tried Texas honey cider, blackberry, blood orange and peach.   Appetizers: - Truffle Fries - The fries were really good! We shamefully devoured them pretty quickly.  - Baked Goat Cheese - cider candied figs, chili smoked local honey, candied pecans, served with sliced and toasted Easy Tiger baguette. The goat cheese dip was also a big hit. I felt like it was kind of small though and we were wishing for more. A good combo of sweet, crunchy and savory.   Overall, fun little spot where you can try a couple ciders and eat a snack or a whole meal. Good location near Barton Springs, so it seems like it would be pretty popular in the summer."

Windy day, so there are napkins every where, which I know is no control of the place itself. Just writing my experience! Chris got a flight and I got a drank and it was good! SO happy they had the broccolini option cuz I'm on this weird diet. AND IT WAS SO GOOD. The flavor, the pine nuts! ugh, I was like.. \"need to learn how to make this myself\" SO many great flavors! Cute place overall and we will definitely return!"

My friends and I shared a cider flight, and got the rosé, peach, blood orange, and blackberry ciders. My favorites were the rosé and blood orange ones. We also got the fried pickles and queso as apps to go with the ciders. Overall a great spot if you're looking for a chill night out!"

                "description": "Stopped by on our way to the airport! The outside has tons of seating and FREE PARKING! Inside has super cute wallpaper even in the bathroom. And they have information about the history and process they use. We got a flight and some lunch. We really enjoyed all the ciders in the flight - the watermelon and blood orange were favorites! The food was impressive tbh. It paired well with the ciders and wasn't super greasy like bar food can be. When I saw that the burger had 2 patties, I thought they were smash patties, I didn't expect them to be like a normal burger size! Burger was cooked great and I upgraded to fries which hit the spot. My husband got the quesadilla and highly reccomend adding brisket!! Service was great and attentive. Would definitely suggest stopping by if you're in town!"

                "description": "Stopped by here for the first time today after walking our pup around the Zilker area.  The patio here is dog-friendly so that was a big win in our book!    The patio is really clean, well shaded, and has a lot of fans.  It was the perfect setting for a quick Sunday lunch.  Living in Austin for many years I'm of course familiar with Austin Eastciders but this was my first time dining at their new restaurant.  The service was great and the overall atmosphere was very lowkey.  We came during brunch hours so there were both breakfast and lunch items available.  The menu is pretty standard with your typical American patio food.  Think burgers/sandwiches/salads/pizza.  I ordered the burger which was honestly way better than I expected.  I would certainly return and have another.  My partner ordered the breakfast on a bun which he also enjoyed.  Of course we had a couple of ciders as well.  They have a rotating seasonal frozen drink which we also tried.  Pineapple passion fruit was the flavor of the season!   The staff was attentive and even brought a bowl of ice water for our pup.    A couple of areas for improvement: getting seated was a little awkward.  All their signs say please wait to be seated.  After standing and waiting for about 5 mins we finally went to find a staff member who told us it was open seating.  Also, once we finished our meal it took nearly 20 mins to get the check.  Not a big deal bc we were not in a rush, but could certainly be annoying under different circumstances.    I wouldn't say I'd go out of my way to come here, but if you're in the area it is definitely one of the best options on the Barton Springs Rd strip near Zilker!"

                "description": "Five stars for just drinks. We didn't order food. Service here is friendly and hospitable.  We had the pineapple cider and the blood orange. Both exceptional. Not too sweet as I am but a huge cider person. With that being said, one the best ciders I've had.   The misters on a very hot day are an added plus. Love the 2000 whatever songs they bring me back to my childhood and teen years. Added bonus.   In the front they have cute swings for the bar area. On the menu you can see pizzas - some say to order well done for crispy. I can't comment on this. They are also known for their baked Brie. Very relaxing place near a lot of key places in austin. Give it a try!"

Everything is bright and FUN! Plenty of indoor, bar, and outdoor seating. Pet and live music friendly.  As for the food it's delicious. I love the fried pickles and pizza. The staff is always friendly and helpful. Sometimes it's hard picking my cider flavor. Parking is easily accessible in the the parking garage located directly behind the restaurant. You ask your server or bartender to validate your parking, and they give you a ticket to scan with your ticket for complimentary parking. Big PLUS."

                "description": "An Austin classic!  Austin Eastciders is basically at every bar around the city, I'm glad I finally got to visit the flagship store.  Great vibe, very clean, very fun and fresh!  The frozen watermelon cocktail is delicious but STRONG. Let me warn you, you can't really taste the bourbon in there so be careful! But if you go on Tuesday's they are only $5.  The flight is a great way to sample a bunch of ciders! My personal favorites are the Texas Honey and Blood Orange. The honey is sweet and the orange has a delicious orange subtly to it!   The Soco pizza is a great deal if you are going for happy hour - 50% off! Crunchy crust, great way to soak up the alcohol.  Worth a visit for every local and visitor alike!"

                "description": "This place has such a fun vibe and their food and drink is excellent! It's definitely a trendy new Austin spot and fits right in to the Barton Springs area. I'm not usually a cider drinker but dang, these are delicious!  My Order: - Traditional Cider - Smooth and not at all overpowering tart. - Pineapple Cider - I'm hoping to find cans of these in stores because it was like a tropical escape in a glass! - Baked Goat Cheese - If y'all know me, you know I MUST order the cheese dish and oh.my.gosh it was worth it! Came piping hot and we scraped the bowl! - Hippie Hollow Pizza - This pizza is super delicious and stuck with our goat cheese theme. It has a thin crust and filled with veggies and cheese on top. Definitely would order again! - Charred Broccolini - Usually broccoli doesn't knock my socks off but this was so freaking good! The sauce pairing was seriously delicious. 10/10 would order again!  Pro-Tip: Have them validate your parking because mine would have been $29 but through validation it was free!  Get over to Austin Eastciders! Might be best to try it on a week night when it is not so chaotic but you won't regret it!"

The prices here are very affordable and the atmosphere is laid back. Parking on Barton Springs can be tricky, but they provide a QR code for a few free hours in the garage on your receipt. So thankful for this!  I've tried the drag and lady bird pizzas and both were great! When it comes to the ciders, a lot of the flavored ones are pretty sweet, so I like to just stick to the original.   Overall, I had a great time and will definitely be back!"

We got a flight, but were there kinda late (~7:30 PM) so they were out of a most food items. I understand that because of COVID it could be hard to get stuff, but we were sad. Staff seemed tired. Again, it's understandable but we were excited to be there, but they didn't seem to be. Overall, this is a go-to spot if you're in the area and go during the day."

                "description": "My first time having hard cider and alcohol in 1.5 years (breaking pandemic sobriety- anyone else?) and Austin Eastciders didn't disappoint! I've been seeing these offered in multiple restaurants and just had to visit their brick and mortar location. We got a flight of 4 and a frozen cucumber melon cider (on their summer menu). I loved the Texas Honey and Peach Seltzer, and would recommend those for anyone! The honey goes down so smooth and pairs perfectly with the slightly bitter cider. The frozen cucumber melon tasted a bit like green juice and the melon cider was a bit underwhelming (could barely taste the melon at all) so I would stay away from those unless you really like your green juice/vegetables.   Outdoor seating was perfect in the summer- they had fans on for the heat and was a great place to kickback and relax with a friend. Parking in the garage is free (up to 4 hours) with a purchase, and you can easily redeem your ticket on your receipt when exiting the garage. The atmosphere was very Austin and laid back/chill, service was friendly, and I will return again for another round!"

All vegetarian as far as I can tell too. The drink menu also looks top-notch.   Parking is tightly packed and not much of it. Tarrytown is a neat area. Outdoor seating had some fun flames to keep people warm. We sat inside and had a reservation.   We ordered the Brussels Sprouts, the Buffalo Cauli, crabcakes and The Burger. Wow. I'm not sure I've tasted appetizers so well prepared. I wouldn't change a thing. All of it was so very delicious and filling. Its like magic: just the right amount of everything. This is how food at restaurants should be.  To drink we has the Hot Toddy and The Mule. Both perfectly flavorful and gorgeous. Food and drinks and tip for two was about a hundred bucks. Worth every penny and I'm going back for sure."

The Sriracha Brussels sprouts were tasty and spicy, but a little soggy and I like my sprouts a little crispy. So we took them home and popped them in the air fryer  the fries were delicious I enjoyed the spices on them, but I could not get over how tasteless the burger was (I know it's not real meat) but it's just not for me - I just think it needs more flavor/spice etc. All in all great vibe at the restaurant and would recommend to anyone who is vegan/vegetarian or wanting a healthy dining option."

Went there for brunch and ordered the oyster mushrooms and grits, fruit plate and a side of toast. The grits were great, but included a tiny bit of mushrooms and at $17, just absurdly overpriced. The single, thin piece of toast was $4 and the fruit plate consisted of a small handful of blueberries and a couple of melon chunks. The food is good, but way overpriced and of poor value. Maybe dinner is better - I want to come back and try it. On the plus side, the food and coffee were tasty, and service was friendly and very good."

                "description": "The  beer plant curry . Is a  bit  spicy .  Pro: Beautifully presented , edible  Con :  The flavor was off .   Overall I give the dish a 4/10 . It was edible ,but I don't want to mutter through eating  my food especially  if it's a hearty  dish , I want to enjoy my  meal .   The country fried chicken -   Pro : the mash potatoes  were decent    , the \"skin \" of the chicken was ok Con :  The fried chicken was  two gelatinous bricks ,    Overall: 3/10    The pictures  shown is of  all the food I left behind , so now I'll still have to find something else to eat. All  of the food was room temperature and very mild flavored.  After I expressed I didn't care for the dishes I was ignored, I had to flag down someone  to pay."

                "description": "Read a bunch of restaurant reviews on Yelp before deciding on this place. There are so many great eats in Austin and this one is definitely worth writing about.   I went in on a Sunday evening around 8:45pm. There was hardly anyone inside so I decided to eat at the bar. The bartender (Laura Lee!) helped me dwindle down my options. I had read about the tomato and nectarine salad, but was worried that it would have a mustard flavor in it. She assured me that there wasn't and admitted that she, too, wasn't a mustard fan. SO glad I ordered it! It was such a perfect balance of flavors and I finished the entire thing.   Next up - should I get the eggplant parm or the \"crab\" cakes. She thought about it and says \"go with the crab cakes.\" Holy moly!!  These were INCREDIBLE! So flavorful and the sauce that came with it - just perfection! Highly recommend!!  Check this place out if you want something a little away from 6th street. It's just a few minutes away and so, so worth it. :)"

                "description": "Third visit to this upscale plant-based restaurant and were not let down. Recommend making a reservation especially if you want indoor seating. We enjoy the dimmed ambience, but sometimes large parties do make it loud inside. Our favorite starter: the Buffalo cauliflower with blue cheese. Favorite entree: the spicy \"chicken\" sandwich with oyster mushroom (nice that it isn't cauliflower). Not a huge fan of their Mac and cheese or loaded fries. On our most recent trip, we tried The 'burger' which was delicious especially if you like arugula. They serve upscale cocktails, beer, and wine. Pricing is pretty fair: $6-$12 for a drink and $13-$20 for an entree. Huge bonus: parking has never been an issue!!!"

Something is off with the hot crispy sandwich, maybe they changed the mushroom, but it not as delicious as it once was. many of the items I used to enjoy are also no longer on the menu. Service was good but the quality of the food, and limited options, no longer matches the vibe, or price."

I loved the Nightwing (pictured below) which visually is very cool due to the activated charcoal."

Portions are very generous and we were happily stuffed. The cauliflower and Brussels sprouts appetizers are amazing. We split the kimchi grilled cheese and I crave it now! The cocktails were also great. A lot of people mention its pricy, but we really didn't think so compared to other restaurants in austin and for the portion size. We'll be back soon!"

                "description": "I feel bad for giving this place a two star review because the customer service was absolutely amazing. But everything else here fell short. First, parking. Super narrow, one way, extremely tight. If you miss the correct turn be prepared to either U turn out or drive down and hope you're not in anyone's way. Second, the wait time here is excruciating. Ordered an appetizer I'll be honest, I didn't time this part. But it was long enough of a wait to constantly wonder where's my food? There's a lot of waiting here. It was pretty insane. We decided at 5:20 we were done eating. We didn't see anyone to ask for our bill until 5:51 (I checked this time). When I finally got someone for some reason they looked confused when I called??? I went inside to pay I did not want to wait a moment longer in the cold. Even to pay I had to wait. Like I really can't catch a break in this place. Third, food was very disappointing. The Mac and cheese was good. But my entrees were subpar. I have very high expectations for vegan food in Austin. I usually get the best vegan meals here. But this place fell flat. Like 1/5 for sure. For $50 I expect way more in the flavor department. Also, the items on the menu on Yelp are different from items I saw here. Double check the menu before coming. I think they rotate through their menus. So I was also upset by my options. I didn't like the options I saw and assumed I picked the safest option The Burger. Hard to mess up, so I thought. They were out of pretzel buns so I was given sourdough bread. That is the toughest bread I've ever had. So that didn't work for me either. Mango ice tea was bad too. Just tasted like water. We also had the Kimchi grilled cheese which was just okay. Fourth, I'm not upset I was seated outside. I was freezing out there. Even with the outdoor heaters were on. I am upset that I could not make reservations online. I attempted to days before coming in but the website told me I could not make reservations for 2 people??? Bizarre. With such a rule one would hope they'd have plenty of seating. They did not. My options were either outside or at the bar. Don't like bar seating so we picked outside. Super chilly windy day so I was uncomfortable. With super tiny tables. We barely had room for all of our plates. Every time another item came we had to rearrange everything just to make the item fit. My server was very nice though. Just wish I saw him more often."

                "description": "A really fun concept. I love that everything here is vegan so I don't have to worry!   Starting off with the Sriracha Brussels - very tasty. I wish there was more glaze on it though and that it packed more spice. It's pretty mild but the sprouts were still quite tasty. The Carolina was a very interesting sandwich. I was expecting them to use jackfruit in a pulled pork sandwich but they used banana blossom instead. The flavor was there especially with the bbq sauce but the texture was definitely weird.  My favorite from this place is the kimchi grilled cheese! Being no dairy I have not had a grilled cheese in AGES and it was definitely something I really craved. This grilled cheese hit the spot. I love that they added kimchi and pear to give it more depth. The kimchi was pretty overpowering though. But overall the sandwich was so delicious.  Great food, slightly pricey."

                "description": "This place is pretty good for all vegan options. The food was flavorful and the service was good. We ordered the Nashville hot chicken sandwich and the hill country chicken and gravy. There was a lot of breading on both \"chicken\" dishes which was a bit much but the flavor was pretty good overall. The mac n cheese was a little bland, but that was the first vegan Mac n cheese I've had. We ordered the loaded fries as an app. Those were my favorite of everything we ordered. This is a pretty loud restaurant, but isn't always a bad thing if you get seated next to the right guests! Overall, I recommend at least trying this place out! There's an extensive drink menu, so it would probably be good for happy hour!"

My buddy and I stopped by on my first day in town, and we clearly started things off on the right foot. We each got flights - and I was very content with each beer I got; and they even allowed the barrel-aged stout to be one of my choices (some places can be somewhat stingy with their BAs).  Solid, under-the-radar brewery - will definitely be back next time I'm in town!"

I like places that don't have pretentious attitudes towards food when food is not their primary business. Paninis are perfect for a brewery - low fuss, easy, fast. And tasty!

Enjoyed all the beers but went back for 2nds with the BBA Stout, comes in a 7oz pour due to the higher abv.

I've been here pre-pandemic and during, and I gotta say...I'm so glad they're here to grace the South Austin beer community with their presence. When I visited the first time they had just opened and their taproom was still a work in progress. They still had a good selection of board games, self-serve water and beer/cider in a dog-friendly taproom. Yes, I repeat...bring yo dawgs.  Most recently, I ordered a trio of their 32 oz crowlers. There was a deal going on, and I GOTTA SAY THE SEVEN STILLS OMG. That scotch ale was deliciously dark and creamy without being overboard. I was afraid it would be burning on the throat and too infused with that liquor aftertaste. BUT it was so deliciously decadent. It had a dark chocolate feel with a full and steady mouth feel! Deeeeelish. I hope they brew it again. Their Peak Season IPA was also SO yummy and refreshing. I just checked out their tap list and there are so many creative and interesting beers right now. SO GET ON IT Y'ALL.  Pro Tip: check out their instagram page because there are usually cool deals or posts (like one time they gave free warm pretzels to the first few customers)!"

Great people with great beer and unsuspecting great food.    Peak season is a top tier hazy IPA.  Radberry was a great sour that was sweet without being fruit juice.  I think it'd satisfy both the tart lovers and Kettle sour seekers.  I was saving my appetite for a BBQ heavyweight but after tasting my girlfriend's turkey pesto I totally regret my decision to not get food.  The whole thing was a delight.  The flavors and texture all come together to deliver one heck of a Sammy.   Definitely a destination to stop at!"

It's on easy tiger sourdough bread which I love too!  It was hot and melty - so delicious!  The BF had sweet prosciutto panini which he loved too!  But I liked mine better!  The staff was really friendly and helpful. We're will definitely be back!"

                "description": "Came here to hang out with a large group on a Saturday afternoon, they have a sizable space with plenty of tables, space to stand, and games to play while you're there. There was a lively bunch of people throughout our time there, but it never got too crowded.   Their beer selection was fairly limited, but it's understandable given they're quite new to the area. The bartender was super helpful and let my friend and I sample a few of them. Being indecisive I still chose to have a flight after.   My personal favorite beer I tried was the dry hopped wheat, but the hazy IPA and the raspberry milkshake IPA also stood out! Their menu was quite IPA heavy, so hopefully they'll continue to branch out, but it does look like they rotate their menu quite often.   There's also a fantastic Korean food truck out back that I highly recommend checking out while you're here.   Overall, I think the combination of good space to hang out, tasty beer, and delicious food is well worth checking out."

In addition the food is a great balance between freshness and greasiness which is perfect for buzzed eats.  I will be taking beers home with me for sure!"

                "description": "This is a trendy little place just off Manor and Airport Boulevard.  There's a fair amount of seating inside and plenty of parking. They also have 16 picnic tables outside to sit at. Due to the low ceiling, this place can get quite noisy when crowded. They have a good craft beer selection albeit quite limited. The beers they make on premise are solid and on point. I only wish they could expand the selection. Their small personal pizzas are worth every penny. With all the new apartments going up in the area, I'm sure this will become a well-established neighborhood pub. Unfortunately, the one negative is that at the time of check out, the infamous \"how much do you want to tip\" screen pops up with at least a 25% minimum when you pay by credit card. That really bothers me considering this is a self service establishment. I'm all for tipping, but that methodology rubs me the wrong way and I tend to steer away from businesses that employ this tactic. The pictures below give a little more insight."

I ordered their American IPA called Pop! Pop! - it was very good. I also decided to try their sour menu and had their Foeder Saison (Family Matters) and enjoyed it more than the IPA even. On this night, one of the bartenders had put on an old playlist they had created years ago and I swear it was perfect song after perfect song after perfect song. You get it. A place like this can easily get by without having to play wonderful, eclectic music for its patrons, but the fact that it usually does just makes it that much better. As always, be sure to tip your [incidentally very cute] bartenders. x"

I've gotten into the habit of stopping in after the gym for a nice relaxing couple of pints while reading a book.  On the Sunday afternoons I've been frequenting this place, the parking is ample and the space is populated but not crowded. I love the diversity of their brews and the frequency with which they change. I've been very happy with the quality and friendliness of service. I think their price-point is spot on for both the brews and the food. I've recently fallen in love with their Caesar salad. It's absolutely delicious and I love the home-made dressing. This will be one of my go-to spots for the foreseeable future and one that I look forward to sharing with my friends. I highly recommend the Bada Bing pizza (meatball) if you love cracker-thin crusts like I do.  They always have a fun variety of beer. I've recently enjoyed their Foeder style beers. They also have a nice selection of hazy IPAs right now that show good variations of the style. Again, I don't have a single favorite as their rotation of brews ensures that I find a new favorite each visit."

Ordered a pizza and first off I love the crust. It's a thin crust that if you probably asked to have it cooked a little longer for some crispy but not too crispy crust and it would be amazing. Also ordered these Tex-mex style meatballs and they had chorizo in them which was different but satisfying. Next time I'm in Austin I'm headed back to oodwood for a Stromboli.  Service was amazing because you order everything from your phone and pay from your phone so I really don't see how someone could mess up that system lol it's not like your server is going to forget to put your order in.  It's dog friendly and I love that.  All in all I had a great first time experience and will most definitely be back."

                "description": "Ok, I want to give the 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding down for the blatantly misleading name. This feels a lot more like a sports bar with some outdoor space than a \"beer garden.\" When I think \"beer garden,\" I picture something with more ambiance (for example plants, string lights, communal tables, music maybe). Instead, here you have a patio with many TVs blaring the game and a dark, concrete/rock picnic area. Yes they have some string lights... on the outer edges of the parking lot #doinitwrong.  That said, they have a great selection of beers and the bartenders are really friendly and helpful. We also enjoyed the food trucks out back. Soooo, if you're looking for a chill spot to catch a game with some great beer, this will fit the bill! If you're looking for a \"beer garden,\" like for a casual date, not so good."

                "description": "Myself and a few friends came here for the Superbowl. The space is so fun and there is a TON of seating outside on the wraparound patio. I think there was two or three bars. We never had to wait in a long line. The drinks were fine, nothing crazy! The food is what I was a little bummed about. I ordered the cheese steak and the mac n cheese (game day special). The cheese steak was okay but the cheese tasted so weird - I'm not sure how to describe it. The bread it was on was hard and overall, extremely messy. The mac n cheese, I think, had the same cheese so it was just a little off putting. I would definitely come back, just wouldn't order food!"

                "description": "The place has a roadhouse atmosphere, most of the staff looked like they were operating a biker bar which at first made me feel a little intimidated, especially when they ignored me. The gentleman at the bar acted like whatever paperwork he was doing was more important than paying customers.  After getting my beer I walked out to the patio to find a place to sit. I was greeted by what I assume was the owner (but again the biker appearance threw me off). He was polite, welcomed me and my party and let me know that he was there if we needed any help.  The seating was comfortable and fun. There was a food truck where we ordered nachos. They were good.  After returning for my second beer I recognized that the beer was flat. I alerted the staff, they gave me another but it was still bad. I suspect the lines need to be cleaned she apologized said she would take it off my bill, I chose another beer and moved on.  Later when lying she charged me for the bad beer anyway, so confused.  Anyway, overall I was disappointed with their beer selection, and disappointed with the staff attentiveness to customers. Had they taken better care of their beer I could have looked past their other shortcomings, but you have to get the beer right if you advertise yourself as a tap house."

Patio area is fine and well covered w heaters... outside open space is small but allows those w kids to set them free. It's fine if the other two are crazy busy, which they usually are, and you just want to hang. Beer selection is  good."

Laid back, chill vibes, CHEAP beer (I don't know if it was happy hour or what, but my local hef (forgot the name, but not Live Oak) was only $4 (feel like I'm usually paying between $6-$8 for local draft hefs everywhere else), and there are TVs everywhere playing all the sporting events televised at the moment.   It's super spacious, there are wooden picnic tables everywhere for seating (covered wrap around patio and outside near the BBQ food truck), and there's also a handful of arcade-y games (not sure if they're operational at this time but they added to the backyard fun aesthetic of the place).  Nice staff, all the safety precautions accounted for, and off the beaten path cool.  Stop by just because or if you're making your way to/from Valentina's ;)"

                "description": "We must've found an old menu online -- so we thought we were going to a place that had burgers, wings, salads, and snacks. Instead, it's just a BBQ trailer and every menu item comes covered in that awful bright yellow plastic cheese you get with your movie theater nachos. I don't remember the last time every single family member said \"I don't like this / this is not good.\" The drinks were good and the staff were super friendly. The kids had fun running around on the seesaws and outdoor area. But there's simply no excuse for such terrible food in Austin in 2022. Would not recommend unless you just want drinks."

It's so refreshing to get a cocktail for less than $16 in this city!  The vibe is also so laid back.  We've never had issues finding parking but on occasion have walked or rideshared here to be safe.  We also thoroughly enjoyed the bbq food truck that is here last time we stopped by.  Additionally everyone we've seen on the property has been safe and masked which we really appreciate."

                "description": "This review is mostly for the food. As of June 2020 the food truck on site is HBQ bbq which doesn't seem to have its own Yelp page - which is a serious problem because it needs some serious love! You know the standards for bbq are high in this town, and HBQ holds its own very well for being virtually unknown. My favorite part of a bbq meal isn't actually the meat, it's the sides, so I was excited to see the selection! I ordered a little of everything (well, not everything, but about half the menu... enough that the cook asked if it were for one or two people when he saw a tiny girl come to pick up all of it!) I ordered what I thought would be a chicken salad sandwich, but maybe I ordered wrong or maybe their idea of \"chicken salad\" is different than mine, because what I got was a typical chicken sandwich - sliced chicken, slaw and what seemed to be mild hot sauce on a hearty roll. Despite the initial disappointment, it wasn't too bad for a chicken sandwich. It was huge! A good deal for the price. However, I didn't want to fill up on it, so I was glad when my friend's son expressed interest in the other half of it. More room for the sides! The hatch creamed corn was amazing - other friends raved about it too. It had a bit of a kick after a few bites, but nothing a spice wimp like myself couldn't handle. The mac and cheese was billed as \"sriracha mac and cheese\" but was not spicy. It was average in a good way, slightly on the not-so-cheesy end, that would be a disappointment to have alone as a meal, but definitely enjoyable as a side dish. The cucumber salad was surprisingly good. I didn't expect much. Who gets excited about cucumbers? I ordered it out of curiosity and so I could feel good about eating some token vegetables. It turned out to be a real sleeper hit! It was a bit like eating pickles, toned-down enough that I could eat a whole cup of them without being overpowered by brine. When they loaded the \"loaded potato salad\" they weren't messing around! It had a lot of cheddar cheese and bacon, and some green onion. Apparently they rotate their pie selection, and this time they had peanut butter ice box pie. The cook asked how much whipped cream I wanted on it and I told him not to hold back! It was obviously delicious. Obviously. You're probably wondering about the meats, because this is a bbq truck. I was with a large group, so I got to hear everyone's review of just about everything on the menu, and everyone was impressed. I know they tried brisket, pulled pork, ribs, mac and cheese loaded with meat and queso, and queso as a dip. All servings were a pretty decent size for their price. The queso was the only unusual thing - it was more like movie-theatre nacho cheese that most Texans wouldn't call queso. However, apparently once it was mixed with brisket, it was good, and I saw several servings of it get finished off.  Like I said, I was with a big group, and the venue accommodated is well.  Drinks seemed satisfactory. (I only had water.) I think I heard live music coming from inside. Kids enjoyed the small playground. (And to tell, the truth, at the end of the night, I went and climbed on it too.) Picnic tables, shade coverings, parking bathrooms and all those important amenities were good. I wish this place was closer in to town, but if it were, that might ruin what they've got going. Despite the long drive south, I'll be likely to return! Update: I checked their menu and they have two chicken sandwiches. It looks like I ordered the wrong one. No wonder I was disappointed, but that's good news for the rest of y'all to know that their chicken sandwich is a decent take on a typical chicken sandwich. But I'm still craving a good chicken salad sandwich..."

It was rather cold that day but we opted to sit outside so we can have prime view to the TV screen.  They brought out heaters for the outdoor seating so there was some warmth to be had.  The drinks were a bit on the expensive side but they're showing the fight with no cover so it was worth it.  What I really enjoyed was the food trucks out back.  The food was amazing!  I had the BBQ plate and the cream corn and mac and cheese were so delicious!!!  The BBQ itself was great of course.  The atmosphere was really fun and I definitely would come back to watch the next UFC fight."

We had our 2 year with us and Miguel, the other bartender, came and brought him like 6 brand new car toys to play with!!

We didn't actually do the crawfish thing but were attracked here by some online advertising we saw.  We were super impressed with how fun our visit was and the service was prompt and kind. I had one of their blonde beers on tap. I am not a huge beer drinker, but it was cold, light and tasty. My wife had a Shiner on tap. Taylor was a quaint little town to spend an afternoon. One of the owners, Amy, stopped to welcome us which was super nice as it was clear they were busy. Several folks told us the BBQ was good so we plan to return soon. All and in all a very postive down home experience. Well done!"

Everyone standing had on masks(CORRECTLY). The Women's bathroom was also clean and easy to access in my walker. (Gold star) We were driving back to College Station-or else I would have stayed longer.

I don't need my ass kissed but when I'm being served and ask for suggestions and all you do is shrug your shoulders and offer nothing that's a HUGE turnoff. I've been bragging about this place to my boyfriend and begging him to take a motorcycle ride out here with me (I live in the Georgetown area) but I'd rather go somewhere else.  I get my hair done next door and slip over for a beer while my color sits. I'd rather drink water than be treated like crap again."

                "description": "Beer was good. Service was questionable. Food was bad.  I had a flight of four different Texas Beer Company beers and they were all okay but to be honest they tasted like beer you can get anywhere these days. I wouldn't say that I'm in a hurry to get back and try more.  Both the bartender and the server gave confusing and unnecessary explanations regarding the food. I didn't inquire where it was cooked, but they both took time to explain something about a \"central kitchen\" that is next door that serves a few nearby establishments? Thanks for the information...I guess. I ordered a pizza but was then asked if I had a back-up choice, so I ordered a different pizza. It was one of the worst pizzas I've ever had, and I am not picky at all about pizza.  Glad I stopped by to check it out, but probably wouldn't go back."

I started out with a flight, but the house beer had me coming back for a full pint.   I love the decor, and for anyone looking for a \"lounge\" to quietly gossip in- this ain't it.   This place is cool, loud, and with a live band it should be awesome!!!  I will have to come back when you guys have live music, because that would be the icing on the cake.  Enjoy the drive out there from ATX, and be nice to the staff- they are good people and friendly if you aren't an asshat to them.  Tip well and carry on!  Again, thanks Max for your skills!"

The beer was great, but needed more of a variety in my opinion. They do offer wine for you wine drinkers out there. The noise level is pretty loud with the way the facility is designed inside. Plenty of seating inside and outside. We enjoyed our time sitting outside.  The staff attended to our needs very well and made sure we had our drinks full when ready.

All the brews we've tried are excellent, and my frau really likes their IPA - which is saying a lot, since she is very picky about her hop fix.   Service is fast and friendly, and everything in the place is well kept up. Davis BBQ has a little set up at the end of the bar, so you can also get some quality BBQ with your pint if you feel a little peckish.   Picnic table seating, aside from the bar seats, and kid and dog friendly."

The Bourbon Berry Cocktail was my favorite! We also enjoyed sampling many different beers and wines on tap. Their crispy chicken sandwich was delicious! Very crispy on the outside and moist on in the inside.   They have crowlers and growlers for 25% off everyday. I really wish they had a smaller to go container as I would've loved to have taken some of the Berry cocktail home - I can't justify the cost of it to take home a crowler or growler. We would definitely go back if we were in the area again."

                "description": "We really enjoyed this place which was an accidental find on our way back from one of our activities in Austin. It is a self-serve concept, so basically you are given a card to scan anytime you want to order a wine, beer, or a cocktail from one of their many taps. You also place your food order at the counter and they bring it out to you.   The fried avocado tacos were amazing and my significant other really enjoyed whatever tacos he had, which I believe were the Carnitas. Why four stars then? Two reasons. One is I was really confused on how much I should tip. I usually don't struggle with this being a bartender, but since we had to pour our own drinks and order food at the counter , I wasn't comfortable leaving a full 20%. Second, when you are pouring your beer, the price adds up very quick. There was one point my boyfriend poured a pint glass and the beer ended up being $22. That was a bit of a letdown. Otherwise the staff is VERY friendly and welcoming -they run a very tight ship. The bathrooms were exceptionally clean and the layout with a big outdoor patio is a bonus. Highly recommend, just watch the higher ABV beers because they add up fast!"

                "description": "The uniqueness of this place really sets it apart. You are given a card to pour any of the beers on top yourself, which I had seen before and always love. What I hadn't seen was also you can pour wine or cocktails! This experience is perfect for all of those people crawling out of quarantine and not knowing what to do when they cant pour their own drinks. But now you can! And despite the setup involving many hands, Oz. keeps the place sparkling clean.  I can't speak much to the food menu. It's mostly a meat-forward fare. They have a vegan burger patty, but I was told neither of the buns are vegan. Since the patty was really soft, I am not sure it would work as a lettuce wrap. It seems weird to have a vegan patty when you can't have a full vegan burger, but at least there is a vegetarian option.  My mom liked her fish and chips.   I am really just here for the taps though!"

We tried a few of the beers and had some Tex-Mex.   I tried the sangria beer. I believe it was number 32 on the panel. If you like sangria and bubbles go for it, It's like sangria with bubbles (GF)  Husband had a few other kinds of beers which I tried and oh Man, It was very good! Nothing like I ever had before.   I also had the house tacos (3) with chicken, steak and fried avocado. The fried avocado was definitely a hit for me. It was full of flavor, creamy and crunchy at the same time.   If you are visiting Austin like us and want to drive away from the city you won't regret going to Oz Tap House.   Also, one of the owners is supper friendly we had the pleasure to speak with Sean briefly. Staff is also very nice, patiently explained to us how tap works.   Thanks Oz Tap House for such a memorable welcome!   I recommend this place to everyone!!"

                "description": "I just ordered lunch from Oz tap house. We got fish and chips, fried pickles,  a baked pretzel, a Caesar salad and a cheesesteak.   The pro's: The ranch dressing that came with the fried pickles was pretty good, As was the coleslaw.   The cons:  The fish and chips portion was small and soggy. It was two pieces of greasy fish, that iterally had no flavor. Fish and Chips is one of my favorite foods and I've had it all over the world. Never had I gotten it without flavor. How do you make something taste like nothing? Granted. I asked that the fish and chips have no hot pepper on it. Unfortunately, Hot pepper is the only spice Oz uses.  The fries were cold inside - clearly not hand-cut. The Caesar salad, was spicy in a weird way. It was not good.  The Philly Cheesesteak was very very spicy and greasy.  The Baked Pretzel - Auntie Ann's does a better job, this was a VERY basic, previously frozen pretzel. Nothing special and not worth the price.  The fried pickles - under seasoned and instead of crisp, they were chewy. Again not good.    Everything was extremely spicy, from the fish and chips to the Caesar salad. Food items that traditionally aren't spicy, were all grossly over spiced with hot peppers. Oz Tap House needs to learn how to use spices without making things spicy. Go back to cooking school - Spiced and Spicy! There is a difference! One more thing,  Read dietary notes. There's a reason why people write them."

We were greeted when we walked in,had the process explained etc.  Beers, a couple of ciders,and wines on tap. Pretty cool. I did semi accidentally pour myself 9 oz of wine, so it was a $12 glass, not what I'd typically spend on a glass of wine, but I also typically wouldn't be served 9 oz.  Our food came out quickly and it was really good!  I don't know much it was (folks mentioned auomatic gratuity) bc my husband paid, but it was great and we will definitely come back. They had a playground in the back that we saw,which would be great to come to with our lil people."

Tap House for the first time after a Vandegrift H.S. football game, recommended to us by a family member.  \"Go to Oz (pronounced Oz, like wizard of Oz) Tap House, is great.  First things first, we realized later it's not Oz it's Oz.  Notice the period after the z.  Oz. = ounce!  Makes perfect sense when you see the concept.  Dozens of self-serve taps, pouring cocktails, beer, wine, etc.  Way cool!  We couldn't tell how much vodka was actually in the Cosmos we had, but they were tasty!  The Community brand ice tea off the charts too.  Any place serving Community products knows their stuff ... oh yeah, the food.  Definitely \"gotta go back for more\" fare.  Fried cauliflower and jalapeños, nice ranch sauce.  Our server, unprompted, brought some buffalo wing sauce, \"dip a little in here, then the ranch.\"  Awesomeness!  House tacos and cod tacos were delicious, depths of sublime flavors layered into top shelf flour tortillas.  Our only observation was using the house taco slaw on the cod tacos may be a better pairing than the sautéed cabbage... at any rate, the tacos were outstanding.  We'll definitely be back, lots more on the menu to explore.  And a special shout out to James working the register.  Explained the concept, led us through the process, and answered quite a few \"newbie\" questions.  He was great, no need to hire more employees, clone James!"

They are also dog friendly outside as long as they're leashed. I had a half order of carnitas nachos which was pretty good sized. Some of the chips were a little stale so that was my only nagative feedback. We also tried a house burger with fries which was solid. Overall they have good food and the patio is nice. Try it out!"

The onion rings were just okay. The breading wasn't very flavorful and kept falling off and the onions were not crispy. We also got the house tacos and the beef was good, and the fried avocado was amazing! Really liked the sauce they used!"

The card drinking system is fun and the drink selection is outstanding.    Taking 2 stars off because the food is sub par.  We've been here a few times and yet to have anything that impresses.  Tacos are dry, nachos inedible, and the chicken sandwich was such a disappointment."

What really stuck out to us last night was customer service - from the front order person to the in-house table bussers, and the \"tap Bosses\" or so to speak.  They pay attention to what's going on. They make you feel like you are the most important person that has come in all day... and it was great to see lots of customers supporting this small business.  Plus, of course, there are MANY drink choices to sample and enjoy!!"

I had no idea the owner himself took my drink order, I had a berry stubborn vodka. They were expert in explaining all the options. For dinner, I had the Oz. House Burger and fries, it was very good. Would recommend."

                "description": "Exceptional Service. Thats the thing that really stood out to me here. The staff was friendly, attentive and made sure my party had a good experience. This a smaller establishment thats easy to miss but you should definitely pay attention and stop by if you're in the area. The decor and coziness makes you feel like you're in a classic pub. I had the port of havana to drink and it was delicious. Lighter on the alcohol(as intended) but it still tasted like a real drink and had an assortment of flavors that I haven't had before but I loved them. For food I tried the burger which was really solid. Cooked well, tasted fresh and the flavor from the caramelized onions made sure it was far from bland. Overall I really enjoyed this place and think its perfect to grab a drink or quick bite after work."

                "description": "I'm embarrassed that I brought friends to one of our favorite places and that we were met with not so great service. The food was stellar however.  We wanted to sit outside and have table service and were told by the tall male host-  no, sorry - those are reservation only and our reservations are full today. So we opted for a table in the parking lot and ran to the bar to order. It was cold and we were the only ones out there - no offer to turn on a heater.  We sat outside from 5:30-9 and zero ZERO people showed up for all their \"reservations\".   I get that you may have to plan staffing around your booked reservations or maybe you didn't have someone to wait on tables but just be upfront about it.   I'm hoping this is an anomaly because usually the team is stellar there."

                "description": "We ate here for Valentine's Day2022. After being seated and our initial order taken, our server didn't return for 50 minutes. I asked the person that delivered our dinner if I could place a drink order with them, to which they replied \"I'll get your server\". The server never came. When our server finally checked in and we communicated we hadn't received any service for a very long time, the reply was \"do you want to order dessert\".  We ate our main course with nothing to drink.  This is my girlfriends favorite restaurant, and she was very upset that my experience was so terrible.  I called the next day to discuss with a manager. None were available, so I left my name and number. I never received a call back, so at least they are consistent. This may be a labor shortage issue, to which a little communication would have gone a long way."

                "description": "We went back here on Monday night for the first time since 2017 and had a better experience than our last visit--but not by much. (Oh, heyyyyy Jennie BTW....)  The space is still as cute as we remember it and the cocktails are great. We split the scotch egg, salade Rachel, and the moules frites. The scotch egg was a unique take and while one of us enjoyed it, the other one said it wasn't sitting well afterwards. The salad was phenomenal but it was too heavily dressed--loved the poached celery though. The artichoke seemed fresh too. Moules frites: flavor of the sauce was wonderful but the whole dish was kinda odd. Like, is the intention to have all the fries at the bottom of the bowl get soggy with the sauce?? Why not just include one slice of something toasted to sop that up? The garlic sauce on top was delish and the mussels themselves were great. Also literally EVERYTHING needed more salt. (Our friend wanted us to include that her mushroom-leek tart hardly had any leek in it :) Dessert was chocolate mousse and creme brûlée: nothing special but both were well-executed.  Service was mostly efficient but definitely snooty. He didn't check up with us about the food until we were almost half way done and there were several missed opportunities for asking us about another round of drinks. Clearing was also haphazard and sloppy.   So, overall, a sliiiightly better experience than last time. The food was pretty good, though, and we were happy to be in a cute little space with our friends, so we're willing to round up to four stars. We think you just need to come in here with the right mindset by not expecting them to excel at anything and for you to pay more than you should. But it's better than most of the restaurant crap out there in Austin--we will say that."

                "description": "Make reservations for dinner. Midday, you usually do not need a reservation, unless you are visiting during a holiday/peak busy time.   Indoor and outdoor seating available. Super casual outdoor setup--plain, wooden, picnic tables and benches, under umbrellas, which do nothing to shield you in hoooot weather. Better sit inside, and enjoy the classy, French province style ambiance. Really enjoyed both times I visited this place and dined indoors. Great for a date, a family gathering, or a casual friends get together.  For lunch, you order and pay at the bar, and then wait for your food and take it to a table of your choice. For dinner, a waiter serves you, providing a complete dinning experience. Staff are friendly and accommodating.  Loooved the pascal burger $16. It hit the spot the first time I tried it. When warm, the soft Camembert cheese melts into the cornichons, caramelized onions, and grain mustard, creating a perfect medley with the juicy patty. The meat was flavorful and well-seasoned, bursting with flavor. Definitely, one of the best burgers I've ever tried. Try this. Eat it while it's hot. When it cools down, it looses its ooomph. When I ordered this during my second visit, I waited until it was cool, and I did not get the same kick out of it.  Fries were perfect--well seasoned, crispy, and delicious.   Duck confit with polenta $27 was a small portion, but every element was executed perfectly. The duck was delicate and bursting with flavor, thanks to the bright, citrusy orange sauce. Polenta was crunchy and fun to eat, fried in a form of thick sticks.  Would return anytime I'm back in Austin!"

I got the scotch egg and escargot dumplings. Its after all just an egg and a few dumplings. They were super filling! A super delicious mistake on my part. Then of course we had to get the dessert creme brulee was okay. The star of dessert was the bread pudding. I cannot wait to come back and try everything else on the menu."

                "description": "First visit, so my assessment change over time. My initial sense is that while the food is good, the service needs some work.   No complaints about the food, which was quite good, such as the Heirloom Tomato Tarte and the Salade Niçoise.  The ratatouille could've used a bit more bread, and I thought the toffee flavor of the mango gelato-bread pudding dessert we got to be overpowering.  Drinks were varied and interesting, with French component takes on standard cocktails (e.g. \"The Vielle Fashioned\") that worked for some (their variation of the French 75) and  less so for others (I believe the Frontera Sidecar).  What definitely fell short was the service. I don't need overly attentive service, but it's not reasonable to be out of water for half an hour, unsuccessfully trying to flag down a waiter time after time.  This is particularly a problem given the small size of their water glasses and the lack of a water bottle for the table. Fixing this relatively small problem would be huge."

Everyone I was with really enjoyed what we got -- we tried the French toast with berry jam and toasted coconut, croissant breakfast sandwich, avocado tartine with a fried egg, eggs benedict, and grapefruit mimosas. Great service, chill ambience (especially for brunch at 11am on a Saturday!)--just great all around.

                "description": "We had our first visit to Hopfields tonight and I definitely think we'll be back. Its one of the most interesting places we've been in a long time. This restaurant had low key MeowWolf vibes. Every room a little different and the menu was full of surprises. Don't come here expecting a classic version of what you see on the menu!  We had the escargot dumplings, ratatouille, and moules- all presented quite differently than what we imagined. The food is good, not great, but very fun to experience. I wished we could have tried a few more things just to see what they would bring. Dress for the possibility that you might spill red sauce on yourself, because you will. Overall, it was a great little night out and definitely something new and different. If you're expecting traditional French food, you will probably be disappointed. If you're open to surprises, I think you'll enjoy it here."

                "description": "February should be the peak of PEI mussel season.  We came for the mussels.  Unfortunately I don't think the cook particularly likes them.  I had the overwhelming feeling that the cook never tasted the dish as it cooked. There was no sauce, the mussels appeared to be steamed okay and then a ton of chili powder or paprika was dumped on them and that was how they were served.   The powder made for kind of a paste because there was no, or very little, other liquid such as wine or vinegar or tomatoes or much of anything else.  I love to scoop up a tasty broth in the mussel shells and sip it while gulping the seafood,  but this was very dry.  The dryness and high chili content made it very hard to taste the mussels. The fries on top soaked up what little moisture that had been present.    The french onion soup, however,  was excellent."

If you're outside you have to get your food and drinks by going back inside by the bar to put your order. To our surprise, the cocktails didn't have actual liquor which was strange. The boards they brought out after a good hour after ordering along with the fries were a bit lackluster.

Hopfields was #5! #5 guys and not to be snooty but I didn't even look at anything past P Terry's which was around #15! Hehehe P Terry's is good (it's a local chain, made to order) but it's a drive thru and I was looking for more of an \"elevated\" experience tonight! No shade to my P Terry lovers!! So the Paschal Burger is $16 Medium rare, and slathered in ooey gooey camembert cheese and mustard! I enjoyed it! I regularly lean toward a sweet burger with carmelized onion (which were included), BBQ sauce, bacon jam and other ingredients like these. This burger is just savory not too bold and a textural delight! See the video for the \"unboxing\"! I would give it a solid 7/10."

Their burger, covered in camembert or brie, carmelized onions and whole grain mustard is so delicious!! Pair it with crispy Pomme frites and homemade aioli...it's a mic drop moment. The staff is kind and helpful, their craft beer choices and a small but wonderful wine list just rounded out the afternoon. All they have left to do is claim their yelp listing! LOL  But seriously, if you are a foodie, this should definitely be on your list of places to frequent. I'm sure they have many other amazing things to eat there, but their burger is so good that we've never ordered anything else!"

                "description": "It has a very classy vibe to it, the choices for food and drink reflect it. I wish they had more variety in their menu, with cheaper options. I suppose you pay extra for the upscale vibe of the place.  This is not saying that the food is bad, in fact it is very good. The wine and beer options are the best in the area, now that Vino Vino is closed. The great thing is that you can go there for drinks, without ordering food, and have a great time sitting indoors or outside. The staff are very professional, welcoming, and they use their knowledge about the different wines to make suggestions."

                "description": "Came for dinner, without reservations, on  Friday. It was pretty empty and easy to get a table, so we sat in the middle room of the place, which was somewhat of a makeshift library/lounge with old foreign decor.  We got olives and almonds to start, with escargot, which came with small lettuce leaves and was in a red sauce (not your typical garlic butter). It was really good, different and interesting to try it in a different preparation. For the main, we split the steak and frites. It was probably the smallest portion of steak I've ever seen and if I had eaten it myself I probably still would have been hungry. But, it was really nicely cooked and seasoned, as well as the fries. So despite the size it was super good.  Don't know if I'd come again, also because they only had some special cocktails and not a full bar, but it was interesting to try the place."

                "description": "If you haven't been to The Brewtique in Cedar Park, you definitely should check it out.   Anytime you stop by, you'll meet either the owner or his wife and they are both nice and very helpful. You can pretty much buy anything they have in singles and they always have their inventory listed online along with the untapped rating for each beer, which I find very useful. They have a solid selection of local stuff and occasionally some more rare stuff as well. If you're immunocompromised, you can call your order in and they'll bring it to your car; they also have a very sanitary setup inside and require masks (of course) and make everyone use the hand sanitizer when you come in. We've been there about 5 times mixing that in with buying direct from breweries but I really love the diversity you can get while supporting local at the Brewtique"

                "description": "Great place to try out a new beer then buy a six-pack or two. We had a couple beers each (they sell singles if you are hanging out) and then bought some to take home. Taco Truck pilsner was great, Mama Pisner, and there was a pickle beer that was probably a tad too pickley for me (go figure).  Great/fun selection, good prices, knowledgeable staff, and lots of picnic tables out to keep you spread out and safe. You can get snacks too, or play Starship Troopers pinball (Do You Want To Know More?!?). We had  a good time just chilling there on a Sunday afternoon.  Oh, and they recycle those plastic can holders that craft breweries use. Bring yours back to help out the brewers in town!"

If you're more beer curious, head over and chat with these friendly folks. They know their stuff and helped me to pick out some new beers.  There's a good range of price points here too so you could find a good gift here.

Folks here are friendly and of course knowledgable and provide a high level of customer service.

This place is totally chill with a few picnic tables to relax and converse with friends. There is also a couple of other chairs if that's your thing. Sampling on sight is totally cool too.  On to the selection of beers. All I can say is,if you can't find something here that you would like, go home,empty handed and admit you have no taste. That's right, I threw the blame squarely on you! Why? Because they must have better than 300-400 different beers to choose from!  Now go, prove me wrong and try that chocolate oatmeal stout or triple ipa !!"

The team is incredibly helpful, very knowledgeable about their products, and all around just a couple of really cool folks.  Just tell them what you're in the mood for, and you'll absolutely receive a satisfying recommendation.  They're dog-friendly both in and outside, and are super welcoming to well-behaved pooches. They also do some really cool charity events on behalf of some great organizations. There's almost always something going on in the evenings -- live music, comedy shows, football games, game night, beer tastings.  They also have some neat retro arcade games and board games on hand to entertain.  There's always a reason to pop in and have a drinks!"

Owner(s?) seem to care a bunch, and have been available to point out new releases/limited beers, make recommendations, and take pics of my dog.   Prices slightly higher than other big retailers, but selection is much better (tip: check their Instagram for limited beers and new stock). Also, a good selection of CBD products for those interested. I have never hung around to drink there, but you can for a small per-beer charge if you want.   Hope this place keeps getting tasty limited beverages and doesn't turn into a vape emporium like the last one!"

They have an expansive patio area with seating to get some fresh air, but it's also enclosed so you're protected from the elements. There's also an indoor seating area, which is where we sat since it was a bit chilly out.   They make ordering easy by providing a QR code at your table where you can input your order through your phone, or you can walk up to the bar and order. They have an array of brews on tap and a few ciders too.   They mainly have apps, sandwiches, and salads. We ordered the Buffalo chicken dip - yum! It came with colored carrots, celery, and bread for dipping. We followed this with the pulled pork sandwich and the pimento and bacon jam sandwiches. Everything was good. The pimento and bacon jam sandwiches were quite rich and could easily be shared. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this place!"

                "description": "ELECTRIC JELLYFISH - okay, if you need me to say more than that, keep reading.  The newest rendition of Penthouse Brewing is NOT a pizza restaurant (honestly didn't realize that until I looked at the menu). Their newest location focuses on showcasing their brewing. The ambiance is really modern and trendy with TONS of space to feel like you can breathe (especially during these COVID times). The beer is wonderful, as always, and if you need a recommendation, refer to my first two words of this review.  Food order: - Texas Pretzel with cold whipped beer cheese - HUGE pretzel, so delicious! Admittedly, I could've lived without the beer cheese as it did not add enough flavor to really warrant the additional cost. - Whipped Burrata - Burrata is my second favorite cheese (to queso of course) so I HAD to order this. Basically it was a deconstructed caprese salad and I am all about it!  - Pulled Porker - To be honest, you could probably get better pulled pork at the 100+ BBQ restaurants Austin has to offer but it was very tasty and hit the spot!  If you are a newbie to the Pinthouse family or a regular, check out their new location - it will not disappoint!"

The atmosphere was so light and open, TVs mounted for entertainment, swinging chairs and a whole upstairs and of course, a brewery behind the bar.  I came here with a big group for a friend's birthday, the staff were incredible and they accommodated us all without hesitation.   I'm looking forward to the next visit!"

We tried the pickled shrimp and they were good. I had the seasonal Blood Orange Cider and it was good. The staff are amazing!! Kiki, Cotton and Kelsey were very nice. They made great recommendations on food places since we are foodies, helped me pick a stout (Autobahn is the stout) I actually like and only allowed me to get it in a smaller glass and most of all they have great personalities!! Check them out you won't be disappointed!"

Now I'm no fan of pizza so the food at their other establishment was always kinda meh for me. I saw the menu here and at first was like who wants \"sandwiches and hummus with beer\".. boy was I wrong... I loved the boiled peanuts, the humus plate and the pimento cheese sandwich. All the food I was served at Pinthouse was fresh and tasty and I'll certainly go back for more.   Their IPA's are top notch as they always have been. They have a crowler for to go and do growler refills.   Go here. Have fun."

                "description": "We don't live too far from this place and we were looking for a new spot to take our guests from out of town to but it ended up just being us two. We weren't leaving until we tried some beer and food and we like the ambiance of the place. A person comes to greet you once you walk in and pretty much give you the low down of the place and how its runs. Service is friendly, helpful, and done exceptionally. They are doggie friendly too.   You only need to wear a mask when you go into the inner part of the place. It has a lot of space and a lounge area with a swinging seat, so it has that cool laid back type of vibe. You can scan the code on the napkin dispensers for the menus. I ordered the DEADLUS CHARM (Belgian Blonde) and hubby got the OF SOUND MIND (Fruit and Sour). For food, I got the chicken and Brie sandwich and hubby got the chicken sausage sandwich. They were both tasty and the food was delicious and fresh. We recommend, we will return, and make this spot one of our go-to for our hangouts."

                "description": "I went to Pinthouse with some friends for a Sunday afternoon lunch and had a great time! We got there in time for brunch, it ends at 3pm, so I decided to get their Rodeo Bagel and a potato cake. Unfortunately, they were out of actual bagels so they gave me a bun instead but it was still quite good. The potato cake, however, was absolutely amazing. It was perfectly crispy and topped with flaky salt, I think I could've eaten five of them alone and been happy. My main complaint about the setup is the fact that a big portion of the tables will get wet. We went during a huge storm and barely got a table because everything was either taken or wet. There was also supposed to be live music but they couldn't play because the stage was wet.   COVID Precautions: Masks are encouraged but not required. All employees were wearing masks though!"

We had pre-ordered a bunch of food while everyone got their own beverages. The food was great and so was the service. I believe Stephanie was our waitress?   Ordering drinks was a little slow-they only had two people working the taps. We are on summer break so who cares?!? We had time to wait!  It is a great space: open-clean-and inviting. It has very tall ceilings which makes the space seem much bigger.   A few friends said they would come here back in the day when it was Midnight Rodeo. We heard a few fun stories.   I heard multiple people comment that they will come back- even a few that lived on the other side of town. I know I'll be back."

                "description": "We decided to try Pint House Brewing after receiving coupons in the mail. One was for a free salad or sandwich and one was for $10 off. We weren't sure where the location was, but following directions, we were able to find it just east of Woodward at Ben White on the southside access road. They really need better signage because the entrance is on the south side of a large warehouse-looking building.  But it is definitely worth finding! We were greeted at the outside patio which is wonderfully shaded and well set up for live music in the evenings. We were shown to a table and told to remember our table number before we went to order at the bar. All the staff were appropriately masked and social distancing seating was enforced.  To take maximum advantage of our coupons (because we will be leaving Austin in two weeks) we ordered separately. I ordered the Italian sandwich with a side salad and an iced tea.  My husband ordered a chicken Caesar salad, an iced tea, and a blackberry cider. The drinks were all self-serve which made keeping our glasses refilled easy.  Our food came out very quickly, as we were some of the first people seated. And it looked amazing when we got it! See photos. My sandwich was huge! The bread was perfect; soft inside and thick and crusty outside. The fillings were amazing with several kinds of meat and cheese and vegetables with a dressing. The flavor was outstanding and I made my husband try it because I knew he would like it too. My side salad was also terrific. The dressing was an olive oil vinaigrette that was just perfect and the homemade croutons made it that much more delicious.  My husband's blackberry cider was so good that he had me try it, and it was delicious! It was slightly sweet and full of flavor. His Caesar salad was huge! It had the same homemade croutons and an incredible garlic Caesar dressing that even I, a non-fish eater, liked.   Try this place! They appear to be owned by the same company as the Pinthouse Pizza locations in Austin, but they are focusing on their brewery, sandwiches and salads, and they are all delicious!"

                "description": "Had been wanting to check this place out and wow, what a beautiful interior, does not give off \"brewery vibes\" at all.   For a brewery it is very modern with it's decor. Love the seating and the chandeliers and all of that when you first walk in, way to go whoever the interior decorator was!   That being said, let's move on to the real reason you're reading this.....you wanna know about the beer!   Well I decided to try their flight, which came with 5 different beers of your choice.   The most popular beer is the electric jellyfish, which is what I ended up settling on after my flights as well. They had also just released some new beers the day I went, and so I tried the \"dude blueberry\" which surprisingly as someone who isn't a fan of heavier beers, I actually enjoyed it. Don't know if I would've handled a full glass of it, but definitely enjoyed the trial version.   All in all, a great place to gather with friends, super chill and low key with a nice vibe."

Finding out after we finally get a table that they intact do not serve pizza was a huge let down. Why did they decided to invest in a massive location like this but not offer pizza!? Pizza + Beer is the tag line and the entire foundation of the brand. To have one location ( the largest and newest one) not offer half of what the existing customer base has come to love and expect is a massive miss step for the brand. Good thing Meanwhile Brewing Co. and Independence is right next door."

However, since trying Batch, I can declare that I LOVE kolaches. At Batch, the bread is so incredibly soft and fluffy. The jalapeno cheese and sausage is my favorite, with the pepperoni coming in as a close second. The sweet kolaches are also delicious and taste just like a donut! I always get a chai latte as well -- and it's so good, not too sweet!   The space is perfect to work out of -- it's relatively quiet, has ample seating and outlets. There's even an outdoor area with tons of picnic benches. The entire staff is super friendly and welcoming."

                "description": "Cute spot that a friend in town had recommended I try for both the beer and kolaches. Lots of space inside, a decent amount of taps (maybe 8ish...for a smaller operation), has available beer to go (although sadly not the one on tap that I reeeeeally wanted lol), and an assortment kolaches - both sweet and savory.    The staff is super nice and laid back, and helpful on picking menu items/drafts when seeking recommendations. But, for at least my first beer, there was no recommendation needed. Earthly Pastry was a no-brainer. A peanut butter with vanilla (and milk sugar). As a PB stout fiend, this...was freaking delicious. If I didn't wander by around like 2pm, I would have definitely had another. I was a little upset they didn't have any canned to-go, but c'est la vie (and the staff/email support were super prompt after the server suggested I email someone to see if/when they might be canning).    Beer aside (and it's delicious), while I didn't have the kolaches, they looked delicious - though, the varieties that they happened to have out didn't really speak to me, likely because I just came from brunch at Nixta...and basically eating and drinking my way through Austin...food guilt prevailed. BUT, next time...definitely.  They also have a full-blown coffee bar and people come on by to came out like a Starbucks, with free wifi n all - and I'll admit, I did find a seat next to an outlet for some charge time. It's just...a very chill, cool place tailoring to a spectrum of clientele. Good stuff!"

Which is really weird when it comes to people bringing things for breakfast. That means no breakfast tacos and it definitely means no kolaches - just donuts all the time haha  So of course the first thing I did was go to Shipleys but it didn't hit the spot? My husband found this place just driving by and got these. YUM. First of all they're huge. I loved the jalapeño cheese (pictured) I basically ate it in 30 seconds and which he'd gotten me two!

HOWEVER, if you are going to go so slow that people have to wait 30 minutes in line for a pastry, coffee etc then the least y'all could do is provide adequate and accessible WiFi. Absolutely terrible. Didn't work and compete waste of a trip here."

I recently tried the iced chai for the first time and was really impressed!  The back patio is well kept and now has even more spaced out tables for relaxing. Also a nice option for a quick grab and go."

                "description": "Was visiting a friend who brought me here for brunch! Plenty of distanced outdoor seating. Simple but sufficient menu consisting of sweet and savory kolaches, coffee, beer, and more. Ordering was simple, and food and drinks came out quick and fresh. I got the pepperoni kolache, veggie sausage and cheese kolache, and Alishan beer. Both kolaches were fantastic, but I had a slight preference for the veggie one! (It's a vegetarian sausage, not veggies + sausage.) I'd recommend getting 2 kolaches if you're not too hungry and 3 if you are. The beer was light, and I believe it was infused with tea and honey. And they filled it to the brim! Definitely worth the $5. In total, my meal came out to $13-14 before tip. Would definitely come again. Great atmosphere."

The FT doesn't open until 3, at least on weekends, so we had to wait a little while once getting there. With their new covid- outdoor only ordering for beer it's hard to order anything else but their own brewed beer because the other cans they have are in a window display 6ft away. But, their beer is good, like this new carrot cake beer is pretty unique!  For their sausages, the price/quality is pretty good at around $6.50 each. The only bummer was the bun, it was too thick, dense and the sausage and toppings just sat on top. It was a little difficult to eat, but the flavors were great."

Both bartenders were such a joy; not only to myself but everyone. They spent the necessary time greeting everyone and helping to figure out how to get to a table asap. Even among small conversations between tables, the bartenders were on top of their serving game.   I have had the waterloo and center cut pork chop. I'm not usually a pork kinda person but the peach chutney was SO good. It was the perfect amount of food and tasted so yummy.   I will definitely go back when I am in Austin. This is the type of place to visit with friends and family for a great evening of sharing small plates, good drinks, and lots of laughs. Or it's old-timey beauty makes it a wonderful date night place. Or grab a cocktail and sit on the front porch people watching... the diversity of the restaurant is really for any occasion.   I can't wait to visit for a weekend brunch!   Thanks so much for the food, drinks, and amazing service!"

                "description": "#2 most reviewed spot in Austin and it did not disappoint. Southern food usually means being unhealthy and my ever failing diet goes further down the rabbit hole. No regrets what-so-ever.  We got here around 7PM where we had a 5 minute wait before a table opened up for the two of us. I got to see how massive this restaurant was as we were lead to a heated tent, which was set up adjacent to the building. The table comes with free popcorn, but we had to ask the server about it as they were never pre-served before we arrived. NBD.  I started off with a Good Hearted Old Fashion ($13). First thing I noticed was that the glass was only half full, but it's supposed to be like this due to the nature of the drink. Tastes great and it's the popular drink ordered. Just sip slowly.  For appetizers, we split the Fried Green Tomatoes ($12) with smoked shrimp, tomatillo aioli, and pimento. Pretty much a way to saying you weren't all that unhealthy, when in reality it's also battered and fried. The smoked shrimp makes it worth ordering from a price perspective and they happen to taste great together.We also ordered The Original Moonshine Corn Dog Shrimp ($12), fancy enough to their own trademark on it. Came with a honey mustard dipping sauce. Tastes pretty good, but it wasn't unique as I've had similar items like this, just not served on a stick.  For the entree to split, we got the Chicken Fried Steak ($18), essentially a giant batter fried chicken with chipotle cream gravy and yukon mashers. This alone between the two of us along with the appetizers was enough to fill us up generously. Tasted amazing and an excellent option if you're not feeling the pork or beef, essentially tired of consuming BBQ all week.  Overall, great food, great service, and a great experience. Would recommend making a stop here if you're making a stop in Austin."

                "description": "EXPECT TO WAIT!! If you are trying to find convenient parking, they offer valet. Went up to the hostess stand and for a table of two, got quoted at least 90 minutes. That was a true 90 minutes. We were lucky enough to get a seat at the bar after 20 minutes but people who checked in around us were not so lucky. Even after people turned in their pagers and left, the wait was still true. While you wait you can order drinks and appetizers at the bar. The bartenders were friendly, helpful and attentive. We ordered Brussel Sprouts, Chicken Fried Steak, Chicken and Waffles and Banana Pudding. My favorite part was the Brussel Sprouts. They were simple, slightly sweet and cooked nicely. The chicken and waffles were good. It seemed like there is cornmeal in the waffle. I enjoyed this as I thought the similar taste to corn bread really preserves the savory part of this dish. The chicken fried steak was just alright. Expected more after hearing it was the 3rd best in the state. The pudding was great. Great flavor but if you like an abundance of wafers it might not be for you. Overall, this place is great if you do not mind the wait. I do not think I would wait that long for it again."

Unfortunately, some of the finer details are now lost in memory, but Moonshine Patio Bar and Grill was our last meal in Austin, Texas. It was for a Sunday brunch (8/15/2021).  Conveniently located in Downtown, we were actually able to walk here from the hotel. At over 5.1k reviews, this would definitely appear to be one of the most popular restaurants in the city. That said, I was pretty interested to see what it was all about.  To eat, I ordered the steak and eggs. It took a little while to get our food, but service was friendly. The place was packed, as expected. Overall, I thought the food was good. The atmosphere is what really stood out to me though. While I wasn't super impressed by the food, I would not be opposed to returning."

The food was very good, but not amazing. I think it's a fair price point for being downtown and being a more talked about Austin restaurant. My pork chop dish was ($22), looked good but tasted like nothing special. I would come back to try the brunch, but I'm not rushing back for anything other than the drinks and outside atmosphere.   It took a long time to get our food even though there was only 2 other small tables of customers outside and a few inside. Our waitstaff was very attentive and had great recommendations for drinks after talking to her a bit. They have vast options for drinks and drink deals on certain nights which is why we stopped by.  Street parking is a hassle here, especially on the weekends, but luckily it's close to a lot of places downtown and makes for an easy walk."

This place and environment overall is awesome. The staff here was  is really great! Plenty of seating, but I can see how this place would have wait when it's busy.   The place has a outdoor heated seating. It was very warm and toasty comfortable. The sliding door of the patio, you could feel like the Hulk when you're trying to open it.  All the beers we had were in a can, and we came just at the right time for happy hour. As other Yelpers stated I was truly amazed with the prices and portions of the food. I had the pork chop and man that chop was so delicious!! Another buddy of mine had the same thing. Another one had the turkey club sandwich and that thing was huge!  We also ordered some pretzel sticks and those were the perfect appetizers. You also get a bucket of free popcorn.  One thing about coming here it's easy to find; however, parking may be a bit of challenge when busy. We lucked out during our visit here and were able to park right on the front of the building.  I definitely want to come back and try some other items on the menu. Great food, drinks, and the prices are right here!"

                "description": "We came to Austin and Moonshine was the first lunch place we hit up, based on a friend's recommendation.  I wasn't super hungry, so decided to try the cornflake battered chicken salad. The chicken was excellent. Crunchy on the outside and very moist inside. The salad came with 3 large pieces. But my problem was that I dumped the dressing throughout the salad so was therefore stuck with it. And I thought it was a not great honey mustard dressing. I am usually not at all picky, but the dressing was too thickly and too mustardy. If half stars were an option, I'd give my salad a 3.5.  My husband ordered the chicken steaks smothered in a white gravy, and really liked it. Before our entrees came, we were brought a large basket of popcorn. That was a nice touch."

The pimento was very flavorful and the pretzel sticks were baked to PERFECTION.  For my entree I had one of their fried chicken sandwiches. The chicken patty was very thin compared to most fried chicken sandwiches I've had, but the flavor was still there in every bite. The accompanying fries were yummy as well!  NOTE: on Mondays they have 50% off wine bottles. Just in case that's useful for you ;)"

                "description": "New Year's Day, came for lunch. We waited for about 30 minutes, but they have a bar in the back while you wait. It was walking distance from our hotel on Third Street.  We got seated at the patio outside for a party of 5, and they adjusted the shade for us since the sun was in our face.   The service was okay, the food was pretty good. The size of that chicken friend steak was definitely Texas size! The cocktails were delicious. We even got a flight of moonshines, but that was a bit hard to drink. It was way to sweet for me personally.   Overall: Cleanliness: 8/10 Food: 8/10 Service: 7/10"

                "description": "Visiting Austin and decided to check this place out for some wonderful Southern food. Everything we ordered for brunch was extremely tasty and flavorful.   If you're looking for something on the lighter side, go for the Migas. Both the Beyond Veggie Burger and Backyard Chicken Sandwich hit the spot as well. They even accommodated my friend's request to switch the bread to a biscuit. The sauce that comes with the Sweet Potato Tater Tots is phenomenal.   They have great heated outdoor seating (tent style), wonderful servers, and generally a great atmosphere!"

                "description": "This restaurant just kind of pulls you in from the street. Being one of the oldest buildings in Austin, this place is obviously well known, and we were lucky to get in.   The atmosphere inside the restaurant just emanates southern charm and the menu offers some excellent southern comfort food entrees. Any time I find an appetizer not normally seen on a menu, I have to try it, and in this case, it was the deviled eggs.   I typically don't have the courage to try anyone else's deviled eggs because I am very picky when it comes to those, so I swore they better be good and they were very good. They were creamy, flavorful and had no pesky surprises like celery or relish.  One thing I never thought I would eat for dinner is chicken and waffles and being in Austin I decided I had to try. I was impressed with the seasoning of the chicken and the light breading. The waffles were fluffy, they came with plenty of butter and syrup. This entree was the epitome of sweet and salty, and a little bit spicy.  The staff are great, the drinks are great, and the atmosphere is alive. Cheers!"

For real, how the fuck we spend the food back the first time, and came back with hair again. Smh.. I'm pissed!!! The manager came and apologize.  She was sincere,  and offered us round of minomas, we declined and left. I'll definitely not come back again.  The only positive is my server Tony was great!!"

                "description": "Decided to take a break from bbq and try something different. After a quick yelp search decided on this place and glad we did. It was an easy walk from our hotel in downtown Austin so that was a plus. They start you off with popcorn which is something different and nice. The popcorn was jazzed up with what I believe to be garlic and paprika and was amazing.  I got the old fashioned and wife got a drink called the fiddler which was whiskey spiced up with jalapeño. Both were really really good.  For an app we got the deviled eggs. Got to say not impressed. They used a lot of mustard and neither me or the wife cared for them.  For a main course we shared the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes. It was absolutely enough for both of us and must say it was delicious. We also shared a side salad.  For desert we shared a banana pudding. Let me tell you order this it's fantastic.  The staff were very friendly and helpful and the ambiance of this place was also super nice and unique.  Definitely recommend and would come back."

Had we gotten there later, I think we'd have had to wait quite a while. Its flooded with customers on the weekend! Curious what it would be like during the week? ‍  Service was wonderful! Our waiter was fun, knowledgeable and attentive! I think that was the case across the staff. They take the service seriously!   The food is decadent! It's heaping portions with a southern flare. I got the green chili hash that was pretty good. My favorite part of the meal was the biscuits we ordered as an appetizer. Delicious!   This is a great spot! My friends and I enjoyed it! The menu is pretty straightforward. You'll walk away full of yummy food."

And greatly mouth watering. I got the jalapeño shutter steak which at first site looks small but will fill you and and have you in an awww that was good. Marissa our server was very attentive and could run us through the whole menu and make sure that we choose what we were craving. They start you off with popcorn at your table for some finger food and homemade cornbread with every meal. My wife also said that there moonshine was very smooth to the taste and went well with the meal. High recommend coming and eating at this reatraunt. Try and make sure you get Marissa she is great server."

                "description": "Beer, friendly bar staff and overall vibe of this place is 5 stars.  Value of food is a heartbreaking 1 star. Burger and fries for $12? Fine if the burger is decent size. We were both surprised when we were served P Terry's size burgers and less than 1/2 the fries. Honestly, nothing wrong with the portion size but it was absolutely not worth $12. The burger is clearly a frozen patty and the bun wasn't even warmed.   Just read through all the reviews and a HUGE props to the staff for enforcing mask wearing when it was required. That's enough reason for me to come back. We'll support this business and drink the great beer. We'll skip the food though."

Food in terms of the \"loaded\" fries leaves a lot to be desired (they're not really \"that\" loaded, so the price for the product is absurd); the pickles tasted good but the fry was quite irregular; the spinach artichoke dip is delicious but the chips cannot lift the dip without you helping them along, either by doubling up or scooping with a utensil.  Beer is alright.  One of the lagers is so-so but the raspberry sour is pretty good."

                "description": "Super excited to have another brewery in the South Congress area to go enjoy some tasty as heck beers and get in your order for some Southside Flying Pizza or other tasty snacks and items on their menu!  This location will forever be in my heart as the first time I ever stepped foot here was when we were in desperate need for some warm food, cold beer, and water.  Beers:  I have been enjoying the melon + grapefruit notes in their Simcoe Pale Ale as well as their summer seasonal ale Vaquero Ranchers lager that is just easy and smooth to drink down on a summer day.  Unsure what to get - check out their crowlers to-go and canned beers! I grabbed a sixer to take home with me the last time we were here just so I can try the variety of other options they have here.  OH! Also I noticed they have a frozen drink machine too!  check it out for me, eh?!  Food:  We came here on a weekend and there was a crawfish broil happening to our surprise!  Easy to order online, at your table, and/or at the counter. I really love the option to order directly from your table and be able to pay without having to get up and go to the counter especially if you are nailing that ping pong game against your friends!  We really enjoy ordering and eating pizza here as Southside Flying Pizza nails it every time and there is enough to enjoy with everyone.   Outside / Inside:  all COVID safety measures are practiced here and taken seriously both inside and outside.  There is PLENTY of seating outside and ample amount of space to move around without it feeling crowded at all.  Snovid: When we experienced about 5 days without water we noticed that Last Stand Brewing were offering water fill ups. We grabbed our containers and made the quick drive down South Congress to get our fill.  I am SUPER appreciative of the kindness, ease, and availability to be able to get some water for our needs during the snowpocalypse that all of Texas experienced.  I will forever be in debt to Last Stand as the showed their genuine willingness to help their community out in a time of extreme need.  THANK YOU, Last Stand! You are truly a life saver.  I appreciate your kindness and help always!"

We were stopped when walking in the door by a rude ass employee (dark curly hair with glasses) literally yelling at us about a mask from across the room full of people. We are fully aware some spots still require masks and as we tried to ask if we can sit outdoors she rudely interrupted us and continued to tell us she won't serve us unless we have a mask. Shit lady haven't you ever heard of customer service or even normal communication. She could have approached us and explained their policy it was not necessary to demean us for making a mistake.      We walked outside my sister was livid and embarrassed. I talked her into staying and me walking in with my mask since she has forgot hers and her sitting outside on the bench area. I saw the employee again and asked if we could sit outside at a table which was our original plan (if she listened and didn't scold us like children) she said I can order since I have a mask but my sister can't leave the table with a complete attitude. I ordered got the beers, drank them and we left.      The beers are good but not worth the rude inappropriate staff. There are plenty of local breweries with good vibes and good beer! Don't waste your time."

                "description": "My friends and I enjoy the atmosphere, but we frequently don't get good service here. The bartenders don't seem to be on the same page as far as pour amounts go, either. Depending on the bartender, you may get a tap beer in a small plastic cup or a pint glass. I asked a female bartender why that was, and she said they do either \"double\" or \"single\" pours. I went back the following week and asked for a double pour of the same beer from the week before - this time with a different male bartender - and he said they only do beers in pint glasses. I guess there is a lack of communication on that front but it's resulting in customers asking for double pours and being charged more for what should be the normal amount of beer and frankly that doesn't sit right with me.  The value of the food from Southside Flying Pizza is also overpriced. The quality of the food is not equal to what they're charging, and they're frequently out of menu items and condiments by the evening. I've never been for lunch but their \"special\" is a slice of pizza for $4, which hardly seems like a special to me considering the quality of the pizza.  They make tasty beer, though!"

                "description": "Came in on a gorgeous spring Saturday afternoon and enjoyed my free...yes free...beer tasting here. Now, the \"free\" tasting is 3 tastes of anything they have on the board in the little taster glasses. There is an option to purchase full pours which includes a glass.  I have always been a fan of Thirsty Planet's beer offerings as I have had them at several brewpubs around Austin. Their Buckethead and Double Buckethead are my handsdown favorites! When I was out and about and headed to some other breweries, I stopped in here and was happy I did.  The staff was very nice and there is ample communal seating inside and out. They also offer tours, but I did not take one as I was a bit tight on time.   For a glorious afternoon in a chill atmosphere with great beer offerings and a little roadtrip out of Austin, this is a great place to spend it!"

                "description": "Just get the Thirsty Goat. It is a crowd favorite. We stopped in on a recent Pub Crawl and the place was hopping. Since they don't sell food, your pup is welcome and we had fun lovin' on some sweet dawgs! Uh, the four legged ones.  They are great at working the crowd and selling their beer glasses. Katherine was there at the door on the one day (Saturday) that we stopped by to explain how it works. Lots of t-shirts and ball caps to pick through and new fun people to meet. Everyone's happy with a beer.  I also love that Thirsty Planet supports Divine Canines, a therapy dog group that sponsors training for dogs to service hospital patients. Just wish they were open for more than 4 hours a week. Rumor has it this outstanding brewery will soon move to a new much larger space on South Congress."

                "description": "I came here on the first leg of a drinking bonanza. The weather was behaving and so we grabbed a table outside and started boozing it up. It's cheap to get a few pours and most everything there is close to some ambrosia of sorts. I've definitely had the goat everywhere so I was glad to try the only-found in-house bevs.   I do not like IPAs so what did I try first, the double bucket head IPA of course. Awesome taste. Not so bitter but leaves you feeling good. Pretty strong so it was a great way to start the morning. I can't recall the other beers I tried but I do remember leaving happy."

I don't have any of the ABV info but it had a nice lemon taste to it. Very refreshing for the hot weather.  Thirsty Goat - American-style Amber Ale, 6.5% ABV. Had a nice spicy finish with the beer.  Yellow Armadillo - Light American-style Wheat, 4.0% ABV. Very refreshing. Had some citrus flavors in there.   There is a nice outside area with picnic tables and plenty of seating inside and out.   The guys there were so nice. Very engaging and informative when it comes to the beer info.   When I make it back to Austin, I'll definitely be stopping by again."

The outdoor \"patio\" area is lacking but the indoor tasting area makes up for it. From what I understanding they are opening another place soon.  Take advantage of the \"Barks for Beer\" sale. $20 for a special pint glass that's good for a free pint in several restaurants and other breweries."

But it's not like I didn't know it would be smoky.  I ordered it anyway and didn't like it so that's on me.  Regarding the brewery itself, it was a well thought out taproom with quality beers.

                "description": "More like 4.5. We had a great post-Zoo visit here on a sweaty Saturday afternoon. $10 for a sweet glass and three pints always works for me. They'll also give you a small tasting glass for free, but why bother with that?   I've been a fan of Thirsty Goat amber for awhile, and this visit turned me on to the Hoppy Blonde and Buckethead IPA. I'll be looking for all of them at local bars.  The \"tour\" is one room, but hey they're a small business, which is cool. Very informative, maybe more than the average beer fan will want, but beer nerds will love it and it's not hard to step out and back to the bar if you get bored.   One downside, it was super stuffy in the tasting room. Not sure if their AC was acting up or just couldn't handle the crowd and the July heat. However, that didn't stop my group for staying and drinking until closing time. I'd recommend Thirsty Planet to any beer lover visiting or living in Austin."

                "description": "Stopped by the brewery for a birthday beer crawl. (Is it really a crawl if you only go to 2 places?)  We signed up for the tour online (which is free) but there was no list and it seemed like they weren't going to do the tour at all. You might have to remind them. Once we mentioned our interest, they announced it and a bunch of people joined in. I'm not sure reservations are really needed at all for this. The tour was fine, nothing to write home about. If you've done a tour before you've probably seen everything they have.  I liked a lot of the beer we had, especially the thirsty goat ale. They were out of the wheat but had a rhubarb beer which was interesting.  Staff were friendly and when not totally overwhelmed with people, happy to engage in conversation about the beers.   It did get quite crowded and I understand why. The outdoor patio is lovely when the weather is nice and they have tons of games. For me it was a bit too crowded and noisy, but that's the small price you pay for free - $10 beer. (You can either get 3 tickets for a small glass for free or 3 pint tickets + a keepsake glass for $10.)"

                "description": "Checked out their brewery tasting and tour this past Saturday.  Warning: there are times it will be quite crowded like when bus loads of people stop by.  However, even despite the crowds, the bartenders did a great job of serving everyone.  $10 gets you a souvenir pint glass and three full pints (plus you can taste a few oz of the other beers they have for no additional charge, so really you can taste 7-8 taps for $10).  Their yellow armadillo and thirsty goat are both solid crowd and palate pleasers.  I liked their merch as well, bought a ladies tee for $18.  The tour was about 25 minutes long, but it was the hottest part of July and it was not a/c, so I think they mercifully made it quick for us.  We brought kiddos and the outside area was kid friendly, although not completely fenced in by the side of the road, which was a bit nerve wracking.  I wish I had brought some more small bills as tips collected in the tasting room go to a local charity, which rotates monthly or seasonally.  A fun way to spend a Saturday, would be even better in the cooler months of the year."

We stopped by this place and had a swell time. The owner/brewmaster was super nice and friendly, in fact, everyone who worked there was awesome. If you don't want to drink three beers, you get a tasting glass and three free tasters. But then you don't get an awesome pint glass...   Only gripe? No AC (in August, yuck) and it is SUPER LOUD inside. And it seemed that the more people drink, the louder they got and it was just incredibly noisy.   If you like Thirsty Planet beers, or beer in general, definitely worth checking out."

They were professional, yet easy to work with, responsive and surprisingly affordable. Jason did a great job behind the bar causally handling the beer orders while educating those who wanted about their beers.  PRO TIP: They use Sonos wireless music system, but do not have an external headphones jack. Download Sonos on your phone and the then manage/update your playlists and you can listin to an iTunes playlist by going to \"This iPhone\" (I assume the same for Android phones) and then Playlists. If you do not want an iTunes playlist, you can create a playlist in Sonos app ahead of time or play Pandora, Spotify, XM/Sirius, etc)."

                "description": "This is a great addition to Austin's micro brewery scene.  I first tried their Buckethead IPA at Second Restaurant and enjoyed it enough to look for Thirsty Planet's website, where I discovered they offer tours most Saturdays.  No information about the tours is provided on the website, but here's the deal: sign up online, when you go there's an optional tour, plus four 4 oz. samples for free, or you can purchase the \"souvenir glass\" for $7 and use it to get up to 4 pints free...a nice deal (although, I don't know about you, but I couldn't consume 4 full pints in 2 hours).  They have a nice large indoor tasting room with communal bench tables and an outdoor patio as well (but it offers no shade).  On to the beer:  * Buckethead IPA - one of my new favorite local IPAs; it is well balanced with the bitter and hint of sweet, with a pleasing Amber color and a mildly citrusy nose.  * Thirsty Goat Amber - a lighter amber, malty but with a slight hoppy finish.  * Double Buckethead IPA - an even stronger bitter taste than the Buckethead...save this one for last. * Yellow Armadillo Habanero - I could definitely taste the habanero flavor, but the spiciness was tempered by a pilsner-like base.  It's surprising how easily this beer can be consumed."

The place had a nice welcoming feeling to it, and stepping up to the bar got me a friendly greeting. I was not familiar with their brews, but saw one called \"Twist and Stout\", and being a fan of the dark stuff, went right for it. Oh my... *smiles coyly\" This stuff was liquid sex.... and I knew it was going to get me in trouble.  So next up, I explained my fondness of the dark, but felt the need to expand outward, what would they suggest. The man behind the counter said without hesitation - \"Thirsty Goat Amber\"!  Boyo was he right! After two pints of that, I had an expression similar to the one on the label, so I took some time in my truck to eat a sandwich before driving away.  Yup, I'm going back!"

                "description": "Cool brewery with a huge selection of beers, but nothing extraordinary. The brewery does not have an actual taproom open regularly, but instead is open only Saturdays from 12-4 pm in their parking lot. I went during their anniversary event and it was $25 for a glass that you keep and 6 8 oz pours of your choice (you can do 12 4 oz pours instead). Majority of the pours turned out to be larger than 8 oz so you can really get trashed here. They had 44 beers on tap. Pretty insane. Unfortunately, none of the beers were that great. They had like 4 food trucks and a lot of porta potties (lines can get long).   Overall, this was a quantity over quality brewery. We had 4 people in our group and none of us were impressed, although, we are from California and are spoiled by all of the good breweries out here. If you just want to get the job done and get trashed on a Saturday afternoon, this is your spot. If your a real beer lover, you may be disappointed"

                "description": "I think all of the yelper complaints are the same: why not open more than one day a week? And for more than 4 hours at a time?!   Maybe it's an exclusivity thing...it sure works. If you are visiting Austin and have a free Saturday early afternoon, be sure to hit up 512 for your beer desires. You can take your tasting cup home as a souvenir. They have outdoor seating, merch for purch, and are kid and dog-friendly. Double wow! My boyfriend and I made it to 512 at the tail end of their Saturday hours, but we were able to share a tasting for one. That was perfect because it was the safest way to drink, play some ladderball (it was my first time playing that!), and drive to dinner afterwards.  They have clean restrooms and an easy way to purchase your guitar picks as proof of beer-drinking capability. When you park (plenty of parking btw), walk first to the door on the tasting room's left. You can purchase your tasting power, then head over to the main room for the adventure. When we went, there was basically one taptender pouring while a barback was helping him out with the glasses and stuff. It seemed like a lot of regulars were there, mostly 30+ in age, but all having a great time socializing. There wasn't a food truck there, nor any food on site, so bring your own or head out to eat afterwards."

                "description": "Came here during their passport beer event thing. There was live music and it was outdoors. It was $25 and you get to keep the beer glass. You get to taste 6 full glass beers or 12 half glass beers and can pick if you want them to pour half a glass or full glass. The beer list was extensive! There were probably 2 beers we really liked and tons of unique ones that were puzzling to us. They also served some complimentary cheeses. There's also a few food trucks for hungry people. The only thing bad about the event was that restrooms were porta-potties. Many people brought their dogs to the event too. Cool to people and dog watch."

I'm glad we made a point to visit and will likely bring friends here when visiting in the future.

Had an IPA. Very tasty. I like. Me, happy camper. 512 Brewing Company taproom mostly outside. Ugh... You buy your beer and hang outside in beer garden. Very unique way to order beer. Buy tokens (12 for $24) at one location. Then walk to beer taps. Ugh... They give you two 8oz glasses. Yeah... Never a fresh clean glass to try delicious beer. This is a comfort I like in a taproom I feel it makes a big difference in flavor and service. My two cents. I have only had their IPA. I am an IPA guy. I like the classic flavors and full body beer. 512 Brewing Company IPA does a good job for me. I would like the tasting experience as an option. I really enjoy a 4oz sample to try all the beers. Not a fan of using my beer token on a maybe. Oh well. 512 Brewing Company I will be back just not that often..."

                "description": "I used to take the train downtown so I'd always stop at Champions by the station and have a Pecan Porter or three while waiting for a pick up.  After relocating and driving myself to work like a pleb for the last 2 years the thing I missed most was the beer.  The few times a month I'd venture into Specs I'd always ask the beer guy about this(and Hitachino) and was always met with the tired response citing the owners devotion to sustainability.  I grew to loathe the environment.  Every time I'd toss something in the blue bin at work I'd scowl.  It just wasn't worth it.  I wanted this beer in something other than a keg.  Low and behold on my last trip in I see a stack of 4-packs of Pecan Porter.  The most perfect stack since the pyramids.  Beer guy saw me and came over to share in my unbridled joy.  I cursed the owner one last time for making me wait so long.  And grabbed two."

                "description": "512 had the honors of providing me with my first brewery tour. It was great, but definitely a little different than I expected. I attended the first weekend where they changed their \"style\" of the tour. They have not updated their website to list the correct details. Admission is $12 per person. This gets you the tour (optional), a small 512 glass souvenir for tasting, and 6 tickets for beer tasting.   The tour is said to start Saturday's around noon. However once you arrive, they will let you know how long they are going to wait based on the amount of people waiting. (they like to fill up)  That being said, we had about an hour wait outside on the patio-ish area (no cover, bring a hat and shades) to enjoy some brews! The weather was great and they have giant Jenga and corn hole for you to enjoy. Dogs are also welcome outside. If you plan to skip out on the tour and just enjoy the beer, bring lawn chairs as the tables get crowded after a while.   IF you decide to attend their tour, keep in mind that it may not be exactly what you expect. The brewery is small and there are only about 3 sections to view in cramped spaces. Get up close to the tour guide so that you can hear because they do not use a microphone. They have some work do to on the tour, but overall I enjoyed it.  Stop by 512! Besides, you can't beat $12 for 6 beers!"

For $12 you get an 8oz 512 glass to keep and 6 guitar pics to trade for different brews. There beers were all great, we even got to try some limited edition that's not being distributed yet. The \"bartender\" was really cool, knowledgeable about the beers, and overall pleasant to talk to. The only thing missing would be some type of food truck or snack.

                "description": "It's pretty rare that I like MOST of the beers at a brewery. Usually there's one or two stand outs, and that in itself is unusual.   However, 512 takes the cake on my brewery tour of Austin this time around. We showed up around noon, definitely past their \"tour\" time and it wasn't even available on their eventbrite / website anymore. Regardless, the brewer (New-ish Guy, woo!) let us in the tour and filled our two glasses with delicious Pecan Porter that was on nitro at the time.  I definitely loved their IPAs (IPA and Seven), their Wit was also not bad at all. The only thing I was a little eh about was their Pils and that's ok with me. They were incredibly knowledgable, the tour was fun, and they're doing some really cool barrel aged stuff that you don't see at a lot of breweries. They're also very dedicated to self distribution, despite how difficult that seems, so I'm definitely looking forward to other 512 beers I can get my hands on in the future."

There was beer for the whole family and the outdoor seating area came complete with bags, jenga, and ladder toss. The cost is $12 for 6-8oz beer samples! Probably the best deal in town. Highly recommend this place if you are looking for a place to hangout with friends. I'd recommend bringing food with you as there isn't much close by, but otherwise great place to just go and chill."

The staff was friendly and there was a decent selection of draft brews to choose from at a reasonable price (I enjoyed their sole Porter, the Samoan Joe). I hope to try something else on the menu if they grow their dark beer menu.  The environment was great on a Sunday afternoon, with several folks there enjoying the NFL playoffs on their TVs.  Wish they had a bit more to choose from in terms of snacks or food (TacoWey is a decent food truck parked outside).  Seems as though this place is a bit of a hidden gem, given that its location is literally hidden off 183. Look forward to another visit."

I would highly recommend this place for casual dates, group meetups, and all your brewery outing needs! We both had a pint of beer to start with, then ended up with a set of tasters each to try more of their other beers. I was so pleased to see on their menu tonnnnns of hazy IPA's, but also that they had a larger number of beers on tap to choose from! That's always a mini gold mine when there are over 10 beers on tap. There were two beertenders on shift when we went, and we had to wait a bit for us to get our orders in, but the place is so chill and so spacious that we didn't mind waiting. We saw a lot of other couples, small groups, and even people with their dogs inside!! So dog-friendly brewery, check!   They also had cornhole indoors as well as pool! I love that this brewery caters to making itself a great source of beer, but also a great place to hang out. That is sometimes forgotten, but this warehouse style brewery does it all. Everything is super low-key, and they even had a food truck outside too.  Their restrooms are clean, wifi strong, and their brewery holds plenty of parking space! I can't wait to come back again."

It's a little off the beaten path but, it is most definitely worth the trip! They've got hazy IPAs for days and they can appeal to any palate. Walking into Southern Heights I wasn't the biggest fan of IPAs, I had never found one that really really did it for me...this place made me rethink my stance on IPAs.   They are posted up in a super cool warehouse that's mostly open and is welcoming to parties of all shapes and sizes. When I went, there were even a lot of kiddos there. The staff was amazing, they were super knowledgeable about their beers and beer in general and they treated my friends and I very well! They have a food truck that comes on the weekend and it is for sure worth a visit as well."

They have a wonderful selection of IPA's (probably the biggest in Austin), as well as a great selection of light beers and delicious dark beers. Regardless of the type of beer you like, I am sure you will find one of their beers amazing. And they are very good about letting you try whatever you want to make sure you get the right beer.

                "description": "When people say of hole in the wall, they're thinking of Southern Heights. Literally nestled in an out of the way office complex, one would never know! Places like this don't attract uppity people and the interiors resemble that. A great color scheme with not a lot of exotic patterns, the place is rustic and industrial. One of the owners, Mike, will graciously give tours of the brewery that produces the beer sold up front.  The beer selection is IPA heavy. Though the selection changes, at the time I went there was five IPAs to choose from. This brewery leans towards dark and bitter beers. A friend mentioned to me that drinking one beer felt like drinking three, and for me the coffee stout hit me harder than anticipated.  Southern Heights is Austin born and raised, by people who work industry jobs along side the rest of us. This is where you can drink local and meet local."

                "description": "Southern Heights might be my new favorite spot in town.  Perhaps most consistent IPAs in town, both hazy and traditional.  Some sour and dark stuff available, but this is IPA destination first and foremost.  3 TVs and free WiFi.  No sports packages, but got the main channels if your game is on network.  Indoor and outdoor seating, dog-friendly, easy parking, and free games.  Tons of space in the back and great place to chill and have a quiet night drinking, or have fun and drink throughout the day.  Saw families with babies and dogs, and also a birthday party tables over.  Cans to go available as well.  Food smelled great out back with Vietnamese, Texas BBQ style, fare.  Only good east side brewery in town - will make this my new goto!"

This brewery offers an EXTENSIVE selection of IPAs, which is great for my dad bod figure.   They had Crawfish on special. They were excellent. Me and the shorty smashed these!!   Far East location if you like that area. Solid parking."

                "description": "My buddy and I just heard about this little gem last week and decided to check it out ASAP. Luckily we got to stop by Sunday November 26 for a few afternoon pints. This brewery may have the greatest juxtaposition between the outside appearance (plain and nondescript) and the beautiful tap room and quality beers within.   Both of the owners were behind the bar (Austin and Chris) and were happy to talk shop. Austin showed us around and told us about how they started, their backgrounds, their current beers and plans for the future.   We both had the pub ale (great, imminently quaffable, low ABV, everyday drinker), then my buddy had the pale ale while I opted for the West Coast IPA. Both the pale ale and IPA were absolutely fantastically executed and perfect representations of their styles. I can't wait to try the special porter that will be coming up in a few months.  Back to the space: the tap room is beautiful and you can tell that the owners have really poured their heart and soul into this place. There was a large TV on the wall, tons of bar seating and several 6-8 top tables. The bathrooms were industrial chic in the best way. Bonus points for free WIFI. These guys are off to a fantastic start! Right now they do not have an outdoor space for our four-legged friends, but one is in the works.   Stop by and try some awesome beer from some really great guys."

They  had staples like a Pilsner, or you can try something a little different like the sparkling golden ale (IMO heavy on the brut flavor). They have seating inside as well as outside, and they're dog friendly! They also had some cute shirts/apparel with their logo on it for purchase. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying this place once they expand their selection a little bit, but overall it was good! It's also right down the way from St Elmos Brewing, so add it to your list and hit them up when you're in the area/getting your beer fix."

The gentleman who served us our beers was also very friendly.   The beers were all very good and we enjoyed our flights.  Sometimes new breweries take time to develop a good list of beers, but I was impressed.   The setting was nicely laid out and decorated.  Indoor seating with AC for those hot days, as well as outdoor seating.   Check out Vacancy and support local independent breweries!!"

                "description": "One of the best \"better\" burgers in Austin.  Plain and simple.    It's a bit hard to find from Lamar because it's semi-hidden in the Midtown Commons apartment complex.  Like the Triangle and most other new Austin developments, there's retail and restaurants on the ground floor.  Decided to drop in here tonight because the burger came highly recommended.  I'm definitely glad I tried it.  The burger is deceptively small.  It looks like a smaller burger, but the density of the high quality burger patty combined with their bun makes it more than a meal.  Don't forget their fries, which were described to me as English style chips.  The fries look like flattened steak fries and are exceptionally crispy.  I'm not sure what the seasoning is, but it's strangely addictive.  Black Star has a huge variety of beers for the drinkers.  For the non-drinkers, they have a variety of canned and bottled soft drinks, although no fountain drinks.    Being a co-op, the service is friendly and obviously takes a lot of pride in their pub.  The quality of the food and the service both show that."

                "description": "Brewpub: dog-friendly, veggie options, friendly staff and strong wifi! SCORE!  Came through with a good friend and my pup. We loved it. Pups have to stay outdoors, but you're allowed to bring them indoors to place your order. They have tons of beer options, great in-house brews. I was floored by their options! I always go for the flight when I try a new brewery to get a better taste of what they offer. I loved pricing: 4 for $10, and my favorites were the Island Baby (pineapple what!!) and juicy Fructis hazy IPA. They had a bit of everything, so that's always nice for beer geeks. Quench my palate, Black Star! They have their beer menu overhead--super easy to read. They also have great happy hour, but we arrived later after it was over. The food menu is on the paper menu that they have at the front of the line. Grab yourself the menu while someone stands in line for ya!   They also offer food specials for that day. It looked good--I think it was some sort of tofu (veg) tacos, but I wanted fries...so went with their avocado club. It was a bit heavy on the mayo, but it tasted great. Their chips...crisps...fries whatever you want to call em were the REAL WINNER. Y'all. Fries are so crispy and uneven...wedge-style. BUT not dry or lukewarm. They are delicious. I would go back just for their addictive fries. Trust me. They also offer the impossible burger too for veg folks, and other options like grilled cheese. I just love how veg-friendly they are. THANK Y'ALL. Grilled cheese gets old for us who don't eat meat.   The atmosphere is very chill and with a darker ambiance. It seems like the perfect spot for group hangs or a relaxed date. Parking was easy, especially since there's a customer parking structure that's free. It's also close to public transportation if you choose to take it. I love this spot--I can see this becoming a new favorite."

                "description": "I cannot emphasize my love for this place enough!!! Usually I am not the type of person to seek out breweries/pubs simply because they are loud and not too clean. I make an exception for this location due to the fantastic service I am given every. single. time. (NO TIPS HERE!! They work and treat you well because thy are paid good/decent wages!!!!!!)  Atmosphere: 4 Pretty big, can get crowded on evenings (cause it's freakin great). Lots of indoor seating and ample outdoor seating (covered)  Food: 4.5 Most of the food I have had here has been pretty decent. I knock off half a star because I've noticed a slight inconsistency in the servings (read about fish and chips) Fish and chips: my go-to food. Usually comes with 2-3 strips of fish and the potato wedges/strips are always well cooked, and come it's this out-of-the-world sauce!! Addicting af but wish they would consistently give 3 strips of fish ): Fried avocado tacos: awesome!! Sounds like it would be plain, but came with these giant thicc bacon strips on it that really added the savory taste Cheese board: nice variety, definitely love that the cheese is locally sourced from Antonelli's! Good mix for everyone's taste buds and really liked how there was plenty of bread too. Ice cream: seasonal flavors but I tried the pecan and regretted only having one scoop.  Service: 5 The servers here are always!!!!!!!!! SO cool and nice and helpful. Whenever we need drink recs, or anything at all, they are there to help! Even called in to ask if they were playing a game before, and offered to put down the big screen to have us come by and watch as we ate."

                "description": "I've always seen this place and been curious to try it. So, when my friend was visiting from Vermont, I decided it was the perfect time! I always like to eat locally. We split the tofu tikka masala and buffalo cauliflower (we added bleu cheese). I'm sure I could've eaten the whole bowl of of buffalo cauliflower by myself. It was super tasty. The sauce was just a little bit vinegary and the cauliflower soaked up all the flavor. Get it with the cheese, if you aren't vegan. It gives it that extra sharpness. The tikka masala was a bit spicy. I was surprised by that. We both liked it. The tofu was perfect with it. You have to know how to do tofu just right, and this was it! Everything was gluten free, for my friend. I can't wait to go back after I have my baby so I can partake in the adult beverages. I had my eye on some that they made there."

                "description": "Black-star Co-op is cool, but the food isn't all that. They brew their own beer and rotate other craft brews, but I always get their Vulcan, a rye IPA.  Foodwise, the only things I've liked are the chicken snack, and the seasoned chips. The burger is just okay, but the fish for the fish and chips needs salt and let's get some dang tarter sauce. They serve it with an aoli, which lacks seasoning. A side of coleslaw would go a long way too.  I'd be back, primarily for a cold one, and I would not not go for food again, but not by my will."

                "description": "Chill beer garden style hang out spot, having passed by a bunch of times it never seems crazy busy and on a beautiful Saturday night we were able to get a table outside without any issue.   Their beer selection is great, with a wide variety of beer made in house and other local breweries. The food selection leaves a little bit to be desired. The season chips were delicious, they reminded me more of steak fries if you put them in a broiler to give them a nice crunch. Besides the chips nothing on the menu really stood out to me as too interesting, and most of the reviews I read were pretty disappointed with their other food.   They also seem to have events  and good happy hour deals pretty frequently during the week. Overall, it's a good place to grab a beer in the area and enjoy a nice night outside, but I wouldn't come here too hungry."

The hill country views are beautiful and I'd imagine sunsets here are gorgeous. Outdoor games available. Dogs on leash are allowed.   Lots of seating and an interesting idea on how to hold your seats/table. It was nice not having to worry about somebody taking our spot while playing with the animals. You can also get food for them at the bar. They were pretty gentle and didn't mind selfies.   Lots of beer, cider and wine options. I had the sweet Sangria (Messina Hof) and Cherry Cobbler by Martin House. Both delightful and fruity.   They have 2 food trucks: Gringas Grub Shak and Kelly's Hill Country BBQ. I went with Kelly's and got the Brisket Elote Parfait and it was so, so good. I want to go back just for that! There were so many options to choose from. There's really something for everyone. I'll definitely be back!"

It the best of what the area wineries offer in terms of a place where you want to spend a leisurely couple of hours, with a great assortment of local craft beers on tap (and options for the non-beer drinkers).  I like that there is a variety of seating options (picnic tables, Adirondack chairs, barstools) and they are nicely spread out.  Aside from the view the main attraction is their resident llamas and mini donkeys, and trust me, splurge on the bag of feed for optimal up-close interaction with these adorable camelids!  | Beverages | A nicely curated selection of local beer on tap, and surely something to please everyone.  There's also a selection of cider, hard seltzer, wine, and non-alcoholic beverages.    | Eats | We didn't eat here, but there's an onsite resident food trailer offering tacos, quesadillas and burgers."

The Shady Llama, just west of Wimberley on the way toward Dripping Springs on RR12 is a gem of a yard bar offering Texas-based craft brews, soft drinks, and wines with a killer view and a few furry mascots to feed and pet.  Our family loves this place. We can each enjoy a tasty beverage we like, have a good lunch from the Gringa's truck we like from Wimberley, and feed some alfalfa to some llamas and burros.  There are plenty of socially-distanced places to lounge around the terraced and tree-shaded yard, and everything is outdoors. It's actually perfect for pandemic times.  Pro-tip: do not try to come here during any weekend with special events in Wimberley, like Market Days or Rodeo. The parking lot has limited capacity. Lazy Sundays are the best time IMHO."

Plenty of great drinks on tap as well as friendly bartenders.   The bae and I came here after a swim at the neighboring Blue Hole Regional Park. Short 11min drive will get you to Shady Llama from Blue Hole.  The star of the show is the petting zoo featuring the llama and two donkeys. You can get up and personal with the llama by feeding and petting. I was a little hesitant to get too close because who knows if he'll spit.  The view of Texas Hill Country is breathtaking and you could sit here for hours just taking it all in. There were two food trucks on site offering tacos and bbq.  THE FINAL BAMBOO: The vibe here was so nice. Great place to unwind after long day at the pool or chill with friends until dusk."

                "description": "Judging from the recent reviews, I guess I'm in the minority. But I miss pre-COVID Shady Llama.  It's just not the same and the magic is gone. Given that literally 100% of the place is outside,  their COVID protocols are way over the top.   Why do you need to assign picnic tables??   And all the hammocks are gone (risk of transmission is greater from canvas than wood??).  At least they stopped doing the inane requirement of reservations they were doing for a while.   So if you're uber paranoid and love restricted freedoms maybe it won't be an issue for you.    But it just made my wife and I sad to be back (1st time in a year and pre-pandemic we were regulars).   Yes they have good beer, and higher prices now to offset the fact that people obviously aren't flocking there like they used to.  And the view is great and it's fun to see the llamas and if you never went before maybe you'll be none the wiser.  But for me it's just a sad reminder of what it used to be and a testament to how much fear and paranoia have all but ruined our country.   I won't be back until they restore everything to pre-pandemic protocols."

                "description": "Just all sorts of whimsical in brewery form.  Their table designation decor they give you at the front so you can claim your spot without fear of anyone scooping it up when you're grabbing a beer or going to gawk at the llamas or mini donkeys is adorbs and shows attention to detail and a winning customer service experience right off the bat.   The tables are spread out nicely and there's plenty of shaded options or exposed ones, depending on your tolerance for the sun/heat.   It's actually on top of a hill so you can get a lovely panoramic vista of Hill Country, so you better believe if you're there at sunset, you'll be getting a gorgeous setting to close out on.   They don't brew their own beer (or wine), so they offer up a glimpse of Texas' finest on tap, which I appreciate. During COVID, every order came with chips or a treat (from a Costco assortment), but there's also a taco truck in the back if you're looking for something a little more substantive.   Kid and dog friendly, and since there are cute animals roaming the grounds (but fenced away from the tables), there are a lot more kids also roaming the grounds, so if that's not your thing, this may not be the place for you ;)  They have 6 llamas and two mini donkeys, and while the guy checking us in made it seem a sighting of them is rare unless you get there right when they open because that's when feeding time is, they were ever present during our midday visit. You can purchase feed for $1/bag to lure them over, and so I have a feeling we just had an extra generous crowd that day that always kept them fence curious!"

However, the scenery was picturesque, and I loved the overall charm of the outdoor space. Service was on point."

More than that, at the end we ended at a tasting room where we sat with others on our tour and chatted.  We ended up walking down to a winery with some of those on the tour with us where we sat and chatted and then ended up going to dinner with them.  I highly recommend visiting the distillery and taking the tour!!"

                "description": "Well Austin, I finally made 2k reviews on Yelp. I must have no life. haha!  My husband and I had come across Still Austin Whiskey while having drinks around Austin. My husband loved their whiskey and wanted to check out their place of business.  Sunday afternoons a few times a month, they do drag queen bingo. After the gym, I showered and we came here around 1:30ish. The drag queen bingo was underway and quite crowded. We grabbed a drink from inside and headed out to the beer garden area to observe. It was so much fun and recommend it.   They have a variety of drink cocktails to try with either gin, whiskey, and a beer or two. My husband got a flight and said it was good. I opted for the gold rush which was bourbon, honey, and lemon. It was quite tasty and strong.   I would like to note that I am gluten intolerant. I talked to the server and the manager about the gluten content. I was told that due to the distilling process basically, all spirits are gluten-free. I disagree with this information because I have had issues with some booze in the past as well as people in the gluten-free community. However, I am intolerant and usually only affected by gluten digestive-wise. I did have some mild digestive issues later that day but I made the choice to have a drink here. So make your decision wisely if you have problems with gluten.   Overall, this is a great place to grab a drink and chill for the afternoon in south austin. There are plenty of other things nearby to check out including food trucks and places to drink. The parking lot can get crowded so look for the overflow parking area or follow someone who is going to their car to leave."

Got an old fashioned for 6 bucks so that was a solid deal. Didn't get any good but it looked like a bunch of fried options which my friends seemed to enjoy. It was about 60% full on a Sunday afternoon. I will say that the music was way too loud during the bingo so that made it hard to talk. Outside of bingo, the volume was fine. Overall I'd recommend it. If not, St Elmo brewing is next door."

I'm a tequila girl so I wasn't too eager to learn how gin and bourbon are made, but she really had my attention the entire time!   We were in a group of 10 which was just right. Everyone could get a few questions in if they wanted...laid back...chill...ITS AUSTIN!  Now, to the best part....and boy I was a bit disappointed. I've been on several tours in distilleries and the tasting at the end could get you about 2 shots away from tipsy. Typically there are about 4 samples....1.5-2 ounces each.....  Here....there were 2 samples with 1.5 ounces TOTAL!  I know all they do is gin and bourbon but can a SISTA have a bit more?! The tour is around $15pp, but I'd be happy to pay the standard $30-$40 for a tad bit more licka.    The gin and bourbon are still yummy!  Get a cocktail.....The old fashioned will have you stumbling!"

When we arrived, the place didn't have electricity or AC due to an electrical issue in the area.   Rather than cancel, they treated us to some complementary drinks to make up for the electrical and AC issue.   The staff was very friendly, professional, and turned a bad situation into a very fun and amazing time. Couldn't have imagined it being any better!   The guide was very knowledgeable, the tour was insightful, and the tasting at the end was great! Go support this local Austin business!"

They don't have tasting flights, but they do have an option to order a taste of any of their liquors for $2 each. That's not bad at all. We were able to taste the whiskey and gin. The two year whiskey was the winner. I did see some yummy cocktails that I would love to try in the near future.   They have inside and outside seating. The outside patio has a cover for shade, but you do have areas where you can get sun   There's a food truck on site.   Parking is available on site, but shared with the other businesses. For those that want to make an afternoon or day out of your visit, the other businesses are all drink or food related."

Our tour guide was incredibly knowledgeable and was able to answer all our questions. I felt like I got a lot out of the tour and now have a basic grasp of how whiskey is made.   The distillery is pretty small and they currently sell bourbon and gin as their bread and butter, both of which you'll get to sample at the end of the tour. Highly recommended to check it out as it's just a fun atmosphere."

The picnic tables outside are plentiful but were all full when we arrived. Luckily two guys let us join them. I had the Raspberry Berliner Weisse and it quickly became my new favorite. It is sweet and crisp without being overly sweet. Our friends both got the Cream Ale and loved it. We all walked out with growlers. Everyone there is super friendly and very welcoming. We had the baby with us which was fine (there were a few kids there)...but every time a car was exiting we would have to wrangle him down (minor downfall of basically sitting alongside the parking lot). We are looking forward to visiting again."

                "description": "Bluebonnet Beer Company is simply amazing. They are a little difficult to find, look for the side street behind the post office and you should notice it on the right.  Their beers are super delicious, I had the wit, pecan brown ale , cream ale and hef. Out of all of them, the cream ale and wit come highly recommended. They are so smooth and drinkable.  There is a schnitzel food trailer that serves some pretty decent food. The place is small but all of the employees I encountered were nice and friendly. For seating, there is only plastic benches avaliable located in the front of the brewery. Not really any kind  of shade or landacaping but this is expected since it is such a small brewery.  It may not have all of the amenities and backyard space that other larger breweries in Austin have. But if you love beer and want to interact with some awesome, friendly people then Bluebonnet Beer Company is the way to go. Everything is tasty and pints are currently at $5 each, you can't beat that price."

We go when it's raining and all tables are outside for the exception of the owners table that was inside. We asked if we could move our table in and was rejected instantly because \"there was no room\" (there was enough). Hospitality was at a negative and we were highly considering the beer mug club but the lost a customer and a loyaled customer.  Bluebonnet Brewery you all need to focus on customer Hospitality and not just your sales."

                "description": "Great little brewery in my hometown of Round Rock!  My family and I came here on a Friday around 6:30 to grab a few beers and relax. If it's cold outside, I highly recommend bringing a layer or two as there is only a bit of seating inside but about four picnic tables outside. Also, wait to grab dinner at the brewery as they have rotating food trucks Thursday-Saturdays. When we went, they had a lobster roll truck that served amazing rolls.   I started out with their Oktoberfest beer, which was very good! My mom, who is not a big beer drinker, got their shandy and thought it would be great for a hot day. The beers are $5 a pint, and I thought it was really cool they have a series related to the Immortal 10.   Parking is not a hassle, the beer is very good, the people are friendly, and your hardest job will be finding a seat. Enjoy!"

Beer is tasteful and I don't always love IPA. Their indoor seating is limited by this isn't normally a problem in Texas. They have plenty of tables outside and also have tents in the summer. No food but there is always a food truck - if you follow them on Facebook you can see what it is ahead of time.   Staff is always friendly and accommodating. Plenty of space for puppies here too.   They are only open Friday evenings and Saturday! I wish they had some openings on Sunday."

We know that they are popular and were even excited to try Jimmy Vega's Smokehouse but when we arrived half of the available tables were set as reserved. There was literally no where to sit. Every table was packed. We had our 3 yr old son with us, so standing wasn't an option, especially since we wanted to eat too. We asked anyway if any of the tables were available and was told no, they are all reserved for 5pm, but you could squeeze in anywhere else. In the end, we left irritated and disappointed, while I understand reserving tables, but when you only have 10 tables and you reserve 5 of them, that doesn't leave much room for anyone else."

They have a solid line up across a wide style of beers. The summer wit is a favorite along with the Kolsch styles they release during the fall. I would love to see them expand to a new location  with a climate controlled tasting room which I think would bring in a lot more clientele."

For all my people with a sweet tooth, this is definitely the place for you. With all the fried foods you can think of, I definitely had to pace myself.  I also got \"The Big Cheez\" (not pictured) to start. It was sooo good. It's mozzarella cheese wrapped in donut dough deep fried with a butter and cilantro buttermilk dressing. This is definitely not a place you go to and every week unless you plan to spend some nights in the gym LOL.   This is great for cheat days and I love that they have very fun takes on regular donuts.

                "description": "I LOVE THIS PLACE. The donuts are fried to perfection, every time. The plates are unique. Gourdough's is great to bring guests to experience what Austin has to offer.  Portion sizes are very filling, except for the Grilled Cheese. The prices are high, but you will have a quality, fun and delicious experience.  My second time here, I ordered the Country Clucker, and the Piña Colada (again). The Piña Colada was still delicious, but I fortunately the bartender did not go all out like last time (I missed the coconut shavings and umbrella). The Country Clucker was a solid choice. I LOVED the candied jalapeños (slightly spicy). The creamed corn was a bit flavorless for my liking, there was a HUGE piece of chicken, and the donut was great. I'm not sure if I'd order this dish again, but I did love the jalapeños. The entrees do not come with a side like the sandwiches and burgers, so my dad and I split a side of fried okra. The side of okra is different from the appetizer of fried okra - instead of frying the entire okra, it's just little balls. The side also does not come with the delicious dipping sauce, but luckily we were able to ask for it. I was soooo full after this meal. My dad ordered the Pork My Avocado - he devoured it! If you like fried avocado and refried beans, it's a good choice. Kind of a Tex-Mex spin, with the queso on top too! He always loves a local beer, and orders the McConaughaze beer every time. My sister ordered the Double D's. She couldn't finish it! Instead of the chips, she got the jalapeño potato salad (subbing a side will cost extra). It wasn't spicy at all, and I wouldn't say it was outstanding and worth paying extra for it. Her S.O. ordered \"built his own\" Grilled Cheese with garlic bread and two types of cheese. He is a VERY picky eater, but he loved it! Said it was \"better than anything he can make himself,\" which is saying something. He was the only one out of us who had room for dessert. He got the Sin A Bomb and ate it all up. It tasted like a king cake filled with cream cheese!  The service from our waitress could have been improved. She was not attentive, and the service was slow. We relied on communicating with other staff members for some of our requests."

Raspberry something Flora Dora... not good, tasted like chemicals. It was bad. Our sandwiches were extremely greasy, and brussel sprouts arrived cold. A table across from us sat empty and dirty nearly the entire time we were there. Waiter only checked on us once and my kid had to get up to ask a waitress for ketchup at the counter. It was all around just a poor experience.  The only positive I can say is that we encountered one friendly employee who said Hi while she worked on rolling napkins. She was busy and still made the time to be friendly.  Been here before and that experience was completely different. This was just regrettable! With so many dining options in Austin, I doubt very much that we'll ever go back."

For background, when we originally visited Austin several years ago we fell in love with Gourdough's (I have a really serious sweet tooth). Since then we make this a must-stop whenever in town.   We ordered the blue balls and the country clucker along with a regular coffee and the donut coffee. Blue balls was as amazing as ever! The country clucker was brought out WITHOUT the candied jalapeños and we had to wait several minutes before our server came back to check. The candied jalapeños really make the dish. We ran out of our drinks and also had to wait several more minutes for our server to come out with more coffee and water.    After flagging down the server 4-5 times throughout the meal, it kinda seemed like he didn't really care to check up on us."

My go to is the nutty valentine with a topping of pecans, my son loves the black out, and my husband loves the black betty with icing on the side.  We hope to try the savory donuts the next time we're there, it's just so hard to decide between sweet or savory!"

                "description": "Bar service is outstanding, but table service is beyond abysmal. As I type this I've been sitting at a completely empty table for 25 minutes without so much as a greeting from any of the staff. There are at least four servers milling about, but not one has offered me a menu or so much as a glass of water. Crickets. Even though it's close to home and I sit at the bar often, this experience is enough to burn the bridge. The food is solid, but the WiFi is even worse than the table service, and if their social media management is as bad as their patio service, I doubt they'll bother responding to this, which would hardly be surprising. What a clown show."

                "description": "I loved the concept of this restaurant. It's so creative. I was wondering how'd they execute our meals and was pleasantly surprised.  I'm not sure if this place gives sports vibes to anyone else but there were several screens/projections available to watch various games. The outside seating was adorable. They have a bar out there as well, I believe.   Our appetizer, Three Little Guidos, was sooo good. The bacon literally melted in my mouth. I thought maybe it'd be too much bread but honestly it was really good. The McGourdough sandwich was delicious and so filling. I loved how they utilized donuts in different ways. We shared a mimosa carafe. For dessert, we took home the Cherry Bombs donut holes. The cherries added the perfect touch.   Overall, I really enjoyed this restaurant and I am eager to go back."

                "description": "When I first moved to Austin, I went to Gourdough's nearly every other week and eventually burned myself out on the overly sweet, donut concoctions. Now, I revisit them every few months.   It's always dead empty, no matter when I go. It's so surprising how easy it is to come in for brunch on the weekends.   My go-to is the Dirty Plucker (fried chicken on top of a maple glazed donut), the Big Cheeze (giant moz sticks with dipping sauces) and pitcher of mimosa.   Service is generally great."

                "description": "From a small food truck to full blown restaurant, Gordoughs still has it! Lots of variety and still the tried and true Gordoughs doughnuts they're known for. The menu is entertaining and interesting to say the least! We got the saucy cock (LOL) which was amazing! I was looking forward to the Count Gordough Cristo, but it flopped in my opinion. The sandwich arrived cold and the ham was colder so I don't recommend this dish. Other than that, lots of TVs to watch the game and great drinks of all kinds!"

                "description": "Gourdough's answers the questions that you didn't know you had. And the answer is always donuts!    How do you make mozzarella sticks better?   Wrap them in donut dough, aka The Big Cheez.   How do you make a breakfast sandwich better?  Serve it on donuts.  The McGourdough is maple sausage, egg, and cheese (on donuts, of course) with maple on the side (opted not to have the pour-over). There's plenty of maple flavor in the sausage so I never used the side of maple syrup.   Once again, how do you make Kolaches better?  You guessed it, use donut dough, aka Gotchie Yo Kolache  And finally, is it even possible to make a Cuban sandwich even better?  Yup! The Cubano, a Cuban sandwich on donuts.   I'm shocked that they didn't figure out how to serve me my beer in a donut!  That's right, a full-bar to go with all that doughy goodness!  Donuts and alcohol, what more do you need?"

It is extremely satisfying when executed successfully, so shout out to Gourdough's for doing it extremely well.   I was actually expecting the doughnut to be sweeter on my dish, and I'm happy it was not. Everything really paired well together.   The vibe is very Austin-esque and the staff was super friendly. My friend asked for no cheese on her burger, they put cheese, but the waitress happily got it fixed up for us.   I can't wait to go back!"

                "description": "This was my first by time here and was sort of disappointed in what I received; I guess my expectations were higher. The description state \"crispy fried fillet chicken breast smothered in honey butter.\"  I did request to have the honey butter on the side. I got two chicken tenders instead of a chicken breast (not to be too critical but the description should be updated if chicken breast = chicken tenders). The honey butter sauce was not what I was expecting; (not a fan). On the bright side, the donut was pretty good. Even thought it wasn't a chicken breast,  the tenders were tasty and had a good crunch.   I did order the miss shortcake and it was pretty good. But nothing special I suppose. Maybe I'll try a sandwich instead so get a full experience. I'll try them again and see if I get a different experience."

Showed up on a Sunday for breakfast and there were SO MANY THINGS I wanted to eat. I picked one thing intending to visit Monday morning again to get the other.   Our group showed up on Monday morning only to be told that their ENTIRE brunch menu was not available during the week. What the fuck man? Nowhere on the menu does it say that. They list brunch offerings with everything else on one giant menu.   The waitress proceeds to tell us how she has to break peoples hearts just about everyday. If you have customers everyday that aren't aware of your limited offerings on a weekday, the problem is you, not your customers.   How hard would it be to add a little graphic anywhere on the menu that says brunch is only available on Sat and Sun? Not sure what genius decided not to include key info on the menu or the website about limited brunch offerings."

Smells super weird in there Idk if I'm smelling old oil or what but it's weird.  2. There are lots of people working here, yet getting service or someone's attention was hard. We were approached when we first walked in and then after that, it was half assed.  3. I got the cucumber mint drink and it's like a mojito but with rum and cucumber instead of mint. Wasn't my fave, wasn't sweet enough, just tasted like cucumber water and lime juice.  4. Our donuts were really good but I was told by my friend that they were smaller than the donut food truck which is disappointing.  I got the sin a bomb and it tasted just like a cinnamon roll. My friends got the cherry bombs and peach donut and we all enjoyed it!  5. Vibes were just off and my friends agreed. If you're looking for good food, sure, but if you're a vibes type person like us, you'll feel weird here lol."

I usually get the black out but this time I got the miss shortcake which was delicious and wasn't too excessive like the black out can be. Excellent dessert spot for sure. The reason I'm giving it four stars is because we had to wait roughly 40-45 minutes to get three donuts? That seems a little excessive especially since they did not seem to be understaffed. And when the donuts came out they felt lukewarm like they had been sitting out for 10+ min which is a bit disappointing. Maybe there was something extra going on which is why I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. Great taste which is why I recommend it but maybe just go to the food truck next time?   Overall: 3.9 stars"

I love Hefeweizen and have drank my fair share while stationed in Germany for four years as well as here in the USA. This was the worst glass of Hefeweizen that I've ever had. It was very disappointing, tasted watered down, and had very little flavor. The Live Oak Brewing Company Hefeweizen is much better, and it's the best I've had in the Austin area. Other than that, the place was clean and the staff was friendly. Again, this review is solely based on their Cedrela Hefeweizen."

Only reason for the 4 starts is today we came for what had to be the 6th or 7th  time and got kicked to the outside patio for having a dog. This is ALWAYS the brewery I go to when it's hot because they allowed dogs inside. I've had every other bartender let my dog in, love on him and have had zero problem sitting inside with him. Even their Facebook has a picture of a dog inside. Today we were told that was never allowed and should have been told to go outside. We have also seen many other dogs inside during past visits. I hate inconsistent rules. Also, super sad that we'll have to find a new brewery this summer. It's too hot to be outside and my dogs nickname is the the brewery dog.  I'll still support them during cooler months-- but dog owners should know the rules have changed. Very sad. Wish they would have posted something about this change."

We got a selection of beers, I personally really enjoyed the Mango Crazy wheat beer and the Keyboard Gansta IPA. The service was also very friendly and they offered some samples if you are in between choices.   The taco truck outside was also very good! I highly recommend one of their loaded fries. The fries were perfectly crispy and tender in the middle, and super flavorful toppings. The tacos were also yummy and I'm a huge corn lover so the elote bowl was perfect.

                "description": "It's been a hot minute since I visited Whitestone- I think the last time I was here was in 2016, when it was quieter and a lot more laid back.  Fast forward to 2021 - the city of cedar park and Leander are booming.  There is a huge influx of population. The tables at Whitestone are full, there is a food truck (which is awesome) as a permanent fixture BUT the overall customer experience has left me disappointed.  Maybe because it's a Sunday with lovely weather, the guy behind the bar is done with people, or, he isn't a people person , or, he just didn't like the way I looked? But man was it hard to get him to give me an effing beer without getting hateful glances. Yeesh. Im kinda scared of coming back here now!  That aside, im not really a fan of their beer selection either - the kolsch is OK but I've had better. I guess the biggest advantage is the proximity to both CP and Leander and for the people who live around here.  So, this isn't much of a review rather than a semi rant ?   Also guys- kids have a tendency to move around from one side of the table to the other. They're not capable of sitting still and neither are you.

                "description": "We waited until Slackers released their own brews to visit. It's great to have another brewpub open in the CP area. Slackers is located hard off 620 in the same strip mall as Interstellar BBQ.Hmmmm BBQ and beer, OK.  Slackers currently have 3 Slacker brews available and a slew of local and not so local taps. Their Belgium lager is a perfect beer to sip on a sunny day.  Round 2 was a Brooklyn amber lager. This brought back memories of our NYC trip and discovering the Brooklyn Brewery. This is a great representation of what an amber beer should be.   There are alternatives to beer such as wine. Got the munchies they have you covered. Check out their menu online.  The brewpub is very welcoming with a bar area and plenty of seating. Games are available and even a foosball table. Outside there are a few picnic benches where you can enjoy the sunshine and bring your mutt. Folks on both sides of the bar are friendly and if you are there for more than 10 minutes you are engaged in a conversation with a fellow pubster (sic)  One nit servers should be able to answer questions regarding their guest taps.   A solid 4 plus stars and Slackers is now in our brewpub rotation. Support Local!"

Family friendly spot (a kids play area with kitchen and all!!),good music playlist and eventually some live music. They just have snacks right now but eventually said they'll have a menu. Oh yah and coffee too. We got to meet Derek and his wife, the owners. This is such a great spot to go and work or to relax at after work! Will definitely be back and can't wait to watch this business grow.  We were having so much fun I forgot to take pictures! I'll update with pictures next time I go."

I also felt kind of weird about asking for a flight but then being told uhhh we're not doing those right now- seemingly bc the line was long. It was odd.  Small indoor space, kind of lacking something aesthetically - compared to other Austin breweries.   Good truck onsite but it wasn't that good :/  Overall just meh!

I went for the Beer My Valentine's event and the Garrison Brothers bourbon-aged Convict Hill and Indy's coconut-flavored Midnight Paradise were my faves.  Tonight there was an open area for dancing and the food truck Killa Wasi was there. Really enjoyed our time there though the great event turnout made the beer line pretty long.

                "description": "Love me some authentic microbreweries.  I haven't been to a solid microbrew spot since moving to Austin, so this was such a breath of fresh air. It seems like there are plenty of breweries that also double as restaurants and music venues--which is cool, I'm all for that, but deep down I'm a plain microbrew kinda gal.  Getting here got me so excited as our GPS took us to industrial surroundings AKA the location of every great microbrewery. There is plenty of parking, and they had a yummy-smelling food truck parked outside, but we already ate so skipped that. My friend and I walked in and immediately felt the warm, relaxed energy that Independence had. I couldn't decide on what pint to get, so I settled on a taster set of four for $10. Not too pricey. The selections were not really in my favor, as I tend to go for wheats, belgians, juicy or hazy IPA's, or oatmeal stouts. However, I knew I would find something I'd like. One can never be too picky about beer.  They also have board games and free stickers! I love that!! Their logo is the lone star on black fire--super cool. Our taptender was a wonderful and friendly man. I just wish he would have been a little more wordy with his explanations of the beer profiles. I'd assume that microbreweries attract devout beer drinkers and self-proclaimed snobs (like myself), so I would love it if he was able to elaborate more. Anyhow, I will be back even with a larger group (yay picnic tables!), but I hope that they have more varieties of beer, or that they rotate their taps often."

Freak power is going for $2/pint right now! Honestly, you would be hard-pressed to find a deal this good anywhere in Austin TX. It's a hefe and goes down easily, very easy to drink.  My personal fav is the convict hill oatmeal stout, coming in at 8% and tastes like coffee. Also very easy to drink and is a nice addition in \"wintertime.\"  Good place, fair prices, decent selection!"

I don't know how hidden it is, but the first time I came, I was skeptical because it is tucked behind some businesses and inside a warehouse. However, once we discovered this great, laid-back brewery, we visit it at least monthly.  Our favorite activity is Thursday night trivia with Geeks who Drink there. We've been a few times and it's always fun! They allow outside food, so it's always fun to pick up some bites and enjoy their awesome beer as we Geek it to random trivia.  I highly recommend, especially on a Thursday night! Hope to compete against you soon!"

Beers listed on the wall, not that many options here but still good beers.  One of the beers I wanted to try ran out so they recommended another based on that selection. Good job, I liked it.  It was a bit sour, so it hit the mark.  But the one I liked the most was the End Credit Chocolate Hazelnut Porter. The hazelnut makes it smooth, and the chocolate flavor comes through as well.    The staff was cordial, not overly friendly, but it's patrons sure are. They made room for us to walk up an order, they asked what I had ordered, and made recommendations based on what they had already tried.  They had live music that day too.  Very entertaining, good set, he even dedicated a song to one of my friends.  Very cool!  They have games like chutes and ladders, Rock Trivia, Oversized Jenga, and more.  Beer and entertainment, can't go wrong with that!"

With awesome craft beer, great hipster service and entertainment usually on the weekends you will have an awesome time. Try the beers on special, but also try the ones that are mixtures between two beers they are special and only unique to this establishment. The bathrooms are clean and there are snacks by the register, but be sure to eat before you get here since some beers are heavy and you might get full which really isn't a bad thing, but good to know!"

I was a little taken back at how low in ABV their beers were but that isn't a deal breaker by any means. In fact, out of the entire selection on tap, only two were higher than 5% and they both happened to be a staggering 9%. The interior is nice and very spacious.  Cheers!"

It's a really large place and they set up picnic tables right outside the brewery.  The Sunday afternoon I went, I believe there was some event wrapping up. DJ was playing 90s RandB/Hip-Hop which contributed to the great vibe. All of their beers tasted amazing. I ended up going with their sour beer. Perfect balance of sourness and fruit. I would definitely come here again."

                "description": "Cool brewery tucked away in a wearhouse.  It can be a little hard to find from the road as it is behind retail.  But once you arrive, there is indoor and outdoor seating.  There are occasional food trucks.  Plenty of games including jenga.  I like the chill vibe.  This is a great place for an afternoon drink or three.  The bartenders know their stuff.  Ask as many questions as you like regarding the beer choices.  You can do tasting flights or go right to the pint.  I prefer the Stash IPA which is one of my local favorites.  Other beers are good too.  Can't go wrong here."

                "description": "When I was visiting friends in Austin last month, a friend and I decided to hit up a local brewery for a couple of hours (it's a tradition of ours). I had to pick up my brother at the airport after, so I was looking for a place that was southeast, so Independence fit the bill. When I lived in Austin, I used to drink Independence beers all the time, but I never made it out to the brewery. I was impressed! It's really large! Tables inside and tables outside. They have several beers to choose from. The line for the bathroom was REALLY long, but we happened to choose a day that had an event (puppy adoptions I think) and it was PACKED. All in all, good beers, they were playing good music, and I had a great time with my friend! Great afternoon, and I'd go again!"

We've been wanting to stop in here for some time and I'm so glad we finally did! The beer is tasty, I only had a few sips since I'm driving but next time I'm pounding some brews! However the pizza!! Omg!! Now that was delicious! I ate half the pie to myself and sadly I feel I could have ate the whole thing haha the crust is chewy crispy, the sauce tastes freshly made, the cheese actually has that cheese flavor and not some pre shredded cheese bs! Oh and the pepperoni!! It was so flavorful!!  Now for the atmosphere! As soon as we walked in we were greeted with smiling faces!! Everyone was so friendly!! I swear this is the first place in Texas that I felt truly welcomed!!"

                "description": "There is a lot that is planned for this place. Well, that's what I was told. Certainly has a cool canvas to work with.  The beer is good. There are lots of shiny distractions on the menu, for sure, but there are some solid entries as well.   The food is nothing amazing. It's just ok. And wow what a wasteful process to give everyone a pizza box. I guess you are not offering the pan it was cooked on or some other dish you don't need to wash or dispose of, and I'm sure they are recyclable, but you just have one trash, so what's the point. Maybe you are saving water instead of trees.   The events are cool, fun stuff. And like I said, a great space for it.   The bartender/manager guy is very snooty, but I guess if he is that proud of the place, that's good for him. You just get the feeling he'd care less if you were there or not. I can pretty easily choose not to go just to not need to deal with that.   But, I'll be back."

You treat a customer with respect and gratitude, guess what they will be coming back.. think of all the repeat customers you losing out on, because of your rude staff...  Do appreciate small business, but if you dont even care about yours and really improving the overall customer experience, why should you...  Setting yourself up for disaster.

Then you just walk up and place your order. I ordered the Pilsner, and I can't remember what my boyfriend got and we also ordered some garlic knots. They have indoor and outdoor seating, you just have to walk around the building. We chose to sit indoors and watch the football game, wasn't too long before our food was ready and it was bread-tastic!!!! There is so much flavor, I would definitely order again it... I cannot wait to try more of their food and come back for more chill vibes! Thanks for the awesome experience Suds Monkey!!"

I really liked the addition of the cinnamon stick, it added the perfect amount of \"winter\" vibe to the drink to match the cool weather.

That's where the compliments stop. Everything else about our experience was wanting, starting with the GRUMPY woman who helped us at the bar. We ordered the burger--they were out (thanks for letting us know!). The winter smash cocktail tasted like it had zero whiskey in it and was poured from a spout. The IPA on draft was fine. The food that we did end up getting was only OK. The cucumber salad was runny and mealy, and the chopped brisket sandwich seemed like it could have been tasty that morning but by 5-whatever pm, it was dry as hell. We also didn't get the BBQ sauce that it was served with (our friends did for theirs). Our kid's quesadilla was standard. And bagged chips galore!  Also, they close at 6:00 pm. On a Sunday before a holiday. OK, fine, bad business, but you do you! Here's what's not cool: coming over to our table hot and heavy and telling us you're closing in five minutes with an attitude and demanding our food trays. We're happy to be accommodating! You just don't need to be jerks about it. If you've had a long day and just can't handle the customer service, then have enough self-awareness to ask a coworker to do the corralling.  Honestly, we went over to Fitzhugh afterwards which had good food (desserts at least), better service, a better play area for the kids, and we had way more fun there. We'd love to try Treaty Oak again, but we need to have enough time to forget the less savory aspects of our experience."

                "description": "Whiskey, whiskey, and more whiskey! I've been to vineyards for wine tastings, but never to a distillery until now. The experience is similar. They have a tasting room with well-versed, educated servers who can give you the lowdown on the various whiskeys available. My guy and I are not whiskey drinkers, but we really enjoyed tasting and learning about the process.  The grounds are clean and well maintained with ample parking. There's a large restaurant with bar service as well. We went out to hear a band one Saturday afternoon, and hang out before the blistering summer sun hits central Texas. The venue is family-friendly- there were lots of kids, and dogs, picnic tables, frisbees flying, and balls being thrown. You can bring along your own camp chair too. I did love that they had flushing toilets and not just port-a-potties. Thank you! You can also tour the distillery itself. I'd highly recommend checking this place out whether your a whiskey connoisseur or a novice. Let me know if you do! Cheers!"

                "description": "Took my second trip out to treaty oak and was not disappointed with the day spent here. Treaty Oak is the kind of place that you want to spend the entire day at, and you totally can! What I love about it too is that it's a massive space with so much to do while on the grounds. It even has a playground where the kids can play, and an indoor space with plenty of TVs to watch football on game day.  We started off with a tasting, which you can either do Gin or Whiskey. I actually highly recommend the tasting, it's only $10 a person but gives some great background on how each different flavor/bottle is created and made. You also can put the $10 towards a bottle if you end up wanting to buy one to take home.  We then went into the bar area and got drinks, which is a huge variety of cocktails! They have plenty of picnic tables, and multiple boards for cornhole on the grounds. The restaurant on site it BBQ and was amazing! We got the brisket sandwich and pork sandwich and loved them both. What I also loved about it, was that there's multiple places where you can get drinks, foods, etc. on the grounds but your tab stays open for everything. Love this place and highly recommend making a day trip out of it if you haven't been!"

We had the white sangria... which was just perfect for a summer afternoon with some brisket nachos that were yum yum yum! The kiddo had a blueberry lemonade with mac n cheese that disappeared in so little time. He couldn't stop exclaiming how good it was.  We'll definitely be back to try out the cocktail bar for a date night.  They didn't have live music but they were playing music of varying genre throughout the evening. Great way to relax and leave your stresses behind."

                "description": "I want to give this business a better review but unfortunately they had some major issues.  We went last weekend on Sunday and there was a sign to scan the QR code the for menu, we waited in a long line to order food, once everyone got to the cashier she told us that only the brunch menu was being served (it was like 2pm or something).   So everyone had to quickly change their order!   Talk about poor communication!! It should say on the menu very clearly what's being served.   Then, I tried to order vegetarian nachos but my cashier told me they were sold out of beans and that I should just get chips and queso instead, so I did. THEN my brother in law who ordered after me got his nachos which were vegetarian bean nachos (not meat like he ordered). I said \"they told me they were sold out!\" Again, bad communication.  Then, my brother in law ordered sangria and got a big pitcher, my dad went to order the same thing and they gave him HALF the size. So weird and confusing.   This place seems very confused internally and each worker seems to have their own message.  Also nothing for gluten-free vegans on the menu."

                "description": "Treaty Oak Distillery in Dripping Springs is a great Texas distillery getting most things to make their bourbon and gin from around Texas. It has great covered patios and outdoor space throughout the property with a delicious restaurant- Alice's Restaurant, a tasting room, and a covered bar/lounge as well as an outdoor stage and small playground. We did the tour and tasting which allowed us to see the inner workings of the distillery. Cody was an excellent tour guide answering all our random questions as he showed us around the distillery. And I bought an old barrel, which I have wanted in my house for quite some time. I would highly recommend you get over there...today! Such a great time. Thanks Treaty Oak!!"

So much space for you, your kids, and your dog! Bring the family! LoL  It was actually recommended to me at my last stop, and I love me some bourbon and whiskey so it was a no brainer. However, if bourbon isn't your thing they also have options for the gin, vodka and non alcoholic lovers in your group! Something for everyone I'd say!   That being said, I took off a star mostly because the line was stupid long. They definitely could have, and should have had more than just one single file line for us to get a drink, I spent half my time in line.   That being said though, once I got my drink and was able to enjoy the drink and the vibe it was great! They have live music and a restaurant if you get hungry and I ended up getting the day tripper drink! I loved it, it was so good. I will definitely be back!"

If you don't get the brisket nachos, you're making the biggest mistake of your life. But don't eat too much, or you'll be too full for the delicious drinks!

Even if you're not buying a mixed drink or anything that requires work other than handing you a bottle and paying for it you have to stand in the line that's serving cocktails and drinks.   Further, when you do get service, it's been rather dismissive the last few times we went. Expect to spend time there- no way to quickly pop in, grab merch and a bottle and leave."

Just about 30-40 minutes outside of Austin lies this beautiful distillery. There's so much space and more than enough seating but even on the weekends this place can get pretty busy. As for food you can expect Texas bbq from this place as I tried both the brisket and Turkey which were both very good. If your not a booze person they also have their own in house wines and beer but if you do like a good cocktail I'd recommend hill country dreaming. Im anticipating come back here to check this place out in the evening for some live music or Sunday brunch!"

Parking was ample and so were the picnic tables! We didn't do a tour but put our name in for lunch at the restaurant, Alice's. It was about a thirty minute wait on a Saturday around 1, which really went unnoticed because we just grabbed drinks at the Cocktail Bar and sat in the open seating area until they called us saying it was ready. There was live music, lots of space and tables , cornhole, and you could go do a distillery tour too.   The bartenders were helpful in finding a gluten free drink option for me, as well as our waitress at Alice's. Our waitress was especially friendly and attentive--didn't get her name but a recent HS grad going to UT! She made sure to ask about gluten and dairy free options for me, and there were plentiful. Everyone devoured their food and were happily satisfied. I had a delicious club sandwich on gluten free bread with some salt and pepper chips. SO good. I also loved the white sangria.   All in all, I am so glad we found it and the bride said it was the perfect way to spend our day. We definitely will be back!"

I'd been invited out there for a friends birthday and the idea of heading all the way to Dripping Springs on a hot Saturday afternoon to try bourbon (which in general all tastes like burning to me) wasn't really my idea of a great time. Man, I was wrong. First off, they have a wide selection of spirits, everything from gin and vodka to wine and beer. The setting is bucolic with wide open spaces and clusters of shade trees. A friendly staff, great bbq (try the brisket nachos) and some tasty signature cocktails (try the Pineapple Express) made for a great afternoon that turned into a lovely evening.

It's a relaxed, family/dog friendly environment with counter service, with a huge patio that's connected to the brewery next door.    We arrived a little after 9am and only had to wait in line for about five minutes.  The food was great--here's what we tried: -Cauliflower tots: A fun, savory treat that's exactly what it sounds like.  It actually reminds me of cauliflower gnocchi from Trader Joes, but more fried.  Good appetizer -French toast: Delicious, and I'd say that it's more like bread pudding because it's super moist and is drenched (in a good way) with whatever sweet batter.   -Chicken biscuit: A perfect little breakfast entree, and I liked the salsa that came with the fried chicken and biscuit."

                "description": "Went there for an early morning brunch. Food was not great. Everything was brown: brown donut holes, brown french toast, brown crumbles, brown cauliflower tots. Nothing felt fresh or bright unless it was a salad. I mean, they could add strawberries or blueberries to those dishes I mentioned as they were overly rich. Everything was super sweet. Some fresh creme or custard to lighten up the sweetness would help. The dipping sauce for the donut holes was like dipping into caramel. It was not needed at all unless you have a 4 year old sugar freak with you. My friend was in the mood for a cheesecake and they were out of it along with other desserts on the menu except for (brown) cookies. I have no idea how this place is so popular. It does have a nice backyard and their brewery neighbor (Holdout) is a fun so you have that option if you're in the area. I would recommend getting their food. For people watching I'm not sure why there were some with travel bags. I wouldn't make the place the first or last stop if I was visiting Austin. There are plenty of options.  I understand the whole staffing issue and people there look glazed. I think management either needs to hire more people to help or give these people some sort of morale boost. They just were not friendly or give off positive vibes. They were just zombies running food to your table.  I don't write negative reviews to stop people from going but want management know they need to adjust some things to make it a better experience."

It's a danish stuffed with pork and cheese with shredded coconut on top. A yummy mouthful of savory sweet and saltiness. A must get if youre there in the morning!! I knocked a few stars off because of 2 things.  First the hit or miss service. The staff were either friendly or would act as if you were bothering them. The other is because I bought a tshirt which I saw on their website for $25. When I checked my receipt I was charged $30.  Granted I should have asked the price but didnt see any reason why it would cost more in person. Overall if in that  Austin neighborhood again I would go back ."

They said that the food would take 45 minutes to an hour, it came out in 5-10 minutes! Super fast. Good queso. Great breakfast sandwich - very messy to eat, expect to get your fingers dirty. Salad was okay, large portion size was good, sweet potato chunks were too large for a salad. Cold brew was not good, recommend getting a different coffee drink. I would definitely come back because it was a chill spot with good food and cheap prices.   Pros: good food, affordable   Cons: no tvs on patio, cold brew wasn't good"

                "description": "Wonderful, flavorful brunch spot. We went very early about 8:30am and it was perfect. We sat outside at a table as we visited last year. Very empty that early and everything still in stock! I enjoy that they have a more limited menu because they focus on every dish being a homerun. Quality food and drinks!  This place(and the brewery) get extremely busy so I recommend a reservation or going earlier instead of peak brunch times. Very pet and kid friendly. We didn't see our server much, but luckily we didn't need much and she was great when we did need her.   Softest cake donut I've ever had and a rich chocolate taste almost more of a dessert than brunch but that's right up my alley! Menu seems to change quite a bit by the season, so I can't wait to try more different plates. We'll definitely be back with friends and family visiting."

                "description": "I love this spot!  I love their coffee and their healthy but tasty food options.  I really love their cauliflower bites with beet ketchup and their lattes. They had homemade syrups which I love- I think they taste less gummy and more natural. My mom and I both got the breakfast sandwich, the English muffin definitely tastes homemade too! And we got a salad- great quality and fresh ingredients. We also got their chocolate chip cookie- it was so chocolate and gooey  theres an inside and outdoor space plus a brewery next door. The. Chef does the better half for breakfast and lunch then hops over to do the brewery's food in the evening. Overall a cute, quality spot! Also pretty quick- so you can't beat that!"

                "description": "Lovely (and popular) spot to get brunch, but they are BUSY! Expect a 2-hour wait if you come during a peak time.  Better Half has ample outdoor seating (and cute pink picnic tables!). I loved their lemonade and cauliflower tots - they were the star of the show. Otherwise, I didn't feel like the food justified the extremely long wait, I would say their menu is pretty on par with other brunch places in the area - it was nothing too special.   I did have a great time here am willing to give them another try at an off peak time! The indoor area was super trendy and ccozy"

                "description": "This pandemic has taken us all for a ride. The folks at Better Half had a nice and cozy building then a worldwide pandemic hit that required you to avoid that.exact.environment.  And they rolled with it.   On several occasions, we used their pickup and it was great. They were efficient, considerate (all the utensils and napkins) and the food was always good considering we would eat it while parked at Zilker.  Well, we finally decided to eat there this time. They have an awesome covered...tent or something, that fits up to 60 folks. They even had a heater blowing in that thing!!  And the food, whew. The grilled halloumi plate was so creative, we loved the mix of flavors. The spicy chicken sandwich was different than at other places, in a good way. I left trying to place all the flavors and can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu.  A cool bonus is the view from the parking lot. I was able to take a quick picture."

I guess that's how all places are, right?   Love the chicken biscuits. Always get it with donut holes.  The cocktails and coffee are great. I love the little canned cocktails.   One of my favorite brunch spots in Austin.  Dinner is super underwhelming. Can't recommend coming for late eats."

The coffee was decent, but I just couldn't get over how small the better half brunch sandwich was. I will say the backyard outdoor seating is really nice as there's some huge trees and the vibes are good, but the sand which didn't really have anything special to it.   Overall disappointed despite the hype around this place."

                "description": "We walked down to this restaurant recently because we were craving a burger, a beer, and a safe place to enjoy them during the pandemic. Better Half has added a ton of outdoor dining areas and some are even under a tent.   The burger? It was just okay. Kind of small. A bit overdone, a bit dry for me, but then I have high expectations. The fries were crispy and salty and hit the spot.  The Hold Out Brewing beer was lovely, too.   The surroundings? They were outside, so perhaps harder to maintain but the table was sticky and when I got home there were dirt marks on my pants from where I sat on the outside bench.  It was too bad because it is so convenient, but perhaps we will give it another try in a month or two. Maybe it is a better breakfast choice"

The portion was smaller than expected but the food was really good - the had browns were crispy and the Parmesan with the sunny side up egg paired really well with their gravy. I liked how the pickled onions added a sour kick to the gravy, but preferred the dish without the onions.   Would definitely come again and sit outdoors, if the weather permits!"

Parking was also relatively easy since they have their own parking lot. They have happy hour Tues-Fri and Sunday 3-6pm, with $6 burgers! They also have reverse happy hour 9-10pm daily (also $6 burgers). The patio is very dog friendly and there is a self-serve water jug as well to help yourself. The food was delicious and a good portion for the price."

We went on Labor Day so it was quite busy and took probably a good 40 minutes to get our food, but it was absolutely worth every minute of the wait.  The Pastrami Sandwich had the best, smokiest pastrami I've ever had and everything from the mushrooms to the bread to the berbere horseradish sauce was just so well executed and damn delicious.   The Big Springy salad was a nice healthier contrast that still tasted interested and decadent (okaay, we added fried chicken, that might not be the healthiest). It was a little light on the cojita-chimichurri dressing so we got some more, and I just wanted to jello shot that condiment cup straight into my mouth it was so good.  I started off with the chagacinno and while it was a tad sweet for my preference, it was still absolutely delicious as well."

I absolutely love the backyard patio vibes - seems like a very chill spot to just hang out and chat.  I don't really recommend coming here to study or do work as this place can get quite rowdy. The same owners also opened a brewery right next doors called Hold Out Brewing, so you can slowly transition from productivity to drunken stupor if that's your thing."

                "description": "Better Half Coffee and Cocktails belongs in the book of Austin AF restaurants. What does that even mean? Innovative menu using fresh ingredients with high prices.   Our table of 3 split the entrees and shared as easy apps to get the full experience of the brunch AND lunch menu. For brunch, we ordered the Waffle Iron Hashbrown, which was literally a plate of overcooked hashbrowns, topped with coffee and cream gravy, cotija cheese, an egg, pickled onions and scallions. Sadly, this was just basic to me (or as Gen Z calls it Cheugy). Nothing that I would die for...  For lunch, we ordered the Vermicelli Salad, the Chilled Ramen, and a side of the Cauliflower Tots. I could not get enough of the Vermicelli Salad and strangely the Cauliflower Tots! The Vermicelli Salad was refreshing and light, and I enjoyed the Pineapple \"Fish\" Sauce substitute they use to make this dish vegan friendly!! The Cauliflowers admittedly looked like burnt bite-sized toast when it arrived, but as soon as I dipped it in the beet ketchup, I couldn't put my fork down.   BEWARE! If you order any of the Frozen Sloppee Frozen Cocktails, this thing will mess you up (in the best form possible). I would advise ordering with caution! The Spicy Peach'arita was my poison of choice, and though delicious, if you add Texas heat, it will melt fast and have you only tasting tequila!"

Inside, there are also ping pong tables . There is a coffee shop within the same building.  Next to here is a brewery that you can also get beer from. There is the Spicy Boys food truck on site for snacks while you drink. I think it's a good place to check out if you like ciders and are in the area.

It's very laid back, intimate, and relaxing with its clean aesthetic. Down in South Atx, we have Texas Keeper (awesome cidery, very different fireflies-on-the-porch and farmside vibes), so it was nice to see a completely different cidery with literally garage-space, elevated, and hipster vibes.   We both got cider flights, and loved the diversity of selections. Their ciders are all hilariously named (Fuccboisen is my favorite...I should've ordered that). I enjoyed their Smell the Van and EZ Tea (it truly tastes like tea!). The EZ tea was so delicious. Quenches thirst, subtle, and very honey-like. Their ciders aren't sickeningly sweet, and the flights give you a great little taste of all of the ciders that you're curious about but are unsure about getting a whole pint of. Their inventory has a clean design too. Their tees are super adorable, as well as their BEVERAGES sweaters. Tempting.  Service was wonderful. Our cider taptender was a wonderful man who was very sweet, knowledgeable and welcoming. The space is small, so it's not recommended you come here with a huge group (unless you plan on taking up the entire space. They have strong wifi, serve-yourself water, and different styles of seating from regular tables to taller barstools. They have little succulents on the table along with a well-designed menu for their \"specials\" deals. I would usually go to 4th Tap next door, but why not do both and hit up Fairweather too?"

If you're here at 11am, which would you pick? Why not both? Good vibes, good music, and a great atmosphere.  Bartenders are super friendly. I like it here! Check out 4th Tap and the pizza truck outside as well!"

But, after some friends who are also beerdrinkers suggested this place and that it wasn't your typically overly-sweet cider (which is what I have the aversion to) suggested this place, I decided \"why not?\".  The vibe here is super chill and the cider-barista was super nice and everyone there chimed in when I asked about the diff ciders they were offering.   So I will say, while I am still not on the cider bandwagon (I mean beer will always be my first love), the ciders here were actually drinkable! I enjoyed that they were on the drier side so your mouth isn't annihilated by chocolate and you can actually appreciate the different flavor components of each one! I will also give them kudos for actually packing a little bit of a punch w/the abv, which you don't usually see with ciders either!  Definitely enjoyed the vibe and the concept here!"

                "description": "So many good things to say. I first and foremost am not a cider guy. Came in here on a referral from a friend and was surprisingly impressed with the operation. The cider was good they had some crisp ciders that came off more like a beer if that's what you need. My favorite was the blood orange or the pear. Still a toss up between the two. Also this place has some crazy good wines. They are cheap for a much better quality compared to the ones you get in most stores. They had football running great AC for that Texas heat. Best of all they allow dogs! When I came in my novice skills when drinking wine and ciders were put aside by the owner who gave me a great understanding and tour of his selections. The staff are all super friendly too!  There are no downsides to this place. Except for the hangovers. (Mostly self inflicted) I recommend Sundays. For your visit. There is a cool little coffee shop inside too. Nervous Charlie's was serving up brunch. Soo many good combinations outside of your regular mimosa routine. Do yourself a favor. You are not too cool to break away from your traditions to try this place.  In regards to the cider snobs leaving bad reviews. They obviously didn't come here for something new. Why would you want to go somewhere that copied someone else? Boring.... wish they could get more stars."

                "description": "First ACTUALLY dry cider I have had while in Texas. Please do yourself a favor and visit this tap room.  It all started with a long wait for barbecue and a guy wearing a cidery shirt/hat. A quick google search later I dragged my family to this tap room so I could get a cider fix (having spent five years in the PNW it is a tough itch to scratch here in TX). The bartender/coowner was extremely friendly and ready to answer all questions. He was adorable and alone was reason enough for a follow up visit.  My sister and I had a flight of their four ciders on tap. Currently:  Common: base for all other cider, ACTUALLY DRY. In lurv Tejano dreams: green chile cider, bomb af. Strong pepper aroma and beautiful subtle Chile flavor. Nelson sauvin (I think).... very strong hop flavor forward with sweet cider finish. A good balance for people seeking hop flavor while trying to expand to cider. huell melon: hop flavor is SO subtle that it almost tastes like sour fruit flavor. I LOVED this cider. I can't wait to try it again.  Opens only Fri-Sun this is definitely a stop to add to your weekend plans. There are big things coming for this cidery. I can't wait to watch them grow.  I loved this cidery and cider and definitely recommend to anyone in the area."

I think a coffee shop was attached too but it was closed at night. We got two samplers and honestly it's hard to pick a fave and the flavors were fun!   Great place to hang out and have some drinks. *went in the fall! Plan to be be back this spring since the doors will be open * fingers crossed**"

                "description": "I really love Fairweather's concept and having a new addition to Metric Row that isn't another brewery! (Love to y'all breweries, though.)  I came here the day after opening day with a few friends who love cider (I'm indifferent) to try out their brews. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised!  We each ordered a flight of their four ciders on tap. One was the Common, which is the base for all their ciders. Another was one of my favorites even though it involved a little heat from some peppers! The last two were hopped ciders, and the bartender/co-owner told us if we tried them first in different orders, we may like one over the other. He was right, both both were delightful.  I want to give a five-star review to support a new business, but my only tiny complaint would be the fruit flies. Some kept buzzing about here and there, but you can only imagine they want to get a taste of this dry cider sweetness!  If you're a beer person like me, you may have found a new hangout for your friends who don't love beer as much as you. But you'll still enjoy what Fairweather has to offer -- so much so, I ordered a 12-oz pour of my favorite hopped cider after my flight!  Good luck, guys, and congrats on your opening!"

                "description": "Fairweather was a surprise find for me thanks to the wise owner of Sunrise Mini Mart.  That guy knows SO much about all different types of distilled liquids, I wish I had a brain that could store that much knowledge.   I digress, this review is about the awesome family who started Fairweather (super friendly and knowledgeable).  I bought their cans of Common and was blown away.  Cideries claim to have dry cider all the time, but it's not TRULY dry.  Common though was legit.  These guys are making a truly BONE DRY English style cider from apples sourced from the PNW.   It's not perfect yet, but you can taste the potential. It reminds me of Shacksbury.  The fun artwork on the can intrigued me to go check out this spot that was just a few minutes drive away.  The tasting room is TINY! Start small and dream big! Kuddos to them for turning a cold warehouse space into a fun modern hipster community watering hole.  On a Friday night, get here early to even find a spot to sit!  I arrived around 5:30pm and sat at a high table outside and had no line.  By 7pm, people were crowded elbow to elbow, with a long line.  There also is very limited parking.  Be prepared to take time to find a spot and walk.  When they state they are pet friendly they mean it. Not only was my furry friend chilling with others, we were soon joined by a parrot!  I had a great time. I had come by myself, but ended up having several great conversations with people I had never met before.  Truly this place is only months old, and has quickly become a new neighborhood hang out.  The ciders are all 6.5%.  You can enjoy a flight of 4x4OZ for $10, enjoy a glass, or enjoy a guest cider or something from Austin Winery. I love the local support for other local liquid makers. There is a wide range of ciders to choose from.  They have some fun experimental ciders that were not like anything I have tried before.  It's hard to choose just four for a flight.  They have their staples- Common, EZ TEA, and Tejano Dreams, but also some Dry Hopped Ciders, and fruit ciders. My favorites were Tejano Dreams (nice kick), Gin Bot, and Dr. Rudi."

You can get a flight or by the glass. If you are usually a beer drinker or new to ciders, they will definitely let you try a few so you can find your favorite.   If you are hungry, there are usually food trucks at 4th tap and they let you bring food in. It is not officially dog friendly but sometimes they have a table outside when the garage is open."

Their cider is so amazing with fusions with sweet tea, gin, wine and different fruits, it'll definitely give you a pleasant experience you may not have been expecting. They also have so many more flavor options than what they offer in the store so id go to the cider for more options. You can also take pictures in front of the interesting wall art with the unicorn things going on."

                "description": "This taproom has a very minimalistic and industrial aesthetic that makes it a perfect place to catch up with a friend. It's quite small, but there was ample seating when I was there. Their cider is different from most of the dry ones I've had before - my favorite was the common with citrus-y flavors. The Apple flavor wasn't as strong as I was expecting (or used to with other ciders), and maybe that's just the case with a \"true\" dry cider. It tasted almost like a wine, which is great if you're a wine lover, I suppose!"

I'll never understand why a server would bring the appetizer with the entree. I also heard complaints from adjacent tables about incorrect orders.  The food is overpriced. It's pub grub. It's not even good pub grub. The chicken was over cooked and dry. The house made chips were stale and greasy.  The beer/wine list is average at best. The two \"house brews\" I tried weren't bad but nothing to overcome everything else.  Overall it's just overpriced bad service and food in a beautiful setting."

They have covered seating under a pavilion which is equipped with heaters and fans for any time of year. They have some uncovered seating as well and a mini amphitheater vibe for live music. They also have picnic tables on the grass and a ton of room for kids to run wild and free. They are dog friendly outside. Today we opted for the back patio and had the pleasure of being helped by Aniya. She has such a kind, gentle, and engaging energy. She impressed me with her knowledge of both the bar and food menu down to knowing the size of the pours. Aniya also had some killer recommendations! If you're in the area, you've got to try them out and ask for Aniya!"

Great service, great outdoors... good filtered water... yes I can tell...  I will be back to try out patio and bar in the very near future!  Would love to try more items on the menu. And I did tell Angel I would be back to see her... I love that it's dog friendly and the outdoor seating is amazing... love the string lights... good ambiance... clean bathrooms...

We had an excellent server and really liked the \"Snug\" we sat in.  The seating options are pretty and a unique feature actually.   Seating: Large tables, small tables, \"Snugs\"(private little cubby with plenty of room), bar seating, outdoor tables and cozy seating around a fireplace outside.   The food: Pretzel w/ dipping trio. Yes! These are excellent w/ an awesome sourdough flavor.  The fish and chips was pretty good. Great batter with a ton of flavor in it. The pizza (ordered without the pepperoni). The dough was under proved and under cooked. Ok at best.  The irish stew was pretty to look at but had none of the heart or depth of flavor that you'd expect from a stew. My soul was craving a hot heart stew, no luck. Disappointing.   Drinks: No wells here!! Just a quality selection of excellent wines and spirits.   We'll definitely be back and try a new selection of foods! If you're looking for a place to visit/meet up, this is a great venue. Plentyyyyyy of room!!"

I want to start off by saying I hadn't eaten breakfast, lunch, or dinner prior to arriving there which you could only imagine I was hangry(hungry + angry)    So I park my car and Soon as I step on the curb to make my way towards the door the hostess had already opened the door and was greeting my wife and I with a warm and friendly greeting.   As a manager myself, I always preached that our customers should never have to touch the door and I was so glad to see this establishment have the same values about it as I do.   We sat down and in no time our waiter Homer was at our table greeting us. I must say he was very personable. He truly grasp the concept of building rapport with his customers.   The food came out pretty quick which was a huge plus because a I stayed before I was \"Hangry\"  My fries were cold, but then again they're fries so I just asked for some fresh ones that had some heat to it lol.  My wife order the 8HR Braised Short Rib and she stated it was just ok.  I asked for lemon pepper wings, My receipt shows that's what I got, but I can tell you that want what came in my plate. Was I made about it NO, why you ask? Because whatever the heck it was taste pretty darn good. I should have asked what was I given because I wouldn't mind ordering it again.  My fish and chips was freaking AMAZING and whatever little SAUCE they give you to dip you food into.... AMAZING!!! make sure you ask for extra so you get enough to dip your fries in it to lol. My wife tried my fish and chips and said she couldn't wait to come back to get that next time.   On our way out the door the host struck again with grabbing the door for us and she did it with a smile. As I was walking my way to the car another employee told me how much they appreciated our business and I'm thinking to myself write your done working your on your way to your own car to head home and you still take the time out to make is feel special. I feel that the friendly service has us excited to come back and eat here again and we are looking forward to it."

It's the only time I'm down to go to a pub - I'm not a beer person but I love a good beer battered Irish fish and chips. The only way I'd take beer.  The place is gorgeous, spacious (big groups are welcome!)  We wished we didn't have to leave. Their back patio is beautifully by a creek. They also control the mosquitoes which could ruin any patio dining experience for me. It's a win all around!  I can't wait to come back to this piece of Ireland in Round Rock, the managers told us that a lot of their restaurant decor are from Ireland shipped here. That's pretty personal and lovely in my book."

                "description": "Was very excited to try this place because of the pictures we saw online. Coming into it, it actually looked very casual like a sports bar almost. We meant to come in for quick lunch. However, quick it was not. We waited 45 minutes before we said anything. The server kept coming to us and saying \"your food will be right out\" every 10 minutes but nothing more. We saw people getting food after us which raised concerns so we asked our waiter who just said \"its coming\"  and finally asked to see to a manager. Manager came and explained that the cook dropped the food and had to remake it.  In conclusion, we told them that we would have wanted them communicate that to us from the start so we knew why others got their food first. The manager just shrugged it off and we were so upset that we couldn't even finish our food. Thumbs down on service and management."

                "description": "This place has so much potential but on my visit it was a total and complete disaster.    Parking - Small parking lot for the size of the venue, saw a sign that said additional parking at Dell diamond which is a good ways up the street.  They do not have any valet parking. I ended up parking at the R Bank lot (about 1/2 between the two spots) that had a sign that said towing was enforced from 5p - 8A but we were assured they had an arrangement and that we would not be towed. It worked out but still was quite a hike.  Atmosphere and decor  The architecture and furnishings are outstanding and really are enticing.  Round Rock does not have many restaurants of this style. The place is packed and you need to make a reservation.  We sat by the window in the bar, a little after 630 and we were baking because of the heat. The air conditioning was not working well enough to keep everyone comfortable, several in our party were visibly sweating.  Adding ceiling fans and putting some type of treatment on the windows would help considerably, this is only going to get worse as summer temperatures begin to return to the 100 +.  The windows face the west,  Service  They are terribly understaffed. Typically for a new restaurant, owners over staff and make sure that the service is beyond good. The service here was beyond bad. Our server was working her tail off and trying to maintain her very large group of tables.  Everything was taking too much time.  There were large gaps of time between ordering and receiving, especially on the drinks.  Two of our rounds were forgotten and upon reminding our server, she quickly darted to the bar and then returned in short order.  Sadly, some of the drinks were no longer chilled and cold  but warm - obviously has been sitting unattended for some period of time.  Drinks  The drinks were overpriced. For example, a vodka martini (Tito's) small demanded a $15 price tag. As mentioned above, the drink was warm and did not taste good at all.  The typical turnaround from placing an order for drinks to receiving them was at least 10 minutes.  On the positive side they have some unique drinks on the menu, an old fashion that comes to the table actually smoking, when they remove the cover. A neighboring table ordered one and it was quite the sight.  Again, some great potential, but because of under staffing and other issues they fall short.  Food  Several of my dining companions had been here before and strongly recommended the Reuben sandwich, saying when they had it a few weeks ago it was fantastic and perhaps one of the best they had ever had eaten. Well, for me, not so much.  The meat was not sliced well, was chunky and tough, the Reuben arrived luke warm and did not taste all that great.    Others in my dining party, ordered the pretzel appetizer and the pepperoni pizza.  The food met expectations, but nothing spectacular.  The dipping sauces for he pretzel were unique - beer cheese, red wine tarragon butter and a garlic cream cheese.  They asked for some small plates, everyone of the plates had to be wiped clean.     One dining companion ordered the charred vegetables.  We were all surprised at the how small the serving was for the $14 price tag - and the comment was they were over charred.    They do have a patio that does not take reservations and seating is first come first serve.  The bar and food are different from the indoor main venue.  Interestingly, they have a food truck that is serving a different menu from what is inside."

                "description": "First of all, the place is beautiful inside and out. That's the main sell 100%. The food is good and so are the drinks but a little overpriced for their outdoor menu. A guiness draught at any type of irish pub shouldn't go for $9 nor any bar for that matter in my opinion. All food and drink prices could be $1-2 less, especially if it's a limited outdoor menu. If we were dining in (and it's beautiful inside + full menu offered), I could see those prices being fair. If the drinks were to be $1-2 less in the future, we could see ourselves being regulars, but definitely not until then.  Two of our friends ordered the wagyu burger, when asked on how it compares to a non-wagyu burger, they said they wouldn't have noticed anything especially different to a regular burger in comparison if they had not read the menu.  Nonetheless, they seemed to enjoy it.   I would order the reuben sandwich again with the kimchi slaw. I thought the kimchi slaw was very creative and it added nice flavor contrast to the otherwise classical meaty cheesy aspects of the reuben. The kimchi by itself was good, they use older more fermented kimchi, which gave the sandwich a bit of sourness to it.   My wife ordered the fish n' chips, one of her favorite barfoods. The fish itself was very moist and tender and it appears much larger in portion size than what we were expecting when looking at other user's yelp photos. The chile-lime tartar sauce wasn't very 'chile-limey' at all, it tasted just like regular tartar sauce, don't get me wrong - we LOVE any tartar sauce, but they could dial up the chile and lime all the way to the moon if that's what they're advertising.   Lastly, the staff was nice, although our waitress basically dissappeared for the second half of our stay and kept forgetting/taking an unquestionably and questionably long time to get our drinks and takeout box. Service was just OK, there is always next time.   Bonus points for the restrooms, very neat, clean and well decorated."

The Fish and Chips  and Reuben Sandwich are delicious and portions generous. The craft beer is also the best (Huckleberry wheat).  Plus the place is filled with great atmosphere, and plenty of history. Our server (Jewels) pointed out the wall plaques located all along the restaurant filled with tidbits of information. This contributes to the experience. The music is great and staff friendly. A very happy place! We drove from South Austin to visit, definitely retuning soon!"

                "description": "Pinthouse is my go to pizza and salad place. My mom and I discovered this place when we were looking for restaurants with gluten free options and I'm so glad we gave it a try.  To start off, I got the Pinthouse chop salad. This has to be the best darn chopped salad I've ever had. All of the ingredients were adequately chopped up and had just the right amount of dressing. I daydream about how good this salad is.  I also ordered the honey pear pizza on gluten free crust and WOW- what a genius combination! The sweet pears complement the prosciutto, balsamic, and basil so well. It was like a symphony in my mouth.   I love the patio area- just the right amount of sun hits it.   This is an Austin staple for me and I'll keep bringing friends and family here. Next time I'll have to try a beer on tap while watching a sports game and chowing down on amazing pizza."

Got the local jellyfish IPA and a sweet pizza that wasn't too sweet. A nice sweet and savory flavor that combo the beer well. Also tried the pretzel for appetizer. It was my first time and was a bit too salty for my liking.  Parking was a bit rough to get to since barely in the front and back of the building but coming in early should be fine."

                "description": "Pinthouse is a great place to come, especially if you're with a large group of people and looking for a casual setting. They offer pretty unique pizza flavors, and this time I tried out the Honey Pear (8.5/10) and Shroomin' Goat (7/10). The Honey Pear was a nice contrast of savory and sweet, without being overly sweet. I'm a huge fan of honey on pizza, so this was definitely a good choice! The Shroomin' Goat has crumbles of goat cheese, with lots of greens and mushrooms. I liked this pizza, but it was a bit too salty for me, and I wish it had more balanced out flavors.   I ordered a medium pizza (~$20) with half of each topping, and I'm glad I got to try out both combinations! The medium pizza, by the way, is huge and more than enough for one person. I was pretty full after three pieces but am happy to take home leftovers. The place also has a nice bar area that has pretty well-priced beers and ciders. There's a blood orange cider that I tried, which was really good. Overall, definitely recommend Pinthouse for anyone who wants a chill, fun pizza and beer night!"

                "description": "Between the 2 of us, we got 2 smalls, and it was plenty to share! Thin crust, very crispy, very fresh! Pretty cheap for great pizza! You can get 2 different kinds on a pizza, even a small!  Small 10\" - $8-8.50 Medium 14\" - $16-17 Large 16\" - $19.50-20.50  In order of favorite pizza: Cannonball and The Works (tied), then The Hoe Down and all a'sprout it (bf doesnt care for goat cheese though).  **CANNONBALL (like a meat lover's)- Red sauce, house cheese blend, pepperoni, bacon, local crumbled sausage, Canadian bacon. Very good. Very crispy.   **THE WORKS (like a Supreme)- Red sauce, house cheese blend, pepperoni, Canadian bacon, local crumbled sausage, green peppers, garlic, mushrooms, red onions.  Good, basic supreme pizza  THE HOE DOWN- Red sauce, house cheese blend, roasted red peppers, roasted CAULIFLOWER, roasted GARLIC, RICOTTA, pepita PESTO. Kind of expected more out of this bc I love roasted cauliflower and ricotta. It was good but probably pass next time.   ALL A'SPROUT IT (monthly pizza) - roasted BRUSSELS SPROUTS, caramelized onions, savory BACON, GOAT CHEESE, BALSAMIC reduction. Love goat cheese and roasted Brussels sprouts. However, this was good but passable.   **My bro's favorite is HONEY PEAR-  Extra virgin olive oil, house cheese blend, sliced pear, caramelized onions, blue cheese, prosciutto, basil, local honey. I will try this next time even though I'm not a big fan of blue cheese."

For starters; MAKE A RESERVATION/JOIN THE WAITLIST ONLINE when you're on the way so you don't have to stand outside and wait in texas' jank weather.  They have a beautiful variety of locally brewed beers that are solid and also go on sale during happy hour!  Interior is a ton of long tables which are perfect for groups.

My husband and I stopped in for a drink since we had dined earlier next door and didn't want to overpay for another drink. In retrospect we should of dined here instead because the prices were way better and it smelled amazing.  Anyway, the bar area was nice and plenty of places to stand and or sit in the dining area. The food smelled so good and would love to grab a slice and a drink next time while here. They have gluten free options to include side and pizzas."

                "description": "We ordered ahead on their website right when it opened at 11 AM. We got a medium honey pear ($17) and a medium banh mi ($16).   Banh mi: the pickled red onions were the star of the show for me. The flavors of the toppings do remind me of banh mi. I would eat this one again for sure. The sriracha on it was a nice touch. It had a good balance of acid, spice, and freshness.  Honey pear: this flavor surprised me in a good way. I just gave this place 4 stars since I thought the toppings on this pizza was lacking a bit as I felt that there was a bit too much crust at the edges, especially compared to the banh mi pizza. I feel like the topping placement could have been more even - some slices didn't have much else besides caramelized onions.  We ordered ahead, and then just picked up our pizza from them and sat down in the store. This place has no waiter, you just order from a counter. The seating is very homey since it's a lot of big tables and bench seats."

Their innovative twists on a classic dish was truly incredible from the first bite when the diversity of flavors exploded on my tastebuds. Also, the price was phenomenal for the amount you get. One small pizza was MORE than enough to fill me up and leave me beyond satisfied. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying all their specialty pizzas.

The chips and salsa could have bought at the convenience store across the street as there was no creativity for $6.  The pretzel and pizzas were top notch.

Their crust sets them apart from other 'za joints and they craft brews are right up their with any of the big guys (if you know, you know!).   During Covid quarantine, I have been taking advantage of their online beer release ordering and curbside pickup. Yay! Really hope this \"new\" process doesn't change. I also discussed they sell their dough to go, so I've been getting more creative in my own kitchen making pretzels and other yummies.   What else can I say? Nothing really, except go...just go! If you haven't yet, you're sadly missing out on this Austin institution.   Congrats on all the expansion and continues success Pinthouse! Cheers!"

                "description": "I'm a fan! I love this place! Their happy hour is amazing! I want to drink their ranch by the pint!  (I've discovered I only really LOVE love their specialty pies though - Honey Pear is possibly my favorite pizza of all time and the Banh Mi one is so fun and spicy and there's so many textures and flavors but it all works really well.)  Pictured is The Works and it wasn't anything special in my opinion. But I will always go back!! For Honey Pear  Note: Happy hour is M-F from 4-6pm and its $2 off pints of PHP beer as well as $2 off beer mates (cheesy garlic bread). Only complaint is I drink beer too slowly so maybe next time I'll order 2 before happy hour ends ;)"

                "description": "Not only are the pizzas here at PHP unique, the flavors somehow just work amazingly well. For example, my friend convinced me to try the honey pear pizza (I was suspicious but got it anyways), the tanginess of the pear with the sweetness of the honey and caramelized onion, with the saltiness of the prosciutto made it one of my all time favorites! Of course, they have \"regular\" pizzas as well, which were also quite delicious. PHP is also a brewery. I won't claim to be a beer connoisseur (it was good beer, that's all I can say), but the combination of beer and pizza here is amazing! Great laid back atmosphere with excellent pies."

                "description": "My favorite pizza place in Austin (and maybe ever!). I always go for the honey pear pizza with a side of ranch and a TX Keeper cider. Last time I was there, they let me know that my pizza wasn't to their standards because the dough had bubbled up a bit too much and caused some of the cheese to pool in places. I would've eaten it happily anyways, but they promised to bring me another, better pie after a while. They did bring one, but it still wasn't quite right to them, so they brought it to me in a to-go box, and promised to get the next one right. A little later, they brought out the \"perfect honey pear\" alongside a $20 gift card for my patience. I've never had a staff go so above and beyond for me! Always feel taken care of here, and always leave feeling wonderful.  Thanks, Pinthouse!!"

                "description": "I was working in Round Rock and we were looking for somewhere for lunch - spotted place on Yelp and bring British and sporting some old faves on the menu, decided to give it a try ! Very glad we did.  Full of cool British decor, we were met by the owner ( Tim?), really nice bloke and super friendly! It made me feel like I was at the local ( pub) back home.  Went with the curry and being vegetarian, was excited they had a cauliflower version which was great and very authentic! Loved the naan bread too.  My colleague got a burger but after spotting the fish and chips wanted to rest that - so we tried that and it was crazy authentic. Loved the mushy peas, curry sauce and the delicious tarter sauce . The dish is huge so easily enough for 2 !  Lovely place , great owner and fabulous food"

                "description": "Anything short of amazing would be doing this pub an injustice! A colleague of mine recommended Kenney Fort Pub for their brews and food. We finally got over there today for lunch to try it out and holy cow were we impressed! The location is tucked away in a commercial development and their frontage faces interior to the subdivision. When you get to the entrance you can feel the attention to detail and hospitality the second you walk in. The owner immediately greeted us and seated us right away. The dining area was spacious and airy. The  bar had a nice open feel, with visibility to all the brews on tap. We accessed the menu on our phones and were able to quickly place our order. We enjoyed vanilla beers which were full of flavor, just thought they might be a porter which they weren't. Only recommendation I would make to the owners is to list their beers by category on their menu so folks will gavitate to what they like. The names by themselves of the beers can be a hair unclear on whether they are a stout versus a pilsner kinda thing.   We enjoyed the hot pretzels with beer cheese that was super flavorful. For entrees we had the Kenney Fort Burger which was served on a warm pretzel bun with string fries and an amazing chargrilled burger which was super juicy. My husband has the fish and chips which came with fantastic wedge fries (I would sub for those with my burger next time) and several different dips for the crispy flaky fish. What we found most amazing was that this all happened with the owner running the entire restaurant and bar. He was on point the entire time and we had an amazing experience.  Lastly (and my personal favor), when he brought us the check, it had an RFID to pay on our phones using Toast. For anyone during this pandemic who has eaten out and either had to wait forever for a server to process your payment...or worse, had a server standing over you awkwardly handing you a device for you to pay your bill and put their tip in, you will appreciate this user-friendly and easy option to complete your check and close out your meal. LOVE LOVE LOVED THIS!  Enjoyed our entire experience and most definitely this is our go-to place going forward. Can't wait to try more beer selections and other menu items!"

This definitely brought me back to my Navy days of Portsmouth and London Pub style fish and chips! Perfectly battered and fried with that nice light crunch when you bite into it. The buffalo cauliflower bites was a first time try for me also. All vegetables need too be made this way. Not too spicy but just right.  This was a takeout order and everything was still hot and crispy when I got home. Perfect spot for any occasion."

                "description": "I've always been told that British food is boring and bland.  After eating it for the first time at The Kenney Fort British Pub, I can undoubtedly tell you, that is not the case.  The first British food item I had become really curious of is a Scotch Egg and I was finally able to get my hands on one here.  A Scotch Egg is a boiled egg wrapped in sausage, coated in bread crumbs and then deep fried or baked.  Simple enough, but Kenney Fort serves it on top of chopped and pickled veggies that takes it to another level.  I would come back here just for the Scotch Egg alone.  My wife ordered Fish and Chips which was battered and fried to perfection.  I'm not big on fish, but I asked for more than just one bite and enjoyed it very much.  It came with a side of tartar, curry, as well as mushy peas, which were delicious.  I ordered Bangers and Mash, which came with three sausage links, mashed potatoes, and peas in a tasty, tasty gravy.  This dish was top notch and surpassed my expectations.  Every bite was packed with flavor and very enjoyable.  The beer options here are plentiful, which also contains many local brewery selections.  Unfortunately, it was noon when we came, and a bit too early for me to crack one open.  However, we are both very excited to try them out as well as some of Kenney Fort's other food items."

                "description": "Was there about 9 pm last night. My companion wanted a really good burger and Yelp gave us this place.   We were the only patrons eating at tables. There were a few guys at the bar. Since I wasn't really hungry, we decided to order their signature burger which is made with ground brisket and ground meat from short ribs. I asked for it to not be overcooked. We talked about the cooking temperature with the waitress and she assured us it would be cooked medium. When it came out it was more like well-done. Pretty dry meat and not all that tasty. The bun seemed like it was homemade and was good, as were all the veggies they put on it. Fries were nothing special.   We will be back and I will try their fish and chips.   Service was good and the prices for what we had were consistent with 2021 inflation prices. I am sure this would be the place to be when a soccer game was on.   Music playing on their sound system was very good too."

I came across the Fort Kenney Pub in Yelp and knew that the following Saturday would start with a fry up!  When we walked in, the staff were all super friendly and welcoming. It wasn't busy as it was still early but there was plenty of seating and the football could be seen from most of them.  The food was great and everything I had hoped for! I subbed black pudding for an extra sausage which our server was more than happy to do. The sausages were really delicious!  Really enjoyed spending my Saturday morning here eating a yummy breakfast. I would love to come back to try some of the other meals on the menu!"

                "description": "Today, on this lazy, rainy, gloomy, post-#AustinBlizzard2021 Sunday, Hubs and I were on the hunt for some true comfort food! Thus, we knew that crossing the proverbial pond was a must! This is how we found ourselves at Kenney Fort Pub. Can I just say, y'all, that what we had here was just what we needed? This is true English pub food, and it warmed the very cockles of our very recently frigid hearts!   Hubby went with the English Breakfast! As he was wolfing it down, he looked up at me with an actual sparkle in his eyes, and he said, \"Do you know what this reminds me of most recently, honey?\", and I said, \"Yep!\"! I knew right away that he was referring to that Irish Breakfast that he got at the military part of the airport in Shannon, Ireland, on the way to his too long deployment in Afghanistan in 2018! The picture that he sent me on WhatsApp of that breakfast in that airport is burned in my memory forever!   I went with the Sunday Roast, and it was bloody fantastic, as well! The picture tells the whole story! So good! Chris ate 3/4ths of it, which is our usual division of restaurant food, but I just loved everything about it! The horseradish sauce was MAGIC! I could bathe in it!   We ended with the Sticky Toffee Pudding, and damn, y'all! Just damn!  Bottom line: if you've never tasted either of these traditional plates across the pond, but you're the sort that likes little tastes of many things, both of these dishes will be RIGHT up your alley!   And, even if you're not down for little tastes of many things, you'll absolutely wax poetic about that pudding!   What a fantastic find!   p.s. Our server was Noah, and he was a gem!"

                "description": "A solid 4 star experience!  I loved the fish (the chips were ok!). The burger was smokey and the meat was fresh. The fries that came with the burger were tasty. Everything was well seasoned. The kids fish and chips was great and my 5 year old ate it up.   I did not like the tikka masala. It was not creamy and felt heavy on the cumin. It was a smaller portion and not very much sauce. This was the only dish I didn't care for.     Also, when you pack up a to go order, please package the naan separate from thee sauce. It was packed together and the naan was all covered in the sauce that I didn't like so I didn't eat that either.    They need clearer instructions on what their pickup curbside process is. It was a little confusing but we just called and the man who answered brought our food out.  Maybe we were supposed to go get it inside?  I don't know.    I'm glad Kenney Fort Pub is in our neighborhood. I am sure  that we will be ordering curbside from them frequently."

I feel they either put an Texas flare or their own take on what British food taste like.    The burger was good, you  can't really mess up a burger.. well, maybe. The banger and mash, yall.... no. It tasted like a warmed up Slim Jim, the mashed potatoes had an odd flavor that none of could place. Maybe the mustard?

I feel like they could have done better to give it a pub feel. It feels nothing like a pub which was disappointing.  I'm docking one star for the Pimm's Cup. It's made with that awful soda machine Minute Laud Lemonade. It was horrendous! That was all I could taste. Simple syrup and Minute Made Lemonade.  I also docked a star for the music. It was SO LOUD. My husband and I couldn't talk. Literally. Couldn't hear each other. We were starting to question whether we're hitting an age where we say things like \"the music is too loud\", but no. No no no. This was freaking ridiculous! They had a lady there playing it for an hour before she started what I think was a quiz or game. Music should add ambiance. This felt like we were sitting front row at a concert. It was insanity. To the point I'm totally okay removing a star because of it.  We'll probably go back for the food, but if we're in the mood for a cocktail, or conversation, it won't be high on our list."

                "description": "Can't believe I haven't written a review here yet.  I went out of my way to get here. Was so looking forward to eating real British food.   I was going to be out this way during my first vaccine shot at Dell Diamond.  It was around lunch that I arrived here.  Waited a short time until they opened. Yes, I was the first one there.  First stop was to the loo.  Yes, it was labeled Loo. Started off with an order of iced tea.  Sorry, Brits no hot tea on a hot day. I asked the server if I could possible try the Black pudding they serve with breakfast. Turns out the server was one of the owner. So I got a slice. Ordered up a Scottish Egg and a plate of Bangers and mash.  I have had Scottish eggs before. These were a bit different because they used British sausage.   British sausage is very much leaner than US sausage.  The sausage meat surrounding the soft boiled egg was denser.  And it was served with picalilli (British salsa).  Loved these starters. Next up the bangers and mash and a slice of black pudding. Had to try the black pudding first.  Trust me it is not a pudding but a blood, oatmeal, pork fat, spices sausage. Before you turn your nose up, try it. A little nibble and interesting flavor. Bigger bite and it was good, before I knew it I finished it off and wish I had more. The banger was a Cumberland made sausage.  Lean pork shoulder meat makes it different than US sausages. Once you get over the difference, It is really good. But the mash potatoes, oh wow. They add mustard and cheddar cheese to theirs. Next batch of mash, I plan on adding mustard to mine. Now if that isn't enough, Red Onion gravy.  Take a slice of sausage, dip into the mash and make sure you have the gravy on it.... Prefect bite. I keep thinking the next time I go, I will get the fish and chips. But as I am writing this, all I can think about is the Bangers and Mash."

                "description": "My wife and I love slab, but we were extremely upset that the Burnet location decided to close 15 minutes early on a Saturday. Closing at 8pm is already a bit early for a weekend night, but shutting off the open sign at least 15 minutes early is crazy. It could have been longer, but it was off when we got there, so who knows when they did shut it down.   The new phone and order system also sucks. You can't talk to anyone, it just sent us to voicemail. Even the online now shuts off early due to toast tab not taking pickup orders when we tried to put one in on our way there.   You are not the only place in town that sells great bbq, guys. If you keep making it difficult to buy yours, people will just go elsewhere."

The first turn off for me the secret shopper was that the cashier stated he could not change $100 bill for a $55 order! Wow.  Second, as you can see in my pictures my sliced beef sandwich was drrrrry! So d@'-dry I got beef stuck In my throat from trying to wash that dry ass beef down and that was without the bread!! I felt some foul vibes when we approached the counter but I just thought I was tripping. I truly believe the meat cutter knew he sold us that dry ass sandwich as well, so 1 star jerk!"

                "description": "Great BBQ for an even greater price! I was really impressed with everything we tried, and for it all being just under $50, it was worth it. It's not your \"traditional\" BBQ stop - the menu is really fun and there are some pretty creative treats to try, from Texas-sized sandwiches to habanero strawberry glazed ribs. The meats were tender as could be, the flavor was incredible, and the sauces were amazing. Will definitely be visiting again!   Service: 5/5 Food: 5/5  Individual food ratings: - Habanero Strawberry Glazed ribs (5/5): sweet and spicy (but more sweet), these ribs were perfectly tender and had really great flavor! You can get them without the glaze, or get the glaze on the side. - Smoked Gouda Mac'n'cheese (4/5): pretty tasty mac, very cheesy and creamy, would be great with hot sauce or meat. - BBQ nachos w/brisket (5/5): super loaded, huge shareable portion, and great flavors! Add extra sauces on top to get saucy. - El Jefe sammie (5/5): brisket, onions, peppers, and Fritos for some crunch, this was a great sandwich and super filling! - Twice baked potato casserole (3/5): needed a kick or maybe some more salt/pepper, but was good overall with the dank white sauce on top."

                "description": "First time at Slab BBQ and it's already our go to bbq in the area. First, all meats are gluten free! Yay!!!! Second, their meats are delicious! I had the chicken and the brisket and both were really good , seasoned well and very moist - cooked to perfection. I couldn't finish my salad and took maybe half of it home. So, portion wise, this is also a win. My daughter had the 1/2 ribs and we were all taken by surprise on the flavor. Seriously, TRY their RIBS!!!  They have a selection of different sauces, including a strawberry one that came with the ribs. I was very skeptical at first, but it worked pretty well. However, their mustard based one is my favorite.  We can't wait to be back!"

The pulled pork sandwich had very good flavor and the Mac and cheese was fabulous. They also serve beer which complements BBQ , IMHO. The service was courteous and prompt. The dining area was clean, though we opted to sit in their temporary outdoor seating area because it was a beautiful day. Check it out as an alternative fast food option."

We thoroughly enjoyed our meal! Our party of three started with the double meat bbq brisket nachos, then we shared 1/2 # of ribs, a Texas Tornado wrap with double brisket (absolutely LOVE their brisket) then added an extra large order of the smoked Gouda Mac and cheese, green bean casserole and finished up with a banana pudding .  Gotta say I haven't eaten such great bbq for years AND took home enough for another meal.  This is my new go-to for Austin BBQ! They have a nice selection of regular and craft beers as well.

                "description": "I've now been here 3 times and if it wasn't for my last visit, it would probably be a 5 star but the last trip was definitely not ideal. The first two times I came here, I ordered the nachos and walked out so satisfied. It is a massive portion that includes all the toppings you could ever want.  They are truly some of my favorite nachos in all of Austin.   This most recent time, I decided to switch it up and went for the trio slider.  My buddy ordered the same thing and both of us walked out of there, not sure if we would come back.  The bread was hard, and the meat was room temp at best. We came in around 12:30 on a Saturday which I would have assumed is a pretty popular time with some of the freshest food but I was definitely wrong. It almost seemed like they were trying to get rid of food from the day before.  I will probably be back at some point but I don't think I would ever order the sliders again (which is such a bummer for a place 100% known for their sandwiches)  All that being said, the first two trips made a great impression and the workers there are all fantastic so I'm still happy to support this place."

The St. Louis ribs are some of the most tender I've had.  I wasn't a huge fan of the bbq sauce that came with the ribs but it's on the side and they have other sauces available as well- the one it came with was a little sweet for me. Planning on bringing my small rib aficionado this weekend after the pumpkin patch.  One complaint... the kids meal ribs says it comes with two.. TWO. Mine will be asking where the rest are if I ordered him a kids meal  they do have a great amount of meat on them but I have a 3 year old that eats like a teenager when he has ribs in front of him so these kids meals won't work for us  we will be getting a whole rack and I'll be lucky if *I* get to have two."

The line was long, but luckily I was able to head to the to-go desk and place my order fairly quickly...Brisket Nachos packaged with all the ingredients separated so as not to get soggy. They easily survived the drive home to Cedar Park and were super delicious and unique! Like a chopped brisket sandwich on tortilla chips with queso. Um, yes, please.  This barbecue place has a vibe like no other. The walls and music combine hip hop with classic Texas in a way I would not have dreamed possible, but it works. Pretty trendy spot.

I've had Hitmaker on my radar for a while. I came through with a good friend close to closing hours on a weekend. We were stoked to try their flights, which was great to get a taste of everything. Their menu is limited at the moment, since they're pretty new. I didn't feel any sort of type of way towards any beers in particular, but I do love that they had a Belgian called Accidental Trappist. Their rye wit I love too. They tried to have a little bit of variety in their menu which I appreciated.  The brewery also smells new too. I love it. It's like the smell of a baby or a puppy. Weird. So let's move on. They have board games for all, clean restrooms and TVs. The seating options are endless. You can go outside and play outdoor brewery games or sit indoors at the bar or in their many picnic tables. Parking is also super easy, and the taproom is easy to locate with their brightly-lit sign (especially at night). I definitely see us coming back here more often, especially since our taptender was a sweet and informative man who was so kind to stay a little past brew hours to let us finish our conversation and beers. I will definitely be back for the exceptionally kind service and cozy brew times."

                "description": "A friend recommended that we meet up at Hitmaker Brewpub. Hitmaker? The Google provided some excellent information: \"The co-owners started six of your favorite neighborhood bars/restaurants - MugShots, The Hideout Pub, Bender Bar and Grill, Pour House Pub, Violet Crown Social Club and Pour House Pints and Pies.\" Having been to a number of their locales I looked forward to having a few Hitmaker beers.  The bottom line their beers did not disappoint. My IPA was not excessively hoppy and had that typical fruity citrus flavor. Plus one stepped out of her comfort zone and went with their Kolsch offering. My tastebuds told me this was not a typical Kolch as it was pretty lite and could have masqueraded as a lite pale ale. A good summer beer.   The bartender on duty was very knowledgable and was eager to fully describe their offerings. The taproom is cozy, dimly lit, and cool. Perfect atmosphere for quaffing excellent brews on a hot summer day. Lastly, feel free to bring your mutts."

                "description": "I live pretty far from Hitmaker but have tried to visit a couple of times when I happened to be in the area. I recall both times they were closed when I was near by. My plan was almost foiled again, but this time luck was on my side. Due to Covid-19 the hours online didn't match their actual hours so I got there an hour before they were actually set to open. I didn't want to wait around for an hour until opening time so I was going to head home. As I was leaving I happened to run into one of the workers (maybe an owner) and after explaining my dilemma he graciously agreed to let me in an hour early to enjoy their beer. I was delighted and thankful. I got a glass of the Summer Saison and the Hill Country Haze and enjoyed both. The service was great and the atmosphere was enjoyable."

                "description": "Wow.  8 beers tried, and 8 beers worth trying again! The kolsch is such an easy drinker, light and refreshing!  Pale ryeder and rye wit have a bit more flavor but still an easy drinking wonderful drink!  It'd be hard to stick with just one here, but if I did; I'd probably go with French Saison, wonderful taste and a bit stronger than the others.  Coconut Porter isn't the best porter I've had, but if it's cold outside this would be my drink at the brewery. Hill country Haze is an IPA I could drink, but I'm not an IPA fan.  Accidental Trappist is good.  I can't put my finger on it... you just have to try it.   The brown ale is a little heavier than most and I'd be tempted to grab it instead of the Porter.  They have some cans of wine and a cider too.  $2 tastes 6oz.  $4/5 16oz pours."

                "description": "Review time kids!   What does one do when new to the area? If you are anything like me and the ever so lovely bride, you go exploring every chance you get!   After hitting a farmers market and a flea market we decided to take the route less traveled home by watching the compass and staying off the major arteries. This is where Lady Luck showed us a sign that I almost can never resist,\"Tasting Room Open\", like a mosquito to a bug zapper ,I'm in!!   I have to say I really dug this place for a few reasons beyond the fresh beer selection. First is general layout,not to big or to small,its just right. Second is decor,simple,industrial,clean. The focus here is on their craft brews not a bunch of goofy crap on the walls. Third is noise, this place was chill. I was actually able to converse with my bride without the aid of ASL!   On to their craftwork, after meeting the very friendly barkeep we decided I'm a picky bastard and he had me try a few samples, all were very good. Landing with the Kolsh really hit the spot!!

You can do a 4 beer tasting flight and they have around 12 or more on tap.  You can buy beer to go in cans or they have growlers available and some cute merchandise.   Be aware the v neck tee shirts they have right now are cut pretty tight/narrow.    They have a nice back patio where you can eat and drink and bring your canine friends and sometimes have local craft vendors back there as well.   I really like their Coffee Kolsch beer!   You definitely need to walk next door  and check out Revolution Distillery - simply fantastic gin and cocktails with a free tasting of a few of their spirits.  Can't buy bottles of hard alcohol on Sundays but they were still open today (Sunday) and they are happy to serve you delicious cocktails!"

Such is the case with Last Stand. It's a good brewery. It's got old school Hill Country funkiness, as evidenced by their chicken shit bingo games (every 3rd Sunday!)  For better or worse, it's also just down the road from the behemoth that is Jester King. Hell, there's a great distillery 10 feet away! Last Stand's brews are good; this visit I had the Citra Smash, Simcoe Pale Ale and the Fuzzelicious. But I'd be lying if I said I wasn't thinking about Jester King with every sip."

Large beer garden with Chicken $**t bingo every 3rd Sunday of the month. That beer tho!  They focus more on the hoppy-side (love their CitraSmash); however, they also make great porters, stouts, and other seasonal brews including barley wine. A flight of 4 - 2oz pours will set you back 10$ if it's your first visit. Then, go for a full flight!  Light snacks available (pretzels, etc.) and food truck on-site at times.   Package available for sell and they also custom fill 16oz crowlers. Cans also available at ATX merchants (e.g., HEB).   Support local!   Family and Fido friendly. Cheers to the love of great beers!"

My 3/5 stars is due to the build your own pizza coming with cheese (which we don't and can't intake) so we spent $20 and weren't able to eat it. I'm hoping someone else ate it because it hurts my heart to think a cow gave her milk for nothing. We were told that we had to purchase another pizza. We decided it would be best to go elsewhere for food. My only advice is to inform the customer that the pizza comes with cheese automatically. We wouldn't have known otherwise.

                "description": "This was our second brewery on our beer tour, while in Austin. Small place, and not many beers on tap, but you can still find some good ones.  Their beers are listed on the wall on tap, and they also have them in the fridge if you want to take some bottles home.  They do flights, and of course that's what I did to be able to try more. The Coffee Porter was like drinking actual coffee.  Delicious!  I left this one for the end, after one sip since it ended up being my favorite. Imperial Oatmeal stout was just OK, in my opinion.  They also had it in Whisky Barrel Aged - same alcohol content but the barrel aged process always makes it taste stronger.  I wasn't loving these so didn't finish them.   Holiday Ale - was good, tasted just like it's name implies. The one that surprised me was the Smash Citra. I usually stay away from IPAs (too hoppy for me) but this was amazing!  I could have had a second one.  Service is hit or miss.  They were a bit slow preparing our flights.  One of the ladies was really nice and friendly, the other two people behind the counter, not so much.  You can enjoy your beers inside but the outside is really cute. Looks almost like a schoolyard with long wood tables, space to walk, and a cute colorful seating area near the exit.  Across from them there's Revolution (locally mad gin) and another brewery. So, this is a good place to \"park\" and enjoy a drinking day out with friends, without having to drive around for more.  3.5 stars"

                "description": "Came here after a stop at JK and this place was a pleasant little surprise!  Far less crowded than JK and the outdoor patio area was fantastic on a gorgeous spring day to just vegge out, hang w/friends, enjoy some brews, and play a mean game of cornhole!  Their beers were very hit or miss for me. I did the sampler and nothing really stood out, but none were undrinkable, just not really my style. If you like hoppy beers, then you will probably enjoy their selections more than I did. Their stout was ok, but in all fairness, probably not the best choice on a warm day as it was heavy.  I will say, what stole the show for me here was our little discovery of their Revolution Spirits barn. They were doing a free tasting of their gin and Cafecito coffee liqueur, both of which were absolutely awesome!  I really like the gin as the lavender in the batch we tasted was very prevalent. I am usually not a gin drinker, but the mix of this w/the hibiscus tea that they served was perfection! The Cafecito, however, was so mindblowingly good, I immediately dropped the $25 to purchase a bottle on-site! It is made w/Cuvee and packs a delightful, caffeinated, yet alcohol-y punch. I have paired it drizzled over some coconut, chocolate chip, almond vanilla ice cream, and it is what dreams are made of!  I probably would come back here in a few months to see if they have any different beers on their rotation and to restock on the spirits."

                "description": "I'm not much of a beer person, but I do try to appreciate it. Came here on a Sunday with friends to check the place out. You can ask to try some of the beers if you're not sure what you want. The samples are very generous and the people working there are nice and helpful. I sampled four different ones before deciding on the pale ale. The coffee one was also great, not like anything I've had before. You also have the option of getting a flight/sampler with four different beers if you want variety. There is outdoor seating too!  Taste | 3.5 Atmosphere | 3 Presentation | 3.5 Service | 4 OVERALL | 3.5"

                "description": "Great new brewery in the Dripping Springs area. They currently have a solid five brews on tap. Our faves were the BPA and Coffee Porter. I will say that I need a session beer from them... something a little less on the alcohol would be good, but that's just my preference.  The location is just a few minutes down the street from Jester King (so if you're already out at JK, come give Last Stand a try!). They are located in a really cool business park. There's also a distillery a few doors down!  There is a couple of places to sit inside and a full outdoor area with seating (if you're allergic to hay, it might be an issue)."

                "description": "This was the last stand for us during a wine trip through Hye and Johnson City. As we circled back to Austin, the Mister decided he would confuse his brain after the lovely wine tastings with a beer. This was dessert, he explained.   However crazy this idea was, I am now a fan of hitting all these breweries five minutes before closing. We were the only customers and serendipitously met the owners and their beautiful white boxer! The guys enjoyed their Coffee Porter and Pale Ale and we were on our way home quickly."

                "description": "Argus Cidery's website mentioned they were open on Sunday. But when we arrived, they were definitely closed.  So since we were there we thought we would check out Last Stand.  Last Stand is located at the back of the warehouse properties in the cute little green buildings, next to revolution spirits.  There is plenty of parking.  They have a small inside tasting room with space to sit down, and an outdoor area that is dog friendly.  There are some trees shading the outdoor area, but they have also put up some netting.  The area is barked and they have some nice tunes playing.  They have a corn hole with bean bags, or across the street a Frisbee Disc Golf course set up that doesn't look like it has been used in awhile.  The only negative on the outside space is that it had a large fly population.    The competition for micro breweries in Austin has become fierce.  There are many options to select from.  There is a bit of something for everyone.  My beer tasting adventures with my expert husband have developed a palette that appreciates this alcoholic beverage.  Last Stand out of the many I have tried is just OK - Average.  The beers just fall flat and thin for me.  They are missing that full flavor quality profile. You can select from a flight of Year Round Beers ($7), or a flight of their rotating taps ($10).  Their rotating beers always feature the following: their ongoing Farmhouse, SMaSH (single malt and single hop), and a Single Barrel Series.  They also have some growlers you can select to fill up to go.  The two that I found decent from their menu were the Pale Ale and Coffee Porter.  The coffee porter is made with local Summer Moon cold brew, which you can taste in the unique roasted and nutty tones.  While not rich and creamy like most coffee porters, this still has some good flavors.  The staff were friendly and helpful."

Usually I am running by it and we decided to finally stop in for a drink on a Saturday afternoon.  We decided to do a flight of a piece of the ciders so we could try them all. It was the perfect choice as we both had different opinions of what tasted good.   There are a few food options but we didn't eat here. They had a guy in the outdoor seating area that was cooking up some food on a grill.   Overall a cool chill place to grab some drinks and hang out inside or outside."

                "description": "Do yourself a favor and stop by the Tasting Room at MoonTower Cider Co., over on Tillery Street, proudly brewing fine cider on the East Side.  I was fortunate enough to show up just after the room opened (2-9 five days a week) and the ambiance and mood was perfect for a cloudy day: French  jazz on the stereo, clean lines in the furniture and understated appointments and the well-informed and cider fan Anne-Claire behind the bar. She patiently walked me through ciders in general and expertly helped me understand one cider from the next from the \"core four\" and special tastings.  Dog-friendly and laid-back, this is the perfect place to escape from the mayhem of daily life and enjoy an artisanal brew made by the good folks right here in town. How artisanal? They brew their own mead.  Anne-Claire or others will be happy to recommend the cider for your palette and will speak to food pairings as well. All in all, a low-key, friendly no-pressure environment. There are no sales people here: there are artists happy to help you discover and share their fondness for cider.  Go."

                "description": "I would really like to give Abel's their 5 stars which they probably deserve but the Restaurant sits at the bottom of a hill. This is not ok when you're bringing in a bus loaded with passengers. Shell passengers at that (Shell has a zero tolerance for unsafe practices). Cars on every side of the street so a bus would have to unload in the street. Luckily for me this time Heaven was on our side by allowing us to get our buses up from the hill. Going down the driveway was just as challenge because we had to turn just right to make the turn to drop the passengers off at the door.  The OS came when we had to turn the buses just right to get out the drive and up the hill onto the street. What makes this even more dangerous are the pedestrians walking in front of the bus, to the side of the bus and in the back of the bus.  It takes a skilled driver (like myself) to be able to get out of the mess I was in. This was the perfect time of all the times I should told my clients dropping them at the door was unsafe. But there I went.  If I didn't position the bus just right getting up that hill a tow truck would have to be called to unstick me. That's what we call bottoming out the bus, when the axil is stuck on concrete enabling the bus to move.  Now my coworker trusted me and followed me right down that forsaken hill and tried to get up the hill as I did.  Now mind you, if we get the buses stuck it will take a tow truck at least 2 hrs to be dispatched and out to our location. It's cost $$$ for a bus pull out, the restaurant is located in a neighborhood so they would have to use an alternate to their homes, patrons inconvenienced, our passengers stomachs full they ready to go to get to their hotel. Shell most definitely will report us for an unsafe practice and we would have to answer for that unsafe practice....just a mess. Anyways, I got my bus out and the other bus as well. There was no bus parking not enough curb parking so we were unable to dine at the restaurant. I forgot about that so I change my rating to 1 star. J/k"

I have to say that I almost didn't go because of the reviews here, but my experience was totally different. And it was absolutely a 5 star experience.  Overall the Views are objectively great right off the water, the food has been very good both times - I had a really good Salmon dish most recently. But more importantly the waiter Rob has been incredibly kind and attentive - even offering Iced Tea \"to go\" both times.  I'd recommend you judge Abels for yourself and come to the restaurant -- I actually asked them about previous reviews and they did say they've been really shifting all of their service to be the best and that's what I've seen first hand.  I can't speak to how they were in the past, but today the experience is 5 stars!"

                "description": "I came here for my graduation dinner (NOT on graduation weekend - so it wasn't that busy) and it was honestly one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. It was embarrassing for me because I picked the place. Thank God that my friends and I are pretty chill people, so we just rolled with it.  However the service was abysmal, the Mexican Martini was not drinkable, bathrooms were filthy and there was not a manager in sight the whole night. Well, at least not until we left and saw them all chatting on an unoccupied patio to the side of the restaurant. I guess it was socialization time while their servers are outside floundering. The girl who served us was seemingly taking care of the whole patio (although failing) and said it was her first week. Wild.   Two people from my party didn't get their meals until everyone else finished. We had to basically beg for our drinks. And the food was honestly 2 stars at best...  Only good thing about this place was the ambiance"

                "description": "I would give this 20 if I could. Visiting from San Diego, we found Abel's on an idyllic Sunday afternoon.  Although there was a wait for a table, Johnny, the BEST bartender/server EVER, found a couple of barstools and made room for us at the bar.  Johnny makes a GREAT host, and GREAT Bloody Mary!  World class. Perfect blend of spices with other ingredients.  I had the Texas burger (YUM) and my husband had Abel's Tex-Mex twist on a Philly steak sandwich. \"Absolutely delicious!\" The open air bar on the lake is a beautiful setting, the weather was perfect, multiple football games on big screens, and a great vibe.   Fabulous food, and not at all expensive.  But Johnny made our experience superb."

                "description": "I've been coming to Abel's for years but hadn't been back since the start of the pandemic. I went tonight and I am so happy I did!  Abel's will be in my routine rotation from here on for dinner and drinks.   They have always had a strong kitchen for an affordable bar and grill - so much better than the place next door. Tonight, I was taken care of very well by two affable gents at the back bar, Stuart and Eric. Stuart told me I should try the blackened redfish. He shared it was a new rotating special. I was amazed how perfectly it was seasoned and cooked.  One of the best redfish dishes I have had in months. I immediately asked what I need to do to convince them to serve this on the regular menu. They said let our management know online so here it is.  I was texting friends about how good it was and that we need to come back soon. Please keep this dish on the menu - as often as possible - and give your chef a raise.    Another fun plus - Stuart and Eric know their sports. We had a fun smart conversation about all current sporting events.   Bottom line.  If you are a sports fan, go here. eat the redfish, ask for Stuart and Eric. drink, have fun and repeat. Also, brunch on Sundays for early fantasy games is another great call.   Five stars on this visit. See you soon."

                "description": "Sweet waitress. She was clearly slammed. That's not the issue here. Sweet potato fries were delivered to the wrong table by someone running food. Pancakes were burnt. Both out of her control. She got them both taken off rightfully so.  The BIG ISSUE was ours and two different tables cards were wrong up wrong, mixed up, and delivered to wrong tables. Our credit card went to someone else's table and we found it ourselves. Still not mad at that sweet girl at all for the record. Our tab came out cheaper and we signed it and got out. Forgive us of our sins. What was EXTREMELY CONCERNING is the manager approached my father IN THE BATHROOM and chased him out the front door. My father explained that a transaction was made and there was a signed document, end of story. Argue that with anyone especially when we were on the street walking to our car. What does the manager do? He THREATENED to call the cops! My husband, who paid the tab suggested to the manager that we go inside and talk privately. The manager proceeded to discuss this private matter  in front of customers IN THE PARKING LOT! Legally, we did nothing wrong. Transaction was made between the establishment and our family. Signed document. Off the property. Boom. If he would have came up to us and started with excuse me, we messed up, can we fix this please- would have been the start to a better approach. Chasing my father. Threatening to call the cops. Discussing in front of customers after we left. We could have sorted it out had he not been so aggressive. I was in the service industry for 8 years, he was 1000% out of line. The scenery is pretty nice though. One star fir that."

Came in with a few friends and sat for about 15 to 20 minutes, after waiting I had told the hostess that we hadn't been helped yet, she then said someone would be out shortly to help us. Waited there about another 10 minutes and still no help. They were not understaffed by any means, in fact there were people standing around doing nothing which was why I was so irritated. I had read the bad reviews and decided to dismiss them and try this place for myself, wouldn't recommend."

                "description": "AMAZING!  I have been wanting to check out this place for 2 years and we finally bit the bullet. The hold up has been the negative feedback from my trusted foodie friends. However, I have a feeling they all must have visited during a weird menu transition that they did not find pleasing because Odd Duck has great ratings! I could not acquire a reservation for 2 so we arrived around 4:45 to ensure we at least snagged a spot at the bar. However, the hostess provided us with a table on the patio with the knowledge that another party would be arriving at 7:00, no problem! I was thoroughly impressed that they had employees lined up behind the hostess stand to show each guest to their seat!    Happy Hour runs from 5-6 so we took advantage of their delicious $8 paloma's! I could seriously drink those all night! They also have 25% off bottles of wine under $100.  We dined on the redfish ceviche which was refreshing, the cheddar cornbread that was so delicious, between 2 people, we ate the entire serving! The scallops were delicious, but I was obsessed with the celery escabeche that accompanied my husband's wagyu sirloin cap. I think the next time I will inquire about having the scallops prepared with the escabeche.  We also tried the chocolate fudge pie, but although the dried chiles were only sprinkled on top of the pie, it was still too spicy for my husband.  I clearly gave Odd Duck 5 stars because I was highly impressed and I plan on making a quarterly trip here to check out the new revisions."

                "description": "Underwhelming, overhyped, nonsense.  If you are going to act like the best restaurant in Austin then guess what I am going to review you like one.  First things first, don't bother coming if you don't have a reservation, they have the tables and the space just not the will or want to seat walk-ins.  First time we showed up directly at 5pm as the place opened.  There was a minimal crowd ahead of us, maybe 10 people.  We were informed for a table for 2 it would be a 3 hour wait...  The restaurant was practically empty.  If you are this lauded as a top restaurant but can't employ enough people to take a 2 person walk in at open, then something is seriously wrong.  So we came back the next day with reservations for 5 o'clock, again no shortage of tables, but a definite shortage in staffing/management.  We were seated promptly, told we could only order once from the menu, and our server didn't understand what or wasn't on the happy hour menu.  We were told 2 cocktails were on the happy hour menu turns out this was incorrect and was only corrected once we pointed out the cocktail we ordered was not listed on the menu as being discounted.  He was nice enough to \"discount\" the drinks, but again for a top restaurant in Austin your waitstaff seems to be poorly trained and unfamiliar with the menu.  By the way the happy hour is absolute worst.  5-6pm, 1 off a few beers, 8 dollar palomas, and 25% off ridiculously priced wine, and large beers.  The eazy peel from jester king was going for 44 dollars here.  I picked it up from specs for 15 dollars, absolutely outrageous.  Do not come thinking the happy hour will save you any money.  Uchi down the street does a much better job (not only at happy hour but for everything else in general)  We ordered the kale beignets, the achiote carrots, oyster mushroom salad, wagyu burger, seared scallops, and the sirloin cap steak with broccoli.  I will be the first to admit that the veggie plates were outstanding.  Really amazing flavor combinations, fresh ingredients, I was thoroughly impressed. The wagyu burger with collard green, chicharron and pimento was also a highlight, cooked perfectly and extremely juicy.  Then came the 36 dollar wagyu sirloin cap...  The aftertaste from this steak was horrid.  I've never encountered this flavor before but was a chemical taste that had me wretch, a few bites and had had enough.  My wife also felt something was severely off, and we sent it back.  The sear scallops (35 dollars) were just ok.  A lovely sear, mediocre sauce miso butter sauce and 3 tiny scallops a complete let down.  This restaurant thinks far too highly of itself.  If you are going to act like a pricey exclusive restaurant that makes me jump through hoops to dine here and charges an arm and a leg, I better be wowed at ever step, and that's far from what happened."

                "description": "Having really high expectations for a restaurant can be a tricky thing.  My expectations for Odd Duck were extraordinarily high... and the food, drink, and service blew my expectations away!  This experience was simply an incredible delight for my tastebuds!  I was seated at the bar and service was attentive and prompt!  Prior to taking my order, the bartender asked if I had any food allergies or dietary restrictions.  When I told him I was restricted to gluten-free items, he grabbed a special gluten-free menu for me and explained the differences to me.  Most everything on the main menu was either gluten-free or could be made that way without differing from the original recipe too much!  My visit was during Happy Hour.  Odd Duck doesn't offer a ton of HH drink specials -- in fact, the paloma is the only cocktail at a reduced price.  I opted for that and good thing I did because it was the perfect paloma!  Truly the best I have ever had!  Of course, I went there for the food... so let's talk about that. I started with the Redfish Ceviche -- I have enjoyed many variations of ceviche and Odd Duck delivered the absolute best!  So far I was 2 for 2... so I was quite happy with myself, but also a little worried that the entree could not live up to the rest of the meal.  My worries were silly and unfounded -- the Wagyu Sirloin Cap was packed with layers of flavor and was the best part of my meal!  Overall rating: *****FIVE STARS*****  Gluten-free rating: *****FIVE STARS*****"

                "description": "The old fashion was made well. The food had incredible flavors.  Tapas style. Loved the first two dishes: roasted carrots and mushroom tostada. The accompanying seasoning is incredible. The scallops were equally good, but only three scallops came in the dish. This was not so hearty given the price of the dish, but flavorful. The pork dish was nicely made, smoky flavor, had kind of an Indian grill feel to it... but for us the taste had a quick diminishing return. The dish was hearty though with a lot of meat on the plate.   I wasn't too much in a dessert mood. Was simply going to have a spoon or two of the chocolate pie, but they brought out the donuts by mistake. Thank goodness, they were amazing. I enjoyed it more than the chocolate pie.   Service tonight was simply outstanding. The waiter took my dietary restrictions to heart and really did a great job helping me navigate the menu. I wish more places did this. I felt the service here from our main and accompanying servers is what other restaurants should aspire to. Bathrooms were kept clean. I wish this place continued success. They have something really great going on!"

                "description": "This was simply the best dining experience I've had in the recent years or maybe, ever. From beginning to end, I was thoroughly impressed with the staff and how easy and enjoyable it is to dine at Odd Duck. It's a place with friendly staff, great drinks AND great food, and ambience is casual but unique. Perfection.  You can tell the owner takes their time to hire the right people because everyone we interacted with were so friendly. I think it matters a lot walking into a restaurant and enjoying a meal.   Parking around this area is usually not the most pleasant but fear not, they have complementary valet parking! That easily eases off the anxiety of missing your reservation time because you were looping around the area for a decent parking spot.   We came here on a Saturday at 5:30pm and it was perfect because I get hungry around that time. Okay, there are more reasons-it was not very crowded, it was happy hour for some drinks, and the lighting was perfect with the blinds pulled up since the sun has set.   Surprisingly, the drinks here were super good, like high quality to sip on. I got the draft paloma and it was very well-balanced. The other drink we ordered was Nice, Bryce, we were eyeing it and the waiter also made that suggestion. Both are different and definitely would get again.  Everyone was great about making their recommendations and the top choice was the scallops and ceviche. We couldn't get seafood this time around but I will definitely come back for those two items.   Waiter was great at making recommendations based on what we like and what he thinks is great. Easy to talk to, checking in on us just enough, and other staffs help with serving the food and filling up the water so that was cool to see everyone work as a team.  On to the food! So we got the cheddar cornbread, mushroom chorizo tostada, achiote roasted carrots, and wagyu sirloin cap. Cheddar cornbread is a must, it was fresh, the butter on it was amazing, and filling too. Mushroom chorizo tostada had a bit of citrusy to the flavor and it's delicious. For the achiote roasted carrots, what stood out to me was the burnt toast hummus!! I want a tub of that whatever it is! I think I would've liked more of the hummus and less chunks of the carrots. Don't get me wrong, the flavor profile is still very good, I think for my likings, the carrots can be slices so it's easier to consume. Wagyu sirloin cap was the star of the show for us, it was cooked very well (as in good job not well steak!), though I probably want it to be a bit more well.  We came here to celebrate our anniversary but it is a casual place so this is good for a date night or regular dining! The great thing about this place is that the menu changes so you can always find reasons to come back here. I can't wait until I come back."

                "description": "This place was delicious! The restaurant offers complimentary valet which is nice. The restaurant is decorated with wood from the original Shiner Brewery. The staff was very friendly and gave off the fantastic Austin vibes!   We sat at the bar and had the frozen chili margarita. It had great flavor and was well balanced. I tasted the Paloma and it was one of the best I've ever had! I also had the Naked Lunch cocktail which has beets. I'm not a huge beet fan but I'd drink this again. There was a special cocktail called Buckle Up Buttercup. The drink was a little salty, a little sweet, and you could really taste the bourbon.   For food we tried the kale beignets which were soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. We also had the mushroom chorizo tostada with beautiful, fresh bean sprouts on top. I LOVED the mushroom chorizo! I could put that s*** on everything. Lastly we had the ceviche. The fish was fresh and the homemade chips it came with were the perfect pair.   As a first time guest, I was very impressed! I'll be coming back next time I visit Austin. Make sure to call a few weeks ahead for a reservation. They book up pretty fast!  10 out of 10 would recommend. The food was too good to take pictures"

                "description": "Visited Odd Duck after months of waiting for a reservation, and was met with food and service that went above and beyond expectations. A local farm to table establishment with an elevated twist, I highly recommend Odd Duck as a go-to spot in Austin.   As many other Yelpers have surely noted, Odd Duck's menu is seasonal, so I'll spare you the details regarding the food I ate, as the menu has most likely changed. Feel free to sit back and trust your waiter's suggestions, as they are veterans of their craft.   One thing that I would like to commend Odd Duck on is their extreme attention to detail, which was immediately noticeable to me. From their unique plates and cutlery to the maintenance of their restrooms, this dining experience made it well worth the price point. Additionally, our waiter made it a point to clean our table throughout the meal, which was awesome.  5/5"

                "description": "Odd Duck is an OG in ATX's food scene; I've known about it since undergrad (10+ years now!) but haven't had a chance to try it until I was in town recently for work.   Before local/farm2table was cool - Odd Duck was doing it. It still feels great to support local farmers and producers though.   The food here was OUTSTANDINGLY flavorful -- bringing it to that edge but showing finesse and balance. I also appreciate that they made vegetarian versions of certain dishes so there are some options for Vegs!   My only regret? Not coming here sooner!   The menu will be different when you visit, but we thoroughly enjoyed each dish! We had the:  *Redfish Ceviche (leche de tigre, persimmon, cucumber, potato chip) *Cajun Pork Rillette (apples, pickles, Sour Duck Market sourdough toast) *Dry-aged wagyu burger (pimento, BBQ sauce, beer battered onion ring) - like an EXPLOSION of flavor.  *Wagyu Sirloin Cap (beef fat papas bravas, soubise, green bean salsa verde)  *French Toast (Vanilla Ice Cream, Cajeta, Apple, Pecan, Brown Butter Cereal) - yes, we had French Toast for dessert! So good and I recall just a pinch of salt from keeping it from being overly sweet!"

                "description": "Pictures of menu on August 17, 2021. Reservations are strongly recommended as this place is quite popular (rightfully so though)! We picked the tomatoes, quail, and cornbread and everything was 10/10. I don't typically eat cornbread but theirs is MAGICAL and a must do! Their service was also A+, they were kind enough to mark the menu with vegetarian options, they even provided ways to alter some of their dishes to make them vegetarian (see photo). The French Toast dessert was also a delight. I'm a big fan of their rotating menus and will happily return to try more.   There is complimentary valet parking. You can also find street parking by the restaurant. They have happy hour 5-6pm daily with drink specials only."

                "description": "Review 10-K Odd Duck Trading Symbol: ODD  Item 1. Business The Odd Duck is one of the places that I've been meaning to try ever since I first came to Austin for undergrad so many moon ago. Generally, the dishes are thoughtful and come together in just the right spots. There are a few aspects of the dinner where the execution could be more polished, but I'd wager the average visiting venture capitalist would hardly notice.  Item 2. Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations The assets: - The roasted carrots were phenomenal. It's rare to find a dish where the carrots were the star of the dish, and Odd Duck hit it out of the park. If there was one element to highlight that enabled this, it would be burnt toast hummus. Spicy and savory, hell I'm waiting for this dip at the nearest Central Market. The crunchy fried chickpeas were a welcome airy, textured munch. - The wagyu sirloin cap was thoughtful in its conception. The celery, broccoli and dill really brought herbaceous elements that complemented the subtle earthy-funkiness of the dry-aged beef. Extremely enjoyable and every bite was as satisfying as the last. Medium rare but not bloody - Dessert was the dried chile chocolate fudge pie. Holy cow, while chile chocolate isn't exactly a new combination, it's certainly not seen in many restaurants. Who says you can't turn up the heat during dessert? The white chocolate peanut butter whip is something I'd eat by the spoonful (and I'm a 'cold brew, no whip'-kind of guy. *Chef's kiss*  The liabilities: - Obviously by the price of the wagyu, there's no way it's Japanese wagyu. But   I found the wagyu a bit *too* firm. You chew, and chew, and chew, and chew some more. It's really a mouth-work out, which can be so antithetical to how wagyu is classically portrayed, e.g. melt-in-your-mouth goodness. I get that it's not the real deal, or that it's just the sirloin cut, but much leaner and less marbled than I would've expected. - Cheddar cornbread was decent, but did not excite, which is something I'd expect given the rest of the menu. It's a fairly expensive piece of cornbread given the price. I will say the texture is extremely fine, but at least nostalgia's sake, would've appreciated more grittiness/texture, perhaps a thicker crust. One final point would be the consistency of the cook, the bottom 10-15% of the cornbread was under-cooked and relatively more 'mushy' than the rest - One suggestion for the fudge pie is to add an ice cream or light sauce element because the pie was fairly dry  Item 3. Other Information - Complementary valet parking is always welcome along South Lamar - Great vibes and ambience - Always appreciate when a place focuses on shareable plates"

                "description": "My first encounter to Odd Duck I went solo as my date was feeling ill. I opted to try two main dishes starting with the quail which was outstanding. The goat cheese stuffing was beyond perfection and while I normally don't like chorizo it wasn't overburdened w/ traditional spices making the protein aspect of the dish wonderful; crispy and juicy.  The baba ghanoush had just a weeee to much cilantro for my tastes but overall a spot on accompaniment to the dish. Finishing the dish the salsa macha hit the perfect notes for heat.   Being a huge scallop lover I'm a stickler for the perfect mollusk. Odd Duck seared them to perfection with a great amount of caramelization and tender on the inside. While the menu said \"celery puree\" I picked up right away the it wasn't something in my years of being a chef never experienced. The puree was Kohlrabi. The vegetable mash was a smart move as the acidity cut the fattiness from the bacon lardon. The chili crisp was a very nice addition as it gave the dish a sweeping hint of heat, enough to compliment, not overpower. Well done.  I paired my dinners with the Hi Sign \"El Berto\" Lager. A very nice draft beer which went down smooth and didn't have the \"hoppiness\" that a more robust beer like an IPA has. I also sampled \"The Hop Sauce in My Bag\". What a refreshing beverage. The codka went down smooth while the ginger and citrus flavors made me with I was on a porch with a nice cool breeze!   My second encounter didn't live up to the first experience. I split the marinated cucumber and melon salad which was perfect for an early July night. The melon was juicy and the fragrant herbs of mint and basil made sure each bite popped with flavor. Excellent starter.   I opted for the aged Pork and while flavored spot on had an extreme amount of gristle. I found it very hard to impress my date while having to napkin off my mouth to expel what I couldn't chew. The rest of the dish complimented the flavors very well so no complaints for the overall flavor profile.   This was my dates' first time at the restaurant and she opted for the nachos. It was a rather bland dish overall but was saved by the amount of chicken and a good choice of using vadouvan pico.   Dessert was the lime panna cotta. Let me tell you the citrus in this dish make eating it like listening to a symphony from heaven! The almonds gave a nice texture balance juxtaposed to the toasted meringue which gave a somewhat campfire marshmellow vibe.     We split a bottle of Elyse Zin which was bold yet smoothed out in the mouth after just a moment.  Very nice and went with both of our entree's perfectly.   All in all these were brilliant efforts and before I forget, the staff was amazing. Kudos to the hard-working chefs and the knowledgeable front of the house for making my move to Austin memorable."

                "description": "When people say Austin has a great food scene, I think of Odd Duck as the pillar of that. My friend and I both agreed that Odd Duck would populate our top 10 restaurant list that we had ever been to.   We had the scallops dish, ceviche, beets, and tostadas. Everything was delicious, but the scallops dish was the best.   The interior and service are on par with Michelin starred restaurants, but have a more authentic Austin vibe. A must visit if you are in town."

                "description": "A gem in Austin for their authenticity and willingness to explore.   I loved dining at Odd Duck so much that I'd say it's now one of my favorite restaurants in Austin (first time was earlier this month). I'd go through all the dishes but that wouldn't be helpful because the menu changes seasonally (since they are a farm-to-table restaurant +1). First, I love that it's tapas styled (+1) because it means you get to try more dishes and nottt feel like you're over ordering!   What stands out to me about this restaurants is their sauces. The ones that I had with the heavier items (the red meat dishes) were rich and dimensional. Some of the flavors were unique because it had some aspects of familiar tastes mixed with ones that were foreign to me. I loved being able to try all the dishes because I knew I was tasting a unique dish that was created (or crafted) by a talented chef.   From a bar seat, I could tell that the servers and chef love what they're doing (trust me, it doesn't go unnoticed). I love knowing that my meal was made by people who are exploring, learning, and having fun! I honestly think it's hard to NOT want to support a restaurant like this..   Every foodie's must-try for sure."

                "description": "Odd Duck is definitely a must-visit if you are in Austin!  This restaurant supports the local Austin community, so it is neat seeing the various sourced goods within the innovative dishes here. It started in a trailer but transformed into what it is today with its farm to table creations.  We found street parking luckily, which was right on Gibson Street W. I did notice there is a private parking lot with valet included in it. I highly recommend making reservations. I found my reservation about ~3 days prior to the date. There are bar top seatings and outdoor seatings available. It's great for dates, friends or family (more for adults).  FOOD: Cajun Pork Rillette (4/5; Apples, Pickles, Sour Duck Market Sourdough): The cajun pork rillette was decent but enhanced with the addition of the veggies. The pickled veggies brought life to the dish. It was my first time trying rillette though, which is pork meat that is submerged in fat then cooked at an extremely slow rate. Another important note was the sourdough (it was baked perfect).  Mushroom Chorizo Tostada (5/5; Squash and Pepita Butter, Radish, Pickled Onions): This tostada was something else! It is very unique, and I loved all of it (including the texture of the tostada). There are 3 pieces, but I ate 2/3. I could have ordered another one for myself. The squash and pepita butter had some flavor, which helped bring another part of the taste element into play. Nothing overpowered another.  Apple Salad (4/5; Smoked Squash, Lavender, Chevre, Black Pepper Pecans): This is a lighter dish. I am not a big fan of apples, but I can assure you that I ate them in this salad! Great flavors that burst in your mouth... even the black pepper pecans.   Wagyu Sirloin Cap (5/5; Papa Bravas, Soubise, Green Bean Salsa Verde): My date loved this. He is an all time meat-lover, and he raved about this. The wagyu was cooked perfectly at medium-rare. It easily became one of my top 5. I also have to mention the pickled veggies with the papa bravas because they were delicious. I did not try much of the soubise (white onion sauce), but it was not overpowering. It added a nice, subtle savory taste with the wagyu.   Service was great and attentive. Everything came out on time. Our drinks never touched bottom.  Would I come back!? Definitely!!! They change the menu pretty often too. I am a fan."

She created customized menus for each person indicating what they could/could not eat and even came back with variations of dishes the chefs said they could do. The service here is excellent, as was the food.  Food is tapas style, so we were ordering tons of dishes for the table. Their menu changes frequently, so what you get really depends on when you go.

We were greeted immediately by the hosts and taken inside. The drinks were amazing. we ordered cornbread to go since we heard such amazing things but I wanted to try so many things on the menu and there were only 2 mouths to feed.   Unfortunately no duck egg for the dinner menu.  We got the wagyu beef which was slightly a bit more raw then I would have liked it.   Drinks were pretty good with the Cucumber Daze and a watermelon drink (can't recall it was one of their seasonal drinks)"

I had their steak most recently which was delicious but if you're not looking to splurge like that the burger here is awesome.   The look and feel of this spot is super modern and cool.  But I think the best part of this place is the service. I mostly eat at the bar and they're exceptional there. One thing I was really impressed with is that they really take care of people that have different food preferences. I personally don't have eating limitations but for those that do they have curated menus so you don't feel that you have only one item to choose from if you're vegan/vegetarian.   Pro tip - make sure to take advantage of the valet. I believe it's fee (plus tip). The adjacent street parking on Gibson is a hill and is normally full anyway."

Plus it was very nice and clean which is a plus.  We were greeted nicely and made to sit at their patio table in next few minutes. Our server was very good as the water came out fast and after placing drinks order it came out quick too.   For food we ordered brussel sprouts and fried cornbread as appetizers. Brussel sprouts were usual but corn break was too sweet than usual. Than we had aglio Olio pasta without chicken and it came out okay. Though I liked their chicken pesto club.   All in all, it's a nice place to have drinks with big outdoor patio, good service and decent food."

When I return this time ithis time it's different I believe the managers are different and is now owned by someone elsomeone else. They know they no longer make the drumsticks like before now they have dried up, comma bad bad dark meat of low quality, comma instead of the succulent white meat of chicken they normally do cook. They served me a very old salad it was horrible I didn't even get to taste it the tomatoes were rotten and smell it was were rotten and smelled you could tell the salad's been in a refrigerator for a long time period period the hamburger was a $22 hamburger small I took a picture so everyone could see a $22 hamburger with little fries. I'm not a glutton I just don't understand why someone would raise a hamburger that high I know that meat cost a lot these days, but but if it is small let it be an amazing tasting hamburger and his hamburger instead of dried up. To my shock I wasn't planning to write a negative review until I got home with a bad sickness my stomach is still hurting I don't know if it's what I ate or the chicken tasted funky. I don't think I can return back to this restaurant ever again I find it to be shocking that these people were very nice to me this time around  and didn't understand Why I felt bad after 35 to 45 minutes still feeling bad is still feeling  bad stomach aches..Hope this helps everyone out there who understands that if you're gonna pay over $50 for a meal it better be a good one instead of a  stomach ache!! New ownership but not in a good way!"

                "description": "What a ridiculous response by the ownership. It's very clear that the ownership of this place does not treat their employees with respect. A lot of your staff has turned over. Such a great patio that the majority of Lakeway will not go to because the owner has little man syndrome and talks down to his staff in front of customers. It's apparent now you don't take criticism very well. Re-read this a couple times and adjust your business instead of reading Dr. Seuss books."

                "description": "First time visit. Nice restaurant. Too cold to go outdoor but it would be nice during warmer days for sure. Small kitchen and small menu with decent size bar. The food we ordered was very good. Smell of seafood overwhelmed the restaurant upon entry. Interesting layout where trays of utensils, etc from the kitchen come through the restaurant to get to cleaning room which is right off the traffic to the restrooms. Shannon was outstanding waitress!  In all, will return but it didn't become our go to restaurant."

Not a huge deal but kind of weird.   Got the breakfast club sandwich. One bread had burnt edges the other under toasted. Hot as heck outside and no lemonade or \"refreshing\" options. Again nothing concerning just off.   Wife got the \"egg plate\". Self explanatory. Not sure what I was expecting but wish I just went to Waffle House.."

                "description": "Fantastic restaurant!!! First time to this restaurant and we'll definitely be back.  Outstanding food and service!!   I had the BBQ baby back ribs and my wife had the salmon. Both dishes we're spot-on!! Super high quality ingredients with delicious homemade sauces. Salmon on a bed of creamy risotto and the ribs on whipped mash potatoes. Not your traditional dryrub Texas BBQ.  We had a few martini's \"up\" and they were perfect.  Very generous size...Shaken with little ice crystals.  We got to meet the owner Eric and he's a great guy that you can tell has tremendous passion for his business and ensures his guests are well taken care of. Real attention to detail for a small neighborhood grill.  Found out that the chef has two Michelin Stars and his food backs it up!  Finally, our waitress Shannon was as Friendly, kind and prompt as you could hope for.  Live music too!!  Great neighborhood spot!!! Can't wait for our next visit!"

They tried to seat us at a table that had yet to be cleaned. Then we waited 5 mins for anyone to come by the table once we were seated.  Despite placing our orders right away, we learned 30 mins in that there were still 10+ dinners ahead of us and it would be more time. Best thing of the night was the waitress offering to cancel our order and close out our tab with our drinks only.   Our previous visits were OK but never lived up to any of the reviews we've read."

                "description": "The overall quality of not only food but ingredients and recipes has declined drastically in recent months. The caesar salad dressing went from creamy and rich with anchovy, to a simple blend of olive oil and parmesan cheese. Brunch items consist primarily of store bought premade processed ingredients straight from HEB. Sitting outside long enough you will notice employees running back and forth with bags from the HEB next door as the restaurant runs short on supplies throughout the day. A simple stroll toward the bathroom provides a clear view of the pantry stocked primarily with Knorr mixes and highly processed precompiled ingredients. For example a $22 Eggs Benedict Entree consisted of store bought Thomas English Muffins, pre-packaged ice cold Parma Prosciutto, Ore-Ida frozen potato cubes, and \"hollandaise inspired\" Knorr Bearnaise sauce powdered mix (almost more powder than liquid sauce). The side of bacon I ordered was unmistakably signature Hormel fully cooked bacon drenched in liquid smoke and processed applewood flavoring. It is truly a disappointment to see a local staple that once emphasized farm to table ingredients transition to a business model that more closely resembles \"frozen food aisle to table.\""

Their outdoor dining area is so nice and the live music is great! All of their cocktails were great. We LOVED the Brussels sprouts. We got two servings of it. We also got the charcuterie board and fried cornbread and really enjoyed those as well. I had the aglio olio for my main and it was tasty. The bread pudding for dessert was a great finish! We met the new owner while we were there also and he was so welcoming. What a great neighborhood bar. We can't wait to come back to Austin to visit my MIL and go eat and drink here again."

We Ordered:  Mai Thais - Sweet and strong Lychee Lowdown - Tasty and a great price for their all day (?) happy hour Charred Spicy Edamame - The char has good flavor but the seasoning wasn't spicy and left it a little greasy. Would just get it salted next time. Queso Loco - Not bad, had good flavor.  JFP Popcorn Chicken: Kung Pao - Really delicious, I could have eaten just this.  Nam Nom Noodle Salad - Also really tasty and would definitely get again. Bonus: it came already split so we didn't have to fight for the last bites. Hilo Hawaiian Sandwich - Was too full to really give this a good enough try but what I could manage to eat was great.  Hong Kong Waffle - Best dessert I've had in a long time. I'm a sucker for treats that make you feel like a kid and this absolutely nailed it.   Our server didn't seem like they wanted to be there but it seems like the crowd can get pretty rowdy so I don't totally blame them. With a few swaps in food, though, I'd definitely still come back."

He was super friendly and helpful and made us 2 Austin visitors feel right at home. Thankful for you!!!  Now, the food. The JFC Popcorn Chicken was FIRE. We ordered the honey sesame version that was sooooo tasty!!  The sweet potato waffle fries were a hit too, and so was the chips and guac.   We also had espresso martinis that were surprisingly without coffee beans but still tasted good!  Overall, we LOVED our experience here.

Honestly everything tasted so great I would recommend everything haha.

Both of our drinks were so delicious that we each got the others drink order for the second round.   The yummy fries were so so yummy.  I highly suggest.  The brisket wontons also were so great.   The place is super cute.  I would have much preferred to sit in the front more part of the restaurant with the bar. It's decorated so adorable and the booths are intimate and adorable.   The service was amazing. We had several different people waiting on our table so I'm not super sure how that worked out but it did.  It worked very well.  10/10 recommend.  Great place.

If you allow your imagination to suspend disbelief, Anthem could be a tiki lounge on one of the islands of Hawaii...without the airfare to get there. The decor of longboards, hula girl jiggle figurines, and tiki torches can transport you for an hour or two to a tropical paradise.  The service was perfect! I unfortunately did not get the bartender's name, but he was prompt in greeting me, and offering to get me a drink to start my evening. My guy was parking the car so I ordered appetizers and drinks before HH ended. We had blood orange frozen margaritas which were delicious. We tried the fried cauliflower and some guacamole. Both had good sized portions and were tasty.  Another bartender checked on us as she walked by, which was great. I love when everyone works together to provide excellent service. There were two hosts at the door to greet people- they were both professional, warm, friendly, and prompt as well. Good job, Anthem in choosing excellent staff.  The decor was spot on. It felt upscale without the upscale prices. We sat at the bar, and the stools were comfortable enough to have a full meal if you were to choose to do so. Overall, the place was clean and spacious as well. Go check it out and let me know what you think. Aloha!"

A group of 9 of us came here for dinner and we were all so impressed with the food. The appetizers are where it's at . The yummy fries blew some of us away - WOW. The brisket rangoon was outstanding. And the miso mac daddy....c'mon.   I would say the appetizers were more star players than the entrees. Don't get me wrong, the entrees were delicious too but I can't get over the apps.  The service was good. Our waitress was attentive and checked on us frequently. However, she did tell us there was a 2 hour service limit....  The decor was very cool and the whole restaurant had mood lighting. We had reservations at 6:30 and it was pretty dead at that time but really picked up 30 minutes later. Once it was a full house the atmosphere became louder and more vibrant. Right on S. Congress, where the bars are, I didn't see many parking options.  Overall, I want to come back here. I want a texasian restaurant in my city immediately! For now, i will just have to recreate their menu on my own."

I almost never order salads from restaurants, but this one is worth it. It's the most flavorful salad I've ever had, and the balance of textures sends it over the top.

They have weekday happy hour which is basically only good for the drinks. Not many shareable food items on it. I'm so glad to have found this spot. The drinks were so great! These two drinks gave me the perfect buzzz. If you like fruity drinks try the Splash and EXSW (East by Southwest) hate the name but love the drink. We ordered the furikake fries which is the perfect comfort food and filling definitely big enough to share between 3-5 people! We also ordered the popcorn chicken, I personally did not like whatever coating/breading. Service was fast. I would definitely dine in again for weekend brunch or an early dinner."

It is a savvy mix of Asian and Latin cuisine with a fun spin, and it's affordable. Don't sleep on the miso Mac daddy -- it's a combination of like Mac and cheese balls and sushi. Truly amazing. The fried tofu app was delicious as well. For entrees, my partner had the noodle salad (yum), and I had the vegan curry dog (comes on a pretzel bun), and you can't go wrong with either. Really, it seemed like you can't go wrong with anything you choose here. Staff are all young, welcoming, and friendly. Added bonus: GREAT happy hour and cocktail menu in general. I'd eat here weekly if we were local."

I would recommend you order their fried shrimp and French fries. They have a bit of spice and come with cole slaw and dipping sauces! You get about 10-12 pieces and a ton of fries. It's enough for 2 people."

Even ordering takeout was a great experience. Got the appetizer sampler which had all great items. Was plenty for 2 people. Also split the chicken sandwich which was yummy and a nice take the traditional fried chicken. The person with me highly recommended the pineapple dessert, though I couldn't try since I'm allergic. Will be stopping here regularly on my trips to rainy."

Every time I find myself in this establishment, I am off-put by the care shown to me by the staff, and how excruciatingly good the service always is. Also another thing that irks me is just how good the pretzel is. Why can't other tap rooms produce a pretzel of the quality of the Food Truck Bavarian Pretzel.  Also the price of beer during happy hours, Friday's, and Sundays is OUTRAGEOUS. $3 on select beers?? What is this? My friends fridge?? On top of this the incredible selection makes me red in the face with frustration, that like that special someone, keeps me coming back for more.   All and all this establishment is painfully well run and makes me smile."

We didn't have the menus out anymore so I asked the waiter how much it cost. \"About $20\" she said. When the bill comes, the pitcher was actually $50! The whole table ordered some, and we were all pissed.   I called the manager afterwards to express my frustration with how the waiter mislead us. He proceeded to criticize, mock and delegitimize my concern. He said I should have \"read the menu\", but the waiter should also know the prices. \"About $20\" is wayyyy off from $50.   Growlers literally does not care about their customers, and will gladly yell at you for THEIR mistakes."

They capture a broad spectrum of tastes and styles of beer. The food is bar style, wings, fries, tots, sandwiches, etc.  nothing I ate was noteworthy. There is room for improvement on greeting and service times.  There was one person working the bar and another waitress floating but no one approached us so we got up and asked.  Then another gentleman came from the back to wait on us.  There were not enough people in this place for the service not to be swift and great. Especially when I bring a party of 8 that are all eating and drinking. Anyway it's a good stop for a quick bite and a beer if you're in the area.  Just not a place on my list to revisit."

                "description": "Growler USA is definitely one of my favorite places to go to for drinks and food. There's a fantastic selection of beer; with something like 100 taps, you're bound to find something you like, whether you want a sour, IPA, or stout. Most of them are Texas beers and the selection is always changing. If you're not feeling beer, there are plenty of other drinks too: sodas, kombucha, wine, cider, mead, etc. A huge plus for me about Growler USA is they have pours starting from 4oz -- perfect for flights and lightweights! -- to the typical 12/16oz, and of course they fill growlers.  There is also decent food that goes a bit beyond typical pub food and is of course more varied than a food truck at a brewery. I'm particularly fond of the tater tots and mac and cheese, but it looks like they've added some new items to the menu in the last couple of months.   Another great aspect of Growler USA is the incredible staff. There is one woman in particular - her name eludes me - but she is extremely knowledgeable about beer of all kinds and can give you some great suggestions based on what you're feeling (or even if you're trying to do a beer and food pairing)!  I believe there is also some kind of special every day of the week. I know Sundays are $1 off sours, happy hour all day (discount on all appetizers), and I believe the tapover beers are discounted as well. Plus they do special events like Beer 101 classes. For all these reasons, I think Growler USA is a great value overall and there really is something for every taste. I know I'm always learning and trying something new every time I come here, and it keeps me coming back!"

The extensive menu and regular Tap Takeovers encourage would-be cicerones to expand their palate.  Don't bother with an entree. Food is mostly overpriced and underwhelming, so maybe get a large appetizer to share with your party. The wings and tots are alright and I hear good things about the pretzels.  The staff is all pretty nice. The price point and atmosphere attract a slightly older crowd for a location so close to a university, so don't worry about this place being flooded with undergrads like myself most of the time."

I just walked with my wife and daughter for lunch.  We waited a few minutes to be seated, or told to seat ourselves - but were totally ignored.  Finally a guy at the bar told the bartender that we had been waiting a while and she said, loud enough for us to hear, \"I don't care, I'm busy.\"  The place was not remotely packed.    Terrible, and very rude, service by the bartender working today.  Candidly one of the worst experiences I've had, and we didn't even make it to a table.

There are TVs and good music playing. The staff were incredibly nice and helpful. The food selection is good and tastes good as well. We will definitely be back.

                "description": "We had an excellent experience here for lunch. I have loved having Easy Tiger breads from Whole Foods at home, but did not realize they had restaurants, too.   We tried out the Lamar location and it was extremely tasty and a super chill atmosphere. They have a great outdoor patio area that is quiet but comfortable (even had heaters and fans).   What I was most impressed by was how the staff accommodated the needs of an ADA guest that was sitting with us. They really went above and beyond to make everyone comfortable. I will definitely be back soon.   PS - Try the beets, they're delicious!"

                "description": "So I traditionally love Easy Tiger and we frequent the North location for happy hour pretty often. We ventured to this South location excited that they have an outdoor space for kids.  The good:  Beautiful place with indoor and outdoor seating Fenced area for kids to run around Delicious food, beer, coffee  The not-so-great: When we arrived, there were a ton of open tables but we were told there was a 30 minute wait to be seated. After roaming around for a while and seeing none of tables were getting used, we asked and were told that they were giving the kitchen a \"chance to catch up.\" I wish they would have let us go ahead and get seated while we waited The prices seem to really be going up. $14 for a pretzel? I mean they're delicious and the cheese sauce is amazing, but I'll probably never order one again if they're the price of an entre.  In conclusion, we'll probably be back, but if we have the kids with us, we'd probably only go for happy hour or just coffee and pastries rather than a full meal. It's just too long a wait and too pricey for a family meal."

                "description": "Loved the variety of outdoor seating options, particularly the non-smoking upstairs area. They do trivia in that section on Tuesday nights, so expect it to be packed. There are ceiling heaters for the colder days, and long family-style seating primarily. That patio also has a bar, or you can order food through table service as well.  Mostly glutenous things on the menu, so would not recommend for special dietary needs. I had the waffle fries, which were tasty and served in a small bowl. Would definitely return again."

                "description": "I still remember the first time we went there. It was on the slow end of Dirty Sixth, where the old Havana location was.   I recall it vividly because of an interesting Interaction I had with the bartender.  As I looked at the menu, I asked about the pastrami and he said, \"Its good. So good in fact, it's the second best in town, behind Pious Pizza.\"  I remember thinking how it was honest but cocky at the same time. Sure, you may not think it's the best, but you sure you're second best?  Well, he was right.  Fast forward to a cool, hazy night in 2022 at their South Lamar location. First of all, the building is immaculate, an intentional nod to their style and culture. I love it.  My wife had the prosciutto baguette, which was delicious. Although the bread almost stole the show on that one.  The kiddo had the chicken schnitzel and, man, who puts that much effort into a kids plate? Really tasty and well executed.  I, like always, went with old faithful, the pastrami sandwich. My old friend was as delicious as always, as it didn't disappoint. The bread was great but didn't come close to stealing the limelight.   I've always worried about Easy Tiger turning into one of those Austin brands (talking to you Torchy) that loses its way, and I'm sure some may feel that way, but the experience at South Lamar could've been back at that old Sixth Street basement.   Five stars, folks."

                "description": "I have been dying to go to Easy Tiger ever since they opened on South Lamar. Today I was craving pastrami in particular and was in the neighborhood so I decided to go get the pastrami sandwich to go.   First impressions: convenient location, lots of parking options, clean restaurant and bathrooms, friendly but unknowledgeable staff, quick service but the restaurant was nearly empty at 3pm in the afternoon.   When I checked out at the counter I was taken back by the price. $23 for a sandwich ($18+ tip). Probably the most expensive sandwich I've ever ordered, even when staying at a five-star hotel and ordering room service. OUCH. I still purchased it in hopes for a big fat pastrami sandwich that I could possibly split up for two meals.   When I got back to home and opened the sandwich I was hugely disappointed. Where was the meat?! It only had a thin layer of pastrami and sauerkraut between two thick slices of oversized bread. WHAT?   The taste was average to mediocre. Absolutely nothing special about this sandwich. Bland, no substance, too much bread. I felt ripped off.   On the positive side the sandwich was homemade (fresh baked bread) and fresh prepared  sauerkraut and dressing, so at least I knew it was quality food/whole food and not processed junk. Sadly that wasn't enough to make it remarkable or worth the price. I was also very disappointed it did not include a big fat pickle. That would be a very easy and tasty addition.   This is Austin full of amazing food and amazing restaurants. Easy Tiger does not make the cut for me, nor would I recommend it to anyone else local or coming from out of town.   Recommendations to management: pile on the pastrami, reimagine the sauce and include a pickle. House made potato chips or even any kind of potato chips would have helped justify the price a little. Also, more training and knowledge needed for the staff as they could not answer my questions about the products and menu items.   Don't waste your money and time on a boring sandwich. I so wanted to love this place."

                "description": "Okay so, I ran across this post of super cute bars in Austin. Well of course I had too try them ALL. Starting with Easy Tiger.  Location: upon arrival it looks like an outdoor situation but once you park your car around the back you slowly realize it's a indoor/outdoor vibe. Areas have great coverage from the sun and I love that they have fans as well as Heaters on the ceiling!   Food: The Food was Fan-Freaking-Tastic. I won't lie first glance at the menu I was ehh. Nevertheless I asked my waiter chandler what should I order he made wonderful recommendations.   The pretzel  10/10: crispy outside pillowy soft inside   The Cajun Chicken Sausage 10/10: that prefect snap you want from any sausage casing and the home made Chow-Chow was the prefect topping.   The breakfast potatoes  10/10 : It was like the par-boiled the pots then fried them    Brussels sprouts 8/10 : Great flavor just wanted them a little more tender   Our cocktails 8/10  We order 3 different kinds all three were just okay.   The dessert and bread too take home was also really good.   All in All I would definitely recommend stopping by."

                "description": "This one hurts my heart because I had been so eager to come here.   A big group of myself and a bunch of other girls had decided that Easy Tiger was the place we wanted to support this night! I was so excited because, like I said, this was a top place on my list of places to go!  We had called the day of to make sure they could accommodate a large group. They said yes. We let them know when we were coming that night and how many of us it would be. All good (we thought)!  Our group starts to arrive at Easy Tiger and we realize that they thought we were coming the next morning and not the time we had told them. Okay, no biggie, we can fix this. We had also been told that there were only two servers that night. You could tell they were overwhelmed. We had made it clear that we wanted to make it as easy as possible for our server since there were so many of us. We were told that they would be able to give us two long tables next to each other so our group would be at least semi close. This didn't happen. Again, whatever... It just kind of sucked.  Now on to food! Yay! Most of us were starving. I can't speak for everyone else but I decided on the Pretzel. It looked so good in the IG photos. When it came out (fast if I may say), it was cold and not soft :( The cheese and other sides it came with felt like they were just taken out of the freezer. Inedible. Sad Ashley.  I drank a Peach Mule that was A1!! That was the highlight of my time here!  Would definitely come back, sit at the bar, and maybe order something different. I'm sure this was just a case of miscommunication and I'm excited to give them a second chance!"

The pretzel and beer cheese is the perfect snack if you're attending one of their weekly trivia nights. My personal favorite sausage is the kielbasa - it tastes as amazing as it looks. My favorite cocktail here is their aperol spritz, or one of their weekly beers on tap if I'm doing well in trivia and need to keep my brain on. Highly recommend!!!"

                "description": "The beer at here was pretty good. I liked the heavenly haze and my friend got the pog-slammer. Haze was a IPA similar to electric jellyfish from pint house. Pog had very citrus-y flavors which I liked. I also got the pretzel which was decently sized. The dips were good for the pretzel.  The bad part... the service. We ordered three beers the first time around, which took around 15 minutes to arrive. The beers weren't really cold at this point. I am not sure how that would be possible but I expect it to be the waiting staff seemingly lounging around talking to each other doing nothing. We asked for the waitress and it took an additional 10 minutes for her to arrive. We then ordered more food and drinks which took additionally extremely long amounts of time. The kicker was that there were two other seated tables so the place was basically empty. I would really recommend going to the 7th location over this one, at least while the current waiting staff is still doing what they did when we went.   Food was alright. Service was shockingly bad."

I accepted it but had wanted pre-sliced. There is a lot of construction underway and it makes parking cramped.   Also, I could not locate the curbside spots. I went to the host stand to pick up. Nearly got run over by an impatient driver driving around the \"Slow Down, Stay Awhile\" sign. Ironic.   The Winter Kale salad seems overpriced for the portion size. It is tasty, just on the small side.   The North side location is much better. Maybe this one will improve after construction."

We all shared a sourdough bread and wow it tasted so fresh and tasty! It was as if it was freshly baked (which I believe that's what they advertised) and it was more than enough to take home to enjoy for breakfast the next day. We also all shared the sausage sampler with the sauces that go with each sausage which I LOVED. Each of them had their own taste and they did an excellent job pairing them with the appropriate sauce.   As for my entrée, I ordered the prosciutto baguette which was quite huge! Very delightful, but I ended up not finishing it. Their bread portions are very generous.   Would love to come back!"

                "description": "A beautiful fall evening in Austin deserved a patio visit. We sat upstairs and the view didn't disappoint. We just missed the sunset but the sky was still stunning.  We grabbed some menus and decided on drinks and a giant pretzel. We also got the charcuterie board. My friend got a margarita which is said was 4/10 on a scale of margs. I tasted it and to me it tasted like a melted frozen margarita. Way too sweet for my liking. I wanted a cab (wine of choice) which they didn't have...I got a Malbec which wasn't horrible but I prefer a good bold cab.  The pretzel was great as always and the charcuterie board was well laid out. Neither one of us like the almonds. They had some sort of oil on them. What I really was sad about was the jam. I was hoping for a fig jam but it was not. My first bite was not good at all. I even asked the waitress what it was...she very nicely called down to the kitchen on her little mic and found out that it was a strawberry ginger jam. Those two flavors do not go together in my personal opinion. The ginger was way too strong and over powering.  The cheeses on the cheese board from Antonelli's Cheese Shop were on point. The goat cheese with honey was great. The blue cheese was yum and the Gouda was \"Gouda\".  ba dum tss.   Overall- this place is a no brainer for a casual night with friends over a pretzel and a beautiful view."

When their 6th street location closed I was so sad, but then like gremlins overnight they multiplied in the best of ways. Having an east austin, and south austin offering and more is such a boon.   We love their snacking/grazing boards. What millennial wouldn't? They're basically adult lunchables. Meats and cheeses and nuts and jams, oh my.   The pretzels and beer cheese are also legendary. But so much so that they sadly often run out of pretzels like they did for us the other day.   We love the use of covered and outdoor seating, especially in this time.   Wanting more substantial fare, they got you. The sausages, pastrami, the blt, all incredible. Really you can't go wrong. So, go!"

                "description": "Easter Sunday and no reservations? No problem. My friends and I decided to check out the new South Austin location of Easy Tiger. It was my suggestion and, thankfully, everyone loved it!  We started with a cinnamon knot, a soft pretzel with mustard, and a round of mimosas. The pretzel was out of this world! Warm, with a light sprinkling of Kosher salt, a crispy exterior and the lightest, fluffiest interior EVER!  We got it with a nice whole grain mustard; cheese was an optional side. The cinnamon knot was pretzel dough in a different shape with a sprinkling of cinnamon (it was savory, not sweet). Good, too, but it wasn't warm, so it got overlooked as we focused on the warm pretzel. As you can see from my photos, we were overcome with hunger and I almost didn't get a picture of the pretzel at all! It was that good.  We moved on to the Grazing Board, a side salad, and avocado toast.  The grazing board was truly a show stopper. It included a blue cheese, guyere, and brie, Prosciutto, sweet red grapes, dark and white raisins, slices of sour dough and walnut cranberry bread, tiny, tiny gherkins, candied walnuts, apricots, whipped butter and other toppings. It was visually stunning, but equally delicious. The house salad had the best, giant croutons and a light, delicious dressing with fresh greens, cherry tomatoes, radish slices. The avocado toast was a thick slice of grilled sour dough topped with a generous mound of mashed avocado, cherry tomatoes, and thinly sliced radishes. Delicious!  The space at the S. Lamar location is very nice, bright and open. There are several outdoor seating areas, so no problem finding a spot to sit. There might be an issue finding parking, as the parking lot is small (and each parking space is tiny!)  I cannot wait to go back and try some other things on the menu as everything I saw coming out of the kitchen looked good. I want to try it all!"

                "description": "This is a joint review from me and my partner. We went on two separate occasions. I went with my coworkers on a Thursday for an outing/birthday. The place itself is cute. Allows dogs. Twinkling lates. Cornhole off to the side. Just a cute, trendy, Austin-like place. But the experience was lack luster. The food took very long. The establishment didn't own enough cups, so part of us had to share cups or just didn't have water. The food was mediocre, save the fries. In this kind of weather, you should be prepared for flies to constantly fly around and land on your food. The drinks are also weak and the time between them will sober you up.   My partner went a separate time. This time I had three things to eat: a strawberry and goat cheese salad, French toast bites, and ricotta toast to share. The salad was ok, but smelled absolutely rank. Even the vinaigrette smelled super off, and not in a heavy-in-vinegar kind of way. The goat cheese wasn't the best, and frankly you could see the indentation of the packaging. The French toast bites bad poor texture. You'd expect to use a slightly stale brioche but instead was a baguette style. It was not soaked enough in the egg mix before cooking for it to have a fluffy texture. Instead, it was hard and unenjoyable. A poor quality baguette instead of the nice ones at real boulangeries. The ricotta toast was the best part, but still wasn't that great. Texture was also off, like an overcooked steak that takes too much force to rip apart. Not only that, but the food took 1 hour to get here.  At the end, they took his card and forgot to return it for 30 minutes. Couldn't get a hold of the waiter and left very late due to him forgetting about us.  Twice have they been very disappointing! Don't recommend this place unless you just want to waste money on a company credit card or take your young mother-in-law that you hate."

                "description": "What a gem on South Lamar! There are some business that have survived the pandemic, some that have folded, but there are very few that have creatively embraced it. Easy Tiger has gone beyond that where they started the business during the pandemic and built something absolutely majestic.   Drinks - Ofcourse the beer selection is amazing but the best part is that there is something for everyone. They have a great selection of wine and some really cool cocktails.   Food - This was a pleasant surprise. I have never heard my food snob wife utter the words \"This may be the best avocado toast I've ever had\" .. not just that the Brussels sprouts are a delight and the egg sandwich is really good too  Ambience - This is where they go from being great to phenomenal.. the outdoor area is a perfect setup and the best part is that they have a little kiddie park for the little ones. All this overlooking the green belt.. does/can it get any better?   One thing to add .. on a good day parking lot gets full very fast so plan accordingly!   A must must go for a nice sunny day or otherwise :)"

                "description": "SHAKE IT TILL YOU MAKE IT!   After dinner last night we decided on going bar hopping. I really don't know the places to go so I trusted my brother and his girlfriend's opinions here. They wanted to show me the places where they have gone on dates and enjoyed.   Whiskers was one of the first stops we made after dinner. My brother told me that this bar had plenty of different rooms that you could go into. So we first walked around and went into each of the rooms before ordering some drinks.   Me being the smart 25 year old that I am decided for the evening since I had already had vodka at dinner I was going to only drink white liquor for the evening because I did not want to screw myself and be really hungry over when my parents got here the next day. (HAHA)!   I looked over the seasonal menu and decided on the Sage Advice drink! It had citrus juices in it as well as vodka. And it was spectacular. All of the flavors in this beverage complimented each other very well. It is definitely one of those drinks I would classify as dangerous. If you had a few of those you might be on the floor. It honestly tastes like juice. So one too many might lead to you not being able to walk. So just be warned.   The inside of the bar was decorated for christmas. They went all out. There were chandeliers at the bars and lights everywhere and even one big christmas tree all decorated in white lights.   It is definitely one of those bars that you need to check out next time you are in Austin. I have only seen it with the holiday decor, but I am sure they decorate it all out for other holidays as well!   The staff and service was great! Very quick and easy. It is a busy bar so you might have to wait a few minutes to get a bartenders attention. But it it all worth it at the end of the night!"

                "description": "An East Austin staple with an eclectic and quirky décor.  If you are looking for a quiet, stuffy cocktail bar, this place is not what you're looking for (at least on the weekends). I would characterize it as sort of a slightly dressed up dive bar with some very unique vibes. The interior has the feeling of an old wild west sort of saloon, crossed with an old cathedral, crossed with an old hunting lodge. Past patrons have written messages on the walls and it is interesting reading some of their musings while sipping on an old fashioned. The exterior bar is fairly standard, although there is a random bath tub located in the middle of the backyard area, which is another interesting quirk.  Generally, the cocktails here are quite good; sometimes they pre-make the cocktails in a larger batch, cutting down on the wait time a bit. My experience has generally been positive with the pre-made cocktails.  One downside here is that it is very popular and is therefore quite crowded much of the time. During the busiest hours on weekend nights, you can expect to encounter a line to get in and another line to get drinks. That said, if you're with the right company, a few minutes wait for cocktails is pretty tolerable.  If you are visiting Austin, this is one good spot to check out to experience the \"charm\" of the area. Additionally, being on 6th, this place is very walkable to other bars and makes for a great place to start or end the night."

Waiting 30+ mins at the bar to order drinks is not fun.   The drinks themselves were just OK. Nothing spectacular or out of the ordinary. Not sure what the hype is about."

There is plenty of space downstairs, but if you really enjoy Mezcal head upstairs to the tasting room where an expert will line you up with a tasting based on your preference. A must visit in Austin."

Came here on a Saturday afternoon and had the best time getting some drinks while sitting on the patio. The bartenders are awesome and extremely helpful when ordering.   We ordered a few drinks, and we loved each one of them! They even offer happy hour 2-5 daily which includes an old fashioned, a gin lavender drink, mule, and many more. As we were leaving the lines for the bar were getting pretty long, however the bartenders move pretty quickly so the wait was not too bad. Love this spot, especially if you are looking for some unique cocktails."

The bar upstairs is a mezcal tasting room which has yet to disappoint me. The bartender will tailor your tasting to what you and your guests are interested in trying and also ensure that the space isn't too overrun by other guests. Push through the crowd and add this bar to your itinerary when visiting Austin and I can assure you won't be disappointed with the experience."

                "description": "I really enjoyed my drinks here, and the inside ambiance was awesome. It was a hot afternoon, and it got a bit uncomfortable inside (no a/c), but it would be an awesome place on a cool fall day (the four we have in Austin!). I tried the old fashioned first, having heard it was \"signature.\" It did not disappoint! My second drink was not as good (something to do with ambition in the name?), so I will stick to the old fashioned next time.   Also, I feel it's worth mentioning that I didn't feel any sort of discrimination. Having read some of the other reviews, I was a little nervous to visit as older than 30,  but I found no problems at all. I had no issues getting drinks. Only once did an employee act like a jerk because the inside bar was closed, but that wasn't readily apparent, and he got snippy that I was waiting there. He did it with others, too, though. I think everyone's experiences are valid, but my experience was not that this bar only caters to picture perfect 20-somethings."

                "description": "This was one of my go-to bars to take visitors in Austin pre-COVID and I am so happy that I have been able to visit now that bars are reopening (safely)! Definitely recommend going after dark because the setting of the inside of the bar is part spooky/part western-y/part old-timey and kinda makes you feel like you could meet a vampire in the corner... but in a cool way! I have had many different drinks from their set menu but admittedly their bartenders know high quality cocktails on and off the menu so order your heart's wishes.   My most recent order: - Twisted Nerve - Fancy, not-too-sweet, and so refreshing on a warm day! - Whisler's Old Fashioned - Smooth and will put some hair on your chest.  Give this bar a shot! Or take a shot... No judgement here."

                "description": "Last night my wife and I made the mistake of going to another cocktail bar that wasn't Whislers. Big mistake. ~$30 and 45 unimpressive minutes later, we hightailed it over to East 6th.   First thing I noticed is that they nixed their dinky parking situation to make room for even more patio tables. Perfect. It's not like Whisler's really needed the space, but with the interior bar unmanned and COVID in the air, it's a welcome addition.  I'm always surprised when people say the cocktails here are unimpressive. I don't know where else they are drinking (in ATX at least), but I'd appreciate a clue-in. Whisler's does a damn fine job; we always drink too much here because we can't stop sipping on inventive and tasty cocktails.   Last night's outing had two standouts I'd like to highlight. First, the Drab Majesty. With rum, cachaça (a fermented sugarcane liquer), beet, raspberry and lime, the drink struck a sweet spot between sweet and savory, with some carribean flair to boot. Next, the Feel Good Hit of the Summer, mint julep-inspired with an attitude. Couching the bourbon inside a fruity melangerie of cantaloupe, apricot, lemon and lemongrass made for a supremely sippable summer drink - a sublime libation if I ever had one.   Last note; I love coming to Whisler's and walking out having tried multiple types of alcohol I never knew existed. It's always fun to learn a thing or two!"

To my surprise, I got a great drink without the waiting part. I had a twisted nerve which was fantastic. Not sweet, not dry, just really smooth. The other patron in my party had an old fashioned and said it was perfect!  The prices are great for how strong the drinks are. The music and energy were reminiscent of the speakeasies. I definitely recommend and will be visiting this establishment again to try some of the other drinks on the menu."

I am not sure if there was an upstairs as we hang out on the lower level. Downstairs there's was two bars one inside and another outside in a tented area. The vibe here is very romantic and relaxed. It has almost a speak easy feeling about it. We ordered several drinks off the menu and loved all of them. The bartenders were all pleasant and kept up with the amount of people. I would not recommend if you are someone who gets claustrophobic though as it can get really packed. Whisper's is super loud and open very late."

The company is Military Veteran owned and a very family friendly property. There is a play area with a jungle gym and lots of picnic tables outside as well as a smaller covered outdoor seating area. I honestly didn't see an indoor seating area so I'm not sure if there is one. The covered seating area is where the bar was to order your drinks. They had about 12 beers to choose from some I did a flight of 4; 3 lagers and 1 stout. It was only about $11. The flight was four four ounce pours. They also serve some local wine if I recall.  There was a food truck on site serving up great bbq. I had their turkey sandwich and a cup of beans. Both were extremely good. The turkey was freshly smoked or bbq'd and perfectly tender. The beans was saucy with their sausage and veggies. For $15 I was stuffed. They also had small buzzers to give when ordering so you knew when it was ready and worked on the entire property.  I really want to return here on a warmer day and in the spring and/or summer. The same road this is located on also has a winery or two I believe so it would make a very good day trip or even weekend adventure to the area to explore all the local spots."

                "description": "This place was recommended to me in a local group I'm in with fellow America lovers!  The only thing I'm disappointed in is not knowing about it sooner. Great atmosphere, great service and great beers and I'm not a beer drinker. There is something for everybody.  When you visit a place like this your faith and hope in our country will be restored. The news and maybe even your own neighborhood/community could be negative or living in fear of what's to come, get out.. turn off the tv, hang around your fellow Americans and breathe in some good ol Texas Hill Country air! Does a body good. If that doesn't make your mouth water then stay home...   Food Trucks! Live Music! Veteran owned! Dog friendly!  Face friendly! Goof folks! Oh and beer!  Cheers!!! Merica!!"

                "description": "The area is nice and spread out with a ton of room for kids. We loved the shade and separation of everything. The idea that this was founded by veterans and gives back to veterans is amazing.  The beer itself, I was personally disappointed in. It was too \"heavy\", if that makes sense. We tried 3 and one I enjoyed but didn't love. It seemed like they were heavier/stronger than they should've been. Plus a lot of \"froo-froo\" drinks such as mead, etc. made up half their offerings. I get that you need some for people that don't like beer but they had too many."

What an awesome event with vendors selling all kinds of things, food trucks providing some delicious victuals, the Reed Meisters playing some great Polka music, and 12 Fox serving up some incredible beer. Without a doubt...12 Fox brews up some incredible beers. I really loved the Negro Sombrero. One of the best and smoothest beers I've enjoyed in a very long time."

They have many of their own beers on tap (featured beers change often) and they also feature other local beer, wine, cider and mead.  It's a family (and dog) friendly establishment featuring an awesome tactical playground!  They have food trucks, live music events, and seasonal family fun events.  We are happy to have them in our \"neck of the woods\".  The owners are kind and always welcoming! We hope they stay around for a long time to come!  They have over 80 picnic tables spaced outside across the property, so you can pick any table that fits your style!  Clean restrooms! Free to use water and ice machine!  Changing table!  Rona Rules! Great place to have an outside birthday party or celebration!  The list goes on and on!!!  At at time when our local businesses are struggling to stay afloat, and many are threatened with permanent closure, we are happy to support local business!  12 Fox has gone above and beyond to give back to the community, help neighbors, and support other small businesses at a time in need."

                "description": "Oh, what a great find! The hubs and were out brew hopping a few weeks back and we saw a sign on the corner of a crossing that stated \"12 Fox Beer Co\" [insert arrow]. Any of you who know me at all know my great penchant for craft beers, especially local, and I'm always up for a new brewery. So, turn left it was.  Parked in the large gravel lot. Walked up the trail to the building - HUGE kiddo playscape - I wanna slide! :) Very chill, nice place with a great patio and lots of other outdoor seating.   The proprietors/brewers are Army Combat Engineer veterans who learned about and found their love for beer while being stationed in Germany. Hence, they dozen lineup of Euro-styled offerings. They use single sourced malt and rainwater to create crisp, clean suds that aim to please. Of course there's hefe, pils, saison, dunkel...they also do a solid IPA.   Highly recommend! Really great folks, brewing their best, and serving one of the most outstanding charcuterie and cheese boards I've seen anywhere...no joke (and you might know that's also my \"thing\"). Go hang out in the Texas Hill Country, sip a cold one, get your snack on, and listen to live music on select nights. If a band isn't playing, some locals might start a impromptu jam session. What else could you ask for? Cheers!  Note: at time of last visit was informed they were going to have 2 food trucks on-site. Icing."

They allow more than the needed room based on the restrictions in place, and have so much open space, there is freedom to chose your seating. They are meeting or exceeding Covid restrictions, in every way and every day. Beautiful, well kept lawns, with trees and tables, its just a pleasure to visit. Delicious beer, great people, and the tastiest food trucks I have ever had. I highly recommend them."

                "description": "Brought the family here hoping to find an outdoor beer garden with lots of space: what ought to be the perfect COVID-safe situation for a relaxing evening. Instead we found a business observing no COVID safety precautions whatsoever other than a chalkboard a-frame asking patrons to stay 6 feet apart, a guideline which I seemed to be completely alone in observing. Not a single member of the staff was wearing a mask, nor were 95% of the clientele while ordering at the bar or moving around the establishment. No capacity controls were in place, and the place was generally indistinguishable from a pre-pandemic beer garden.   A ton of wasted potential here, it's a shame the business owners aren't interested in being responsible members of the community and taking basic safety precautions."

Plenty of seating, and you go up to the counter to order and get your stuff right away! This last visit we got the raspberry Meade, it wasn't too bad... Don't think I could drink too much of it though because it is so sweet. There's a playground for kids so parents can hang out while their kids have some fun too, lots of times they have a live band or singer playing. There's easily accessible restrooms, and a food truck if you get a bit hungry. Overall wonderful spot that's out of the way and away from the craziness... Just go here!"

The beer was absolutely amazing.   The beer was absolutely incredible.  They seem to focus primarily on Belgian style beers, which is my absolute favorite, but they have some IPAs that will appeal to the hipsterist of hipsters as well.   We also tried the Cranberry Mead as well as their cider, which was crispy and dry that would appeal to any lager or Pilsner fan.   The outdoor area was expansive and, frankly, beautiful.   The staff were very friendly, accommodating, and genuinely excited to share their knowledge.  It was fun to get their perspective on what I should try.    One thing worth mentioning...that I have seen in comments:   The folks behind the bar don't wear masks.  The order process is 6 foot distances, so no big deal for me, but some may have a problem with this.  Although I feel we are being extremely careful with covid guidelines, for some reason, I felt perfectly safe here.  Overall, I was extremely impressed with the quality of the beer, the beauty of the grounds, and the charming staff. This place will be a regular haunt for us."

                "description": "Not sure why people are giving more stars than this place deserves. If you actually read the peoples' reviews, they really meant to give less stars.   Here's why:  The pizza is just bar pizza. It's nothing special and if I'm being honest, I would have been much happier just going to Costco for pizza   Imagine your pizza covered in melted plastic that has cheese flavor. That's what's the pizza is like; bar pizza. Pizza you'd love to eat when hammered. It tasted like Red Baron.   Let's talk about the cocktails. I can't speak over every cocktail in existence but if they're anything like the margaritas... lol... don't order a cocktail. The margarita here was so bad, I'm sure my husband could make one better with margarita mix and Jose Cuervo. Gross .   I wish I could tell you that our experience here was fluffed with great service... unfortunately, that isn't the case. I understand being understaffed because of the C word, but I watched my waitress, and she was so inefficient, I was very tempted to get up and serve myself. Also, they weren't understaffed. There were plenty of servers for the lack of people that were present. Be prepared to sit for awhile staring at your feet until you can order anything. Be prepared to stay thirsty while you eat. Ask for everything you need from the start, or be prepared to not need it by the time you receive help.   Last but not least, the bathrooms. Those things are important, are they not?  they are to me. I will say, they are definitely public bathrooms. Have you ever been to a really gross gas station bathroom? Ok, then you know what these bathrooms are like. I wonder, does anyone even clean them? Oh well, we will just blame it on the C word this time around. ‍"

I also learned two things I've been missing in pizza, too.  I've passed this place dozens of times.  It sits on the fringe of a west Austin neighborhood and several apartments/condos between them and 183.  I believe it is affiliated with a restaurant that has a place in Fort Worth, too, but I might be wrong.  What I'm sure of my first visit there was killer!  I'm planning on going back when I can eat and drink a whole day away!  They have a great outdoor area with plenty of umbrellas and we chose a table.  The server acknowledged us right away.  We QR'd the menu and by the time we'd made a choice of food our beers were on the table and cold (good pour on the Guinness, btw).    We ordered a pizza of our own:  Sausage, mushroom, green peppers and spicy marinara sauce.  Okay, first... You know how some chain pizzas you have the ingredients all coming off together leaving you with less than even a cheese pizza?  Not here.  Every thing is chopped into small pieces and spread evenly over the entire pizza.  Every bite comes with a mouthful of exactly what you ordered.  Second, put some of that marinara on a piece of canvas and I'd eat it.  The spices brought everything together.  We got wings too.  Golden Buffalo.  Perfect heat! Crispy.  Meaty. Those wings were gone so fast I was looking at other tables to see if someone had snatch a couple off our plate LOL  We were licking the hot sauce off the plate.  I'M DOUBLING THE ORDER NEXT TIME!  Great service, cool vibe, good food!  Did I get lucky or find bar food Nirvana?  I dunno.  I'm going to rock a five star and adjust as I need to, but I'm not going to deprive myself of another visit here for sure!!"

                "description": "Fun Neighborhood joint.  This feels like a place where you'd walk in and they'd say, \"Norm!\"...if that were your name and you were on an episode of Cheers.  The beer was deliciously cold served in a thick glass to keep it that way. The pizza was generously embellished with toppings, and the crust was above average. The service was timely and courteous. I really liked the outdoor patio. Part of it is covered with fans, and part was uncovered with tables with umbrellas. The only drawback is there's a lot of road noise. We sat at a table as far away from the road as possible, and it was acceptable noise-wise. When our world health situation is better, I hope to see all the tables filled with large groups of friends enjoying pints and pizzas. For now, come check it out with your close friends and/or significant other."

It was way more laid back then I expected (place is always popping outside!!) which was great, I'm not for the \"pay twice what it's worth because we are fancy pants\".  Everything was very reasonably priced, and freaking delicious! We tried a few of the drinks (I tried a few of the beers) and it's safe to say I left tipsy and happy! Can't wait to visit this place again and try some new pizzas and beer!"

                "description": "My friends like this place, but I don't see the draw. The pizza is mediocre. Fortunately tonight I discovered their sandwiches are good. I got the Pourboy, with Fries. Everyone else in our group who wanted food ended up being in a sandwich mood, so the Chicken Parm sandwich got good reviews from two of the guys. The fries were well-seasoned and looked promising, but were a little cold and soft. Other times I liked the Fried Pickle Chips, but could only eat a few pieces before they got overpowering. It's not like we'd eat that many pickles out of the jar in one sitting! I think the server mixed up my friend's beer order. The final blow to this spot is that their outdoor chairs are wildly uncomfortable. I even brought my own seat cushion the last few times I came! This time it saved my butt, but my back still hurts. I'd give Pour House a 3.5 but I'm in a generous mood so I'm rounding up."

                "description": "At first glance, the interior of Pour House looked a little un-maintained. But, then of course, Austin. Where everything is underground. I was excited about the local beer list, though the stout selection was a bit thin. I went with Redhorn, a coffee stout that was a little short on stoutness for me. But, the flavor was good.  We ordered three 8\" pizzas to share: El Supremo, Hawaiian, and a Veggie pizza, providing plenty for two adults and two children. The pizza was quite good, as in Austin-good. I couldn't put my finger on it, but there was something unique about the flavor.    Our server was very good, personable and informative. We ate a late lunch, during which a growing number of what appeared to be regulars gathered mostly around the bar. The location is a bit secluded from the rest of Austin. But, it's near the technology district, where I was working for the day.  Parking was a little confusing because we approached the building from a side where the entrance wasn't visible. It's a private parking lot with plenty of space. Outdoor seating is available. Highly recommended!"

The environment was chill and not too busy during lunch time so that was a plus for us because we needed to be back for training within the hour.  Three of us ordered the Cubano and it was so tasty! I definitely enjoyed the pickles and pork amongst other fine ingredients they packed on that pizza! One of guys ordered the regular pepperoni pizza and he said he liked it a lot. The crust and dough of the pizza was cooked perfectly thoroughly.  There salads were delicious and portioned perfectly. When you arrive the parking is all in the back area pretty much, and you enter through the patio area. They have signs for you and that guide you to entrance."

Regardless, while the food tasted great, the portions (pizza and pizza rolls) were pricey for what we got. Paid over $50 for dinner (one salad, one small pizza, 3 very small pizza rolls and one dessert.)"

                "description": "Terrific pizza, but painful service.  BackDraft Pizza is wonderful pizza.  But, ordering it, customizing it, and paying for it is a pure pain in the ass.   I've gotten their pizza on at least three or four times over the past year.  And each time, the ordering process is a bad joke.    For example, last night, with a windchill of about 20 degrees, I stood in the ordering window for roughly 10 minutes, because the ordering app would not work.   After entering my debit card info including cell number and email address, there was no \"submit\" button on the app.  I handed my phone to the clerk and asked him to show me where to click it.    After getting my phone, he squinted at the screen, stating he didn't have his glasses, and couldn't read it.   We fumble with the app for another five minutes, with no success.  Meanwhile, I'm freezing my ass off.   Finally, after almost 15 minutes, the guy grabs the iPad, takes my card and enters the order manually, and then has to re-insert my debit card. Once they finally get the order, I ask how long it will be.  \"About 20 minutes\" he answers.  I look at my watch and it's 7:15.   At 7:40, 25 minutes later, I had not gotten a text yet.  Since I had waited more than 25 minutes, I went out to check on it.    I figured they'd have it ready by then.   Oh no!  It'd be another 5 minutes.  This was like the Seinfeld episode at the Chinese Restaurant.  \"Another 5 minutes.\"  I had to duck around the corner, to get out of the wind.  I had left my coat inside, as they had led me to expect the pie to be ready.   These as**holes  kept me waiting another 15 minutes, before they finally delivered the pizza, about 40 minutes after I first ordered it.  I thought I would freeze to death before they handed over the pizza.   It was terrific, as usual, but I won't be subjecting myself this type of suffering, because the Company can't get its app to work--and then subjects the customer to a consistent routine of misery, just to order one of their pizzas.  It's great pizza, but definitely NOT worth the labor required to simply ORDER ONE ONLINE.  The pandemic's nearly over. Perhaps it's time to junk the app, and TRAIN THEIR STAFF HOW ACCEPT ORDERS MANUALLY."

Our favorites are the Shrooms to the Moon (Mushrooms, Caramelized Onions, Sausage) and the Backdraft (Sausage, Pepperoni, Jalapeños) pizzas.   They are the perfect accompaniment to a pint of draft beer from whichever brewery is housing them at the moment.

My favorites were the Twisted Rita and Sweet Sow. The Shrooms to the Moon had some good umami to it -- it's the most flavorful, but a bit heavier than the first two. Also -- if you like pizza rolls, then I would definitely try the Rollin' Ronies.  I will definitely be ordering these again in the near future.  Note about ordering: I ordered online and picked up the food. I will say, however, that the order was not ready by the estimated time. Instead, you can wait for a text notification to pick up the order. I didn't know that, but now I do!"

                "description": "Looking at recent Yelp reviews, I was nervous about how this place would turn out. BackDraft did NOT disappoint.   First off, where is it? There is conflicting info on Yelp and their website. I called ahead because going to the wrong pickup spot would turn me into a hangry rage. They did not answer the phone but the host breweries did. CONFIRMED: They are currently located at Celis brewery.   We ordered 2 pizzas for pickup on Grubhub on a Friday night. BackDraft and pepperoni. They were ready in about 30 minutes. CONFIRMED: The pizzas were AMAZING. Like... hands down some of the best pizza I've ever had. Their homemade sausage and humongous thin pepperoni slices were phenomenal.  I can't speak for anyone else's experiences recently. It sounds like delivery may be questionable? But as of April 2021, if you can drive to pick up a pie, this is the place you need to go."

It's topped with House Made Spicy Sausage, Pepperoni, Fresh Jalapeños, but we also added mushrooms on ours.  It's a thin crust style pizza that is PACKED with flavor.  Our buddy ordered the Kale Yeah Caesar salad which he was very pleased with.  The guys that run this truck are really cool and definitely dedicated to their craft.  Backdraft Pizzeria is definitely up there on the short list of Austin's best pizza.  I'd be surprised if they didn't branch out and open up another location in the near future, especially in the downtown Austin area.  I would highly recommend giving them a visit and try their food.  How can you say no to a fantastic pizza and a frothy craft beer to go with it?"

                "description": "Had a craving for \"real\" pizza and BackDraft was in the top 3 when I did a search but it was the great reviews and photos that sealed the deal. We quickly ordered the Backdraft pizza, a pepperoni pizza, and wings. The order was delivered contactless and on time, hot and ready to eat. We've lived in Austin for almost 2 years and I've been disappointed by all the Austin favorite pizza spots but my days of yearning for good pizza are DONE. My husband and I are both now completely obsessed with Backdraft and I'm sure will be ordering it again very, very soon."

                "description": "TLDR: BackDraft is back, and they're better than ev-VAH!  I'm a longtime fan of BackDraft, even once calling it 'the best pizza you can get off a truck'.  That's damning with faint praise, as this is some of the best pizza in all of Austin.    Back when I first tried them, the food truck was parked down on 360 near Bee Cave.  But now that both I and they have moved to the north quadrant of Austin, and they're attached to an excellent brewery to boot!  By far, my favorite is a slightly altered 'Shrooms to the Moon', which is a triple-whammy combo of homemade spicy sausage, mushrooms, and carmelized onion. If you look at the picture, you'll see that the crust has the  right amount of 'char' or 'leoparding' as some call it.   Whoever's doing the pizza-slinging at BackDraft knows their stuff. Get down here when they're open, grab a brewski, and you're in for one of the best lunch combos that Austin can serve up!  Some Tips:  1) I said 'best lunch', but be sure to check their hours before you come. I'm pretty sure they just do lunch Friday and Saturday.  Otherwise, they follow brewery peak hours and just do evenings.  2) Try the Shrooms to the Moon but ask them to hold the caramelized onions.  Without the onions, you get a spicier, hotter pizza which goes perfectly with a pale ale beer to wash it down.  You'll end up with a pizza-nirvana feeling of a warm glow in your tummy.  This place scores a 5 out of 5 on the 'CTJ Scale', as noted below.  5 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Jesus good. Would be OK passing away after finishing a plate here. 4 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Mary good. Would be OK being seen eating here by Mother Mary. 3 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Joseph good. Would be OK having a beer here with Jesus' Dad. 2 out of 5 stars: Come-to-the-Apostles good. Meh. Wouldn't have my last supper here. 1 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Nobody good. I wouldn't have my penultimate supper here, either."

                "description": "At noon on a Friday, it only took 13 minutes to get my food. I got pizza and wings to go. This is one of the best pizzas I have had in Austin so far. The crust was very thin and had a good crunch to it. The sauce for the wings had a slight sweetness and wasn't too hot. I also appreciate that they put the buffalo sauce for my wings on the side, so that they wouldn't get soggy before I got home."

Lunch is from a food truck (trailer) on site. My group tasted reds and whites and all were very tasty. Food was good - had burgers and they were good quality. Setup was nice with covered tables outdoors or an indoor option. I didn't check out the brewery onsite but did see some guys partaking in the brews. I would not hesitate to return."

Anne was very welcoming and friendly. She also gave us information on other wineries/breweries/distilleries to try. I had the $15 flight of reds and she also gave me an extra cup of red wine, Needy B*tch, I ended up buying a bottle! I finally found a great bottle of red that I actually enjoy, sad that I can't get it shipped to me in California. Drippin' Sweet is also great, bought a bottle as well. Love the descriptions given to the wines it made them sound all delicious. And they were! (According to all the ones I tried)."

So we are there enjoying wine glasses, wine flights, food, the atmosphere. Everything about this place is so cute and amazing. But trying to get an Uber home seemed unlikely. Everyone kept cancelling on us and the bartender Ann or Annie (plus the last two customers) kept telling us that we were not gonna walk the 2 miles home. Annie made sure that we stayed till she closed and literally DROVE US BACK TO THE AIR BNB!!!. She was the sweetest thing and didn't even want to take any money from us. We had a back and forth of take it, no keep it, take it!! Haha I'm 80% sure I got the money in her cupholder before I left but I was the tipsy one so who knows haha. I really hope I did because driving us back to our Airbnb was above and beyond."

They have wine flight options or you can enjoy a glass if you chose. The server was incredibly knowledgeable and had great recommendations for everyone in our group. She let us try what we wanted before committing to our drink of choice. I ended up going to wine cocktail called the Texas Kiri and it fresh rosemary in it which I though was a nice touch! They also have live music outside and plenty of areas to sit and enjoy listening to it. Definitely try this place out!"

                "description": "We were in town for another winery quarterly wine pick up party.  That winery no longer allows you to open your bottles of wine at the party or allow dogs.  As such, it wasn't a great day.  We decided to go some place else.  We showed up around 4pm on a Sunday and had the entire place to ourselves. It is so cute.  I love the decorations and the vibe. We did the wine tasting which is $7 or waved if you buy a bottle of wine.  Megan was wonderful.  She was full of information and funny.  We had such a wonderful time we decided to join Bell Springs wine club.  Three bottles a quarter. No sign up fee. They have a wine pick up party that allows you to bring your dogs.  20% discount the first year and the discount increases every year you are a member.  Free wine tasting for you and four people either at Side Car or the winery itself. You also get to pick which three bottles you want. We signed up on the spot. What is NOT to like! We enjoyed many of their wines but really it was Megan.  She made us feel so welcomed and was so friendly.  Bell Spring treat her right, she is a HUGE asset to you.  We can't wait to attend our first wine pick up party.  Hope to make it to first Thursday soon and hang out at the Side Car.  If we lived in Dripping Springs this would be a weekly stop for us.  What a great place in this sleepy town.  We are so glad to part of their wine club and excited for the many cool events moving forward.  This should be a place to stop if you are in Dripping Springs."

                "description": "Dear Lort, why was it so cold during my visit to Austin when I stopped into Whip In? On an average sweltering Austin day/night I can imagine Whip In being the essential local spot for a quick beer or 5. With a great selection of beers on tap, along with extensive coolers for carry out, this place seems just great.  Apparently they have food too? Whip In should be the norm for corner stores/bars everywhere. Kudos fellas"

                "description": "Are you hungry and upset leaving empty-handed after waiting 45 minutes? \"Oh well\" will essentially be the response.  Ordered/paid for pick-up. No food or even an acknowledgement really of something gone wrong.  I think it's a management issue - just a waitress and cook were there to shrug and say maybe someone else took it.  Mistakes happen, but the lack of reaction leaves me baffled i.e. offer empathy or refund or comp...  Sorry, but y'all lost a neighborhood regular!"

                "description": "I ordered a to-go meal tonight via Postmates, and when I went to pick it up, I was met with extremely rude and disrespectful behavior by one of the bartenders. Upon arrival, I asked where I needed to pick up my food, and I was pointed to a shelf. The bag had my first and middle initial, but not my last name and was labeled UberEats. I asked them to find my order. With some back and forth, it was determined that my order had been mislabeled. Mistakes happen, and I understand that. As I'm trying to sort this out with a female bartender and a cook, the other bartender, a tall burly man with a beard, a Marlboro hat and a camouflage shirt rudely shoved the bag of food at me, cutting me off, and said, \"this is yours\" and turned around and walked off.   I supported this business at the beginning of COVID by shopping in their makeshift grocery store, and even buying t-shirts. I only recently acquired a taste for Indian food, so I was excited to try it tonight. I will never be back. I was also told they don't have a manager around, nobody is in charge, and as I searched online for a way to contact anybody running this place, I came up empty."

                "description": "This is a unique locally grown spot that is worth a visit in South Austin. Prior to the pandemic a popular spot to catch bands on the outdoor stage, not too sure about the music situation right now. The Whip In is a corner beverage depot with a quality selection of craft wine and beer. If I may add, a very quality selection of wine and beer. If you want to expand your palette and try  a new craft beer or wine, def stop in. Very large selection of chilled rose, which I found impressive. The selection of beers by the glass is also impressive. This is a very cool spot to come in and meet friends, and grab a pint. The Whip In is also an Indian restaurant. The quality of the food is not a 5, but a 4. If you are looking for great Indian food there are better options, but the overall experience here and what it offers is above average and worth a visit."

                "description": "Really disappointing tonight at the Whip In. I think it was an off night? First off, the draught board which is usually full up to 70+ was very scarce, so not sure what was going on there.  We ordered the chicken vindaloo and chicken shawarma. I was confused when our food came out for 2 reasons: 1) I wasn't expecting a wrap and fries for the shawarma- just was expecting rice since the menu didn't describe it as a wrap, but whatever - my bad 2) it came in takeout containers with only one set of silverware (plastic)  I went back inside to ask for another set and also asked if why (out of curiosity) the presentation had changed to takeout containers. I was told \"it's a covid thing\". I tried to explain nicely that I understood - but have only been in Austin since covid and have come every week or so since January, always with plates etc. She repeated, seeming annoyed with the question, that it was a covid thing, shoved me two mini plates and some silverware and walked away. Ok, cool!   I'm only giving a 3 because I have been here 6-7 times, always with a great experience. Tonight was a 1 star for service, but honestly food was below par as well. Leaving a sad customer :("

But ever since the new owners came in, fired the management staff, TOOK TIPS FROM PEOPLE THAT EARNED THEM, and the outstanding amount of disrespect I see to their employees- I'm never coming here again. Or the Quickie Pickie because they own that too. And they treat those employees horribly as well. I can't believe the things I have seen and heard the owners say!!

Nice, clean restrooms (a very pleasant surprise). Easy parking. Convenient location. It has everything. The food is genuinely good whether you're getting standard bar fare or the tasty Indian specialties. We hope to return when a band plays on stage, but we had the best relaxed lunch on the covered patio on our way out of town. Who knew you could find a little calm oasis so close to the interstate? It's quirky and perfect."

                "description": "This might be one of the hardest reviews I've ever made. I have come to the Whip In for years (I still remember playing a show here when I was a kid in my father's band and having one of best and most interesting Indian fusion chicken fried steaks of my life) and always appreciated (and still do) what they're doing. But the prices are just getting too damn high.        As of the past week, every single beer on tap has risen by a price of roughly $3 on average; essentially the base price for any beer on tap STARTS at $8, and without a doubt that's the highest I've seen at any establisbment in Austin, and I have been to an uncountable number. I also had their $12.99 Kurma (also known as Korma in some resturaunts) and it was good, but more like a $8.99 Korma at Tejis as fas as quantity and depth of flavor goes.        Make no mistake, this is an indesputed historic establishment that's likely also struggling with COVID and I'll still support it, but seeing these changes is just disheartening and it's getting harder and harder for me to justify still stopping in on the weekend."

                "description": "Whip-In, what happened? I've lived down the street from this place for a year and have come at least once a week. It has steadily declined. Constant staff turnover, and the menu and beer selection has shrunk to basically half of what it was.   The food in particular is a shadow of what it used to be. Tonight, after finding out they didn't have any of the specials on the board, we ordered chips and queso and after bringing us one order, they brought us a second mistakenly? Both had stale chips and the queso was burnt. I asked for no cilantro in my dish due to an allergy and it was absolutely lousy with it. Tried to drown my sorrows with a beer and was served the wrong one.   Honestly, not sure what changed but this place isn't what it used to be. Hopefully it's just an off night, but I've thought that several times in the past few months and it's only become worse."

I ordered a chicken tikka masala curry along with two beers - Belgian ale and a wheat. The CTM was a decent size and quality for the $12 tag. I'll definitely come back again to relax with friends and my doggo in the future. I thought the fridges in the back full of beer was pretty cool.  TLDR - decent food and draft beer selection - bunch of freezers with lots of beers and shelves of wines - cool music - had one TV inside from what I could see"

The beer selection for purchase might be my favorite in town that I have found so far. They carry my two favorite breweries which aren't found many places and then have a multitude of beers on tap, too! I love the tarot card feel at each of the booths and then the perfect little patio outside.  Dog friendly, live music when the world is allowed to sing again, and Indian food? You would never know.... we brought some friends here recently and quite honestly... this might be my new little \"let me take you to a local spot we love.....\" for our guests. Go. Have a beer. Buy some to take home.... and definitely get some garlic naan."

This place has a little bit of everything, from beers to ciders, wines, and even serving beer on draft as well. They also have a nice little courtyard on the side which looks fairly pleasant. Overall definitely enough beers in stock to keep you busy, only thing I've noticed is that their price point is a little higher than say Specs by $1-2 on various beers."

You walk into a beautiful large spacious entrance where all of their vodka is on display. In the mornings they have a build your own bloody Mary bar which is definitely where I'll be camping out. The other drink we tried is one of their slushy's, the hurricane. Don't be fooled... These are doubles and they sneak up on you fast! The sugar to alcohol ratio is on point.  For the pregnant and nursing ladies there's three different mocktails, and friendly bartenders that are willing to put together anything your heart desires. The food menu is great! A little bit for everyone. Salads, soups, even a box for kiddos. Outside is beautiful spacious and open all of the live oak trees are immaculate and the space is well laid out.  They have one small play place for kids, lots of yard games and lots of different areas to sit and hang out. Including a turf area. This place is definitely want to come see!!!"

The clean, pure taste is better than Tito's and we will miss having this when we move soon. The tour was great, and informative. Our tour guide was nice. I wanted to ask him to take our group picture, but in the hour we had our tour, he rubbed his nose, scratch his nose, and touched his nose every few seconds. It was gross. So we didn't get a single picture bc I couldn't ask him to hold my phone! Other than that, the tour was great!!!!!  I rarely leave a review, but this would change someone's mind on whether they would ever come back somewhere these days. I love this company too much not to help them change it!"

We go to deep eddy's every time and have never looked up any other distilleries in the area but I'm so glad we did this time. The property itself is gorgeous and it is coupled by the fact that there liquor is also very good. Ryan had the flight and had their 2 bourbons which he said were okay and then he had the traditional gin which we really liked. They have their cocktails on tap and I got the Raz N Shine cocktail which was made with their orange vodka and was absolutely delicious. We ended up getting another flight of the rest of their liquors after that, and I'm so glad we did because their straight vodka is so good. It's so smooth you could drink it straight. We will definitely be back next time we are down!"

                "description": "Dripping Springs Distilling is just now opening its spanking new tasting room, patios, entertainment venue and production facility, and it is splendid. I went there four years ago, when the tasting room was essentially the lobby to the distillery. While I great.y appreciated what they were doing with their gins and vodkas, the ambience was like drinking in the lobby of Atscott manufacturing in Pine City, Minnesota. This new facility reshuffles the entire deck.  It has taken them a while to complete, but it was worth it. The new venue is spectacular -- well designed, comfortably modern, spacious and welcoming. It's not only a tasting room, it's also a credible restaurant with an interesting menu, specials, and a exceptionally friendly staff.  We went on the second weekend of the 'soft 'opening', but they seemed to have already worked all the kinks out. They were welcoming and prompt and attentive. Our server, Jack, went out of his way to answer questions, including about plantings on the grounds and ingredients in the dishes, and to offer suggestions about cocktails.   I had the street taco daily special and an Electric Lady cocktail. My companion had the jalapeño cornbread muffins and a French 75. The street tacos were small but fully packed. The spice mix could have been spicier,  it then I like hot. The flavors though were indeed special. Nothing dominated, so you could appreciate the protein and still enjoy the comity cheese and the light drizzle of sour cream. The tortillas were a bit small, but you expect that in a street taco. My friends jalapeño corn muffins were excellent. A well constructed corn muffin with one slice of jalapeño that came up and kicked your butt on the after palate. There were plenty of them, so we took lots home for later. The regular entre menu is interesting enough (two different pot pies, additional comfort type foods) that I'll be back.  I should not forget the flight of spirits. I've always respected their two gins, and I often buy them as they are available at Twin and Specs. Very solid, unpretentious and well crafted. I'm not a vodka guy, but my friend liked their offerings. Their 1876 bourbon still needs some maturation and work though. But such is the case with whiskey.   The full grand opening is coming up, with all the hoopla expected. Once the noise is past, Dripping Springs Distilling, with its multiple brands and spirits, will be a destination you'll want to add to the itinerary."

We booked a tour, which turned out to be very informative and Talon was a great guide!  The only (teeny) downfall of the tour was the distillery was operational that day and was a little noisy and difficult to hear our guide.  We enjoyed a cocktail and lunch on the patio.  I had the Basil Sour and my husband had an Old Fashioned.  We both had the grilled cheese and tomato soup.  Everything was delicious!"

Talon, our tour guide was so knowledgeable, engaging and witty. We started with drinks prior to the tour and Miley was so outgoing and welcoming. The follow up lunch and drinks topped off the afternoon. The food was delicious and our server Jake was so accommodating. Everyone enjoyed the beautiful grounds and tried their luck with the cornhole boards. It became a bit of a competition! The group said the day was superb and the quality of the gin rivaled the best from across the pond."

Unfortunately, our plane flight was cancelled the day of our arrival.  We were very disappointed.  I called the manager, Kristi Quick, and she accommodated us completely.  Seldom do you see such actions any more.  She took some time our of her busy day to let us sample the spirits and even gave us some great local restaurant recommendations for lunch and dinner!  Her gracious hospitality was very much appreciated.  This is now going to be my vodka of choice..."

I think it's so versatile you could bring family and kids here, or turn down in the evening with a hot date for a nice dinner.   The cocktails are very good. I had the \"Room Service\" which is a refreshing gin cocktail.   The smoked salmon appetizer was sooooo good with the saltiness from the capers, perfected toasted ciabatta, and perfectly cooked egg. Highly recommend!   The Shaved Prime Rib sandwich was very good as well, and my son had ordered the Turkey pastrami sandwich, which was also very good!   We sat at the bar and the staff was top-notch. Friendly, attentive, intuitive and on their game!   I recommend this place for any occasion."

(there was a 5 min wait for tables not bad )  I ordered the peachy mimosa and added a tequila shot it was perfect . My boyfriend ordered the breakfast sandwich he  loved it For food I ordered the hash bowl another great choice no complaints ( it did take a while to get your food which is the only reason for my 4 star review ) but the wait worth it . Bartenders were friendly and available."

                "description": "Culinary Dropout, more like you'll wanna Drop In...bad puns aside, easily one of the best places in the Domain to gather a group of friends and enjoy their very spacious patio. Certainly compliments the great food they have to serve as well.  Atmosphere: Very fitting of the domain and Austin, modern hipster style so very open with a nice view of the domain surroundings. Live music is played on occasion as well, which really makes for that feel of a local flavor styled joint.  Food: Having come here several times and trying most their food items, you can't really go wrong with any particular choice, just whichever suits your craving for that moment. My personal favorites though is the Fried Chicken. Most certainly worth the wait, and comes with flavorful mashed potatoes and gravy mmmhmmm. Meat is well cooked with good texture and doesn't have an overly heavy taste or feel that most deep fried foods commonly come with.  Service: Every time I've gone services has been great. Staff is friendly and can help accommodate any assistance or questions you may have.   Hungry around the domain and need a place that will leave you full with a good experience? Drop-in to Culinary Dropout. Perfect for anyone seeking a casual and enjoyable night."

                "description": "Joined folks for lunch and I think I went wild on the appetizers that I was full when it came time for the main dish. We ordered the Brussels, deviled eggs, and  bread, my sister ordered the kale salad with steak and my friend ordered the chicken bbq salad.   So I'll start with the bread - it's grilled and has some balsamic on it. A little salty but good. The deviled eggs came 3 to an order and I love a good deviled egg but this was \"meh\" at best. Seems like it needed a little more seasoning and there wasn't anything special about it. I will say I'm not usually a fan of brussel sprouts but these aren't mom's brussels. These were fried and then tossed in a sauce (Korean go-guchang) and is a little spicy but oh so good. The kale salad was a lot of small pieces of kale, the steak was tender but I can't say I'd order it again (or steal it off my sister plate). The chicken salad was good and came with a deviled egg.   Overall, it was a good lunch - we did order 4 drinks and the total came up to about $100.   We were able to sit outside on the porch under a heater which made it a great atmosphere. I will say that I saw the chips and dip and will come back to try that."

The outside patio \"pre-COVID\" had lots of games for guest to play. There's enough TV's to watch sports from anywhere you're sitting. I recommend ordering the fried chicken and homemade mash potatoes. I think it's their most popular dish. The dish is fried to the perfect level of crisp, and it's very juicy!  I also like their salmon!  As far as the drinks, if I'm not ordering my usual Austin Eastcider, I'm getting their jalapeño margarita! One of the best in town!   The vibes are always good here."

I was happy to see CD had an Austin location!  We came on a week night and it was still pretty crowded. Wait time was about 30 minutes, so that gave us some time to walk around and do some window shopping at the Domain. Once we were seated, we put it our order right away.  Pretzels and Fondue: The softest pretzels!!! Perfect for dipping in the provolone cheese sauce. We actually got 2 rounds of these as they were that good.  El Matador: tequila, elderflower, ginger agave, and orange bitters. This is my favorite drink here. Has enough of a fruit taste without being overly sweet. And the bartender made it with a lot of love. Lol. Only 2 drinks and I was finished for the night.  Our server was really great and kept checking on us throughout the night. Fun crowd. Fun music. And a really fun time."

                "description": "Just tried to eat here tonight (Tuesday 2/15). Got here around 7:30pm and was told there was a 30 minute wait- no problem we waited. At 8pm on the dot we got a text our table was ready. We were seated and already knew what we wanted so the second our server came over we ordered, maybe 8:05pm. We saw tons of dishes coming out but figured with how busy it was it might be a bit. At 8:35pm someone (not our server) came over and told us \"so sorry about the wait, you're up next\" we waited 15 more minutes after at least 15 orders came out and finally couldn't stand it anymore and left. We wasted an hour and a half and still left hungry.   The sad part is this is not the first time we've experienced bad service here. Last time we came here with a reservation and were sat outdoors when we reserved an indoor table. 20 minutes passed and no one came to our table even though multiple servers passed us. We asked a girl who was clearing tables if there was someone who could take our order and she came back and said no one wanted to so she took our order. I guess that should've been our red flag last time not to visit again but we love the food and gave it another chance.   We've been to Culinary Dropout at several locations in Arizona and never experienced anything like this. The Austin location definitely doesn't hold the standards of the others. We won't be returning and suggest you don't either unless you have 2-3 hours to spare to wait for your food."

I didn't love the pretzel bread with cheese \"fondue.\" The cheese seemed like the fake cheese you get in prepackaged containers/baseball games. The pretzels were slightly warm but were a bit dry. Would not recommend.   We both had the Turkey pastrami and didn't love or finish them. I had the French fries and they were good and friend had the side salad and said it was good."

                "description": "Originally was going to stop for a quick lunch but got ahead of ourselves when looking at the menu.   Brussel Sprouts (3/5): not crispy like I expected it to be but the flavor was solid and unique.  Salad (4/5): they made kale taste good. that's impressive!   36-hour Pork Ribs (3/5): very sauce-y and therefore, very messy. At least the flavor was decent. The ribs itself were are not very tender.   Steak Frites (3.5/5): not bad but also not great. The salad on the side was great tho.   Korean BBQ Skirt Steak (4/5): lots of flavorrrr. Better than the Steak Frites. The meats on these two dishes actually tasted the same but this one had sauce. I actually liked this main the most out of the ones that we tried!   Overall, chill spot for a nice dinner with friends. I would rate this place a 3/5 for the food but probably bump it up because of the ambiance. There's lots of space and a few games to play so the vibes probably make up for the food."

Eventually we were  seated and our server was super friendly.  We ordered a couple of drinks to start. I didn't care for my cocktail two to mango at all. Hardly tasted the fruit flavors of pineapple, guava, orange or the mango white claw, since it was so overpowered by the vodka. I just passed the drink onto my son. We put our order in for our meals and it took quite a bit of time for the meals to come out. We had to flag down our server to find out what was going on. She mentioned they had many orders and were backed up.  We were a bit disappointed when our meals arrived. My burger was super dry and my son's salmon dish looked like an appetizer. The portion size of the salmon was small and the amount of risotto it was sitting on sad. We left very hungry. Service was slow, food and drinks are overpriced. Not sure we'll come back."

                "description": "We had a party of 8 at 1:30 pm on the Friday of ACL weekend. It was pretty packed, but they were able to accommodate us. Service was great!  Here's what I tried: - Evil Jungle Princess ($13): This fruity rum drink was good! - Soft Pretzels and Provolone Fondue ($13.25): The pretzel bread was good. The cheese was good. $13.25 is a lot for what it is though. - Gojuchang Brussels Sprouts ($6): It maybe came with 5-6 total brussels sprouts. It tasted good, but super not worth it. - The M.A.C. Burger ($14.50): Their take on a McDonald's Big Mac. It was good!  Fun vibes. Convenient if you're staying in the Domain."

Culinary dropout is great. We love their grilled asparagus, it comes chilled and their seasoning plus whatever methods used really brings out the sweetness of asparagus.  Fish and chip is the real deal, been to many places and felt disappointed, NOT here. Pure deliciousness and we can't wait to come back for more!   Sorry for my rather short reviews nowadays, my hands are kind of full lol"

                "description": "10-25-21  Quality/Quantity - Gochujang Brussels Sprout - I would have preferred the brussel sprouts to have been a little more crispy. Could not really taste the gochujang flavor, not spicy at all. Kurobuta Pork Ribs - My favorite, good flavor. Would have preferred more fries though. Spicy Vegan Curry - My daughter's choice, I guess it was good, but not something I would have ordered. Had a hint of lemon grass after taste, which is a little different from Indian or Thai Curry. Separated rice versus rice combined in the sauce is also preferred, so we can control the flavor.  Atmosphere - This is a very good spot. I like both the indoor and outdoor space. There were a few activities (cornhole, etc) for the guests. I like the choices of seating - regular tables, high top tables, bar seating, couches, etc. Additionally, your huge wrap around bar was nice. Lastly, I am always a fan of an open kitchen concept.  Service - Julia did a good job; she came back and refilled our water often. It was really busy and the entire team seemed to be working hard. I also noticed 2 employees picking up garbage as they walked back and forth serving customers, this is always a positive plus.  Price - $49.80 + tip  Owner Suggestion - Seems like you are very successful, owning quite a few restaurants. Congrats on all your success, and wish you many more. I look forward to trying your other restaurants in the future."

Place was very busy on a Saturday night - multiple parties out on the porch.   I still dream about their chopped chicken salad! - so good!    They have a big drink menu with cute cocktails. Staff was so nice and my dog loved all the loving he got from everyone there.   It's definitely a casual/loud/fun ambiance!"

                "description": "This is one of the biggest bar/restaurants I've ever been to in America! They have indoor seating and half outdoor seating (it's \"outside\" of the restaurant but still covered on all sides - great for when it's cold out!   It's a cool bar with live music and games but my favorite part is the food!   We got the cheese fondue that came with a bowl of pretzels and it was nothing I expected at all - pretzels are okay at best usually and most places has cheese that taste gross but this was the best pretzel/cheese combo I've ever had!! The pretzel balls were pretty big in size from what I was expecting, they were warm and perfectly seasoned and delicious! And then the cheese - wow I could literally drink a jar of it if I wasn't my age and getting heartburn everyday as is. I haven't stopped thinking about the pretzels and cheese since my first bite! I definitely want to go back to Austin just for this dish.   And then for entree my boyfriend and I split the butternut lasagna and they were so nice enough to split the dish for us without us having to ask.   Oh yeah and for drinks (I forgot to take a pic) but we got the Smashed Irishman and it was so good we ordered 5 through out dinner.   The staff was really nice and the place was super busy so some things took a little longer to come out and we were forewarned before ordering anyway."

To my husband and my luck there were 2 seats open.  It was Sunday around 2ish and there was a guy singing with his guitar.  The speakers were amazing you can hear him inside and out on the patio.  Friendly staff. The food was so good. My husband and I are some carnivores but today we both ordered vegetarian options  Don't let that fool you. Both dishes were packed with flavor. My favorite was the vegetarian spicy curry. Holy cow was it good. So good. Would definitely visit again!!"

This is a great place for large groups. More bar than restaurant.   Cocktails were tasty and reasonably priced. Large selection of beer on tap. The menu is a little thin, and our brunch items weren't anything special.   Service was top notch. We'd come back for happy hour, but probably not for a meal."

And some sort of food options. I'm not impressed with the bar service either. They have a barrier up for a line, but they don't actually use it.    Highly recommend orange, lemon, sweet tea and peach vodka.   It's not a bad stop for a drink. But only get one. There's a cop in the parking lot waiting to nab a drunk driver."

My favorite is probably the peach vodka and they have many cocktails to choose from. We went on a Sunday where there were local vendors there too as well as live music. Head to Dripping Springs for the great tasting room. Unfortunately, the distillery near Buda is not one that is open to the public, so the tasting room is where to go."

                "description": "Like I was saying earlier, I find tasting rooms gimmicky and this one is a perfect example of it.   We chose to come here because I have deep respect for Deep Eddy as a company for their commitment and contributions to the local community. They've gone above and beyond again and again. Respect!  The tasting room is a large hall, with flights consisting of tiny cups of flavored vodka. You don't taste the actual spirit because the fruity flavors are so sweet.   The \"Colombian\" food options on-site is a joke. It's an old school concession stand (movie theater of the 80s style) with heat lamps keeping nacho chips warm on a folding table. Don't expect tacos or empanadas.  The space, both indoors and outdoor, is quite large. And they have a cute performance stage inside.  We stayed a total of 15 minutes."

Bartenders are very friendly and fast but the drinks are simply made and during Covid they are all touching the mint in their hands by smacking it. Id rather a gentle crush/roll in a glass... felt a bit gross (others commented too).

                "description": "Finally I was able to make it out to the distillery with my good friend early on a Saturday so that we could get some direct tasting vodka notes from Deep Eddy themselves rather than me taking shots at bars around Austin.  Parking was easy for us but do note that we showed up around 11:20AM on a Saturday so we didn't have any issues.  The later you arrive parking could be a thing and you may have to wait/stalk someone who is leaving to get a spot. Also as the day got later there were many buses and charter vans parked in the front and roundabout chilling out as the company they are driving around are inside getting down too.  Cocktails in a paper cup runs $8 with plenty to choose from the menu that is thoughtfully laid out in sweet, sours, spicy, etc. A nice mason jar with the Deep Eddy logo is $12 and slightly larger.  Do know that they will not refill your mason jar after you buy your first one so be prepared to be clanking around the distillery with your extra mason jars if you keep going the $12 route. Also be careful with your glass too - I saw many people let that mason jar slip out of their hands and the mason jar just crash on the concrete floor. So sad! Also frozen drinks / cocktails can only be purchased downstairs so be ready to wait in a little line if it is busy.   Loved the areas to sit inside the tasting room and even in the 2nd large downstairs area.  The pillows, decor, and the small touches around the sitting areas on the first floor are super cute and selfie-worthy.  I can imagine in the winter, with the large fireplace going, this space is cozy AF!  We didn't go outside at all as it was super hot in July but it looked like there are plenty of tables, shade, and seating for some large groups both in the front, side, and back areas.  After 2 cocktails in a mason jar we were feeling a good buzz and knowing we still had to trek back home (south Austin) we cut it off there. By the time we left around 2pm the place was buzzing with people, all 3 bars had 10+ waiting to be served, and I wasn't planning on waiting to close my tab in a long line.  I was super surprised to find out you can close your tab at the merch area with the cashier there so don't fret and add in that mug, stickers, shirts, bar additions, and Deep Eddy cool pool lady in red signage to your basket to check out while you close out your tab. You will save yourself some time and be out of there in a jiffy!  We plan to come back especially now knowing they are opened on Thursdays at 11am!!!!"

The set-up is gorgeous and feels so clean when you walk in. You get a behind the scenes taste of where the best Texas vodka comes from. The staff was kind and knowledgeable. They answered any questions we had about the drinks. I ordered a $10 flight and my Husband got the Orange dreamcicle drink. You have the option to get your drink in a mason jar as a keep sake.  There is a great gift shop on site, so we got matching shirts because we are cheesy like that.  There was a delicious food truck out front that had Vegan and Meat Eater options available. I like that they cater to both.   There is so much to do in the surrounding area. We went thrifting and enjoyed the nature that Hill Country has to offer."

We are already big fans of Deep Eddy's vodka and all of their flavors, so we had no doubt we would enjoy our time there. The cocktails they serve at their bar are innovative and refreshing. I ordered the Spring Sling and he ordered the Austin Mule. We both enjoyed the drinks next to the patio where they had multiple groupings of chairs spread out on the lawn. Other than drinking, there's not much else to do here, but it's definitely a lively place to enjoy a drink with friends! Our bartender was also very kind and helped us choose the right cocktails for each of us."

The weather was perfect and they have a nice little patio area. The spot is family friendly meaning you can bring your kids, but there isn't a lot for them to do except run around in the patio area. I would have liked if the patio area was fenced off and not open to the parking so I could relax a bit more. I had to keep a close eye to make sure my kid didn't wander off. I enjoyed both of the drinks I tasted and would definitely stop in here to explore more of the tastings, but will likely leave the kid at home next time."

FINALLY this past weekend we got there when they were open! Oh we were so excited and the place lived up to the hype. The seating atmosphere both inside and out is very roomy and comfortable. All the staff is friendly and easy-going. Everywhere including the bathrooms were incredibly clean. The cocktails... the cocktails are downright amazing. They're inventive, delicious, and fresh. You're going to have a hard decision to make no matter what kind of drinks you like... I actually ended up ordering two at once because I couldn't decide! On the way out, we stopped at their little gift shop and man do they pack that area with goodies! Talk about variety and options. The shirts are awesome and made very well to boot, and they have tons of other merch. I left with a soft tanktop, a wicked fun tin can that I plan on using for a cactus or succulent vase, a magnet, and a collapsible dog bowl! We'll be back every chance we get. Loved it, loved everything, love the vodka."

                "description": "‼PSA: NEVER go to the Deep Eddy's Vodka Tasting Room!!‼ HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED AS A REGULAR DEEP EDDYS ENTHUSI  My friends and I went out to celebrate Maddy Montgomery's 22nd birthday and were harassed by the manager for being \"underage\".   The whole group willingly gave our ID's for inspection and the birthday girl's ID was \"questionable\", so she was taken to a cop car by a Sheriff, put in the back and questioned.  While Maddy was at the cop car getting her ID verified, the rest of the group had our full drinks/cups (that we paid for and were able to take home), snatched out of our hands. We all requested a refund for the drinks and were denied??  After the Sherriff verified that Maddy's ID was real, the manager proceeded to threaten tresspassing charges against us??   I have never experienced anything like this and would love to be contacted/reimbursed for the mistake that was clearly made."

                "description": "Our Jeep club organized an event at this establishment, anticipating a fun and enjoyable experience.  Wrong!  I will preface that this whole COVID thing has still, for some reason, has some still on edge.  However, this place has taken it to new heights.  While the great state of Texas has opened to 100%, this place seems to have missed that memo.  We literally got yelled it for actually standing up at our tables and told that if we do stand to have a mask on.  Additionally, we got yelled at for moving a table.  The guys exact words were \"I'm picky where our furniture is placed.\"  Additionally, if you want to get a beverage, you actually have to MAKE A RESERVATION just to go in get one.  That is ridiculous!  By the way, the Hays County police are on site to enforce all of this over-the-top nonsense.  Most of us stayed for a single drink and then left for better and more fun pastures.  It's obvious that this place has forgotten all about who the consumer is and how we should be treated.  Not only will we never go back, but I am never going to purchase any of their products again.  By the way...the Jeep community here in Texas is very tight-knit and we will talk..."

Jarrod, the bartender, and Sam, the waitress made us feel at home and I made what was it looking like a pretty bleak Christmas Eve into a wonderful party night. Between the two of them, awesome awesome is the only word that I can use to describe the feeling of hospitality on Christmas Eve, it saved our night and made us loyal customers of crown and anchor whenever we will layover in Austin or visit.  Bravo and Cheers to Jarrod and Sam. We will be back whenever possible! Thank you!"

                "description": "I have been driving by CandA up to 4 times a day on my way to/from work for years now and kept thinking \"we need to go, we need to go\". We finally decided on a random Tuesday to pop in after work and we're kicking ourselves for waiting so long! This place was so great! They have QR code menus on each table for both food, and beer, and they were so user-friendly, and easy to navigate. The tables are spaced out, and there's seating on the front deck, under the cover on the patio, and some inside as well. The staff was seriously THE friendliest we have encountered in Austin, especially during COVID times. They checked on us regularly, and basically made it so we never had to go in and order anything, because they were SO on it! They are amazingly, over the top, dog friendly!!! It's one of the few spots we can sit under cover with our dog, they have tons of water bowls, free snacks, and they even brought him out a very special snack from the kitchen! They gave him lots of love, and were happy to have him there.  We ordered cheeseburger baskets with fries and they were so delicious! The portions were huge, but the burgers weren't so fat you couldn't handle them semi-gracefully. They were loaded with melting cheese, and the smoked bacon was amazing. There was an abundance of toppings, and a huge pile of perfectly crisped fries. The beer selection and HH is just awesome, we have zero complaints at all! We'll definitely become more regular patrons here, and I highly recommend going out of your way, giving them a chance, and checking out this perfect neighborhood bar!"

My fiancé is that obnoxious person who walks into a room and immediately tells everyone we're from out of town. Maybe that attributed to the friendliness but I won't complain.  We were trying to see as much of Austin as we could in one day, but if we had more time we would have stayed for a few more beers. Great patio too.  I can imagine this place being a complete cluster during football season. My alma mater plays Texas in 2025 and we may need to be here to find out :)"

                "description": "Looking for a slice of \"old Austin\"? A large selection of craft beers? Affordable and tasty food menu? Great atmosphere?  Look no further than the Crown and Anchor pub.   If you're looking for an expansive beer menu, they have it. Just about any craft beer you can think of is available.   If you're looking for great atmosphere, they own it. The owner Derven has been operating the place for 25 year and is a true Austinite. He has played gigs with many of the areas legendary musicians back the 80s. You can find him at the register most days haggling regulars and slinging beers.   Food? The food menu has the essentials and is affordable and tasty. It has enough options to satisfy just about anybody including a vegetarian or vegan and the food is always great and reasonably priced.   What else? Pool tables. Check. Darts. Check. Plenty of sitting area? Plenty of parking? Check and check.   Overall Crown and Anchor is a mellow and great dive to try a new beer, eat good burger or to clank glasses and cheers with beers at.   The old show Cheers comes to mind. It's a must stop for the neighborhood."

Basic wooden tables, a nice porch, 3 dart boards and 2 pool tables. You dont have to pay for darts, but you need collateral. They always have a great selection of beer, also they always have a nice deal on some type of beer they're trying to get rid of. Your dollar will go far at this place, especially during happy hour.  In terms of atmosphere, its no frills. Its great for big groups and small groups and hanging out. The porch is enclosed with screens but it is a little hot in the summer. Its great in the fall and spring though.  In terms of food, nothing is really stand out. But, it isnt bad either. Their burger is like the perfect backyard barbecue dad burger. Their fries are pretty good too but there jot artisanal. The cheese fries have a healthy amount of cheese. The nachos are fine too. The prices are a little high compared to the drinks. But, they're not unreasonable.  A lot of researchers at the university have happy hours here, so it gets busy on fridays especially during the semester. People from the neighborhood come too so theres always a crowd. That being said, youll usually be able to get a dart board or a pool table if you want it."

The price varies depending on the type of beer and whether it is happy hour or not.  I got a pint of 512 pecan porter for $4 during happy hour.  They also have pitchers available.    This place is not upscale, but it is a chill place to grab a beer and hang out, watch the game (NBA playoffs and baseball were on while I was there) and there is indoor and outdoor seating and two pool tables.  I was there on Sunday night and pool was FREE!  I suck at pool and don't particularly like pool, but I was up for a few games to help kill the time, so that was an added bonus, especially if you like pool.  There were probably 20 or more beers on tap, lots of bottle and can options, so I'm sure you will find 2 or 5 things that you like.  Parking was free on Sunday.  Pro tip, go on SUNDAY!  I didn't get any food, but it looked like everyone was ordering nachos."

                "description": "It's different from other board game cafes I've been to; first the whole inside ambiance is very rustic with dim lighting giving it a very nice cozy feeling. Next each table has a little bell you can call a server which is nice especially if you are in the middle of a game and you don't want to be distracted trying to flag down a server.  When you book a reservation they need the number of guests because they have a special menu for games that cater to a certain number of players which I think is an amazing and smart idea. They also have a game master available if you have any questions, but the servers were also very knowledgable with gameplay. The games all have a wooden box container to make give it a fine wine kind of vibe which I thought was cute and quirky.  The reason I had to knock off a star is due to the food ordering. So they have a deal of ordering 3 dishes and you get $3 off. You think simple right? No, there is no writing on the menu or explanation from the staff that you MUST tell the server that you are doing this deal which I think is silly needing to DECLARE it and the next is you have to order to the multiples of 3 dishes all in one go. Besides that annoyance, I think overall the food was inexpensive and delicious. I like that it comes in smaller portions so you try a little bit of everything. I had the mushroom kingdom burger, fries, pretzel bites, and cookies (remember to order at least 20 minutes before leaving since it takes time to bake). All the drinks were good like the boozy milkshakes and fyi if you want a cute instagram photo get the rainbow road."

                "description": "I absolutely loved the concept when I heard about this board game bar for the first time! They provide you a menu with a huge variety of different games. The workers there were incredibly helpful in recommending and explaining games. I was so impressed by their knowledge and how well they were able to go over game rules so we all knew how to play. We ended up playing Secret Hitler and Red Flags (which is similar to Cards Against Humanity but focused on dating). You can play as many games as you want here, all for the charge of $5.   There are also a bunch of food and drink options you can order! Currently, because of Covid, they only seat outdoors which is unfortunate because there are really only three tables. Make sure you place a reservation at least four hours in advance! The tables had heating poles next to them so at least it wasn't too cold. I had a wonderful experience and would highly recommend this place for an outing with friends or family!"

                "description": "For NYE we rented the wizard private room and spent hours eating, drinking, and playing games. The room really made our night special with the insanely detailed decor, Bluetooth speaker to customize the gaming vibe, and remote controlled fan for comfort. The waitresses were also so kind and we all felt right at home. We ordered almost every drink and small plate on the menu. I recommend ordering an old fashioned and the dumplings - the sauce was so good! In the main area, they had a nerf gun war planned to end NYE along with a champagne toast. Everything they do is well thought out - definitely give it a try!"

                "description": "If you're ever looking for a place to just hangout in the evenings, play some board games with some friends, or try some board games that you're thinking about buying, Vigilante is where it's at. It's got everything you could want for a nice fun evening.  Ordering system is pretty simple - just tell your server what game you want and they go fetch it. Once you're done, flag someone and pick another game.  Food is pretty simple and if you order three things all at once, it's a little cheaper. I wasn't particularly hungry the couple of times I went but the pretzel bites are decent with queso. The sandwiches and milkshakes also don't look bad though I can't vouch for it. They got a lot of drinks on tap too.  Sit back, kick back and relax!"

                "description": "Well, since I wrote my last review, I've played a lot of board games, been to lots of board game bars, and new places in Austin have opened up.  And for a minute, I thought: the competition is getting tough... There are cheaper ways to go out and play board games now, and there's always tons of places to eat in Austin   But honestly, Vigilante still deserves five full stars because they provide a unique experience you can't get anywhere else. The service is EXCELLENT. The wait staff is always extremely friendly and makes you excited to be there. The game masters are truly that, and can teach you a game as fast as possible. The food is also much improved and truly enjoyable. While also staying out of the way of the real focus: playing games with friends!  By always innovating and keeping the experience top notch, Vigilante will always have a spot in my rotation."

The food was okay, most of it we liked, but when we ordered the Gyro and we didn't eat it our waiter noticed and was kind enough to take it off our tab! We have an excellent waiter! The bartender was great, and the hostess at the front door was super cool! I'm very glad we got to experience Vigilante! And when we are back in ATX. We will be back :)"

                "description": "This is such an amazing concept and we had a blast!  Our group of 4 came here for an adult game night and were not disappointed.  They have a huge variety of board games to choose from.  These game range from easy to hard, long play to short play.  We ordered several different appetizers to share as a table and we each had a burger.  The appetizers were decent and the burgers were very small but pretty good.  This place is definitely not about the food but about the games.  It is good for the snackable items, but I wouldn't plan your dinner here.  The drinks are good and very reasonably priced.  We had a reservation for two hours, but we ended up staying there for about 3 and a half hours and we were not kicked out or asked to leave.  The staff was all super friendly and helpful.  This is definitely a spot that we will be back to."

Bar food is delicious and perfectly snackable. You can never have just one plate. The staff is always friendly.   By far the most unique and best part is the extensive bored game library. This makes it the perfect gathering place for parties small and large to get together for some wholesome and competitive fun. The thought put into this aspect is also plain to see. The design of the tables, the food choice, and the atmosphere makes this the perfect place for the next role of the dice or grand strategic victory. For large parties and special events, ask about the hidden rooms."

They do split the check individually since it's a handheld POS system that they use.  Majority of your party must be there in order to be seated, otherwise you can just wait at the bar. If you choose not to play board games, you can hangout at the bar and they'll give you switch controllers so you can play smash on their projector screen.  I saw that there was 1 hidden room, behind the bookcase, which I can only assume people can rent out for private parties. There is free parking out front in the garage.  -1 star because service was painfully slow."

                "description": "Man what a gem this spot is! If you haven't been, you mos def need to go. From groups of 2 to about 8, you're gonna have a great time from their lengthy list of board games, small and easy plates, plus brewskies or cocktails! Came here with three friends on MLK night and it was busy! But we were able to get our gaming in. FYI, at night it's a bit tough to see the store sign, but it's right at the corner/entrance of the apartment complex it's near!  Inside - 5/5 The left side of the spot has long benched tables with booths lining the wall/corner. If you sit in this at area, the staff give you a cool plasma-esque lantern so that you can call them over for food, libations, and games. The back of the left side is a bar with a projector in the behind. But what really sets the inside are the four person tables on the right side that are outfitted for perfect board and card games. Each side of the table has compartments where you can put your personal items, a cup for rolling dice, and a slider for cards. There are swinging sections at each corner to put your drinks or other items. Lastly, each side has a button that turns on a light right above the table to let the staff know you need something! P legit.  Food - 4/5 There are two pretty cool three plate deals you can order for $12 as you partake in the games. So far I've had the tacos, fries, and rolls and they weren't that bad. Nothing to write home to, but would be nice with larger portions. If ya don't do the deal, the  plates a la carte are of course a bit more expensive. Also, they can gluten-free most, if not all options! The beer and cocktail selection is pretty nice. Again, nothing out of this world, but cool you can really spend hours here.  Games - 5/5 The best part of Vigilante is of course the games. As several of the menu photos depict, they have a full menu of categorized games (e.g. adventure, party, cards, board). They also break it down by how difficult the games are to learn, set-up, and play. They of course have your staples - Settlers of Catan, Cards Against Humanity, Exploding Kittens - but there are plenty of more games that you can try with your friends! For example, we tried Sushi Go (a quick card dealing game to get the most points) and it has now become one of our go to games! The fun part is that the games are placed in a protective wooden box, which makes you feel like you're accessing a side quest of some sort.  Tips! Like a night club, it's $5 per person to sit at a table and play! And it's unlimited games all night. Your group can only one game at a time. Sit at the 4 person tables I described above! You won't regret it! You can order per person - the staff have mobile card readers  Overall - 4.5/5 I don't think any place is perfect as I believe it's always fun to continue building and making something better. Nevertheless Vigilante is a must go place for a date, a \"night in\", or what have you among other game loving fellows. It has everything you need and you're not risking yourself in the crazy scary world out there. Don't do yourself a disservice and go go go (Power Rangers)!"

                "description": "it was nice to get to a vineyard that was hospitable and had darn good wine.  We continued through our drive in the countryside south of Austin to the next vineyard, which was Driftwood.  after pulling in and walking down the trail to the main house we got in line to do a tasting.  actually my gal got a tasting, was happy to try a full pour of the Cabernet they have.   While we waited I took in the rooms that we were in.  It was a homey vibe with lots of small things to buy and others to just look at. The tasting was pretty good, but I took my glass of wine outside to the edge of what seemed the property as it dropped off sharply down a hill. There was some chairs there to sit and look out over the valley and that's just what I did.  it is a beautiful spot to appreciate the views of the wine valley here.  I could see the vineyards crawling over the hills on the other side.   There was a gazebo a ways to my right with a couple people people enjoying there wine there.  They had some classic rock songs going on the sound system which added to the relaxed vibe. I would definitely recommend going, and for sure enjoy the view out back."

The one policy not listed is one you will be yelled at for violiting and practically chased out of the building for. We went in with the intention or purchasing a wine tasting experience. The woman behind the bar was rude, as others have mentioned, and did not tell us anything about the rules. We received our pour and stepped away to sit outside since, while the website boasts table tastings, there aren't any tables inside. We were yelled at in an absolutely abrasive manner by two woman behind the bar. We were then informed that we were not allowed to take our tastings outside and come back inside for the remaining pours. They stated: \"it's just too busy to allow that on the weekends\". There were four other people inside. Busy? I think not. There isn't a sign anywhere stating you must remain inside for the duration of the tasting. The women were so incredibly rude when referencing a policy that isn't stated anywhere and that we were completely unaware of. It was humiliating and aggressive. So many other wineries allow you to taste at your pace and sit wherever you'd like. This was not the case. We were so thrown off by such atrocious customer service that we settled on a bottle just to get out of the building.   Hours later I saw one of the same woman chase a woman out of the building while yelling \"excuse me, excuse me\" because the woman had violated some other unstated policy. Chasing after and yelling at paying customers does not invite a relaxing winery experience.   We are local to the area and are members of two other wineries. We would have been back but my opinion of this \"estate\" winery has been permanently soured. Don't aggressively yell at customers in front of other guests and certainly don't chase them around your property. We'll stick to welcoming wineries with better tasting wine like Duchman, Bell Springs, Wimberely Valley, and Fall Creek. If you're looking for a great Texas winery skip this place and head elsewhere."

Beautiful area you can see the vineyard from up top.  Dogs welcome, to s of land outside for the doggies yo play in.   We tasted award winning wine from TEXAS grapes!  I'll just bet that when the temperature is a bit WARMER, and the sunshine's one would have a memorable time relaxing and enjoying a bottle or two  Some nibbles you can purchase, not a whole lot the time we were there, remember it was TUESDAY"

                "description": "We made a quick stop at this winery and enjoyed the view while having a glass of wine.  I chose a jammy Cabernet called Lone Star Cab that was perfect. They do wine tasting but I just opted for a glass of what I knew that I would enjoy.    The cafe was not open but they had items that paired well with wine.  I'm sure it is busy in the weekend.  The Cafe is small so get your food to go and enjoy one of the many cozy spots to view the vineyards.   The staff were very friendly and the store was very clean.  They have gifts as well.  If we were in town longer, We would have come back for lunch.    The road to the vineyard is gravel so drive slow.  Parking is free and plentiful.  Follow the signs as the vineyard is about a mile up from the main road."

The wine was fine but definitely not the sole reason to visit, so make sure you have a couple places you're bopping around to in the area. Cute little tasting glasses and there's a shop for kitschy items featuring a lot of wine puns.    I do think the crowd skews a bit older, so better suited for entertaining folks than a bach party!"

                "description": "Beautiful winery 25 minutes from Wimberly! We stopped by during 4th of July and was surprised there wasn't more of a crowd. Strict 21+ policy (many signs warning you to turn back if you aren't 21!) but the servers were so nice and kind. We did a wine tasting which was $20 for 6 samples of white, red, and sweet wine. You can also split the sampling between people, which I shared with a friend. Server (I think her name was Julie) was so sweet and knowledgeable about the wine flavors and gave us recommendations and some history of the flavors. Our favorite was the Starry Night, or the Orange Muscat wine! A bit disappointed they didn't give chocolates or nuts during a wine tasting and overall felt a bit rushed through the process as more people showed up, but it was still a unique experience.   The patio has a beautiful view of the orchard, which is why we came here versus other wineries in the area. Outdoor seating is plentiful, many round tables for larger groups too. Definitely would've spent a good half of day out here sipping wine if it wasn't for the rain. The Bistro (food/restaurant area) was closed because of Covid so eat before you arrive so you don't get hangry or wine drunk! ;)"

They are on a hill so that the outdoor seating has a great view.  We got 2 tastings and for the most part I enjoyed all of their wines. The Alamo Red was great and so was the Longhorn Red. My wife enjoyed the Chardonnay as well. The servers were very helpful and help guide us to their more popular wines.   We ended up buying a couple of bottles and really enjoyed the experience and the view. We plan on coming here again soon!"

                "description": "The wife and I tasted a flight of 6 wines: including the Rose, Cab, Red Blend, Merlot, Sangovese, and Syrah.  They were all simply awful swill. Everyone of the varietals lacked depth, character and complexity.  Everyone of the reds tasted blah, and I mean blah. They all lacked the distinctive aroma and notes that each of the grapes are known for.  The Rose  lacked any minerality that one would expect, and was as bad as the others.  The tasting room experience was as bad as the wines. The server had zero personality or character either.  We came away with the same thoughts as we have from other Hill Country Wineries.  They should not, nor should they be attempting to produce well known wines, and in fact do a terrible version of Cabs, Merlots, and Chards.  They should stick to Italian varietals, as well as a few others that might be better suited to the Texas climate, even though most people have no idea about those varietals. I suppose its just marketing to attract people in to the tasting room, and once they get toasted enough it no longer matters, since once the minds fogs, its just pour me another."

The ambiance is fantastic and is worth the visit to just get a bottle and enjoy the panoramic views.   Pro tip: they do not allow children, so know that before you go.

They wipe down tables in between people and staff are all wearing mask. Plenty of space outside for proper social distancing and enjoying some wine. We grabbed a bottle and ate at the small restaurant they have there. Would recommend you make reservations if you want a view. Service was great and food was amazing. My favorite was the pizza, don't remember the name of it but it had honey on it and it was the perfect amount of sweetness. Never thought I would like a pizza with honey on it, now I can't wait to go back."

They have an outdoor sitting area where you can admire the views and the bottle that you order is brought to you by a server who wears a face shield and gloves.    My group ordered a bottle of the 2017 Newsom Cabernet Sauvignon and we were pleased with our choice. It was not dry like a Merlot but just right. This winery does not allow you to bring outside food only the food offered in their bistro outdoor facility. This was not an issue for us.   Overall, it was a pleasant experience."

Prior to this place, everything I tasted was a mixture of sour fermented grapes. Not knocking Texas wines but they are just not my style. Maybe it needs an ice cube. Every wine here, ones that I tasted, is 100% Texan and done the way I think it is suppose to taste. Also, the view from the estate is beautiful. Very worth a stop for tasting and buying."

We went an 75 minutes out of our way to stop in for a tasting to see what peaked our interest in their current offerings. We loved that they have so much beautiful outdoor space. That is something that was always a major draw for us at Driftwood.   We called ahead, let them know we had a pup with us, and wanted to do a tasting. They told us to come on in. (It was a Monday and the place was very slow)  Upon arrival they told us they will only to tastings inside? What? In the era of COVID? As for the dog, they said one of us could do a tasting.   Between the lack of customer service, unfriendly attitude, and most importantly lack of outdoor tastings we will never bother to come back. WAY too many options with just as beautiful of grounds, equally great wines, safe tasting environment, and more importantly good customer service."

Really good atmosphere, great drinks, and friendly bartender. Em. was an absolute joy. She made such wonderful suggestions and was just the best. As a woman drinking alone, I felt like I was in a safe space. I would go back all the time and recommend it to anyone, especially if you are wanting something low key and chill. Will go back. Make sure you tip the bartenders! They works so hard and do an amazing job!"

We got the Moscow Mules and a growler of lager, both of which were excellent.   The big surprise was their special offering due to COVID, their GRILLED CHEESE sandwich!! And what terrific sandwich it was - super crispy, firm, delicious sourdough, and melty, tasty cheese and---no greasy fingers! Pickles were satisfyingly crunchy too!   Thank you Tigress Pub for a delightfully delicious experience tonight. Looking forward to our next visit!"

                "description": "3.5 stars for the cons, given that other, less refined establishments in town lack these issues entirely.  Pros: Cozy ambiance, intimate atmosphere inside, quaint almost romantic patio in the back that still feels as such even with multiple parties outside. Fit that in with some personable bartenders, and you've got the makings for a really nice date night! The Bartender who hosted us personally was wonderful company for conversation with the rest of my party, and she took the BEST care of us during our visit that she could.  Cons: An arguably limited selection of liquor for a place that seems to focus its pride on craft cocktails. It's understandable that the pandemic had severely limited business as of late to give any benefit of doubt, but combine that with a lack of providing customers with a preference of liquor for classic standard cocktails exacerbates this. The coups de Grace in dissatisfaction came when I was informed that the bar had absolutely no cherries to compliment a cocktail that is typically garnished with one. Other regulars who overheard me went out of their way to mention that it's a decision from the ownership down. If it's a matter of affordability for something as trivial yet pertinent as a jar of Luxardo cherries, then bigger core issues exist elsewhere; if it's a matter of personal opinion as to what constitutes tradition in a drink, that's even worse when any reasonable bartender or connoisseur should know that the \"best way\" to serve a drink is however the person consuming it wants it dressed."

                "description": "The Tigress is the  OG of classic cocktail culture in Austin. They opened their doors well before the craft cocktail madness took over the local blogosphere. There are no codewords, no hidden doors, and no over the top marketing gimmicks used to try to make them stand out from the pack. They don't need to. They just offer highly skilled staff serving up classic cocktails the way they were meant to be.   I'm a cocktail enthusiast and admitted \"drink snob\" with very high expectations of any place that claims to be a \"cocktail bar\". The Tigress is like a \"small batch heaven\" located off the beaten path. The rotating menu is carefully curated and the liquor selection, though small, is a blend of unique, local, and masterfully crafted offerings. You won't find mass produced, highly generic, overly commercialized well spirits here. Though the seasonal menus are small, the bartenders are highly skilled and can handle almost any classic cocktail request. In fact, they've even introduced me to a few that I'd not heard of previously, but are now part of my \"at home\" offerings (The Trinidad Sour is a favorite I didn't know I had previously). From the perfectly selected glassware to the outstanding skill of the folks behind the bar, this place is a must visit for every cocktail conisouer looking for that one special place where you stop in for a drink and leave having had a memorable experience.    Despite having all the right things to lend itself to being a high-end elegant cocktail bar, The Tigress has a casual, local, friendly feel. If you don't fancy yourself a cocktail person, have no fear.The drinks are very reasonably priced and the bartenders are highly skilled at asking about your flavor profile preferences and making the perfect recommendations for both the experienced drinker as well as the cocktail novices of the world. Don't be afraid to ask their advice. I take friends and visitors from out of town here regularly and they've never steered us wrong.   Cheers!"

They have outdoor seating which can probably seat around 10 ppl - very small tables surrounded by a few chairs.   For drinks we ordered the boys of summer, paper tiger, leash-less and native tongue.  The drinks were very okay, hit or a miss . I liked the boys of summer, wasn't the best drink I've ever had but certainly better than the others.   Our hostess was a little moody for some reason. She asked   Overall- can surely try it out for a drink if you are in the neighborhood."

If this were a Western saloon, there'd be a piano player, mopping his damn brow and waiting for higher spirits before smashing out a tune.  (you can even smoke outdoors, and if it's cold enough, no one will come out for a solid hour, guaranteed)  If you are not the type to make friends with every moron at the bar, this is a good place to seek some quiet and forgetfulness on off-hours, which are pretty much all hours not the weekend.  TCM is always on, subbed; Ida Lupino, Fred Macmurray, the Bogart, etc, become regulars to you, and inevitably some doofus pipes out, sure as God, \"You know, I think Empire Strikes Back is one of the top ten films on the planet.\"  Sit long enough, still, like a walking stick; in comes a Bumble date once or twice a week: a leather daddy with a face pitted by acne that got the best of him years ago is making up big time by going to absolute town on some mixed girls, reciting the old lines, sure as Old Faithful, pat and safe and just this shy of rote PUA material; a young guy is meeting a blonde with a bob, discussing schadenfreude, saudade, acentrism, kicking canes out from mobility-disadvantaged Nazis, and everyone works at IBM or Dell.  There is always a gang of strangers who know each other over drinks, stinking of the day; every time you come in, they're here, swigging down Claire's Knees and Plump Perfections.  Some of them probably even had a cookout or two before life got in the way.    Every year they do Tiki Week.  Someone's written them up recently.  One of the top cocktail holes in this wreck of a town.   There is something disgusting in being known. Thank the Lord if you are the type who is able to weave little shrouds and stitches of obscurance around your neck wattle and your denimed shanks.  This is a place to hide, to commiserate with your immoralities."

I was told that cocktails were their specialty so I just wanted to keep it simple and asked for a rum and diet coke.  The bartender immediately replied \"we don't carry anything with aspertame in it!!\"  Yet I could see regular coke in their cooler, so I think high fructose corn syrup is that much better?  There was no need to make that comment, simply state you don't have DIET. A little attitude, so so drinks.  No wonder at prime time there were only 4 or 5 people in the place."

Dim lighting and wood booths line the place. Funny to say, but they have he most comfortable bar stools I've ever sat on!   The bartender was very friendly, talkative and great at recommending drinks.   First, I had The Green Drink! She said you can only get it 1-2 times a year! Unique and tasty! Never had a drink with cilantro in it. Good balance of fresh herbs, pineapple and citrus.   Second drink, she made a custom cocktail for me. I was in the mood for gin but my favorite drinks are mojitos and vodka presses. She didn't bat an eyelash and whipped up something exactly to what I asked for.   Prices are average for a craft cocktail ($9-10). The green drink was $12 but not crazy for the specialty and freshness."

It's an awesome beer garden with stellar staff and food trucks that are great for any occasion.   The bar area has tons of local beers that they do let you sample. The staff have typically made some great drink suggestions that I always attempt to look out for when buying larger packs at my nearest liquor store.   At this point, I think I've had food from each of their more permanent  food trucks and will say that you really can't go wrong with what you choose. My top favs are the arepas from Four Brothers and the 50/50 burger from the Oink Mobile...in case you have an issue deciding!"

Children annoy me so this is not my favorite place ATM, but we'll be back during the school day or later on at night.   Glad to have something like this in CP.   To the owner: please discourage remote control cars and soccer balls. Pretty annoying to have my beer knocked over by some kid who thinks he's at the park. Plus the remote control cars are just obnoxious."

                "description": "Sunday was another really enjoyable afternoon at the good lot with family. Lots of really beautiful, adorable kids with lots of well behaved pets. They have astro turfed the big outdoor area and added more fire pits and tables and it is so freakin beautiful. Another good selection of food trucks , I had shrimp tacos from Redfin and two different draft beers (Again, served in glasses, not paper or plastic. The vibes were very relaxed. I have only one suggestion; Considering the number of little people and the traffic on New Hope, Some sort of a fence along New Hope is in order. I suggest simple metal poles and the green, plastic stuff that comes in rolls that you can get from Lowes or HD. there is a hedge row but there are spaces between. At least until the bushes grow up."

                "description": "I made the drive up to Cedar Park and my friend was excited to take me here as it had just opened up and seemed to add a streak of cool to my friend's new neighborhood. So, it was midweek around 8pm and while the patio had plenty of folks and there was music going the food trucks were done and they weren't too courteous about letting it be known they were closed or out of food or closing up.   So, the taps were open which allowed me to try out a beer. The staff pouring were definitely friendly, letting me know some of their personal favorites on tap as well as letting me try some out. I did also appreciate that they had some NA options as well and I liked the kombucha they had on tap so much I had two more of those instead of the more adult beverage options they had.  If there was a way to have some of the bar staff cross train with the food truck staff it would make a huge improvement."

                "description": "The Good Lot is a wonderful addition to the CP area. Bring your kiddos and your hounds sit outside under the shade or on their covered patio.    Cocktails anyone? I was surprised at their expansive craft beer options. Check out their rotating taps at: https://thegoodlotcp.com/beergarden/drinks/  There are wine, seltzer, and non-acholohol options as well.  When we visited there were 3 food truck options; Yard Bird, Oink, and our favorite The Rice is Right.    Be aware on weekends and when there is live music parking will be a challenge. This has been a point of contention with the neighbors and according to the Good Lot, they are looking to expand the parking area.    Pro tip: Don't park in the adjoining neighborhood park 5 minutes away at the Veterans Memorial Park. Stretch your legs on the way there and work off that beer on the way back."

                "description": "As far as I can tell, The Good Lot only has 5 star reviews and for good reason.  It is a great beer garden with plenty of non-beer options as well.  I have always passed by the place and noticed how busy it is most weeknights and especially weekends, but I am certainly pleased with what it brings to the community.  Generally it gets pretty busy after 6PM until close, and parking can be difficult to find.  Carpooling or taking a rideshare would be the best way to do it in my opinion as I would hate to park in front of someone else's house in the nice neighborhoods nearby.  Certainly a parking lot expansion is something the owners are considering as that is my only issue with the place especially when it gets busy.  That being said, it is always a great atmosphere with a variety of food and drink options.  There are also always lots of dogs in the grassy area by the patio and it is nice to see how family-friendly the place is.  I will certainly be back and bring some friends in the future!"

                "description": "This is such a cool place! I planned an outing in Cedar Park with a group of my girlfriends. After our outing at the Ecuadorian chocolate factory, we needed a place that could accommodate a fairly large group of friends during lunch time on a Friday (a task that seemed.... yikes). I am very thankful I stumbled across The Good Lot on Yelp! I reached out to make sure The Good Lot could accommodate us, and they said \"Of Course\" and let me know that all of the trucks would be out on Friday.    When we arrived, we were pleasantly surprised to find several open food trucks and a large building (see, beer bar). People had their dogs outside and everyone seemed to be having a good time.   Between all of us, we tried every food truck. I personally got Four Brothers Venezuelan Kitchen. I am a sucker for good Venezuelan food. I got a Pulled pork Bowl with extra garlic sauce, black beans, avocado, sweet plantains, and all the fixings. I would definitely eat here again. I tried a few samples from other food trucks as well.   Everyone left super happy. This is a great place to go if you have a casual group looking for a quick bite and place to hang out.    The next day (Saturday), I swung by the dog park across the street and stopped by again for lunch on my way home. They have trivia nights, live music over the weekends, and happy hour all day on Monday. Please build another location close to Fort Hood. A copy and paste of exactly what you already created would be great. ;). I promise to stop by weekly."

(sorry guys, we were the last ones to leave)  Parking is nuts so plan ahead and maybe carpool... We drive a jeep so we had no issues ... live music and plenty of smiling faces.. service was great, bathrooms were clean... dogs welcome! Plenty of good beers, wines and ciders... gals were so nice behind the bar.. offered samples and were super sweet... good folks, good music and good grub.... my son joined us and grabbed some food from the food trucks... cauliflower wings, shrimp fried rice and macaroni and cheese... so so good.... bring your chairs/ blanket to sit on because tables and chairs are hard to snag... the lines are long for drinks but they go fast.... We will be back for sure! We feel right at home here. If you like fresh air and freedom... come here.. if you are afraid of fresh air and human contact, probably should go to Austin and be amongst others who feel that way... Merica!"

                "description": "My daughter and I visited The Good Lot yesterday (8/8/21).  It's the new and hot food truck and bar spot in Cedar Park TX (2500 W New Hope). The Good Lot has a main building with a large dining area enclosed by glass garage doors that open and a bar that has numerous beers, ales, ciders, and craft sodas.  It's nestled among the oak trees. There is a nice amount of paved parking and gravel lot parking.   The Good Lot also has dining areas under the oaks along with a game area (corn hole) and a playground for the kids with a large wooden teepee for climbing.  They are dog friendly.   The Good Lot had 4 food trucks.  We chose The Rice Is Right that serves Korean inspired rice boxes and other items.  We ordered the crispy chicken box and the cauliflower box.  Both items were perfectly fried and coated in a sweet and spicy Korean sauce.  Flavor was amazing.  The boxes came with steamed white rice and a purple cabbage slaw.  The portions were large and more than enough food for us. There were other food trucks that served Mediterranean, Pork, and Chicken.  The menus look good and I will explore those in the future.  The Good Lot and The Rice Is Right are on 'My Keepers List'."

Food trailers here, beer on tap, covered patio, great outdoor seats and space, place for kids and pets. It has only been open for 3 weeks and the word is getting out. As we were leaving tonight, the park lot was pretty full. Great place to relax with buddies after work or with the family with a wooden teepee for the kids to climb and corn hole. Head over to The Good Lot and get some food from The Rice is Right and Oink Mobile."

The beer selection was great, lots of locals including Whitestone, Hedgehog, Red Horn, Family Brewing and (of course) some lovely PHP Jellyfish on tap.  We decided to tried Yaadbird, since we hadn't had any fried chicken in a while. The lemon pepper chicken was on point, crispy, juicy, peppery, a 'lil salty, and everything you need in your fried chicken!  The property is beautiful and well landscaped. The lawn was amazing! It was so fluffy! When we first arrived we just admired the live oak trees and the quality of the grass.. Lawn lovers, you will understand...  The bartenders were very nice and very excited to introduce so many new people to the Good Lot. The owner was all over the bar, pouring drinks, helping staff, and checking with guests, seeming to have time for everyone.  We are looking forward to coming back here and trying the 3 other food trucks, along with the rotating beer menu. Hope they are planning to host more events, as we would love to do an anniversary party here at some point!"

                "description": "Finally, a really great beer garden in Cedar Park. I came on their first \"soft public open\" day and I'm so glad I did. I've been to about 20 pubs and bars in CP and this one stands head and shoulders above the rest. It's an open air (no AC but there is heat in the winter) with big garage doors that were open and a huge ceiling fan so it was comfortable. There were about 20 taps and 3 of them were not filled yet. I chatted with the owner and she said she was looking for ideas so my friend Greg gave her some. :)  There is plenty of indoor seating. Plus, there is a huge grassy area with picnic tables and even a fire pit. It's family-friendly so no smoking.  There is a playground for the kids and spots for four food trucks although only two were filled.   Beer was about $6 on average so not cheap but not expensive either. $1 off all day on Mondays.   It was an enjoyable experience and a really great ambience. I'll definitely be back!"

This place is non-smoking, dog-friendly (leashed) and kid-friendly, with a unique play area, six sets of cornhole, and plenty of shaded grassy area to run around in. Tables are wide and comfortable, and the entire patio was open-air, so social distancing is a breeze. We ate at the Oinkmobile truck (delicious) and grabbed local beers and ciders at the patio desk. We walked the fifteen minutes from our house, but it looks like they have a decent-sized parking lot and are working on creating more space. The only downside is that there's no ramp down to the grass/play area, but hopefully they'll make it more accessible in the future. Staff was super friendly, and I can't wait to come back for open mic night. Because yes, we'll be back!!"

Once we got a drink, we were lucky enough to snag a table under the fans and the breeze was so nice. They had live music while we were there, which I believe will continue on weekends so that's fun. The lawn looked so nice, chairs to sit in, trees for shade, lawn games for entertainment! There were 4 or 5 food truck options while we were there and while we didn't get any food, all the food we saw coming out looked so good! Definitely recommend stopping by and checking it out!"

We visited them middle of a day when not many people were around to have such an early start lol. We all had a tasting set, which I tried cucumber, blood orange, sangria and spiced peach. They were surprisingly all flavorful and enjoyable! Tried their frozen cucumber drink as well - super refreshing. We also ordered a couple of chips and popcorn. The only thing I wish they'd do differently is to serve a few more snack items. Something you prep by microwave may suffice but not just a few bags of chips... maybe if food tracks around were open, it would be all good?"

This is the East Austin location and is easy in and out with plenty of parking.   I walked in and immediately loved the interior. There were lights and barrels stacked to the ceiling. I was surprised by the lack of seating for how popular this location is... there were only 10 or so picnic-style tables inside and a few more outside. It also wasn't terribly busy and I arrived around 5pm on a Wednesday.  Not knowing what I liked, I ordered a flight of ciders. They were incredibly sweet, and I mean almost too sweet. I drank most but the Texas Honey and Blood Orange were too much for me to finish (perfect for those with a sweet tooth though!). The staff were helpful though in helping me find some good options!  Overall, I'd try Eastciders again. This is a great happy hour spot for friends, coworkers, date night, etc."

My boyfriend headed next door for actual beers, and then we sat together outside on the porch as the sun was going down. Met a lot of super friendly people and finally got to drink the brut on tap. 10/10 would recommend."

                "description": "\"Always look on the bright cider life\"   Highlights: *Outdoor and Indoor Seating  *Seasonal Ciders  *Cocktails in a Can   Review: Looking for a chill spot to take your friends out to have a nice cold one? Well look no further Austin EastCiders has a nice outdoor seating area where you can enjoy the beautiful weather or they also have nice indoor seating. They have at least 6 of their ciders on draft yearlong with a couple of seasonal small batches. They're all very smooth, crisp, semisweet and refreshing. You can also get cocktails in a can which is one of their ciders mixed with sake, cream sherry or agave wine. Next visit will be to their Barton Springs location to try out their food and other cocktails.   Rating: 9/10  Cider Flight: Honey, Pineapple, Sangria and Cranberry"

We went on a Saturday afternoon and asked for an out of market ice hockey game to be put on the TV - the staff was very engaging and fun and brought up the game. During the game we conversed back and forth on different ciders to try and again the staff were exactly what we could've hoped for. The 4 of us had a great time and will be back with more friends. Would highly recommend for groups or a relaxing afternoon. Thank you!"

They just released the Blackberry Cider this week and it was so good. It's a nice fruity, sweet and slightly sour cider. I also tried the Honey Cider. Both excellent !! They sell all their ciders by the packs or the variety pack if you need to stock up before leaving.   The staff was 5-star. The decorations were 5-star. It was just such a nice chill, vibe. Will visit again soon."

                "description": "Back in 2015 I was on a business trip in Oklahoma City. On the last day of my trip I took the time to go into the city and explore as my flight wasn't until the evening. For brunch I stopped into Kitchen No 324 for their eggs Benedict. I noticed a Honey Cider available on the menu and decided to try it. This is the day (even to this day) I discovered my favorite hard cider of all time. Austin East Cider's Honey Cider has such a smooth taste that balances the honey, brown sugar and hard apple cider to give you a complete blueprint of the perfect cider.   Fast forward to today and Austin East Ciders (and the shipping wizards) finally opened up ordering online for shipping and delivery. Amanda noticed this and ordered some as a surprise birthday present. The Honey Cider is as good as I remember it. Definitely recommend trying this product."

They had a large variety of ciders to try (definitely recommend a flight or two to sample them), an outdoor space to enjoy the weather, and a food truck outside if you want a bite to eat.  The ciders range across the spectrum from sweet to dry, fruity, spiced, something for everyone.  Parking was a little tough due to the popularity of the other businesses (as well as Eastciders) right around there."

For food we only had the queso and chips but two many cocktails to count. If you are a cider fan and want to support a Cider based Austin group do yourself a favor and stop by. The only thing I would say is, get their early so you don't have to wait for 30+ minutes. But, they validate parking so if you bring a waiting beer you will be fine."

                "description": "Went here on a whim. Overall i would recommend this place.   I'll start with the food.   We had the fried pickles and the wings (naked). The pickles were very good and the wings were a bit bland. For entrees we have the slider trio and the tacos (mahi and chicken). The slider trio was very very good. The BBQ was delicious, though the brisket was a little fatty. But the turkey and pulled pork with the bread combo were delicious. The tacos were also very good. The mahi was a little more spicy than expected but still good. We also had a few beers off the draft. Wish they had a little bigger selection here, but what they had was ok.   Staff.   They were very friendly. We sat at the bar as it was seat yourself anywhere in the place. Overall it was ok service. Would not say it was the best. Clearly they need more staff but i know how hard staffing is these days due to covid so i will not hold it against them. Though it did make getting food/drinks kind of slow but we were not in a hurry.   Cleanliness.   This is where i take a star. It was ok but the bathrooms men and women were gross and clearly ignored. The overall establishment just felt like it needed a good cleaning. While we were sitting at the bar a couple silver fish ended up crawling on me. Luckily this was at the end of my meal otherwise i have no idea what i might have done during. Cleanliness is important and an indicator of whether i would go back or not. I'll have to put some thought into it."

I think it was underdone and too hard so it was a bit tough to eat.  The 2 plate bbq dish was good though, especially the brisket (how can you go wrong with brisket?). The \"coleslaw\" wasn't the best and could have used more seasoning and either a better vinegar or mayo base to give it a better texture.  The drinks are pretty good and their atmosphere is overall nice; would definitely go again and check out their HH menu."

We instead ordered the mimosa carafe for $12. Presentation could have been better. They were just served in normal water glasses which made the mimosas go flat pretty quickly.  We ordered the Whiskey-infused Banana Bread French toast and the Eastside Benedict. Banana bread is on the crunchier side as opposed to fluffy (which I don't mind). My friend liked her benedict and thought the brisket was cooked well!  I was not blown away by any means, but I may come back another time to try out their dinner menu."

                "description": "I hate that this is one of the last remaining bottomless mimosa spots in Austin because I would give it lower than one star if I could. The food sucks, and the service is even worse. I came once during July 4thweekend, and it started pouring. Waiters would still bring food on trays that had an inch of water in it, and I was one of those unlucky ones who received food after it started raining. I asked the waiter if it was possible to return my food because it was drenched in rainwater, and he said it was too late because I had already ordered it. Excuse me?? I was genuinely shocked. I went downstairs to ask a manager if I could get a refund, and he said I would have to dispute it with the online ordering system company. Absolutely ridiculous. I couldn't say enough negative things about this establishment. Please, anybody else, do bottomless mimosas because I'm tired of having only this one crappy place be the go-to despite how terrible the service and food is."

She asked us to pay and box our food and leave, the way she talked to us was very unprofessional.

I asked the hostess to place us on the waitlist for a table inside and she tells me it'll be about 30 min wait. In the meantime, my party and I decided to sit outside and order a drink while we wait. We never got a text letting us know that a table was ready.   We stayed outside and ordered food. 3 of us ordered the chicken sandwich, one of us ordered the brunch burger, and another friend ordered the Brussel sprouts. Well, everyone got their food except me. I waited a little over an hour, asked 3 different waiters, until I finally got my food. My entire party was already done eating.   I had also ordered the bottomless mimosas, but I never received that either. Everyone at my table kept getting their drinks, while I was still waiting for mine. I got up, went downstairs, and asked the hostess if she could remove the mimosa from my tab since I never received it.   Food is ok, but service is TERRIBLE. Still can't believe how bad of an experience I had."

Anyway, we showed up to this place and we almost left because it was sooooo packed! It was during their famous brunch time, and so we had to get the mimosa carafe. We ended up changing seats when the bar opened up, so we'd have a view of the game. Loved all the ladies working there. They were nice, friendly, funny, and it made it such a fun day! We ate some loaded fries but added their brisket- omg so good! Also had some fried pickles, but forgot to take a photo."

                "description": "My friends and I were visiting Austin for a 30th birthday. We were looking for a bottomless mimosa brunch spot so we looked online and found this place. It turns out that they do not do bottomless mimosas they just sell the bottle or glass by their price. So they should really take off their advertisement of $14 bottomless mimosas because we would have went elsewhere. When we were there, the app that they have went down, so everything was chaotic and no organization was there. My friends and I ordered food and drinks, my friends food came out but mine did not and it was a whole ordeal to get my food. I ended up having them box it up because my friends already finished their food because I didn't want them to wait for mine and have their food get cold. I spoke to the manager on shift and she basically was just trying to make excuses for all their mistakes rather than just own up to them and apologize for all the miscommunication going on that day. Katie, the server, who wasn't even our server, was AMAZING. She was the only one who truly cared about our problems going on and she will literally be the only reason we would ever come back to this place. She should be placed in management. If you do visit here, ask for Katie to be your server because then you will have a great experience for sure!"

You have to order and pay through an application which removed the ability to receive our meal in courses. We got appetizers and meal all at once. It took over 45minutes to get our food which was subpar. The cornbread was completely burned. The BLT sandwich literally had one slice of bacon and the queso was lukewarm. This is a foodie town and today's experience was below quality considering citywide options."

                "description": "This review is not for our server, Zach, who provided excellent service. This review reflects the nonsensical reservation system that requires one to email (not call... email) 24 hours in advance. I emailed a bit over 24 hours ahead and they said that my requested time wasn't available, which makes no sense if reservations are indeed only taken 24 hours in advance. We were seated outside in the baking sun with no umbrella because they are a \"liability.\" We were told that outside seating with shade was completely reserved which again makes no sense because we again emailed over 24 hours ahead of time. We were also told that there was no inside seating and that they \"can't control the weather.\" It's Texas in April, you need to provide people with some kind of shade. Disappointing as this used to be a favorite bottomless brunch spot. No bottomless, no logical reservation system. Go somewhere else."

We came for brunch and the food was just okay. Nothing special. We got Brussel sprouts, nachos, and the breakfast bowls. We had mimosas but they were out of orange juice?(lol) they had cranberry and grapefruit juice instead.   P.s. Parking lot is like maybe 8 spots so not exactly ideal."

I politley told the waitress it did not taste right and seemed artificial. She got all upset when I asked for a Hazy Beer instead, and stormed off, only to return with a Lager instead of the Hazy.  I ordered the 3 meat BBQ plate. All three meats were totally dry, and tasted like nothing. The wife ordered the 2 meat plate; both meats were dry and tasteless.   $85 dollars for lousy food and service."

Walking in gave me comforting coffeeshop vibes, with mostly tables of small parties 2-3 drinking beer and socializing.  Having no idea what to order, staff made some recommendations for a flight that were all fantastic. My favorites were the Cuerno Rojo (lightly carbonated and very smooth) and the Continental Breakfast (heavier stout but tastes just like French Toast and Maple syrup). I had to do a double take that I wasn't just drinking syrup but the flavors were spot on!  I'll be back again with friends/family and hopefully get to enjoy the great coffee I was smelling as well!"

The options here were so amazing and such a fun mix. I did enjoy that even when I ordered coffee they asked if I wanted to start a tab as if I was at a bar. This place was loud and seemed like a great place to enjoy some fun. They do have outdoor seating with heaters and covered. All in all I'd say I will go back again but maybe not on a weekend next time."

                "description": "Just wanted to update this one. Red Horn just gets better and better with age and has really turned into a community institution - especially during the pandemic when they switched to \"to go\" beers that we could all take out to the parking lot and drink while socially distanced. Fortunately those days are past us but I think I will always have a soft spot in my heart for this place that was a little bit of sanity amidst all the insanity.   As for the fare itself? The beers rotate and you can't  go wrong because they will always let you sample (I'm a strawberry pop-tart ravioli fan - and yes that's a beer). Pair that beer (or wine) with a meat and cheese tray or maybe a panini and you have absolutely nothing to complain about. They even have food trucks on most days...  Thanks for being here Red Horn."

Red Horn was very highly rated and the photos looked like they offered genuine espresso beverages. Red Horn offered a number of non-dairy options so I would not destroy my stomach on my pending road trip. We ordered Americans with a half inch of steamed oat milk. The coffee was very smooth. The espresso taste was still solid enough that I knew I was drinking espresso. I.e. Not watered down at all. All-in-all a great cup of coffee that hit the spot."

But I don't believe in spending $12 a glass for wine -- especially at a coffee/brew  pub.  While they listed an $8 or $9 red wine (on a menu in front of register), they conveniently only had the $12  wine.  It is a neat place, I \"get\" that people like it, but I don't plan to return.  I can go across the street, get good food and drinks at happy hour, or lunch.  And not feel ripped off.  (the serving size seemed less than average, too)."

The interior ambiance was dark, cozy, and perfect for an intimate convo, remote work, or even games with friends. I have two small children so helped myself to the outdoor covered and heated patio. The kids enjoyed the chips and salsa while we sipped our stellar brews. Excited to try the Leander location that is actually closer to us. 10/10 plan to come back, especially to try the coffee."

It's hard to find decaf that isn't boring and the decaf here is strong and full of flavor! I even purchased a pound of decaf beans to take home.   I pulled up and my first thought was that the vibe was more brewery than coffee shop and I was right, but I was wrong that the coffee would just be an afterthought. When I went on a Saturday early afternoon, there was a taco truck and people hanging out in the beer garden. Lots of bicyclists and not sure if it's a popular rest stop or because there's a bike shop in the same parking lot or both or something else. Once you step inside there is a giant section of beer taps and beer menu, and a small coffee and pastry menu. They also sell ice cream here which was tempting but I stuck to my americano and later a vanilla latte.   The inside has plenty of socially distanced seating as does the outside and I lucked out with a parking spot right out front. There's a large lot of shared parking for the businesses.   I want to come back to check out their beers!!"

Pretty flowers and lots of grass for kids to run in. The beer was delicious. I tried 3 five oz pours, all IPAs they were delicious!! You order the beer online and they call you when it's ready. Quick, easy and safe. Will def be back!  They have different food trucks , check their Facebook to see what's there when you're going."

                "description": "Been here a few times. I must say that the waiters and waitresses here are phenomenal. During my most recent experience our waitress was Karisha.  Late 30s early 40s generation like me will LOVE the music selection here - I felt like they were playing my old playlists from high school or something!   (And they actually have a barcode to listen to their playlist on Spotify which I thought was cool)  I ordered the 20 oz ribeye. (I had a very paltry breakfast and had recently worked out so my body was lusting for some bovine carnage)  My better half ordered truffle fries and the Gardein Buffalo chicken - which she absolutely loved - and trust me that's a rare sight - so Thank You Yard House!  Meanwhile, this steak had everything I hoped for - it was bone-in, juicy and cooked to perfection. The server even asked me to cut into it to ensure it was to my liking - I had to ask her to repeat herself because I've never had someone ask me before.. how thoughtful! And cut into it I did, again and again until all that was left was the bone.   The Parmesan mashed potatoes were also scrumptious! Just the right texture and not too cheesy at all, the right touch of Parmesan.   Oh and there was also the healthy baby broccoli. The heads were very good, the stem was a little tough for me to chew but that's probably because they are grilled (as opposed to steamed) but that's fine because I usually only eat the heads anyways.   I don't usually drink but they are supposed to have a large selection on tap as well as bottled beers. I had the Heineken 0 (0% alcohol) and for those who used to drink Heineken I recommend it because it tastes exactly like the real thing! I was amazed they had it, so I guess there's something for everyone here.  I think this place is a keeper and I will return to see what other delicious adventures are lurking inside that menu. I've had the steak bowl before and it always hits the spot! The burgers are also delicious - though sadly I'm watching my carb intake recently.   In the end, you can't go wrong with this place! It can get pretty busy but all you have to do is give your name and number and they text you when your table is ready! Just go walk to Restoration Hardware and look at extremely expensive furniture you'll never buy in the meantime or stroll on over to Amazon books and play with their toys :) the possibilities are endless"

                "description": "I have always seen this place but never really made it in until recently. I will add the disclaimer that we did go during SXSW as well as Spring break. On top of understanding most places are dealing with coming out of covid restrictions and labor storages.  We went while walking around the Domain. It was busy, but not packed. We were sat with no wait, but then sat for almost 15 min before someone came to greet us and get our drink order. We had already decided on trying several of the apps and then maybe splitting a pizza. So we ordered our apps with our drinks. We got the pretzel, edamame, cheese curds, and calamari. Another 10 min go by and our drinks (literally a coke, water, and tea) are finally brought and the food about 15 min later. We didn't see our server again. Calamari was very rubbery and cold and bland. The pretzel was ok on it's own but the beer cheese they made with it was really beer forward and couldn't taste much else. The cheese curds were a little over cooked but not horrible. And the edamame was almost inedible. A different server came after about 45 min and asked if we wanted refills, our glasses being empty for more than 30 min. We decided to not order the pizza and just pay and leave.  I gave them 3 stars because like I said I totally understand the staff shortages and it being SXSW and all that. But really not great food or service. Their bar menu looked very detailed for those who drink, and we might give them a shot later down the road to see if things are better without a big event going on. But not any time soon."

                "description": "We've come here almost every week, sometimes multiple times a week since we moved to Austin 3 months ago. The hours are great and the food has always been good, you get a full menu and happy hour specials. I'm not sure if we've been here any other Sunday but this past Sunday the food was absolutely awful. I'm not sure if the head chef, kitchen manager, etc. is off or what but both our meals and appetizer tasted like they were microwaved leftovers.   We got the ahi tuna and it was very strange this time, so strange I didn't want to really eat it but the portion was so small this time we just ate it. I guess that kind of shows we're really not picky so when I say something was terrible it's really-really bad. I know anyone reading this will say that's your fault for getting ahi tuna from a sports bar but we've got it dozens of times and it was always surprisingly good. The tuna sandwich and poke nachos are great as well, but we didn't get them this time. We did get the fish and chips and the hot chicken sandwich. The fish was 100% microwaved, it was rubbery and had no crisp to the breading so they're dead giveaways. Also, the coleslaw was brown so that was nice. The chicken sandwich tasted nothing like the chicken sandwiches we've had from there before, and the taste of this one was not pleasant. We still ate most of our food so I wasn't going to complain that it was terrible unless our waitress asked and to my surprise she never did. lol. I think she knew so she avoided that question.   The cocktails and beer selection is great from here and they make great drinks for a sports bar. During happy hour they have small discounts on drinks and larger discounts on food. I don't remember what they all are but I know the cocktails are 2 dollars off, nothing crazy but hey I'll take it. I ordered my first cocktail during happy hour and about 30-40 minutes later another. The waitress took my order for the drink and came back later maybe 10-15 minutes and asked if I still want the drink I ordered. I was confused and said yeah so another 10 minutes or so I got my drink. My girlfriend was on her phone and noticed she came back to ask right after 11 PM when happy hour is done. So I was charged 2 dollars extra for one drink, I could care less. But it was really weird for her to do that.   I don't think we'll stop coming here because of our bad experience. I figured I would take my time to at least let the establishment know of our experience. So they can improve - if they want to. I know a lot of restaurants have staffing issues and there is a massive amount of competition in Austin. A bad meal isn't the end of the world by any means."

But overall the service was good and the food was ok. I got the steak bowl but had it sent back to the kitchen because the steak was so extremely tough! The meat in the picture looks red but it was so tough. The best part of our meal was probably the truffle fries. They had a nice truffle flavor but other than that, nothing too spectacular about our meal."

                "description": "Exceptional service(two waiters were both checking on our tables and made sure we had everything we needed!) and pretty solid food! I got the KBBQ Cheesesteak sandwich, which had decent flavors and nice presentation. I would personally have preferred a stronger tasting gochujang sauce, but it was still tasty as is. My friend got the whiskey salmon, which had great sauce! The sweetness and whisky flavors mixed very well. I had a pretty good experience overall and was really happy with the atmosphere and waiters! Tim and Noah, you guys were cool!  I also had Yard House in the past once at maybe 1am and ordered their pepperoni mushroom pizza and Margherita pizza, both which tasted great! Definitely a great meal after being out with friends. Would recommend as a fun, laidback place to eat and drink!"

                "description": "We absolutely love yard houses HH! We have tried bunch of there appetizers and they are all pretty good, and most of there appetizers are 50% off and pizzas too. But if it's outside the HH time, I this it's bit pricey.  Chicken nachos: skimpy on the chicken and too much of sour cream.  Korean chicken wings: it was pretty good, it had a nice hint with a hint of sweetness and our kiddo loved it.  Onion rings: I mostly don't like onion rings because it's greasy and feels heavy, but at the YH, it's light, crispy and non greasy.  Chicken strips: chicken strips comes with the small basket of fries, chicken stripes itself doesn't have much flavors or seasoning, but it's good if you dip it in some sauce.  They don't have online reservations, so that sucks. Ordering and paying is with the tablet they have on the table and that's not convenient either, we had to try atleast 4-5 times for payment to go through and it's so confusing, otherwise everything else is good."

The staff is Amazing and professional but not so much where they're snobby.  Just a kick back place.  While my husband and I sat down at the bar there was a guy watching a game..GO DODGERS!! To our left.. a couple to our right and a blind date across the way. I feeds everyone's needs.   Our bartender KEITH was fantastic...  if your ever so luck for him to make you a drink... you'll be in mixer heaven. He recommended a beer to my hubby some kind of blonde.  Jez I wish I can remember the name... any who, he's gave himself a sample and that was the end of that.  Also, we ordered shots and I ordered a dirty martini.  EVERY.  SINGLE.  DRINK.  Was delicious haha. But also, he was  good company and made sure we're taken care of.   Pros: EVERYTHING!!!! FOOD IS ON ANOTHER LEVEL.  CHEERS TO THE KITCHEN  Cons: nothing.

In case you didn't know, during happy hour all their apps are half off.! Unfortunately I only took pictures of the calamari and nachos, however some of my appetizer favorites are the ahi sashimi, poke nachos, fried calamari, and the chicken lettuce wraps. I also like the chicken nachos, classic sliders, and have heard great things about the cheese curds. Often times, I come here for the happy hour and don't even end up ordering an entre just get a few half priced apps!"

The waitress that assisted me was attentive, knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. My order came out in a timely manner. I ordered blackened shrimp tacos that came with rice and beans. The sauce that is on the tacos is spicy. For my drink I ordered a Sangria. The food and drink were great!   I sat outside on the patio because it was a nice day outside. The patio is a nice size that has a lot of tables. The restrooms were clean and they are unisex. It's a parking garage across from Yard House which is convenient."

Second, the food, the appetizers, buffalo wings and Sushi Nachos were so impressive, fresh and tasty.  The bacon cheese burger were amazing.  Good beef, and delicious fries.

                "description": "What a great place in downtown Round Rock! We met a friend here for drinks late, and the wait staff was wonderful! I don't think I've ever been in a bar with such nice and professional staff. They have an epic beer selection. Though beer isn't my thing, the selection still impressed me! They helped me select a beer, as I said, beer isn't my thing. They were patient and actually found me an option to \"get me through the night\". I did move on to margaritas though, and were these delicious! So why the 4 starts, well, they kept running out of things. For instance, my margarita went skinny when they ran out of the regular mix they use. Then, they ran out of limes! The margaritas, even the skinny ones, were fantastic! They use A LOT of ice, but still tasted delicious. Decor was wonderful for Christmas. It was just a warm and inviting space. We will definitely go back if we are ever back in that area! Parking was sufficient, as it was a weeknight. I'm sure that helped for it not to be too crowded. Everything was very clean also. Just a great place to go and meet with friends over drinks. If you're expecting tapas, call ahead to see when the kitchen closes. The kitchen had closed shortly after we got there, which was a bummer. Regardless, check this place out if you're in the area!"

It was meh but it filled our bellies so in that aspect it got the job done.   The drinks are where it is at here. My husband ordered a flight of beer. Tons of options to choose from. I ordered Bishop cider on draft. I got the strawberry (my favorite) and also the apple pineapple. All the drinks were good.  We noticed that staff attention to customers had been a little lacking and very slow. I think this has more to do with our crappy country and COVID. But who am I to judge? We just made sure to grab our check before I was even close to being done with my second glass."

The back courtyard has giant Jenga and other games and there are plenty of seating options both indoors and outdoors. Just recently tried their food and the loaded fries were pretty good! I was looking around at surrounding tables and their food all looked great. Can't wait to try more here in the future. Tons of beer on tap and very knowledgeable bartenders who make great recommendations. I will say that their cocktail availability is slim but definitely a good spot for beer."

We thought would give the round rock location of try. Came in happy hour and were pleased with the bartenders from the friendlyness and helpfulness. Our food met our expectation in time and quality as well as the drinks. However when I went to pay for our $40 bill with $100 cash we were told \"we don't take cash\". Number one, probably should tell someone that before they eat and drink your food and beverage, and number two, why? Is cash dirtier than a credit card you've never sanitized? I don't understand businesses that say \"I don't want your cash\". And I don't plan on patronizing them again either."

Service is outstanding, they always have A great selection of beer on tap and if you are confused or just can't decide, ask, staff is great and matching your preferences to their current selections. Over the last couple weeks my friends and I have enjoyed flatbreads and sandwiches - Tasty and fresh. The options these days in this area, post Covid, are rather slim - But it is definitely worth you stopping in and staying for a while...

There were a couple of mistakes by our server at first, but I chalked it up to him possibly being new or simply having an off night. Unfortunately, the service progressively got worse throughout the dinner. From spilling a drink on the table, to telling us he wasn't focused, to the bartender remaking the drink and under pouring it, and it taking almost 20 minutes to receive our check after we asked three times for it, you can't blame it on anything but a lack of effort. Continuous poor service can truly ruin an evening if you let it."

                "description": "My Fiancee' and two friends of ours visiting from Dallas area decided to check this place out on Friday night.  I read the reviews on Yelp (as I always do before going), and suggested this place to them.  I am sorry for doing so. We got there, in what seems to be happening area of downtown Round Rock, which I did not know existed.  There are several bars in this same stretch of road.  Parking was easy on the street.  Once we got in, it has the bar and lot of the front area filled (no social distancing here).  Sign at the front read, \"Seat yourself, and we will find ya\".  We sat at a table/booth section across from the bar near the back.  Our waiter, seems like he did not know much.  We asked him questions, and he was not sure.  We found out though, if you don't want beer, they are limited on other alcohol.  I wanted a Grey Goose and tonic.  They did not have Grey Goose.  I asked for Ketel One.  They did not have.  They said they only have local vodkas, \"Dripping Springs\" and \"Titos\".  I went with \"Titos\" and waiter asked three times, what I wanted with the vodka.  My friend got a \"Apple-tini\".  It came in a very small v-shapped glass, that looked like not much more then a shot...and it had ice chips floating in her drink.  She used to be a bartender, and knew that is not what you are supposed to have there.  Also, her boyfriend had a Long Island Ice tea.  He sipped it, and it was not tasting right.  So, she walked up to the bar to get it fixed.  They told her to go back and get her mask and come back (*mind you, no patrons at bar were wearing a mask).  She did so, and ask if they could remake it.  They did so, and brought to our table by different waitress person, and he tasted it, and still not right.  So, my friend asked the waitress if they knew what they put in it.  They went thru all the ingredients and found out they use \"lemonade\" instead of  \"sweet and sour\" , which made it taste really sweet.  The food was just ok.  My friend got a salad, and looked like left over pieces of lettuce they had lying around. The nachos were just ok, and the reuben and cuban were ok.  It took us about 15 min or more just to get our waiter to come back to get bill.  They pay attention to bar area, but not much in area around it.  Sorry, won't be back."

I was shushed and shunned by the staff for having any kind of point of view. I decided to move to the main bar to be by myself and was then questioned by the staff, who blew the whole thing out of proportion. I was told that I needed to leave the premises by some screening bartender because I was \"disturbing other people\"; all while never raising my voice. If the staff had not perpetuated drama, it would have been dropped. I would not suggest this bar unless you're absolutely certain that you're going to be quiet and pay for over price drinks for underwhelming service from the newer waitstaff. Weak management."

The bar staff is friendly and accommodating and there is plenty of seating from couches to regular tables. If you're going to be there for a while drinking be prepared for a hefty bill as nothing is inexpensive here. The awesome lake view helps to ease the $$ pain though. This place lends to awesome people watching as well since this area is a big tourist draw, so overall you can't really go wrong by stopping in here for a weekend libation."

I wasn't greeted by anyone because you have to go up to the bar to order, which is pleasant for my kind of personality. They have very loud music to fit the vibe of the room and plenty of places to sit! Most importantly was the food; I was absolutely amazed by it and it was so delicious! I ordered the sisig and it was the best thing I ever had. I also, ordered a side of Caesar salad, but this was no ordinary piece of salad. It was presented gracefully and tasted extraordinary. The staff is very kind and fast paced with receiving orders. I am very glad that I came to this restaurant and hope I can revisit this place in the future!"

Our server, Sofie, was great- attentive, knowledgeable and had great recommendations for food and drinks. I ordered the brussel sprouts as an appetizer, beef ragu for my main meal, the watchtower for my drink because I love blackberries, and the sticky toffee pudding as my dessert. All of these items were absolutely delicious!   Since we had dinner reservations, the atmosphere inside was intimate with lights lowered, and candles at the table. There is no dress code, but it is a place where you can dress up."

The restaurant staff is friendly as well  However, the food could be much better, especially for the price. I'd do a hard pass on the smash burger; the meat was over cooked and chewy and the fries extremely basic. Definitely not worth anywhere near $18. That said, I did quite enjoy the brisket hash, brisket was very flavorful and tender, but also quite pricey."

                "description": "We were here on Tuesday night to celebrate our anniversary. Overall, it was a nice experience, but the only thing that really wow-ed us was the decor. One of us had been to the back bar area for drinks before, but we were in the main dining room this time around and the atmosphere is lovely. We didn't enjoy the massive circular booth that we were in but whatever. It was definitely quiet around 6:00 pm when we arrived, so we were happy to be leaving once it got busy.   Started with drinks, and Eberly is keeping the trend going of idiotic names for them. The mezcal in the \"Don't Look Back\" completely overpowered the rest of the drink, including the apricot puree which had sounded like a promising addition. The \"Nick the Lounge Singer\" (eye roll emoji here) and \"lonesome traveler\" were fine.  For food, we got the beet salad and the grilled octopus as starters. For the salad, the beets were cooked (what the hell was \"pickled\"?, um no) and ain't no way that was labne unless it came out of a plastic jar. It wasn't bad, per se, but it's annoying when dishes don't come out as advertised. Re. the octopus: it was sliced up, like into PIECES. What the actual F? Are you KIDDING? Why on god's green earth would you serve the octopus in slices unless you 1) precooked it and then are just heating it up or 2) are really trying to get away with such a measly amount. That dish was so creative and delicious (seriously), but the presentation just ruined it. For mains, the pasta ragu was light on the meat but tasted good; the short rib hit the spot--perfectly cooked and the flavors popped.  Dessert was nothing impressive: couple random ice cream flavors and a mediocre frangipane tart. Service was kinda fine. It took the guy a long time to come over initially (even though the place was dead) and he forgot to put in the house salad that we also ordered. But after that, he managed to get the job done.  Bottom line: good, not great, though we'd be willing to go again. 3.5 stars: one of us thinks it should be rounded down, but the other thinks it should be rounded up and he's going to win this time. 4 stars, but you can and should do better, Eberly."

                "description": "In short: definitely don't go to this place for special occasion, below average food and sucky service for higher price!!  We made a reservation for our anniversary brunch almost two weeks before, and mentioned in our reservation under special occasion, so when we checked in, saw there garden covered patio was not full, and asked if we can get a table there, and the girl who was checking in told, they have a reservation for that place at 12:45, we were there @ 11:30 and I asked we too made a reservation and there's no where you can pick a place while making reservation, then she thought for a minute and told, you can add it as a request  So you pick them for a special occasion and specify it in the reservations and request something, which they could've done, but they say no and give you a lame excuse??  Our host was okay, dint even bother to check even once if everything was okay.  Food is okay nothing special, we ordered milk rolls, hot chicken sandwich, French toast, El Paso( cocktail )  Milk rolls: it looked glossy, but it's just like Hawaiian rolls, warm on top and cold at the bottom, they haven't even warmed up thoroughly.  Cocktail was just okay   French toast: this was good, but single slice French toast   For$$$  Hot chicken sandwich: there was nothing hot in it, it's just dry hard chicken breast in between the bun, we dint taste any white cheddar or burnt onion aioli as they have described it.  So overall I don't recommend this place, and especially not for special occasion!!"

I can't knock anything for slow service given most places are short staffed, but it just felt like they weren't really present for a place with a nearly $100 aged ribeye.  That said, I would come back again just for the cocktails and dessert, including the sticky toffee pudding and the Dont look back Mezcal drink. The harissa chicken tasted great and was very juicy but only came with a couple pieces of asparagus and not enough vegetable."

                "description": "We had a great experience here.  It was an anniversary weekend for us and we went to the Eberly to celebrate.  They gave us a nice card when we got there. Very kind.  Started with the Cold Fashioned which was very nicely made, though I have never had one of these, I enjoyed the flavors and tastes.  I will definitely try it again.  I went for the spicy chicken sandwich which was broiled not fried, I loved the flavors and the coleslaw and tangy spicy sauce. It comes with tons of fries.  Also tried the Avacado toast which was nice.  Our strawberry coffee cake came out last (not bad, just were expecting it earlier).  It was very nice, lots of flavors and textures.  Our server seemed to want us to leave though as she kept asking us if we wanted to wrap up the cake , if we wanted anything else or the bill.  We were only there for 45 min total.  That was strange.  Overall great place for breakfast."

Very modern. Very dark but chic.   We started off with the Japanese milk rolls. They were pretty good. Very soft and good. Then had the mussels. Very good. Cooked just right and with the mussels they give you bread. Soak it in the mussels and it's really good. Then we had the potato leek croquettes. These were pretty good. Nice and soft inside but all of these were really good appetizers.   I had the short ribs and it was really good. Very tender. Very well cooked and so good. We also got the sides of crushed potatoes, Brussel Sprouts, and asparagus. All three were very good. Loved the potatoes. Little crispy but soft and good. Brussel Sprouts and asparagus and really good too. Spot on and really good.  My wife got the salmon and she was really happy with this. I got a bite and it was cooked perfectly. Very moist. So good.   Our server was pretty good. She kept our water glasses always filled even when they provide a bottle of water on the table.   So overall,  great food and loved everything about this meal from the appetizers, entree, and sides. Very filling for us. Very fresh food. Really good service and yet the ambiance was intimate but little loud. We had a really good meal and enjoyed it very much. I would have no problem visiting again cause the menu changes so you don't have to worry about same old same old. Enjoy. We did"

Our food took a while to come out, but that was most likely due to the fact that my group consisted of 12 people and most of the food came out in batches so that nobody got their food alone.  The food was tasty, especially the French Toast and milk buns (both are must gets). The crispy potatoes can be skipped. They aren't that great.  The other items we ordered received good feedback overall though, so I would still recommend Eberly. The interior, service, ambiance, and food each have their own highlights, so all together they make this out to be a good brunch spot."

Everyone working there contributed to make sure we had what we needed.  Cocktails are a star attraction. Lots of interesting twists on classics.  The food was very interesting. I had the short ribs which were fantastic. My wife had the harissa chicken which she loved.  Topped it off with dessert and coffee. The apple tart was great.

                "description": "Eberly is a gorgeous restaurant with solid food, drink, and service. 100% the kind of place I'd choose for a first date if I was in my mid 20s and wanted to impress. Hell, even in my mid 30s this place still hits. It's like suddenly living life through an Instagram filter.   My partner and I carbed up with Japanese milk rolls, mushroom mafaldini, and braised pork cheek ragu. All were delicious. Roasted banana crème brûlée and apple frangipane tart were even better. But I think my favorite items here were the cocktails. I highly recommend the Don't Look Back if you like mezcal. I never know what to do with mezcal other than drink it neat, so whenever a place nails a mezcal cocktail, I'm always impressed. Loved the Tristezza and Watchtower as well, but they all sounded great. Definitely need to return for the Anejo Manhattan.  Only thing holding me back from giving it 5 stars is the fact that I've only been here once, and we were seated at a bar high top. While the bar is super cool, and I want to try dining in The Study with some friends next time to get the full experience."

                "description": "Went here for NYE Galactic Rodeo event! It was super fun! The whole place is enormous. They had multiple seating areas and a bar when you step in with plenty of space to walk around. The whole restaurant is designed elegantly and has wood features on the bar. I am really curious to see what it's like functioning normally.  The event had a lot of food, they served us BBQ with a full spread. The brisket, Mac n cheese and potato salad were my favorites. I have no idea if it was catered or if the restaurant made it, but it was really good.  They had a DJ downstairs with awesome decor and lights. Upstairs is Cedar Tavern, which I think maybe partners with Eberly or is owned by the same people? It was a good drinking area, with games and a mechanical bull. They had Symply Courtney hosting the mechanical bull rides and he was very entertaining. We talked to him after the show and he was super nice as well.   There was also a guy doing lasso tricks with a rope! I did not catch his name but, he was very talented.   The rest of the staff was really awesome too.   Overall 10/10 event, would definitely do another NYE here and am super curious to try the restaurant on a normal basis."

There are some places I've gone to where they have some sort of expensive cauliflower dish and it'll only have 5 pieces of bland cauliflower. It kind of feels like you're getting robbed. Eberly does not do that! Their dish is an entire head of cauliflower that has so much flavor and detail. It's obvious in every bite that they put effort into creating it. One of my new favorite places!"

I had the halibut with the side of crushed potatoes and it was delicious. Absolutely yummy with my spicy margarita. The entire staff also signed a bday card for us which was so cute and a little added touch that was appreciated. We had a wonderful time and even lost track of time to go to our other reservation!"

                "description": "The restaurant is BEAUTIFUL!!  The atmosphere, fantastic!  Service was good.  I was so looking forward to having brunch here but was thoroughly disappointed.  In a haste, I chose my usual brunch fare, Eggs Benedict, without reading the ingredients and questioning what exactly was in my meal.  Prior to my going,  I did see many favorable reviews regarding the Eggs Benedict however, none mentioned Braised Collar Greens.  Yes!  Eggs Benedict with Collard Greens.  I'm a HUGE fan of vegetables but let's just say that after trying it at Eberly, I'm NOT a fan of Eggs Benedict with Collard Greens.    I'll be back, Eberly."

                "description": "In person, in dining room, reunion dinner!!! Yes!!  After a long 15 months of not meeting in groups, my original core ATX friends decided we needed, nay, had to meet up.. Eberly was unanimously chosen out of 4 options.  I have always loved the interior of this location, yet to nab seats in the Atrium :(, one day it will happen.   Our evening was just perfect, from the Service, Meal - Starters to Dessert, Wine to Post dinner drinks at the bar.   The reason for 4 stars not 5, the vegetarian pasta entree didn't deliver, the menu description had potential, what I was served paled disappointingly in comparison to everything else that graced our table.   I just noticed that the menu has changed just like our season has. Dinner date anyone? :)"

                "description": "My first visit to Eberly was the end of Jan of 2021 when I came down to visit a wonderful woman. We decided to frequent a few restaurants that evening so we limited our culinary adventure to appetizers. As for beverages I opted for the Piattelli Melbec which was a very well balanced wine, full of flavor but it didn't overpower the diverse plates we ordered.   We opted for the Kanpachi Crudo which was a very pleasant dish. The amberjack fish was delicate and had a nice light flavor. The jap/cucumber broth was very well conceived complimenting the fish, allowing it to take center stage, while just adding hints of heat and earthiness. The radish provided a nice crunch to enhance the flavor profile in terms of how it hit the pallet.  Now, I used to be a chef on the eastern shore, but I've never had octopus worth mentioning nor have I cooked it myself. However, and I'm not being hyperbolic, the octopus blew my mind. It was tender, flavorful, smoky, and had an ever so slight seafood brine to it. The romesco anchored the whole dish, pushing the natural flavors of the octopus to the forefront while enhancing the perfumed smoke juxtaposing it with the red peppers and slight tang of the sourdough, only uncovering it after several pleasurable chews. This dish was my favorite dish I've had so far in Austin.   I came back to Eberly in June of 2021. My date and I ordered three small dishes which never seemed to live up to my fond memory of a my previous visit. I opted to leave my wine comfort zone and ordered the Domaine Nais Rose wine. It was light and perfect for a hot July night with subtlety being the most distinguishing characteristic.    The first dish was the Tuna Poke which I liked but not loved. This had more to do with my anticipation of a higher sesame profile than the vision of the head chef. Aside from that, the tuna was fresh and sized right while the yuzo soy was divine offering, the perfect hint of fermentation.    Dish two were the steamed mussels. Typically I'm not a huge mussel fan (sorry Arnold Schwarzennegger) but these were outstanding. The mussels were cooked to perfection and all were opened (ie not dead before the cooking process) while being large and succulent. The white wine added a perfect spike of acidity while the 'nduja was flavorful complimenting the seafood. The corn added a nice sweet pop to the dish and the herbs were spot on.   As I previously stated, I had the octopus 6 months earlier. I considered telling the wonderful woman I had been courting I wanted the octopus again almost as much as I wanted to see her, however this was internal monolog of which it was never outwardly spoken. Joking aside perhaps the previous experience was a fairytale that I built from a hut into a castle in my mind. The octopus was once again was flawless. Being boiled for the absolute perfect amount of time then getting a kiss of smoke from the grill. However, my letdown came with the avocado-cilantro puree. The acidity didn't compliment the dish as my previous experience and the romesco. Rather it overpowered the fish, competing for the dominate flavor in my mouth. The olives and pine nuts were ok but the battle of sauce vs protein diverted my attention from enjoyment to befuddlement. My take away is, and this is paramount, Eberly knows how to provide a wonderful culinary experience and can cook Octopus! It is well worth your time and money to try this exhilarating experience. This restaurant is one of my favorites in town and the front of the house operations work flawlessly with in-depth knowledge of all customer centric aspects."

Couldn't tell if the bathroom was clean (one bathroom for everyone) it was very dark in there. We had reservations for dinner but gathered early thinking we'd sit at the bar but you need a reservation at the bar. I had the halibut which was fine, nothing special. I added an order of asparagus which was generous and covered in a lot of yummy sauce."

They're also relatively expensive for the experience (for not knowing how to explain them). Also, I just don't find them good. Strong alcohol taste, and not in a good way...   On another note... Patrizis is an absolutely banger. 10/10 would recommend."

                "description": "This review might be a bit biased because I don't really enjoy the taste of alcohol, but here it goes:  I ordered the margarita and added the mango flavor for an additional $1. I couldn't taste any mango as it was all masked by the strong tequila. I'm not sure if all margs are like this, but it could have been because the ratio of tequila to everything else was off. My friends and I all agreed that the taste of alcohol was a bit too strong for a drink like a margarita.   I did like the ease of ordering drinks. We were eating at Patrizis and I liked how you could order and pay off your phone and they'd bring it straight to your table within 5min."

                "description": "Came here for the first time about a month ago. It's definitely an \"East Austin\" vibe, like a crazy backyard with statues and lights and mismatched patio tables.   I like that they do have a hostess at the front gate to seat you, so you don't have to do that awkward wandering around the yard looking for a table and feeling like everyone is staring at you. They also check IDs and take your temperature at the front.   Currently, all the ordering is done via your cell phone. Scan the QVC code, and then view the menu and place your order to your table number and they carry out your drinks. Note that when ordering liquor, it requires you to order food with it, so they have a menu of $2 bar snacks. After the first round, we notated that we had already ordered snacks, and were not required to buy more with every drink purchase. But they did check for the snacks when the drinks were brought out.  I've only tried the margarita and a dirty vodka martini, $9 and $10 respectively. DAMN. Those margaritas are GOOD and STRONG. I had 2 and i was....feeling no pain. My martini was also PERFECT. Worth the money, and if you get there during happy hour, the margs are only $5! I did also enjoy the little $2 package of trail mix with MandMs.   One thing I noticed was that the cup size seemed to change, one time i went and they were served in these short plastic cups and another time these taller plastic cups. I was a little concerned that there are inconsistent portions but I can't be sure.  Will definitely be back, those drinks are FIRE and i want to try the food truck. Also plenty of non street parking which i appreciate!"

                "description": "A magical circus of a place.  Never mind they have a real circus wagon out on the side, out of which they serve Italian food.  Never mind the strings of colored lights that make the back yard look like a carnival midway.  Never mind that the Vortex theater is right inside.  So if you are a paying customer, just beyond the velvet door curtain of the Vortex, there really ARE sword swallowers, lesbian ring masters, dancing dryads in water pools, and mega-gods of universal destruction.   Actually what is behind the velvet door curtain changes every few weeks.   When you go it may be nuclear rainbow unicorns, cybernetic tap dancers and the Flaming King of the Empire of the Ashes.  There will always be something interesting behind the Vortex velvet door for sure.  However, it is just as magical out in the bar.  The bar magic goes on all night rather than ending at the one hour and forty minute mark.  Of course, part of the magic is EtOH.  EtOH produces far more intoxicating illusions than anything that goes on in the main hall of the Vortex.  (EtOH is chemical-ese for ethyl alcohol, otherwise known as booze.)  The Butterfly Bar serves first rate EtOH.  Most of the house drinks are girly cocktails of classical or recent provenance. These are fine for what they are.  However, they do one wicked little number called the Whippoorwill which is fine bourbon, cold brew coffee, New Orleans style chicory and foam with secret flavor ingredients.  The Ghost of Sherlock Holmes appears and takes you down all the secret passages of the house.  The magic is generally enhanced by broadcasts of best-of scenes from past Vortex productions, projected on one wall.  There are projections of obscure documentaries on another wall. These have no sound, and I can promise you, you have never heard of any of them.  There is a vending machine on the wall that will sell you thirty dollar forks, knives and spoons that will save the world.  (I am not making that last detail up. Check it out for yourself.)  There are cats who run the establishment and have more authority than the bartenders.  One particular kingly and somnolent feline decided he was going to take his nightly nap at my table on the bench.  He claimed his space where I otherwise would have preferred to sit, and owned half of my table for the rest of the night.  He occasionally roused himself for twenty seconds just to make sure no service dogs had entered the establishment. After that, he returned to his regal slumbers.  The most magical parts of the establishment however, are not the food truck, the colored lights, the video loops, the drinks or the cats,   The most magical parts of the Butterfly bar are the patrons.  This is one of the most fantastical people watching spots in Austin.  It is a world of twenty nine different genders. It is a world of eighty nine different art forms. It is a world of magical costumes to die for. It is a world of back stories that makes your Ghost of Sherlock Holmes seem relatively tame.  The imaginary characters on the Vortex Stage have nothing on the real-life characters that populate the Butterfly Bar  So come to the Butterfly Bar and watch all of the limits of your plain-jane everyday reality dissolve.  Bring your magic hat even if it is just an old Chicago White Sox cap you got as a kid at a ballgame.  After half an hour, you will be able to reach inside that baseball cap and pull out a talking marmoset."

                "description": "I arrived there the Wednesday before Thanksgiving.  Before riding there on my bike from 4 miles away,  i mapped out the route on Google Maps beforehand and Google said it was closed. the phone recording on the bar's answering machine said they were open for business. Still wanting to confirm,  i tried ordering some food/drink over the website and again it let me order food/drink.  So i arrive to the bar and there is a piece of paper stuck on door that said \"closed.\" About 4-5 others were standing around also surprised that it was closed. Butterfly Bar management lacked a modicum of courtesy to its potential customers by omitting  to mention on its website/ answering machine/ FB  that it was indeed closed on a non-holiday. Surprise!Customers are going to rely on that answering machine msg and actually take an Uber or ride their bikes several miles to get there. It would make sense to at least turn off the answering machine completely if you are not going to bother to change the outgoing message. I doubt i will venture out to Butterfly Bar again. Luckily, the very professionally-run Salty Sow nearby gave us excellent refreshments and earned the $100+ we spent that night."

Kind of hidden from the main road, the Butterfly Bar has one sign and a gate that you follow to an outdoor garden full of twinkle lights and laughing people. There's a stage where there's often performances and a little indoor cabin part where you order drinks. It's almost pitch black outside at night, but makes for a fun date and casual atmosphere.   I ordered a mojito and it was delicious and strong. I would 100% recommend going here if you're in the area! So fun and unique."

She asked for a card for the tab and we asked if we could do two separate tabs to which she basically told us that we could be on one tab and figure out the rest on our own. Then as I offered up my card with a bit of hesitation she made a comment about how some of us in the group didn't know what it was like to go out prior to Covid and open a tab. Her facetious comment was directed at me being that I recently turned 21 and was the youngest. Next we received our drinks, I understand that some drinks are made bigger than others, but when my friends were brought their drinks they were all filled to the top, weheres mine was filled 3/4. I let it go and asked if we could get some more water and our waitress said ok and never came back until it was last call and my friend asked again, then she brought the water. Let me mention that we were not belligerent, we were in a space by ourselves and we had each ordered a single drink and had food. When we asked for our check, my friend asked our waitress how her night had been, thinking that if it had been busy then maybe she was just a bit frustrated and we should be understanding of that, instead she said it had been an easy night, then why rudeness directed at me? All people  in my party (with 2 being practically strangers) noticed the difference in attitude towards me compared to them. Overall it was very upsetting as a POC to get this clear difference in treatment from another POC at an establishment that loudly advocates for POC. I still tipped her, because we are in a pandemic it's the right thing to do, but I felt so strongly about this that it made me write my first yelp review."

Great service that is quick and active, not the typical where you're standing there trying to make eye contact for 10 minutes.  Patrizi's out back so you got great food with good drink; not best selection of beer but local Texas.  Got a projector on the wall for special showings, but expect a hangout on most nights and not a get-some-work-done type of venue.  Overall a good spot and easy to find parking out back."

                "description": "I love this place! I have only passed by this when driving on Manor like 1,000,000 times! It is truly a hidden gem and super divey! Getting into the parking lot kind of sucks if you are coming from Manor because it is such a small little entrance, if you have a bigger SUV, it might be tight for you. Otherwise, this place is amazing! There are a lot of different picnic tables outside and some w/umbrellas and some without. Also, some of them have heating lamps for when it is cold. They have a food truck here apparently that is supposed to be amazing, we didn't try it because we had already had dinner but the line to the food truck was literally out the fence. The butterfly bar also has indoor seating but the outside seating is more lively and fun! I had a sangria and it was super tasty! It had OJ and brown sugar in it made w/red wine! I love this place. They have a couple cats walkin around too, don't pet them, they don't like it. Cheers!"

                "description": "I chose this winery for my husband and I, because I found the \"Grape Escape,\" and it was seemingly a perfect choice. A full tasting + a glass of your favorite from the tasting + a pizza to share. (And I sprung for the custom-label bottle to go with it!) It was $40 a person -- closer to $45 each at checkout with fees and what not -- which I already thought was ridiculously well-price for what you get. But then, they blew us away with the location, service, quality, and overall experience. The tasting wasn't just a cookie-cutter preset selection. Our \"experience guide\" asked us what flavors we preferred and talked us through multiple options for our tastes. It was awesome! Now, I'm not a wine aficionado by any means, but our guide was clearly knowledgeable and passionate about his work. And I enjoyed all of the options he brought to the tasting for us. (My experience was that all of the wines were quite unique in flavor, and the tasting consisted of lots of new wine-types I'd never even heard of!) Then, icing on the cake: getting to pick a favorite to have a full glass of! *chef kiss*  The pizza ended up coming with a starter salad as well, which was a nice surprise. The food was delicious. Well made, not over-the-top, but rather just enough to satisfy our bellies and our palettes.   After finishing up with the Grape Escape, my husband and I went for a walk around the property on a trail that leads you around the vines and gives some awesome views. This was arguably my favorite part. The property is huge and gorgeous! But, it was a gloomy and COLD February day when we visited, so we will definitely be back to see the property in bloom and in warmer weather."

The founder of the winery, Madelyn, visited our table and we chatted for quite a while. Great plans for the future! Our meal was incredible. One person in our party said it was the best meal  she has ever had. That is quite a statement! We asked to see the chef.  Executive Chef Shawn graciously accepted our kudos and applause. We walked the property and will always remember the great experience and fabulous property views. Well done!"

                "description": "My daughter gave me the gift of her time, along with a 3-course meal and wine tasting, to honor a special occasion. We decided to make this a weekday outing, to minimize traffic and the possibility of large groups being at the winery.  We were promptly greeted and seated upon arrival. The dining room was largely empty, and we had superb service. This was our second visit to the winery, and we plan to return.   We tasted 7 wines in all, 3 of which were paired with the November menu of panzanella (a bread salad), fennel-crusted pork tenderloin, and cannoli. The wine pairings were excellent.   We were not big fans of the panzanella. It seemed to need additional ingredients to make it more interesting and less dry. The main course, however, was fabulous. The pork medallions were crusty and flavorful. The linguine accompaniment was wonderfully garlicky, making it almost possible to ignore that the pasta was overcooked. And the cannoli was excellent. I think of cannoli as a finger food; these mini cannoli were made pretty with their presentation but more messy to eat because of the chocolate sauce. The cannoli were served with a very good port wine.   All in all, we had a very nice meal and enjoyed the wines... which we drank. No spitting for us! We are not connoisseurs, but certainly enjoy good quality wine. Some of Flat Creek's are very good indeed.   This was not a cheap excursion, but the 2 hours we spent there were worth it. This would be a great place for a romantic date, and also worked well as a mother-daughter excursion. Flat Creek has other dining options that include pizza, and there's a disc golf course on the premises. Do make advance reservations for your visit, as this isn't a large establishment and can be a long (but pretty) drive from the Austin area."

                "description": "I wish I could give 3.5 stars! Overall, I had a nice time here. We did \"the grape experience\" for 2 people which included wine flights for both of us and a pizza each. Payed $80 not including tax + tip left on site. When we purchased online, the description said one pizza per 2 people and 2 salads but when we arrived we were given a pizza each so we had lots of leftovers :) Pizza was just okay, nothing special. Salad was really good! It was probably my favorite part of the meal. I didn't love the wines I tried, but I do tend to go for sweeter wines and these were all pretty tart. Overall, I had a nice time and the staff were all very nice."

                "description": "I can't say enough about this place. We've visited this vineyard a few times but our latest visit was memorable. We met the new owner Neal and John the restaurant manager and they were genuinely amazing people. They initiated conversation, asked us if everything was going well and the owner took the time to come by our table to ensure we we were having a great time and thanked us for our visit. They understand that we could've chosen to spend our afternoon elsewhere so they were genuinely appreciated for our business. The food was amazing, the servers were attentive and courteous. Then later we met Clare, a young lady that came around and asked us what else they could do to make our visit even better. She brought some wines for us to try. Incredibly amazing experience. They're a family place where you can bring your kids, your pets without feeling that you're bothering anyone. They have plenty of seating areas and amazing views. Their wines are super good and the owner explained to us that they're going to start a renovation and having a new winemaker so I can't wait to see all the great things they will accomplish to make the experience even better! Wow hard to say because they're already exceeding my expectations!"

This chef needs to be recognized for such wonderfully prepared dishes.  The customer service was great and every pairing was on point.  Balancing flavors in the food, pairing the dishes and wines, and giving 2 hours for our experience was meticulously thought out.  If Spanish wines are your preference, then you should come to this winery.  Neil is the new owner and came to chat with us.  He has great plans for this place and I cannot wait to return for wine updates.  This place absolutely deserves 5 stars."

In addition your apology seems very condescending and not genuine at all.  How do you know that what we were envisioning?

My girlfriend and I made our first trip to Marble falls this past weekend and are very happy to say we started the weekend off here at Flat Creek Estate.   We enjoyed the \"Chef's 3 course experience\" which was one of the best dining experiences we've ever had! 6 glasses of wine and a 3 course meal that took us on a  flavorful journey. At one point we felt like Remy in that scene from Ratatouille, the one where he pairs the strawberry with some cheese and feels fireworks... yes, it was really that good!  Carmen was a priceless part of the already amazing experience, she was so friendly, enthusiastic and helpful! Ask for her to be your server if you can!

We started with wine tasting followed by a spectacular wine pairing with each course. We hadn't really considered Texas wine as equivalent to Calif wines but we were wrong. All of the wines we sampled were great and because of that we ended up heading home with 14 bottles! The owner even stopped by to ask us about our experience which we gladly shared.

                "description": "It hurts me to write this review. We truly want every small business to thrive. My family and I went to the Vineyard on a Friday afternoon for an intimate celebration of my husband's birthday with our mom, dad and children, it ended in my 5-year old little one being verbally attacked by a man in the pavilion, who identified himself as 'the owner'.   We decided to try the disc golf course, and we loved our experience with Casey, he is a gem! Very knowledgeable about disc golf, and very accommodating. We let him and Madelyn (the owner's wife) know we were celebrating a birthday. The course was fun, but ridden with fire ants, red ants, sticker burs and bull nettle. It was not the polished experience we were expecting. But still fun for our family.   We finished disc golf, and returned to the pavilion around 6:00pm.  We ordered a large dinner, but since we were not offered to sit in the main seating area, we sat under the outdoor pavilion. We were in the pavilion for less than 5 minutes, and the adults arranged tables so our family could sit together (there is no waiter in the pavilion so we had to move tables on our own). During those few minutes my two small children were playing under the pavilion, not causing any harm or damage, just laughing and trotting around like kids do outside (he is 5 and she is 7).   Out of no where a man started verbally attacking my 5-year old. This man who looked to be in his 70s, was sitting at a table drinking bottles of wine with 2 other people. He continued to yell at the top of his lungs scaring me and my babies. They came running to me asking me why the man was yelling and whistling at them. It broke my heart. A complete stranger was attacking them for no apparent reason.   After protecting them, my dad and husband approached the man who was yelling the obscenities. This is when he identified himself as 'the owner'. He told us our children were 'out of control' and we needed to get them under control. I asked them what they were doing to display out of control behavior, and he didn't say a thing, besides he had guests with him and they were disrupting his evening. My father let the man know if we were going to be patrons of his business, we would not tolerate his verbal abuse of our 5 and 7 year old children. My father also told him, \"We don't yell at our kids like that and if he had a problem with the way our children were behaving he could have stood up and walked over while we were arranging our own tables and told us in a normal tone of voice the problem he saw.\"  After the incident, the man sat at his table continuing to drink wine for 45 minutes, and sadly never came back to our table to apologize to our children for scaring them because of his obscene behavior. As we left, both of my children continued to asked why he was so angry.   We now understand this pavilion is in 'the owners' front yard. On this evening Rick (the owner) had been drinking with friends and our family was interrupting their evening. His behavior not only made us feel the most unwelcome as paying customers, but was abusive and completely out of control, especially as 'the owner'.  We should have been able to have this conversation with the business owner. Unfortunately, he left the pavilion to go back to his house, and did not return or offer an apology.  ***Update in Response to Owners Apology Below***  Your apology ends with 'resolve any confusion or fears the children had regarding why they were reprimanded'. The main point of why this experience was so horrifying: No one should ever reprimand a 5-year old child, except that child's guardians. If there was an issue with a child's safety, that concern should have been directed to the guardians who were standing between the children and the owner. Never should a stranger, much less a 70-year old man who is consuming alcohol ever 'reprimand' a child, ever! Of course of case the outcome was severe harm to the child, in this case, our 5-year old was not in severe danger.  Regarding the excuse that you 'witnessed dangerous behavior, and you had to immediately intervene': If there are components of your business that are dangerous to patrons, you should immediately remove these hazards, so that they don't become a safety issue. If you feel your deck boxes are not safe, you should store them in a storage facility where patrons do not have access.   Regarding your comment that 'you wish to leave discipling to parents but are forced to intervene when there is a safety concern': We were a party of 4 adults, and we were less than 10 feet away from our children. While we were bussing our own tables and arranging furniture, we were not aware my 5- year old sat on the 'deck box' and got down by jumping off. This type of 'danger' (i.e. sitting on a sitting area, and jumping off something that is no more than 2 feet off the ground) should not elicit the response of 'discipline' by a stranger, or 'immediate' intervention."

                "description": "Covid/\"reopening\" June review.   Signage not great, and cell reception can be spotty, so be sure to download the map to your cell phone in advance.   Beautiful location and building. Plenty of parking.   Inside tables by reservation only. Nicely separated, no issues being close to other guests. Not the same for reception or table service.  Server was pleasant, but had zero concept of social distancing, no mask and was right in our faces each time we had an interaction.   Menu/tasting a little confusing. Basically you prepay $40 each and get whatever you want from the menu, including wine to drink there or to go. Most wines were available for tasting pours, but not all. Some wines good, some not so much. Liked the primitivo the most of the many we tried.   Very nice for the setting and service. Great set up for limited capacity, but they really need to work on wait staff protection."

                "description": "We went for a wine tasting during a girls weekend but decided to just sit and have dinner instead. The baked Brie was great, but the \"roasted\" Brussel sprouts were truly just steamed and served on a sizzling cast iron skillet -- definitely NOT roasted. It honestly was a let down as \"roasted\" truly didn't mean roasted. The wine was great, service was great.... But food was just mediocre for the price."

                "description": "This used to be one of my favorite places on Manor to grab dinner and a drink, but unfortunately I don't think I'll return again. The vibes here are so uncomfortable since they hired an incredibly rude bartender/manager who barks at customers like they are her subordinates in the army.  I've noticed she has been on staff during each of my visits since the pandemic began. It's hard for me to imagine how someone with such poor social skills has been placed in a customer-facing role. I will however continue supporting Techo, the mezcal bar upstairs, with super friendly staff and lovely atmosphere."

This little gem is sandwiched behind Mi Madre's and El Chilito. You'll miss it if you blink! Swing around back for parking or walk up from the front.   Indoor/outdoor seating with puppers welcomed outside.   + Tasty noms (get the fried deviled eggs. Woo!) Classy cocktails Very relaxed vibe Minimal staff contact  Safety measures in place Cute little floating books  Clean bathroom  - This place is smaller, dont bring a big group.  No cash, yall. Its dirty, ya know? Small parking outback   I took my cousin and we had a really nice time. The staff and bartenders were incredibly kind and went above and beyond to be helpful.   Definitely check this place out with a friend or two...or a pupper or two."

                "description": "Food is delicious! I came here twice to order their deviled eggs!  It's best if you come during recess hours (happy hour) and check out their discounted menu! Otherwise, expect to pay minimum $14 for your main course. I love that their menu, decor and the restaurant reminds me of an elementary school.   Service was wonderful and food came out about 15 mins on a slow day. It's also conveniently located between a couple of taco restaurants if you need a quick snack!   Patio is Bob and dog friendly! There's water bowls for your thirsty pup on the side of the restaurant if you choose to bring your furry companion!   Bartender made me a cute mimosa to enjoy before heading back to the airport. Definitely coming back to visit when I'm in town again!"

                "description": "Visited for happy hour and wasn't smitten with any dish (except the mac 'n cheese). Everything was fine; just nothing that makes me want to return again any time soon.  I love the indoor seating with its broody, dark interiors and the plentiful outdoor seating on park benches (hard to get in and out of if you're wearing a skirt/dress!) and when the sunset is that beautiful magenta/hot Texas orange color, this venue is perfectly situated to stare longingly at it. I also like that you order from the counter instead of traditional table service because sometimes it's nice not to be interrupted (make sure you have everything you need before you sit down, though, because if the line is long, it makes it difficult to track someone down for something).  A solid place for a drink if you're a sunset chaser."

A mess. Drinks are basic and uninteresting. If you want a decent site to sit and chat with your friends, it's a good place to hang, but you can find the same atmosphere elsewhere and get palatable food and better cocktails."

                "description": "Solid neighborhood bar, but i probably wouldn't come if i didnt live near by.   The best feature is the patio, Manor road is a cool neighborhood and its fun to people watch. The inside feels a little cramped for a group and it can be pretty loud. The neighborhood in general is nice. If your in the area you should stop by.  They also have some good happy hour deals. 6 dollar fish and chips and 5 dollars off bottles of wine. Each day of the week has a different deal and they're all pretty good.  In terms of drinks, they have a decent selection of beers on tap. Theyre selection extends beyond the basic austin starter pack too which is nice.  In terms of food,  Its a step up from bar food, but i definitely wouldn't call this a gastro pub. The fish and chips are good but definitely greasy and the portions are inconsistent.    The burger is pretty good. The patty is pretty thick and they put a jam on top thats sweet which stole the show. I think the jam was made of onions. I only wish they put more jam on top. It has a similar effect as ketchup. be warned, the saten burger is a little tough."

The only parking available is street parking behind the bar in the neighborhood, but you don't have to walk too far. (Less than 5 min)  This bar has a throwback school vibe with chalkboards on the walls and mini composition notebooks for your receipt. They have a good craft beer selection and their food is delicious and higher quality than your average bar food. We ordered the wings and pretzels. The pretzels are a bit more oily, however it being bar food, filled my greasy food craving. The mustard seed it came with was a great pair (although i highly recommend adding a queso dip!). The wings were delicious as well and were mild spicy. There is patio seating out back and picnic tables out front, as well, so there is plenty of space for a group."

                "description": "I had been meaning to check this place out as it is literally down the street from a friend's apt on Manor and having investigated almost every other place on the block, my FOMO was kicking in when I would see this place packed to the hilt every time we drove by. Luckily, I came on a quiet weekday evening and barely made it for their HH (the bartender was nice enough to honor it since it was but a minute over).   I like the vibe here, it is very trendy eastside but w/o the pretension or self-importance of other places nearby.   I had my sights set on the Montreal fries as I am a poutine enthusiast (and purist, to be truthful) , so I will establish right now these are not traditional poutine, but a conceptualization. First off, the serving was massive and I probably reached my sodium quota for the week by finishing every last bite, but I'm not a quitter and setting this heap of short ribs, gravy, cheese curds, and fries in front of me was instantly \"Challenge: Accepted!\". It took me almost an hour and a half whittling away one bite at a time and having to take literal breathers in between, but it was ::MISSION ACCOMPLISHED:: (in the unironic non-Bush sense) and I had 0 regrets.  In the 90mins of unleashing my hardcore Fatty for all to see, I got to interact w/the staff and other patrons and I have to say, there were no judgements (aamof, I got several nods and eyebrow raises of approval at my endeavor). I'll admit, everyone I encountered was a very Austin-y version of splendid! We laughed, I cried (when I finally finished the Montreal Fries), and even rebuked the very handsome bartender's insinuation I would even think about a to-go box!   All in all, I enjoyed my visit here and can see myself coming back on an off/quiet night. The seating inside is pretty cozy and the patio is smallish as well, so I can only imagine how chummy you have to get with your fellow \"students\" when the Friday bell sounds and weekend recess is in effect!"

Think it was worth it.   While small the space was great and the food and drinks on point. Loved the smokey blood Mary. Got the potato hash vegan style and it was tasty.   Only thing that was a miss was the way they handled the crowd. Couldn't order food and drink until after a time past open which isn't their fault but there wasn't enough staff to handle the crowd. Food went to wrong people and no one to check on diners.  They did the best they could but poor planning.   Will give them another go on a normal day and think things will be five star worthy."

Went ahead and sampled some beers, grabbed a Dogfish Punkin Ale - they guy even threw some sugar and freshly ground cinnamon on the rim! This is the only way you should be drinking a pumpkin beer!   Ordered the fish and chips - $5 bucks on HH! These things came with some serious garlic fries.. I want you to take what you think is a lot of garlic, then multiply it by 83874... Somehow still delicious, the tarter sauce on the side deserves an award.. It was like a tarter/greek tzatziki sauce hybrid! I should have asked for some to-go. No idea why they give you ketchup as well.. Doesn't really fit the plate because of the fry seasonings and garlic. The fish was tender and crispy... perfect balance.   If you haven't had a chance to check this spot out, throw it on your list!  One last thing - if you do order the fish and chips.. Don't go get your game on for the night without brushing and gargling a gallon of mouthwash, throw some gum in for good measure! Be responsible, people!"

Took advantage of the full kitchen and bar and got the sweet potatoes! Was pleasantly surprised by how good they were. They came with a curry masala mayo (which my drunk friend loved so much, they basically licked my plate clean). Will have to come back and try the sandwiches everyone is talking about"

I came back here this weekend and not a single thing changed.   We got to sit outside this time and everything was perfect. Yellow Jacket Social Club is a diamond in the rough."

In total, we had two drinks apiece and slightly more experience compared to other places in the area. I have been here once before and had some fries. They had been pretty decent. Overall, I would recommend and will be back in the future."

                "description": "We came here on a Saturday night for the open patio seating and the grungy vibe. We got lemon drop shots, Vegas bombs, and Modelo's... Props to the bartenders for making legitimate lemon drops instead of hating us for ordering them.  They had bar service, and line was never longer than 3 people or crowded. We didn't have to wait for a table at all when we arrived. We sat in a table nestled in the trees and although I saw reviews that complained about the birds, the trees were a nice back rest, and the social distancing was comforting! It's definitely not a fancy or experience-based spot, but it has a time and place!   Pro tip: If you get stuck on the wrong side of the really long fence in the street, one of the panels to the right of the entrance is unattached and you can step through!!"

I walked it and was completely ignored. It felt like if I wasn't into indie music or dresses like a local I wasn't look at. I had a coworker who loves this place and raves about it. She was a very rude person so I shouldn't have know she would love this place. Like minded people, like minded spaces. I tried to give you a shot Yellow Jacket, but you weren't batting an eye. So I left and found other bars who didn't judge me in my appearance."

                "description": "We visited Yellow Jacket Social Club for an after work cocktail and they did not disappoint. From the guy at the door to the bartender, everyone was super kind and helpful. We ended up ordering the watermelon frozen margaritas - I could be wrong but I think they change up their frozen cocktails quite often. If you come across it on your visit, I would definitely recommend it. They had a variety of beer options and even though I didn't order any food, their menu looked appetizing.  They have a cool vibe with an expansive patio setup. If you get the choice between small/large cocktail, get the large. The price comparison is $7/10 and the large seemed like a way better deal. The birds above can be a little bit of a nuisance so try and sit somewhere with less tree above. They were also very Covid safe and instead of having everyone order in the bar, they had a makeshift bar setup outside where you would place your order. I recommend grabbing a patio seat here on a beautiful day!"

Bartender was alright but the staff overall and vibe of the place were not as hospitable as other places nearby. The inside is small with a five bar feel, which I'm fine with, the outside area is probably nice on days where it isn't raining but I sat out there during cloud cover and it was just alright. The parking lot gets flooded after rain so take that into consideration, The bright spot of this place was their potato wedges. Not even kidding. They aren't your typical wedges and I was delighted at how good they were. I'd return just for the those, to be honest. If you want no frills and to keep entirely to yourself, this is probably your place. Social butterflied would be best served somewhere else."

I love coming here when it's not busy, which I'm finding is becoming more and more difficult as time passes. The place has built up a solid base of loyal customers that seem to return week after week and I can't blame them. There is consistency at work here, the staff is always excellent - they make great recommendations to the ever-changing list of beers on tap, the selection of beers is constantly rotating, and best of all - the food is delicious. We often consider ordering take-out for only the pizza/pizza rolls here.   This place has adapted to changing times, they have more outdoor seating so we're able to socially distance ourselves most of the time and feel safe during our visit. I'm happy to see this place thrive."

So first, for some reason, my GPS kept taking me across the street where the Zaxbys and Arbys are located. I finally had the sense to check across the street and there it was! Hard to see from the street, but it's there. Anyways, this is a cool neighborhood pizza and beer bar. Apparently, they change the drafts all the time so you can try different types of beer. Brett at the counter helped me and was very nice. I ordered a pizza to go (pepperoni, Canadian bacon, bacon bits, mushrooms), lemon pepper wings and two Live Oak Hefenweizen beers (yes! You can get two beers to go!). While I waited, I enjoyed yuengling on tap and Brett also let me sample a few beers. The pizza and wings were delicious! I was so hungry that I forgot to take pics, but just trust me, it looked as good as it tasted! I will definitely be back when I'm in the area again."

There's also plenty of tables outside with umbrellas for those with dogs or don't mind the scorching Texas heat.  The pizza is delicious. I can't remember the name of it but it had Canadian bacon, bacon and a sriracha bbq drizzle on it. Crust was delicious, the bottom wasn't soggy near the center.  Also tried the pretzels with beer cheese. Mmmmmm.   A really big beer selection available as well.   Service was great. You order at the bar, get a number and they bring to your table.

                "description": "In my previous review, I neglected to mention something important. This is one of those businesses which require you to pay first and they hit you with the gratuity percentage upfront before you receive your food and service.  The gratuity should come at the end of the meal and service, not at the beginning and I have found this practice puts more money in the business' pocket at your expense.  Now with that said, their pizza, wings and pizza rolls are quite exceptional. they have an extensive beer selection which is always changing around to keep up with the seasons. So if paying upfront along with the gratuity doesn't bother you then we do recommend the fare, however I find it a turn off. Especially since they forgot half of our order and didn't get it to us until we were ready to leave. So basically, one star for the payment practice, but four stars for the food and beer."

We had a beer called Nola- next time we go I'll get a growler but since we weren't going straight home and forgot a cooler that had to wait. Their beer cheese looks like gravy.. it doesn't taste like gravy though- highly suggest! We will definitely be back next time he visits. Nice large patio and clean bathrooms as well."

The environment is loud but in the good way that makes you feel comfortable and relaxed. I saw numerous kids here as well so I guess if you have children you don't have to leave them at home for this one. I have to point out, staff wears no masks and they aren't required if you're into that thing."

                "description": "Decent selection of craft beers, but one thing unique about this bar is that they do not allow customers to sample any beers, unlike most of their competitors.  I undetstand the policy to a certain extent, especially if you had very knowledgeable bartenders, but that is not the case here.  During my most recent visit, one person I was with asked for an IPA that was very hoppy, But instead got something but was very sour and totally did not like the taste of the beer. She was stuck with paying for the pint, despite the bartender's error.  The pizza (bbq chicken) was decent, but pretty bready - took away from the tasty toppings - left me feeling like we were served a glorified frozen pizza - we were hungry so we devoured the pizza, but we were disappointed and will thing twice before  ordering it again.  They had some live music, a young man with the guitar singing cover songs, did a very decent job. It helped make the dying experience enjoyable.  It was a great night to sit on the patio, with a nice breeze, some decent music being played, and the company of good friends.  Perhaps they could think about modifying their policy so that you're entitled to one beer sample, as long as you order a full beer.  The bartender stated the reason for the no sample policy was because of Covid... I just do not buy it, given the fact that None of the bars/restaurants that I have gone to the last couple of months have this type of policy."

Wings and other bar food options are surprisingly good as well.   Very popular local spot so this place can get packed. Decent amount of indoor and outdoor seating.

Unfortunately I didn't get a pic of the wall of beers since I ate outside to enjoy the cool Texas breeze. The pretzel sticks were hot from the oven. The carnivore pizza had enough meat for four pizzas so come ready to eat. I must say the Hefeweizen was very good and close enough to remind you of Germany if you've been. They have have local bands playing nightly so there's also entertainment. The locals know and if you ever take a trip to the area now you do too."

                "description": "Great pizza and bar! Lots of outside seating and lots of options on tap for beers and ciders. I really enjoy their pepperoni rolls.   First time coming here - you order at the bar, they give you a number, and then you take it to whatever table is available and that you choose. Look at the food menu before you come because the food menu is only visible at the counter/bar that you order from. The only bummer to the whole experience was that the number they gave us was not the number they gave the kitchen so the food got lost for a little bit because they were looking for a different number. We got it figured out and it was still delicious!"

                "description": "Service was awesome. Beers were delicious. We ordered Hawaiian pizza rolls and a carnivore calzone. They split the calzone so it was two separate smaller calzones instead which was awesome. The only thing we recommend is the calzone and pizza rolls might have been slightly over cooked as the top of the crusts were very dark and tough. Probably because they cooked it in the same oven and temperature as the pizzas which makes sense. But this wasn't an issue and the food was still great. Loved our experience"

The pizza is actually quite good (and I'm a midwestern pizza snob) and the service honestly really makes it. Their servers are so friendly and all throughout the COVID restrictions, they followed the protocols and managed to still make it a fun place to go to. We even hit up a couple of Trivia nights with friends on accident and scored some gift cards and had a blast. My only reason for taking a star off were the wings. We tried them a couple of times but the thick, rubbery fat and lack of crispiness were big turnoffs - seemed like they weren't fried but maybe baked? In any case not good. We've got plenty of other deliciousness there, though, so we just order everything else!"

This last time, the beertender sat taking our order (yes, he was sitting behind the bar) and had no suggestions or enthusiasm.  There is no way to order without going inside the bar. During covid, there should be options for this!  The pizza is okay. If you are looking for pepperoni rolls, Pinthouse are much better in my opinion.  We may return for specific beers, but it won't be on our regular rotation with other options in the area."

This is my favorite place to come with my fiancé. We bring all of our friends here. Holly is a delightful bartender who has gone above and beyond for us.   Wonderful selections of beer, cider, wine, kombucha, etc..  For food, go with any flavor the wings (lemon pepper and garlic parm are my favorite). The pizza rolls are divine and freshly made. You also can't go wrong with the pizza.   They also have live music and outside seating. Perfect place for date night or to chill with friends. I HIGHLY recommend it."

                "description": "My review is mostly based on service.  I came here with the husband on a Monday night because I wanted a post-dinner beer. I marked this place in my bookmarks as a place I wanted to try based off the reviews. I generally try to be open-minded about my experiences at new places, but honestly I was just rubbed the wrong way here. We walked inside around 7 pm and I only noticed the list of cocktails on the wall behind the bar. I looked at the tap handles to see if I could tell what they had and the bartender finally came over. I figured I'd ask for something easy and see if they had Dos Equis on draft and was told they didn't with a snarky attitude that I guess he thought was witty or funny. I asked where the list of beers was and he stared at me and just pointed up...ok where am I supposed to be looking? OH. Apparently I'm supposed to know there are individual beer names hanging not only above the bar seats, but also sticking out slightly over the seating where you have to get up to see them. I tell him I haven't been there before and wouldn't know those were there. I order the beer he suggested (Alstadt Kölsch) based off of me asking for Dos Equis. He asks if I want to open a tab and I say no. His response: \"Only one beer?\" with what may as well have been an eye roll. You would think with me telling someone that I'm a new patron the attitude would be better. He probably doesn't care since A) it probably isn't his business, B) I'm sure they have regulars and C) he was probably in a hurry to come outside to vape with his friends on the patio that says \"No Smoking\".  Side note: if you want to sit outside be prepared to listen to cornhole games underneath the same covering as the seating which causes it to echo so loud you can't hear your own conversation."

We decided to visit as they were not busy and were following the separation guidelines. The service is always friendly and it was even better on this visit. Our guest puppy was treated to snacks and fresh water. We sat on the covered patio and watched rerun sporting events and just enjoyed being outside.   I've been an LB patron since day 1 and I remember when it was difficult to find a local venue that offered a large variety of craft beer options.  LB has changed a lot of the years as they now serve cocktails and their patio has been expanded. Venues come and go (see Sheas and AJs across the street) but LB has a loyal following and has remained our go-to venue to have a brew or two and some pub grub.   It's a misnomer to call their food pub grub as you can order a pretty darn good pizza, meatball casserole, fried calamari, artichoke dip, or our favorite their homemade fried pickles. Yes, they pickle on site!   Nice folks, great beer, good cocktails (check out their specials), and food."

We ordered pizza also. One side was barely done while the other side was burnt. They put a lot of Italian season on top the pizza after it was cooked. Some times you just get a bite full of seasoning, not good.  First bits we thought the pizza had a good flavor but the more you ate the pizza the less tasty it was."

Pub grub for the most part with $10 pizzas unlimited toppings. So- naturally this is what i ordered each time. Each time it comes out it looks amazing and I'm excited. Like a Pointer Sister ( I 'm so excited ) . But the pizza never tastes cooked. The dough is mushy. Not a big deal. NExt time around I tell them to leave it in a bit longer for me. Comes out -- same. Not a deal breaker. Just need to change what I am eating. My belly prob says same thing. Next lets move onto the staff. For the most part the lady running the joint is on point. Friendly- helpful and witty. The remainder of the staff is quite the opposite. I have noticed this during a lunch visit with us being one of 2 people in the place, and in the evenings like during the sports games and crowds. Just abrasive . Again- I'm not there to make friends. I'm there to have a cold beer ( maybe 3) watch baseball or the slew of people who still have to think if they need to be wearing a mask when they enter an establishment( smh). So - The beer. They have a pretty typical tap list with 1-2 silver and gold medal choices. I saw Aldelberts there last night.. sweet!. But behind the bar is a ghostbuster lunchbox treasure chest of cans and bottles. WARNING! don't try to figure out what's in there. Hard to see them all... and after learning  how friendly the bar staff(see above ) is - I gave up asking and went with an IPA. The crowds are not bad and for the most part follow distancing rules.. but - nothing enforced. This scares me. While I know its MY choice to patron , I would still like to see ppl adhere to the 6ft. Outside- good seating - tv;s good parking and over all fantastic. I will prob go back, just not order the pizza and maybe try and get a spy camera behind the bar to see the other options as -- that's what life is all about. Options. Thanks for eating with me today, and I'll see you next time.  -M"

                "description": "A visit to Justine's is a night well spent. The atmosphere, music and bites are top notch.  There are three sections of the restaurant - a front room with funky lights and a bar, a back room with a bistro feel and an outdoor space with tents and chandeliers. Each area has a distinctive vibe, I personally enjoy the lively bistro space.  My favorite items include the onion soup, mussels, fish and the French 75. There is always something too intriguing to pass up on the specials list.  If able, make a reservation well in advance on OpenTable otherwise there will be a wait, the line starts before they open at 6pm! Free parking is available in the lot diagonally across the street."

                "description": "Underwhelmed. Started off with a nice Bordeaux and ordered escargot and fromages. I've had better escargot at Perry's and June's. The highlight of the fromages wasn't even the cheese, it was the fig jam. Nothing outside the ordinary quality wise with the cheese.  Entree was slammin though. Had the Confit Canard. Skin was perfectly crispy, duck fat smothered all the meat that tenderly fell off the bone. Loved it!  Dessert, was lacking. The créme brûlée was blow torched too much in the middle on first round, and instead of thin candied shell, it was hard carbon tasting. No big deal, We kindly asked for another. The next one came out a viscous sticky goop. I was really let down as creme brulee is my absolute favorite dessert, and being that we were eating at a French restaurant I had high exceptions. I've had better créme brulee at steakhouses. They did comp it though, and the server was very understanding of our expectations. So I really can't complain too much.  We decided to have a nightcap, and that was the saving grace. I had the best damn martini of my life. First time having Monkey 47 Gin. Was amazing! My wife had an espresso martini that was amazing too. The espresso was strong and it had finely ground espresso on top as a garnish. Drinks were so good we finished them and decided to have another round!  I'm pretty forgiving with reviews so Justine's get 4 stars, but before going in, I was expecting to end up writing a 5 star review.   Bonus points for the silverware though. VERY nice Laguiole silverware!"

                "description": "Not for me.   I appreciate that you can reserve outdoor tents for your party of 4-6 that have three sides fabric, one open to the common area. It looked like there was also a fan built in for the warmer months. I also appreciate that our reservation (which started at 6:15) let us stay at the table till 9:00 when the next reservation showed up. I feel like this is likely rare and due to the fact that we were a larger party drinking and eating a lot.   I didn't love the service - drinks took 30+ minutes to make it out to the table, yet over-attentive clearing staff kept trying to take the items that did arrive away long before they were finished. We also had to triple check on some dietary restrictions. From an accessibility standpoint the website and menu were nearly impossible to read.  If you don't have a reservation (or once it's over) you're welcome to hang out in the cabana area at the back, but it's 100% smoking, which was not great for some in our party.   It's worth noting 20% gratuity will be added to any party over six. With the prices as high as they are ($15 for a cup of soup), expect to drop $50+ easily eating here. Given the price vs quality of food, service, and prevalence of smoking I definitely won't be back. It was loved by many in my group, however, so I can understand why it has a strong following. Just not for me.  Also, if you're surprised that this place has over 1,100 reviews on Yelp yet remains unclaimed, here's a segment from their website that they wrote in response to a complaint: \"We're not corporate, and don't need to sanitize and compromise our ideas to please the masses... We're not the Olive Garden. Our outlook is that by trying to please everyone, you end up truly exciting no one. We may alienate some people, but we make other people happy, and in the meantime, we honor our own principles and imagination.\" Sounds great in theory, but does mean you get the \"go F yourself\" feeling from some of the staff. If you love that, you'll probably love Justine's."

                "description": "If you like French food this is the spot for you. I realized I don't. The charcuterie board pictured was so gross in my opinion... I now know I do not like my meat as a mousse. Because of the cold weather they have tents set up for private seating, it was a little too private and quiet. I feel like part of the draw to the restaurant is the atmosphere and energy and you don't get that seated away from everything. We also had our reservation on a Friday night at 7pm and the service was not great, we were seated for probably 15 to 20 minutes before someone came over to take our drink order. I think they forgot about us because of our very private tent."

                "description": "Had a good experience at Justine's. We walked in on a rainy evening and was quoted an hour wait. No problem, we grabbed drinks at the bar but waited maybe 10 minutes and were offered a table! We were seated at a cabana like tent outside. There was even a little chandelier, super super cute. Service was fine.   The food was good and they had all of the obvious French dishes one would expect. The escargot was quite delish, especially the buttery garlic sauce. The complimentary bread was disappointing. I think it was stale, tough crust, chewy. I would have recommended dipping the bread in the escargot sauce otherwise. The beef tartare was great, looked and tasted fresh. Thought it was a little weird fries were sides for most dishes.   Parking was a little bit of a pain. There is a parking lot but it was full and muddy and I was in heels so I had to be dropped off outside the restaurant. There is street parking but seems that area gets busy."

                "description": "Came to Justine's for a celebratory graduation dinner and had a great time! We made reservations for an outdoor table for 7, and it was the cutest little set up. It was a bit humid the evening we went, but they had fans blowing in our little tent-thing that helped. The decor (and all the PLANTS!) was gorgeous - I can see it being an amazing place for happy hour with the girls or a cute date night!   The food slapped. Notable dishes are the escargot - trust me and dip the complimentary bread in the leftover garlic butter. Just do it. We also loved the mussels, steak frites, and bolognese (AMAZING meat sauce). For drinks, their Paloma was very good.  My only critiques are 1) my ankles got eaten alive by mosquitos during dinner, which I can't blame on Justine. Just be aware if you're a mosquito magnet like me! 2) the service was kinda spotty and our server had an attitude when we asked for more bread (I feel like that's a pretty fair ask? We only asked for more bread one time."

                "description": "Had a good time at Justine's. Alternative, vibey atmosphere and staff made for a fun and festive environment.   Scallop crudo was excellent! Well seasoned and with tasty caper, minced onion, high quality olive oil and a vinegary flavor I could not place.   Escargot was excellent buttery/garlicky as expected.    Butter spread missed the mark. Was supposed to have sea urchin but that flavor and color was undetectable. Trout roe was nice but an ocerall mediocre dish for $15.  Steak tartare with ratatouille was good but not in the top that i have had. The chop was a little large and found some hard fat chunks that weren't edible. Ratatouille was nice but the vegetable colors were washed out brown more than vibrant.  Steak frites was an issue starting out because the online menu lists it as $40 yet on the handout menu it is $48. Online menu should be updated and current! Steak was cooked properly and tasty but somewhat chewy. Fries were heavy pepper flavor, not enough salt for my taste and was hoping they'd be cooked well and extra crispy but were not."

                "description": "I've been wanting to try Justine's  for years. I've stopped by a few times around dinner-time only for there to be an hour-long wait and on top of that, they don't take rezzies for two :(   Last night, we decided to stop by on a whim. We came a little bit later than usual around 9pm.   I thought the ambiance and the service was the most amazing thing. Justine's is an Austin gem!   We came in, put our name on the list and grabbed wine from the bar. We sipped under the green pagoda and then was seated where we promptly got started with apps (escargot and French onion soup). The Escargot was buttery, garlicky and French onion soup was absolutely spectacular! Please, everyone, try their French onion soup!   I had the Marmont rose which I was obsessed with (it has almond notes).   Through the entire visit - I never felt rushed. I'm usually mindful that restaurants want to turn over tables so I was quite shocked and pleasantly surprised when our server took our apps order, let us finish, and then took our entree orders. It was a slow and mindful pace and in a society that's \"go-go-go, \" this was refreshing.   For our entree, we ended up getting the steak frites, moules frites, and bologonese. The moules frites was my favorite entree.   If we were sitting and talking, our server would just pass by and let us relax. I appreciated the small niceties here.   I AM ABSOLUTELY OBSESSED WITH JUSTINE'S!"

It has one of the best escargot in town, in my opinion. Our waitress was lovely and very knowledgeable. Unfortunately, we were seated inside and the music and noise level kept increasing over the evening.  They do have free parking at a fairly large lot across the street.  It was pretty expensive so this is definitely not an every-week-type-of-place but would generally go back for other special occasions."

                "description": "Enjoyed my experience here but didn't find it to be exemplary. Parking is super confusing if it's your first time but their lot is right next to the Central Machine Works parking lot directly across the street from Justine's.   I ordered the French 75 to drink and the octopus and escargot as appetizers. The cocktail was good but nothing special; very sweet and I was expecting bubbles considering the champagne but my drink was served in a martini glass rather than a champagne flute and not fizzy at all. The octopus was good but again, not spectacular. I wouldn't order it again. The escargot unfortunately smelled better than it tasted. They were good but what made them better was dipping the complimentary bread in the butter they sat in.   For dinner, I ordered the poisson béarnaise. The market fish was cod and the market price was $32. I thought this dish was pretty spectacular. Served with a delightful béarnaise sauce that was creamy, frothy, rich, and a little bit sweet, I couldn't get enough. I was straight up dunking everything on my plate (veggies, fish, everythingg) in the sauce. I even dipped some bread in it and it made anything chefs kiss amazing. The waitress even said the herbs in the sauce came straight from their garden! I thought the veggies that accompanied the fish were great and the cod was good as well. However, I found myself wishing it were a more sophisticated fish on the plate for the price point.  Overall, had a good time. I would consider visiting again but foregoing the apps/cocktails and heading straight for the entree."

                "description": "Surprised it took me so long to go to Justine's, I know that it's a favorite restaurant of two of my close friends who swear by it.  I went on a Thursday night and was promptly seated at one of the outdoor cabanas. It was quite nice, except there are always bugs flying around outdoors, perhaps netting would be a smart idea. I also added more privacy by closing more of the cabana curtains facing other guests.  Started off the night with with the house red wine to put myself in a pleasant mood. Very good for a house wine.  To start, had the saumon cru appetizer. Can't go wrong with this, delicious and recommended.  I personally ordered the Steak Frites and was unfortunately disappointed. The frites were over fried to the point it was too crunchy. I ordered medium rare for the steak but it cooked a bit longer than needed and I found it rough and tough.  What saved the night was the Moules Frites. The frites were still over fried but the mussels were absolutely delectable. The flavor of the broth is rich and goes well with the taste of the sea from the mussels. This will definitely be ordered again if I were to come back."

We had quite a number of celebrations in June and July , which were incredible... we recently went back with a few friends this past week... I guess we have never gone during the week because we didn't recognize the hostess... her attitude almost ruined it, she snapped at my friend and said she was organizing the seating and made us feel like we were an inconvenience ... she seemed overwhelmed by the heat, grumpy... lucky the other younger hostess changed the energy , talked about her favorite mezcal cocktails and walked us to our table."

                "description": "We were excited to come to this spot after seeing it on a list of places to visit while in Austin and they just so happened to have reservations available tonight. We were seated promptly and ordered a bottle of wine recommended by our server which was great. We ordered quite a lot of dishes -- the escargots, grilled octopus, French onion soups, duck confit, steak tartare, and mussels. The food was very good and I especially enjoyed the escargots. However, the service was extremely slow and the food took a LONG time to arrive. After we had been served out appetizers and French onion soup, we waited almost 45 minutes for the entrees that didn't end up coming out, so we flagged down our server to ask if we could cancel as we were full and tired (it was almost 10pm and my friend was falling asleep at the table). Luckily, the manager came out and offered to box the food for us as well as gave us a discount on our bill. This is a cute little restaurant and the food was pretty good so I would definitely be inclined to give it a second chance the next time I'm back in Austin but I would probably have our server put in the whole order at the same time instead of waiting for intervals as we finished eating each course pretty fast and had to wait and wait for the next dishes to come out."

There is a second bar up the stairs straight ahead from the entrance.  I also appreciate the emo and rock music they play.  Brings me back to the mid 2000's when wearing side bangs and a bow in my hair was a thing."

                "description": "The Jackalope in downtown Austin. It was a blast great drinks and it attracted great people. The food was even good, including the drinks. I would go back for sure, pretty cool atmosphere as well.  When I went I had done research and everything. There are other places to go to but, this was the best for a Sunday. I arrived just a bit before happy hour and enjoyed myself.  I had the Jackalope burger and it was plenary to eat. With the toppings I didn't even need anything else. I usually get honey mustard and mayo, I didn't need it but, I did put mayo on it. There were plenty of pickles and the burger meat was tasty.   I had a frozen margarita, the frozen was out after that and I switched to a hibiscus margarita. I know your thinking hibiscus flower, yea it was even pretty like the flower. I also had the huge Heldarado as well. Man let me tell you now have a few people would help you finish but it was good.   It was just great company we had fun there I met a couple cool people there and it was rememberable. It's kind of what we are looking for when we go out to eat or something. The server was good even when they switched out for shifts, the only thing I will get you don't want us they could use a few more extra service. Great experience I definitely go back."

The giant jackalope inside is very insta-friendly, they tell you to feel free to hop on and take a pic.   Our bartender was really friendly and funny, and served us right away. He gave us a few suggestions, and we ordered drinks and a round of shots. They were all good and mid-priced. The only downfall was they didn't shake the pineapple chaser, so it was lukewarm.   Overall, a solid and memorable bar experience!"

                "description": "Food was good when it came out correctly but had to send back what was put in the computer versus what I asked for.    Tonight October 30, 2021. I put a food order in for honey jalapeño wings, an order of waffle fries and a dos xx draft. Total came to 22 and was given order number 80 around 8:00 Pm. Order came out as a burger and side of fries which after checking your menu, should've only been 14$ plus what ever the beer was which I'm sure isn't 8$ for a draft beer in a plastic cup.   I informed the food runner it should've been wings and he showed me where the food was rung in as a burger instead, no harm no foul a simple misunderstanding or so I thought. The bartender who rang it in informed me I ordered a burger when I \"shouted\" my order at him and said I like that with fries. By my calculations, if I did intact order the burger with a side of fries it should've been 11.5 for burger plus 2.5 for fries. Not almost 16 I'm assuming plus 6$ for a dosxx.   I get it it's Halloween weekend. But if you can't fully hear the order then just make sure with customer before finalizing and putting order in and over charge them if in fact you thought I ordered a burger. But also don't give attitude when customer asks for the wings and believes the wings only come with 8 like you PDF menu states. Not from Austin but will not be back anytime soon. Unfortunately I paid in cash or I would ask for a refund for the difference because I'm entitled to that I believe. I understand customer isn't always right. But food costs can't be that high that you need to argue about the wrong button being pressed on your end.   And yes this is the exact same review I sent to the contact us for on the website, I'm sure nothing will change with how orders are put in on busy nights, but just make sure you get your itemized at this establishment so that you know before you walk away from bar."

The staff wasn't very friendly at all and of course didn't have good customer service quality's.  The lighting inside was very dim and dark - more like a bar setting but the variety of appetizers was great. The D.J. was playing some good tunes and when our food came out - They had the best wings and Cheese Waffle fries. We had a couple of drinks and ordered a couple more appetizers but then we saw the WORST - A RAT ran above us on the beams and then my husband and cousin saw another RAT in front of him running along the opposite end!!!  And we all know if there is 1/2 rats their are more to follow. Obviously this is an issue that they are aware of. Needless to say we grabbed our stuff and left! I felt so disgusted and nauseous!!!  Coming out the restaurant we met a couple (locals) outside and they told us they have heard as well about infestation of rats. So if your looking for a good restaurant- Don't come here!!!"

                "description": "IF I COULD GIVE THIS PLACE ZERO STARS - I WOULD.   DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU ARE TRYING TO HAVE A GOOD TIME.   We came here during a BACHELORETTE.  I understand circumstances are weird due to COVID-19.  I get that. We ALL get that. We are in Austin visiting for our best friends bachelorette and on our second night here we decided to take the advice from our waiter at Caroline's and go to The Jackalope.  We went there at 9pm just to check it out and our bartender, Bart, gave us complimentary drinks. We were so thankful, we paid for the giant mixed drink and went next door for a few hours and then went back to The Jackalope because the bride requested it. We sat down for 20 minutes even ordered some drinks (which they never brought) and they were playing the jams -- so naturally we started dancing around our table.   Even the other bartender, Dimitrius, was hitting on one of our bridesmaids HEAVILY and hanging around with us while we were dancing - not even one whole song went by before Dimitrius told us we couldn't be dancing and that we needed to be in our seats. We said okay, that sucks but sure. So we sat down and made sure our butts where planted -- next thing you know some random came up to us and started twerking at our table then on jumped on the couch and started twerking and spreading her legs in the air. Again - SHE WAS NOT WITH US. None of us even knew who she was. Immediately, some angry bartender (that clearly needs to get laid) with a ponytail ran over to us being loud and demanding that WE get out meanwhile Twerker conveniently slinks on back to her table    I can understand if we were the ones doing THAT and you wanted to kick us out - FINE.  But that was not the case. No one wanted to even hear us out, one of our bridesmaids does not drink and she was very civil in trying to explain to Ponytail Bartender but he literally was non-stop raising his voice to us. He even yells at Bart to come over - and this fool just straight up decides to \"go with his boys on this one\" and preceded to gesture us to get out  Ponytail could not WAIT to kick us out, let me tell you. Like there's some underlying issues there  He yelled at us saying \"You're not even ordering drinks! You're not even ordering food!!!\" NOPE. Wrong again, Ponytail.   We DID order food and drinks but your stubborn hating ass didn't accommodate us  Meanwhile Twerker (aka THE PROBLEM) is still running rampant inside the bar   Also, the pink haired lady was GOD AWFUL. Not helpful whatsoever.  Bart you were the biggest disappointment, and Ponytail -- you just suck. Thank you for ending our night horribly and giving us a HORRIBLE first trip experience.   I do not recommend this place whatsoever for anyone who is looking to actually have a good time."

I just love everything about this place. It's on Sixth and sure it gets the tourists in but it's definitely a hang out for regulars. Because we have family in Austin, we're here often. If it were in Pittsburgh it would definitely be one of my locals.  The beer selection is fabulous and so are the prices. The crowd is cool and fun.  The Mac and Cheese Burger is so freaking good and yummy and big! Definitely shared it with the boyfriend.  My favorite cocktail is The Jezebel. It's tasty and refreshing.   Dive bar personified!"

                "description": "(from June 2021)  One dope ass bar!  The bartenders, ambiance, drink selection, and people make this place a blast.  They have multitude of whiskeys and beers to pick from.  Plus the outdoor seating and dog friendly atmosphere make this a chill spot for mingling with friends or soaking in the awesomeness of the state capital of Texas.  They also sell awesome shirts.  Sadly the Excite Bike shirt I saw the bartender rocking wasn't available so I settled for the blue shirt.  Please get more of those in!  The Wheel, keep on spinning!"

                "description": "Finally got to try The Wheel after a long wait. Moved to the neighborhood almost a year ago and when I tried to come here, they hadn't reopened. Came today to have a celebratory vaccine cocktail. It looks like they used to have a $4 whisky of the day... well, it's now $5 but the winning bet is to make it as a cocktail for $8. An $8 old fashioned? Can't say I'm mad about that. Jenny behind the bar was super friendly and I gotta say it's nice to sit at an actual bar again."

We have spent a month fighting it with the credit card company. It's disappointing because the staff there was great. And the drinks were fantastic, but this kind of behavior is pathetic and makes us question returning."

                "description": "I really want to like this bar. It's cute, has a nice variety of seating... inside and outside and kinda-dense-in-a-good-way. The bartenders are cool folks with lots of great knowledge. The music isn't too loud - a good volume for talking but still bumping :-)  Unfortunately though... its quite expensive, and the staff isn't super transparent about the pricing. For instance, the whiskey of the day is supposed to be $5. I got it with ice, and was charged an extra dollar. This might be trivial, but it sucks getting charged without warning, especially for something that shouldn't get an upcharge (even if the on-the-rocks pour is slightly more liquid)... kinda like getting charged for napkins. And in general, everything's pretty pricey for a neighborhood bar.  I guess I'm a little too old school for all the new hotness in Austin. But I don't see any reason to visit The Wheel when you have so many other places that are both inexpensive and cool."

                "description": "Parking can be troublessome, and space is limited, but easy to have a good time here.  More of a hangout spot than a sports bar.  No TV, limited beer selection that runs out quickly (both IPA kegs tapped out on a random Tuesday night), and no food.  You come here to let the night get away from you and order some strong cocktails.  Lots of outdoor space is cool and bring your own food is actually a plus in my book.  Beer selection 8 on draft, but good prices at $7/ish per big pour.  Everyone is nice and vibe seems 20s-30s clientele. I liked the Wheel for what it is, a good starting point nearby my apartment to begin a drinking night."

The bartenders are extremely friendly and seemed genuinely interested in conversation beyond just your tip.   They definitely specialize in cocktails so I would probably look elsewhere if you are looking for a nice draft or bottle of Shiner. I had 2 different specialty cocktails, both of which were good but definitely on the pricier side ($10-$15 each).   They have a large patio space for meeting up with friends and the indoor bar is intimate enough to make it a decent  first date spot worth checking out."

Ok, so this place is just super adorbs in a very approachable, contempo-rustic, \"shhhh, don't tell anyone or else the ubiquitous \"they\" will ruin it for the rest of us\" kinda way.   The barkeeps know their stuffs, their cocktails are legend (wait for it) dary without the arrogance or pretension you might expect from a place of this caliber; I think the lack of self-importance this place and the staff exude is one of my favorite things about it!  If you are looking for a low-key place to drink handcrafted, amazing cocktails (the Madison, I'm just saying) in front of a draught-tap water fountain amidst a menagerie of interesting EastSide Austin folk, then come here and enjoy (you can even have ADP delivered!). Just please remember...mum's the word, the password changes daily, and if fratty bros or hipsters catch wind of this place...I will look for you, I will find you, and I will give you the spiciest side-eye of your life!"

This place is definitely cool for sure! I love the cocktails and all the ladies names, very cute!  My friend introduced me to this new spot.  It is located off Martin Luther King right next to the Austin daily Press.  The inside bar are is small and quaint.  I love the side patio and this is where I spent a beautiful evening sipping on some cocktails and enjoying a sandwich which was delivered from next door.  I had the Molly and the Layla cocktails and both were excellent, refreshing and went down nice and smooth.  The patio has a gorgeous fountain with tons of beer taps spouting out water ... it was cool and creative feature to the atmosphere.    The bartenders here are super nice and professional!  If you are in the area I would absolutely recommend stopping in here for a Molly or Madison in your life!"

I truly enjoyed every minute of the experience, and my tasty Old Fashioned which was a perfect choice to compliment the atmosphere. The bar tenders are super friendly and the place is eclectic, dark and decorated in a vintage style. They also have the best t-shirts I have ever seen at a bar. I was bummed that the Excite Bike 80s Nintendo themed shirt was sold out in my size because I'd be rocking that all the time. Good vibes, great ambience and a great spot to hang after a long day."

                "description": "The Wheel was really well decorated, which set the evening off to a good start. The indoor area is intimate, dimly lit, and has a sort of prohibition-era bar feel with its tin ceiling, newspaper clipping wallpaper, and red lighting. Outside, you'll find a large patio with lots tables, and a great fountain made from beer taps. The drinks... well, my beer was way too expensive for what it was (a fairly generic IPA), and their selection for beers was limited (on draft: 8 taps, 1 IPA). HOWEVER, I know that's mainly due to the fact that The Wheel's specialty is whiskey. If whiskey's your drink of choice, I'm sure you'll love it here. They have $4 daily specials, and a number of specialty cocktails.  I'm glad I gave it a shot, and I'll definitely recommend it to my whiskey drinking friends, but if you're looking for anything besides whiskey (or maybe a nice cocktail) I'd steer you elsewhere."

Actually go next-door and then to their backyard and then go up and you are at the spot. It's very small it's almost gives you a speakeasy feel. The bartenders were super cool and we really enjoyed our time there. It was a group of seven of us and we took up most of the bar. Drinks are very good as well. If you're not a tequila fan this is not for you but you should still try to experience it at least once. They have frozen on the rocks and other delicious cocktails."

I have been driving by Techo everyday for years, and we frequent the area for the other restaurants and bars, but for some dumb reason beyond comprehension, we never gave them a try. We are completely hooked now! The space is cozy, intimate, and inviting. The drinks are just out of this world, and SO strong! The flavors are unique, and even if you aren't a mezcal fan, some of the drinks completely cover up what's even in it! They had a cool nook tucked away next to the bar that we are hoping to sit in once things open back some more, and we would love to hang out inside and enjoy their cool vibe inside! The patio is tucked away upstairs, and even though it's in a busy area right along the street, you don't even notice! They have TONS of misting fans outside that made the 102 degree heat totally tolerable for once!   They had dog bowls out, so I would venture to say they are dog friendly, which we plan to take advantage of very soon!"

This is the first bar I bring visitors too - usually right when they open, so we can snag seats at the bar and get guided Mezcal tastings from Techo's very knowledgeable and easygoing staff. I never leave without ordering at least one of their Frozen Guava Agave Margaritas with the chili salt rim (do NOT pass on the home-made chili salt, it is the perfect pair for this sweet/tart drink).  Every one of my girlfriends love that drink! My boyfriend also loves that he can get a strong mezcal centered cocktail from their list (which has 10-12 house cocktails that are great). Their Micheladas are also a crowd fave.   When you start to get hungry - walk to Salty Sow for happy hour apps or down to Patrizi's to share some crazy good home-made Italian food from a food truck! You'll have a line at Patrizi's - but it's a great option for your visiting friends, who have probably never had an Italian food truck experience."

We sat in this little nook that had seating for four, it felt very private from the rest of the bar, we enjoyed it! I had their mezcal margarita and the flavor was so good, I will definitely be back!"

Tried my first mezcal margarita there and have a new favorite cocktail (normally prefer an old fashioned).   Fried crickets are a nice add on as well.   Will definitely go back. A date might be more impressed by this than another random brewery!"

                "description": "Techo Mezcaleria reminds me of why I still love Austin: the unusual, hidden gems that are tucked away all around the city.  Most other folks already hit the highlights. It's tiny, seats maybe 10, and you enter through the Schoolhouse Pub gate, despite Techo actually being on the second story of Mi Madres. Word of caution: Mezcal ranges from \"lightly smoky\" to \"I'm drinking liquid smoke.\" Personally it's not something I can have a lot of, we had three sample sized shots and that was plenty between the two of us. Just be forewarned.   Our bartender Ian was awesome, we had a nice, rambling forty minute conversation about mezcal versus tequila versus whisky. Unfortunately, we went on a Saturday when there wasn't a happy hour, so we didn't get a chance to sample the margaritas, but that gives us a great excuse to go back."

I feel everyone gave him the \"just a dumb drunk pass\" but the more I think about it the more I think if he was drunk like that maybe he shouldn't have been served anymore or asked to leave. Also this was around 6-8pm not your average time for people to be so belligerent. Drink pictured is the violeta."

They have a good sized drink menu and also offer frozen drinks, which is always a fun addition.   They have a fantastic selection of Mezcal and Tequila and it's a fantastic spot for a date because they have a few nooks inside great for a few to sit. The ambience is also very romantic-very dim inside with lots and lots of candles everywhere. The place itself is upstairs of SchoolHouse (there are stairs outside to the right of the restaurant). It is pretty small, only seating maybe 20 inside and about the same outside.   However, worst case scenario if you arrive and they're packed you can head downstairs to SchoolHouse for a drink!  This is a must visit and will impress others when you introduce them to a what-feels-like hidden gem."

Luckily, it also happens to be right next to this absolute gem of a winery! #winning   Travis, our wine journey guide, was the sweetest, most knowledgeable, and most approachable human being on earth, and we thoroughly enjoyed our Saturday afternoon stop! The bright and airy space, the pitch perfect music, the yummy wine (we had both the Work Horse Red Blend and the Violet Crown Tempranillo. Deliciously dry reds!), and Travis all collaborated to make this a most excellent pit stop!   Thanks, Austin Winery! Thanks, Travis!"

The atmosphere is lively with board games and great decor inside, and a food truck and lots of picnic tables outside for large groups.   However, my group ordered 2 different red wines and 1 sparkling white wine and felt that the wines were lacking in flavor and very watery. Maybe this is how Austin wine is, but if you're looking for deeper, richer flavored wine, I would go somewhere else."

I was not going to get any snacks, but their cheese and charcuterie board was calling my name.  We both got the tasting. Each of us got different wines. Our favs were the Tempranillo, Grenache and spaghetti western. You can get all your wines at once or one at a time. I suggest getting them all at once because staff can get busy.  The cheese and charcuterie board paired well with our wines and it was definitely the perfect snack. Loved the cheese selection. The bread sprinkled with olive oil made my day cause who doesn't love bread They have inside and outside seating available. Parking is onsite, but shared with other businesses."

The first time we came here, they had a private event going on so that was sad. The second time, we got here a few hours early so they hadn't opened - that's our fault. Finally, our third attempt was fruitful!  The service here is super chill and on top of things. We 2 flights so we got to taste a good variety of samples. Great pours. We ended up leaving w one of their best bottles and now we're saving it for a special occasion.   We got (ranked from 'pour me another' to meh): *Violet Crown *Tempranillo Nuevo *Vermentino *Red-Nat *Picpoul *Piquette - this seems to be a star here but we personally hated it - tasted a bit like dilute pickle juice  A bottle we had before coming to this place was their Hill Country Rosso and that's still my favorite.  As far as COVID safety goes, the tables are super spread out, the staff wears masks at all times, and everything seems clean.   This place is super cool and what seems to be a hidden gem."

The Yard is the location and they have several business including this winery, a distillery, a brewery, and a few other places. The wine was good and the cheese and charcuterie board was a good size. I'd like to give 5 stars, but we had to ask for napkins, no plates given either. It was also a bit messy inside. Not sure if they were re-organizing or what. But friendly staff, good wine, and cute space! I recommend a stop in!"

During the 'rona, it is recommended to ensure you can get a spot.   My hubby and I did a wine flight a piece. We tried all the reds, the rose, and white wine (Vermentino). We ended up buying a bottle of Malbec to take home which we both had enjoyed. Note, the staff was very knowledgeable and helpful.   I really like the atmosphere of the winery as it is inside a warehouse where they make their own wine and buy their grapes. The winery has a few things to eat or you can buy pizza from Lil Nonna's. The pizza takes awhile but you can always purchase online and set a date. If you are done at the winery you can also bar hope in the area for beer, cocktails, and whiskey."

                "description": "Star service and a non-judgmental space. I dig you, Austin Winery!  We decided on Austin Winery after we had plans to go to Spokesman next door for some beers. Unfortunately, Spokesman had an event going on that looked a little noisy and full for our study date, hence the change in venues. The winery was very spacious and lofty--I love that in an industrial winery! We asked if we could move a table (to plug in to their only one outlet--score!) and do some computer work with their wifi. The gal at the tasting room was fantastically wonderful. She gave us a large smile and told us to do whatever we wanted. Wonderful service alone will get me to come back. That's for sure.  We each got a flight of wine to try, and got down to it until they closed. They have a good selection of whites, rose's and reds, so fret not friends. All is provided. They also have some light bites like cheeses and charcuteries, so you can definitely go with that if you're hungry. The tastings were a little pricey compared to what you might get at a wine tasting out in the vineyards (I used to work in the industry), but you're paying for the convenience of being in South Austin and lots of space to hold conversations, play board games and just be with your groups. They have loads of seating and an upstairs area (that a Bachelorette party was using). Restrooms are clean and wifi is strong. We also walked home with some Brose (a hilarious take on rose especially because it was a women-lead winery effort). Clean, classy and airy space."

Lil' Nonna's pizza truck is right outside of the door and has fantastic pizza - try the VBR!  The bummer is they only have Texas wines and I am not a fan.  I tried 5 different options and truly am not a fan.  I would love if they had other options."

I wish I lived closer to it because I'd be taking my friends and family here all the time. It's great for date nights and parties of all age groups (as long as you're fine with the occasional jokes/profanities). The musicians are so incredibly talented and can perform basically any song you give them on piano, drums, guitar...  The entire performance is so engaging and fun (the crowd picks all the songs that are played), and the service is spectacular! Make sure to bring money for the cover and for tips (the performers deserve it!)."

These two performers were so fun and I was very impressed by the wide array of songs they could play, sing, and jive to at the drop of a hat.

The cover fee was $12 (or $3 if you check in on Yelp) and when you enter, you see the two piano guys going head to head having a great time. There were a lot of other people celebrating birthdays and bachelorette parties there and the ambience was very fun and upbeat. I'll admit, some of the songs were a little to country for us, but we had a fun time sipping on our giant cocktail and watching from the floor above!"

I don't think it was too bad considering we really drank. It was hilarious! Entertaining! Joyful  Uber dropped us off in front!  Next time, I will stay to about 10-10:30pm. Then walk to Velvet Taco and have a late night bite.   6th street was a little rough. Did not feel safe. But thank Austin police dept. They were there in heavy presence. It helped.

The musicians were absolutely INCREDIBLE. We stayed for several hours and they played song after song seamlessly on piano, drums, harmonica, trumpet. We did request \"Complicated\" by Avril Lavigne, which did stump them. While one musician did some on-the-spot research, the other one played us a medley of similar songs (Skater boi, Michelle Branch) to keep us entertained. Wish we had one of these in Baltimore, can't wait to come back!"

I was greeted at the door by asking what \"color of my car is.\" Weirdly, and as a woman, I didn't want to disclose what color my car was? And was also confused by what the point of this question was. I was refused to enter the bar due to my hesitation despite not having drank the whole night. I wasn't let in even though I was over 21. It looked like a great time behind me, which is why I grant it 1 star. However, poor experience. Get it together! I have never written a Yelp review even in my poorest experiences, but this was worth it. Visiting Austin would've been 10/10 despite this experience!"

They're dog-friendly (with treats) and have both indoor/outdoor seating. They also had TV that was playing soccer, and strong wifi. I love that they have flight options 4 for $10, as well as pints. It wasn't busy when we stopped through on a Saturday afternoon. They don't have food here, but if you ask the taptender...he'll tell you what food options are nearby.  Service was kind and efficient. Their beers were across the board--good. My favorite was their Aine Hefe! It was floral and super crisp for the warm weather after a long hike. They seem to do a lot of English style ales, which aren't my favorite...but you can definitely find options that suit your taste buds. They also give free stickers upon request. BOOM!"

The staff is friendly, prices reasonable, though quite a few of their brews tend towards English styles.   On our visit, I had the Norwegian Juice, Bellibone and the Killiecrankie. Careful with that last one, it's delicious, but at 11.4% ABC, more than one can sneak up on you pretty quickly.   Acopon just had a really great vibe, and the fact that it's dog friendly is icing on the cake."

                "description": "This place has the coolest logo I have ever seen in regards to the various breweries I've been to. They have a really good beer menu and the prices are more than fair! I was actually surprised to see them so decently priced this far out in the hill country.   They do provide half pours in their standard sized glasses, just make sure to ask for a half pour when you order. I was happy to see they allow food from the outside as well which makes staying easier as you can bring your snacks in haha.  Not on overly crazy amount of seating, but definitely enough for 5-6 medium/large parties. They also seemed to follow the trend of allowing owners to bring their dogs inside which is always cool and fun to see.  They also have merchandise for sale and their shirts are super sick...did I mention their logo absolutely rocks!?"

If you are in the Dripping area and enjoy beer, this place is well worth a stop.  Cool names for their beers and explanations behind the names' meanings."

                "description": "A nice little find.  My bud who is a massive craft beer dude drove us here on the way back from a visit to William Chris Vineyards.  Located in Dripping Springs and in a small space felt right.  On the day we visited they had 4-5 beers on tap I believe.  I'm a larger guy, so a Bellibone was ordered up for me.  Suz got an English Bitter Gaspipes.  I enjoyed my larger, it was crisp and cool. This is a great nod to Emil Christian Hansen and the use of his Saccharomyces Pastorianus, which he first isolated in 1904.  A year before the greatest footy team in the world, Chelsea FC was started.  And he was also a Dane.  Suzie drank her Bitter and coo'ed.  We would of stayed longer, but staring a gigantic Manchester City flag was making me ill.  Just Kidding Dudes, I'm still ill after that 6 goal slacking you gave us this past February.  Drop in, grab a pint.  Bring the pup and stay awhile."

I walked in thinking the same but was quite surprised to be able to chill inside with my fur-bro. Made for a much better time in this \"hotter than average\" June we're having this year. I've been here a few times now, have never had a bad time here, and after my experience today I will continue to stop by when in Dripping Springs."

                "description": "The owners of the Barber shop wanted to start brewing something different.  They wanted to focus on creating English ales fresh from the cask. Their goal is to have at least one ale available from a fresh cask each week.  Are English ales their sole focus?  Definitely not! There are a variety quality brew styles.  You will find them here.  Their specialty though will be ales.  Acopon is just a stones throw down the street from the Barber shop in downtown historic Dripping Springs. On the Sunday afternoon I ventured here, this was a quiet and sleepy part of town. The tasting room and production are located in the same small historic building. The tasting room is comfortable, and inviting.  It feels lived in, like a proper English drinking hole should.  A nice change from the hipster modern sleek brewery tasting rooms popping up all over Austin.  The staff member behind the bar was knowledgeable and friendly.  They also have canned mead, cider, and wine options for non beer drinkers.  Outside food is welcomed.  They have some tables available outside to sit at, and are dog friendly.  I enjoyed one of their flights.  All of the beers in my flight were well structured.  I liked some better than others.  The Rowan was a stand out for me.  Good solid beers."

                "description": "A short review: The beer was pretty good - but served in plastic cups (unforgivable) - the service was kind of slow. Good prices.  A longer review: We were there during the Songwriters' Festival so this may explain the plastic cups, even so, if you care about your beer you can't serve it in a plastic cup. It defeats the whole purpose. But, looking beyond that, the few beers we tried were good. I particularly liked the porter.  The service was slow with three people behind the bar but it seemed that only one person was really doing the work. (There was a younger lady behind the bar but as far as I could see all she did was stand there and scowl at people.) So, a mixed experience. We'll probably try it again (I suspect the beer really is good) when there isn't a festival going on, and hopefully have a drink in a real glass."

The beer was to put it mildly scrumptious.  The Rat King Double IPA was one of the very best I have ever had the pleasure of drinking.  Beautifuly balanced, malty, and hoppy at the same time, perfect nose.  Just awesome all around.  The Hans Trapp Imperial Stout was a malt bomb of the first order.  Great Beers, Great People, Great Location.  Great Brewery.  Must Go to if you're in Central Texas ..."

Just plug the owners name, Colonel Phil Waldron, into your favorite search engine.   But if you don't have the patience, the owner, colonel Phil Waldron has concocted an amazing and intoxicating drink called the Jan 6th. The description is so funny. Tongue In cheek: Two parts my pillow guy, one part Giuliani, 1 part Trump. Colonel Phil the owner of One Shot then personally stirs it. He is such a funny guy. He really lights up this place!! He has this funny cos-play bit he will perform if you ask. With his horns and fur hat, he imitates the insurrection shaman. He does a great job. Almost like he was there. So funny!!!

It was nice to have a place to stop that had something other than beer. They had several places to hang indoors, then a big outdoor area which looked like it might have live music events. The cocktails were delicious: I had the Mogadishu Mile - like a blackberry mint mule, and the Big Red which was a vodka, grapefruit with rosemary. We ordered at the bar inside, but quite often the bartenders would come out to see if we needed anything or the owner check on us here and there. Cute spot, we'll be back!"

I can't really comment on their beer other than to say, the three I tried were not to my liking, but what I can say is that I love this place!  I've been here twice now, with friends, and with my man and both times have been great!  The place is spacious and covered in tree canopies with a sprinkle of fire pits, Adirondack chairs and picnic tables. The service is good and the mules are divine. I love that they serve cocktails as well as beer so there is something that I like and something for the beer drinkers, like my boo.   We were lucky on both occasions to have great weather and this time around, live music. I've been to several of the breweries and distilleries along Fitzhugh and so far, this is my favorite."

Otherwise I probably would not come back here, the drink I got was literally all syrup and made me extremely sick to where we had to leave... Kind of completely ruined the day. My boyfriend enjoyed the drink he ordered, which I believe was the hurricane. They have a wing food truck that you can order from, unfortunately we didn't get to try it because the drink made me so sick. We plan to go back in try the wings and will review the wing food truck. Great location for the spot, nice and relaxing... Just be careful what you order and avoid anything that has syrup in it."

They are presently distilling rum and vodka and brewing several varieties of beer.  My spouse tried a Big Red One with salt -- a vodka drink -- and a Cuba Libre.  She was pleased with both. I had their amber and liked it so much I had another.  They have a clever solution to social distancing. The two young, friendly order takers are stationed under a canopy at the edge of the parking lot by their outside seating. You place your order with them, and one goes inside to fetch your drinks. There are plenty of shade trees and picnic benches so it's a pleasant experience. The owner , Phil, came out to say hi to a fellow vet (me). Nice, congenial guy.  The Dripping Wings food truck is stationed there now, so I went back for an order for dinner. Excellent wings, particularly the Asian sweet and spicy.  Glad to have a new convenient venue to enjoy."

                "description": "Some notes for anyone trying to sit outside/be COVID-safe:   They have outdoor seating but to access it you have to go through the indoor bar first. To exit, same thing.  The staff doesn't wear masks (some do but not all) inside.  They do not allow dogs in their outdoor patio.  They have picnic tables spaced out.  You can only order food at the bar; they don't have QR codes on their outdoor tables to allow remote ordering. They do bring out your food to your table, though. If you go during winter, come prepared to bundle up because they have no space heaters in the open-air patio.   TLDR; bring your mask because you're going to have to go inside at some point. Leave Fido at home, bring a jacket."

                "description": "Used to be good, which is a shame since I used to love coming here over the past few years. It seems to have gone downhill a bit it seems. First noticed the harsh increase in wing prices (before the shortage) a couple years ago. I understand prices increase, inflation blah blah.   But they used to advertise it as wing Wednesday, and they were cheaper that day. And it was fun. Now, the overpriced wings come out with very little sauce, and the sauce tastes/looks different than what it used to?(referring to blazing sauce, my fav.) Meh, guess the crowd is changing."

                "description": "I finally got a chance to checkout Cat's infamous hideout, and it did not disappoint. It's the typical neighborhood dive bar that I expected it to be, but that's not a bad thing.  Some of the best things happen in a place like this!  TRUST me, it's nothing but fun, fun, fun, with a capital F-U-N!  It's a good place to do some day drinking, or hang out until the wee hours of the morn'.  As Tina R said in her review, lots of interesting characters lurk in this place.  Including \"that\" guy who likes to butt into your conversation, and then carry the conversation and not give anyone else a chance to talk.  But I won't dock 'em a star for that.  Every neighborhood bar has \"that\" guy in it.  It's a package deal.  Inside is kind of dark and it takes a minute for your eyeballs to adjust if you enter during the daytime. But after a few minutes, all is well and you'll soon be jamming out to the old school jukebox. You won't find any Touch Tunes here folks - yes, it still uses CDs (who would have imagined CDs would ever be considered old school?).  Here's the most important part of this review before I blather on with all of the interesting factoids:  If you learn nothing else this year, learn this my young Padawans: Many people say it's hard to find, so here's a tip - if you cross the railroad tracks on the access/frontage road, you have just passed it.  Turn right on the last street that you see right BEFORE you get to the tracks, and then take another right turn into the parking lot.  DON'T cross the railroad tracks!  There's a decent outdoor patio with plenty of picnic tables, and a few of them are shaded.  10 dollar minimum for using a credit card (pet peeve of mine).  Wi-Fi password \"cheapdr1nks\" all in lower case.  12 local and regional craft beers on tap (I counted).  They have about 30 brews in cans and bottles, most of them are from the ATX or at least regional.  The big name brews are only available in bottles and cans, not on tap.  It's a little pricey for a dive bar - pints of Thirsty Goat were 4.50  Full bar - liquor and eraythang!  Six TVs, and a large projector screen (yes I counted).  Yes, they do have food - I didn't partake, but they have tacos, a couple of salads, burgers, sammiches, and the usual bar appetizers.  Every one of the picnic tables on the patio has Cat's name carved in it (she's the current duchess but has fled the city, so it won't last long. Get out there and claim it boys and girls).  Rumor has it that this picnic table vandalism is why she had to leave the ATX, but who knows the real truth?"

                "description": "I love wing wednesday! They have great wings and all sorts of flavors. They do charge you for everything, which is quirky. It's not expensive at all, so it's really not upsetting. Just a funny thing I noticed. You're charged for condiments and celery. When you're paying 75 cents for wings and cheap drinks, it's a drop in the bucket.   The patio is great and so lively. It is fairly busy. I would even suggest getting there as early as possible because parking is limited. There is a weird gravelly lot for overflow parking, but I have a little sedan and not a 4-wheeler to get over the ditch that is there.  They do allow smoking outside, so if you're sensitive to that then the patio is not for you. At first it bothered me, but had a great time catching up with friends and eating up those wings!"

I enjoyed the look and feel of the place and the cheap booze. My only gripe is that it is on the North side of Austin for me.   I will note that my husband and I ordered the nachos here. I wasn't impressed with them but honestly you don't come here for the food. You come here for booze and maybe the people if you are feeling up to it."

                "description": "So we are in Austin for a family holiday because daughter #2 has a home 4x the size of ours (for the same amount of money!) But I digress...  Daughter #1 is here, too. She once lived in in Austin for a minute; but that was five years ago and so much has changed since then.   She asked to go somewhere quintessentially Austin. Not much of that left, especially in the northern parts, but we researched a bit and came up with The Hideout Pub.   Only juke box music during our visit, so not sure if they ever have live music, which we were hoping for. Regardless, the drinks were good and CHEAP. I mean $5.50 for a Moscow Mule cheap. And that's not even Happy Hour price.   We also had burgers. The Austin burger, ($13) with grilled onions, mushrooms and goat cheese, to which I added the sweet and delicious Moonshine BBQ sauce. Big burgers that come with fries, onion rings, tater tots, salad or chips and salsa. I got the onion rings, she ordered the tots. Both delicious. We couldn't finish our meals and brought half of it home.   Atmosphere is strictly dive bar. Love it! But not \"biker bar\" as I saw it described somewhere. Dark, low lighting, neon, plain seating, wood floors, tv screens all around. There's also an outdoor, multilevel seating area.   Our server was as sweet as pie, with a faint cute accent to boot. Mixed crowd, mostly keeping to themselves.   New neighborhood if this was my permanent neighborhood."

These burgers are better than any other burger place I've had in Austin, and that includes P Terry's, Shake Shack, In N Out, Dirty Martins (does that still exist?), and scattered places here and there.

Its divey dark spot with plenty of room to chill and hang out. The bartenders were cute, funny and poured some very nice drinks. The long island is only 6 bucks and they had a host of cheap drinks but thats what we were drinking. Now...onto the fooood.  The wings...wangs...were delicious! I got the spicy BBQ and my friend got lemon pepper both well done (I hate a soggy wing). The only downside is that for 7 bucks you only get like 5...well damn! However I saw that they have a wing special every wednesday for like 25 cents or something like that so don't quote me.  Will have to come back on a wednesday."

The food truck run by Chef Massaro is a must. My husband and I ordered buffalo chicken, Korean bbq chicken, Cilantro dumplings and waffle fries. The food was beyond what I expected from a lunch truck, it is delicious! My husband and I will definitely be going back to order from Chef Massaro and if you go on Bell Springs Winery website, you will find the food menu and send a text with your order to Chef Massaro ahead  of time."

                "description": "This winery is so beautiful, I could live there.   The views are breathtaking, and the main house is absolutely impressive, I was so impressed with the property I had to explore it further on my own.   They have been operating since 2004 and turned the former residence into a tasting, event and sales space. The sunroom and patio are perfect for enjoying a tasing or a bottle of wine among friends.   I actually sampled all of the wines on my visit to the vineyard, of course my preference is red, but I found many of the whites quite refreshing. Although the pool is no longer used for swimming, it makes an excellent backdrop, stop in and set a spell! Cheers!"

We tried two whites and a red, fairly inexpensive for a glass of wine. I think I paid $6-$8 per glass.. and they were all delicious! The only struggle is to find a place to sit during a weekend.. took a bit of patience before we got a spot. Dog friendly outside, too :)"

                "description": "I'm a huge fan of the property and how much green space they offer and the nibbles offered are quite tasty (especially the truffle fries). I'm not weeping with joy from any of the wines but they're easy enough to drink.  It's particularly lovely for violet crown sunsets, so save it for your last stop if you're making the rounds in this neck of the woods.  They don't have any ice, which I find supremely odd being that it's Texas and they serve white wine! If you want to keep your wine chilled while sitting outside (they've got plenty of gorgeous trees to provide shade but shade is not a wine bucket!) the only way to do so is to drink it real fast while thinking cold thoughts."

                "description": "This is a must-stop on your wine tour and where we began ours! The architecture alone is a photographer's paradise and the wine is wonderful.   We were a little disappointed to hear that, as of our visit in May, they weren't doing tastings due to Covid because I do think it can be done safely and would've made for a better experience. Otherwise, you either have to buy a full bottle or multiple bottles if you'd like a well-rounded understanding of their wines. We opted for a blend that we absolutely loved, described on the bottle as a \"patchwork quilt of grapes.\" It was honestly worth every penny--so delicious!   We took our bottle and glasses outside onto the expansive lawn which is just perfect for picnics. They have lots of shaded tables under the old growth trees.   Perhaps for safer tastings they could serve them \"beer flight\" style with the informational flyer and direct you to sit outdoors so that you can still experience a handful of their wines without breaking the bank? That would make it a 5-star experience for me!"

They have lovely picnic tables outside to bring your own snacks or enjoy their pizza or charcuterie boards alongside bought bottles.

I've done the tasting before and also just purchased wine by glass. Both are delightful. Tasting is nice for first timers to explore a variety of wines Duchman produces. Because of the tasting, I was able to find my favorite red and white wine of theirs. And for $10/tasting, it is such a steal!! (Price may have changed. This was based off of 2018). After my first visit, I just opt to get a bottle or glass of my favorite red and sip it on the patio taking in good wine, views, and company.   My friends and I always love to end our Hill Country winery trek at Duchman and drive over to Salt Lick after for good ol Texas BBQ."

                "description": "This was actually one of my favorite stops in our Driftwood wine tasting day. This particular winery has outdoor picnics for groups and benches for smaller groups for one to buy a bottle , bring some of your own food and enjoy their wines. During this pandemic time, this is the perfect scenario to drink wine while still practicing social distancing.   They do allow you to use the restroom with mask wearing enforced for you to go inside the building.   Their wine was light and refreshing. We chose  a white wine.   If you go near the end of the day you enjoy a nice sunset followed by lighted trees giving you a Christmas vibe. Up until that day , I never knew that Texas had a winery side like Driftwood but places like Duchman Family Winery proved to me that they do exist and they have really good wine too. Highly recommend you make a stop at this winery."

                "description": "I live in California and only an hour away from Napa. I wasn't expecting anything close to what one would experience in Napa. However, I still wasn't fully pleased.   The only way I can imagine that someone would really enjoy it, is to bring your own picnic and use their outdoor seating area. This is of course conditioned on the weather and also whether or not there is gonna be any bachelorette party there during your visit. (We saw two when we visited and they were so loud and they had overtaken all the outdoor seatings)  We tried their tasting. It was only $15 which is relatively cheap. In Napa you pay 2-3x more than that in a good winery. They let you choose your own 5 wines out of their selection or go with their recommendation. The tasting overall was okay, nothing that I disliked and at the same time nothing wowed me. I'm not sure if I'm gonna go back there, but it was worth to try it once."

Dropped into this place for a quick wine tasting, consisting of 6 small pours of wine. The whites we tasted were all very smooth, not overly sweet but just the right amount of smooth and dry. Definitely recommend sampling all the whites if you have time, you won't be disappointed!  We didn't go check out Trattoria next door for food, but have been there in the past and pretty good Italian food, pairs well with the winery.  If you come here and the weather is looking good, you can expect a very scenic, picturesque spot to spend some time at!"

If it was a free tasting I wouldn't care as much . When I made reservation I was specific about food and was not given accurate info. You are not able to order food or eat during the tasting. Food only available to purchase after tasting was over. Servers poured wine on top of previous tasting . Missed poured twice . Server changed frequently and not consistent. They obviously are not organized to keep track of what wine we should be on . Huge red wine fan( live in Europe for 6 years ) was not a fan of  any of the reds . Surprisingly liked 2 of the whites, Beautiful atmosphere and building . A shame the tasting experience doesn't match . Could be so much better!!"

                "description": "Duchman is a great winery to visit near Austin that makes great wines.  I've recently been on a kick to learn more about and try Texas wines.  I've tried wine from several different Texas wineries in the past couple months (all purchased from wine stores) and Duchman is so far my favorite.  I prefer red wines and my favorite Duchman wines are the Aglianico and Sangiovese. Since the winery is so close to Austin, my husband and I decided to visit.  The grounds are beautiful - the perfect place for a picnic.  I appreciate the precautions they've taken due to COVID-19 too.  You can't go into the building (though they will let you in if you need to use the restroom), so they are set up outside selling wine by the bottle and require everyone to wear a mask.  There is plenty of space to picnic and social distance.  They sell some picnic meals on-site, but we brought pizza from Pieous, bought a bottle of wine, and had a lovely time relaxing at a picnic table in the shade.  I highly recommend visiting Duchman.  I'm happy there is a winery that makes great wines so close to Austin.  Even if you can't do a tasting during COVID-19, it is still worth the drive to drink wine in a pretty setting!"

They do $15 for 6, which is pretty good, and was offering 5% off your total bill for following them on Instagram.   There's some beautiful benches set up outside to go with your glass of wine. It unfortunately seemed to be drought season when we visited so the actual grape plants were pretty bare. Once you step inside, there's a small room where the tastings happen and the shop where they sell bottles and all kinds of souvenirs. There unfortunately wasn't any seating indoors so we had to stand the entire time. If you walk in more, you can see barrels and label making rooms. Wish they had given us more history during our tasting but it was fun nonetheless.   It was pretty easy to get an uber out here from the city but be warned getting an uber out here may take a little while."

                "description": "Found this place walking around Austin.  Great little find.   The bar focuses on Belgian beers, and has an extensive selection.  Bartenders are friendly and knowledgeable of the menu, willing to point you the right direction.  Added bonus, all beers are served in their appropriate glass!! Inside is a little small, but they have a nice patio area in front.   A little pricy compared to other breweries we stopped at, but considering the unusual and hard to find beers they carry, it is worth the price to treat yourself to something from here."

                "description": "Quite the find in Austin for just walking by and thinking of a beer.  Great stop and a super-gal bartender who was really knowledgeable of the beers.  Great draft selection, in fact an OUTSTANDING draft selection.  They even have some bottled selection too. I really like that they don't carry the Milwaukee or St Louis brands and are all craft.  My only criticism would be that beer shouldn't be served in a small (almost) wine glass at $9/beer. That's just too rich that it limits me to one.  If it were a pint the value would be better. Four Stars instead of Five."

                "description": "Straight outta Belgium! I love it!  I popped by this place for a beer and found it interesting that I previously and unknowingly walked right past when meeting friends at the TexMex joint next door.  Service here was great during the day - when I stopped in. I presume the guy running the bar was the owner but didn't get into a convo about that. He appeared to have moved from San Francisco a few years back from what I gathered and he was very beer knowledgeable which made for my sour selection.  We spoke of some other sours in the area and such. He was a genuine guy having a genuine conversation. That small chatter right there made me feel like I could call this a regular watering hole in a town usually piled high with trendy pop-ups.  He celebrated 3 yrs just recently and I can see why he's still here. It reminds me of a small establishment I visited in Brussels last year right adjacent to Mannekin Pils (the famous peeing baby statue for those unaware). It had a sense of community and Mort Subite also has that. Maybe it's a Belgium thing but I felt like I was right back there when I sat here.  I really enjoyed myself here and although I had but one drink (i was doing my own beer exploration day), I will be back."

                "description": "Great talk bar with inviting, chill atmosphere and access to the only Belgian beer pipeline in the state, iirc. Like all bars, the bartenders set the standard and, hence, the five star review. Anthony and Piper are a great team and are professional, warm and inviting with customers. The draft beer selection is exceptional and you'd be hard pressed to find an equal rival in the city. Directly across the street from Elephant Room on Congress and 3rd, you get a great mix of residents and tourists, alike. There's outdoor seating both in the front and back (including a solid American fare trailer in the back -- good philly cheesesteak). But I digress, it's all about the ambiance, beer and good people at Mort's."

This cozy bar features about 30 Belgian beers on draft, and has many more in bottles.  Of course, every beer is served in the brewery's unique glass.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  They also have an Indian food truck behind their outdoor beer garden.  Delicious food that goes surprisingly well with the Belgian beer."

Can't believe I haven't seen this place while walking around dt.. a real hidden gem if you're looking for Belgian beers.  They have a nice selection of Belgian ales on tap, most I had never heard of which was nice to be able to try all new things. They also have some higher % beers in the frig which appear to be some of their fancier ones, eager to have a go at these next time.   Real cool spot, good for going in and trying some new Belgians to get an idea for this particular subset of beers, right in the heart of Austin."

                "description": "The only thing good about this place was the variety of Belgian Beer, which is what they're known for. They had 2 of our favorites, 1 of which is incredibly hard to find in Austin, La Trappe. I do appreciate the beers in the proper glass. The front patio gives nice European vibes. However, the service is horrible. I wish I had gotten her name, tall thin woman, medium length blonde hair. Very rude and short with our group, the birthday boy with us had questions and she wasn't happy to help. She told him to stop talking in the middle of their conversation. Then when we went to close our tab the bill was $135 for 4 beers. Four beers, by the glass. Now some of the beers are pricier than others since they're imported but we were aware of that as the prices are listed on the chalk board behind the bar. We also don't mind paying good money for quality beer. We questioned the tab and the person behind the bar investigated and said the tall thin woman, who was short with us earlier, charged us for the two large bottles of some vintage or specialty bottle, which is not what we ordered nor what she served. She eventually fixed the tab but it was a very sketchy 'mistake' and the entire experience was memorable in a terrible way. We will not be back and are disappointed since we went in very excited to try it out. I don't recommend this bar."

                "description": "I love all beers Belgian so I have been wanting to come here for a while now.  Came in on a cold Wed January evening and my friend and I, save for whom I can only assume was a regular, were the only ones in the bar.  The bartender was very friendly and appreciated that we concurred on beer suggestions for my friend.   I really loved that they serve the beers in their correct respective glassware (especially the Kwak, which is worth ordering for the glass apparatus alone!).  The prices per serving are a bit on the higher-end of the Belgian Beer spectrum from other bars I have had the same beers at, but honestly,  I liken this sitch to the line from \"The Prince and Me\"...\"you can really taste the extra 10 cents\".   For a place that's French for 'Sudden Death', it isn't nearly all that intesnse, but when I had my first pour of their Gulden Draak 9000 Quad, I did kinda feel like I'd died and gone to Belgian Beer heaven!"

                "description": "This place gets two-stars because of their selection. Being from Belgium, I enjoy looking up places in America and Mort Subite might be the only Belgian place in Austin.  To my big disappointment, besides the selection they have, there's not much attraction for a native to come here, unless you want a badly poured beer and rude service.  The first time I came to Mort Subite I can no longer remember, probably because it was underwhelming but after a lot of people told me to go there as a Belgian, I figured to give it another chance as I was pretty excited to have a La Chouffe on draft. When I noticed that the bartender was pouring this high ABV beer wrong, I asked him if I could give him some advice on how to pour it better. His answer was simply \"no\" and walked away while he handed my my check. Completely mesmerized, I still tipped him, and walked away. When I explained to my friend what happened, he said I needed to have given context.  So I went back in, ordered another La Chouffe and as soon as he placed the glass under the tap, not holding or tilting it, I apologized for earlier and asked him again if I could give some advice as a Belgian who has had many years experience working in bars. He immediately stopped the pour and  looked at me. When I explained him to hold the glass, tilt it and pour the beer on the spot where your finger is, and how that technique is very common and necessary to pour high ABV beer, he just stared me dead in the eye and continue to pour as he started, wasting a lot of beer and giving me a shitty poured beer.  I send management an email since I thought that they would love to be aware about this before I put anything online but after almost a two weeks of no response, I feel obligated to share this experience."

                "description": "Gave Mort Subite another shot as Belgian beer is the one true god of beers and can't stand not going to one of the truly Belgian bars in the country.  Again, takes a long time to get served as each pour is perfect and looks delicate.  Menu doesn't change often on draft and was 90% the same.  However, this is some of the freshest draft Belgians I've ever had, and have some rare varieties that you mainly only see in bottles.  Prices are very high and 150% of any other bar in town, but this is the quality stuff and high abv.  Now that they have a food truck out back with some good looking Indian, Mort Subite might be worth adding to my list of usuals when in that Belgian mood.  You should expect a long wait at the bar, high bill, but overall a great beer pour."

Our bartender Anthony was very friendly and did not hesitate to explain each beer. And he steered to one that we loved. They have a food truck in the back, Indian food, if you are hungry. We did not eat, but I am glad it is there if needed. I will be a regular here. I love Belgian beer, and hate having to hunt for it at local bars, restaurants, or trying to get it delivered online is hard and expensive. THIS IS THE PLACE FOR GREAT BELGIAN BEER!"

Except for a lack of delicious bar foods!   Although you can bring food into the restaurant, the selection around the area is a bit lackluster. Your only choices are a mediocre pizza place or Mexican cuisine. Brooklyn's pizza will probably be your go to dish if you do decide on italian. Their appetizers are not enjoyable for the value you'll be paying.   All in all, this place has a wide assortment of beverages and a nice place to unwind after a long day of work."

                "description": "Laid back atmosphere. Good beers/drinks. Nothing fancy, doesn't cater to one click or another. This location is new and they have it worked out fairly well. Only minor rub is that the outside patio gets direct sun, which is going to be a bit of bitch in the dead of summer, but for now it's fine. Outdoor bar, plenty of screens.  \"Jukebox\" (fancy MP3 player is nice). Allows you to bump something that is playing that isn't quite to your liking. Drink prices are fair for sure considering most watering holes are serving watered down and overpriced cough syrup.  This place is clean and seems well kept. The manager is almost constantly walking the place and fixing things. They went out of there way to find me an outlet to charge my phone.   Note: Pet friendly even having a water bowl for your four legged family as needed. Just please mind the leash, one guys dropped his momentarily to grab a beer and his dog tore through the kitchen/bar area, it was hilarious."

The management is beyond professional and they take time to hear opinions or just causally chat. The bar tenders are courteous and quick to serve. No matter what day it is, you will always feel like it's a Friday a night when you come here.   P.S.  I highly recommend you get in a game of cornhole! Lots of great players!"

The staff is also a big reason I keep coming back.  I just finished my first run through the Big 50 Club (50 different drafts) and there is more on tap than just those on that list.  Pretty cool!  They don't have food, but the pizza place next door delivers to your table--a slice, whole pie, salads, fries, chips n queso, wings, chicken fingers, subs, etc...so it's not only pizza.  Outstanding!"

To the juvenile waitress with an attitude: you're in customer service. That means you serve customers WITHOUT the massive chip on your shoulder. If you don't like your job, find something else to do, but DON'T take your mistakes out on your customers.  The waitress got our order wrong and pitched a massive attitude when we kindly asked her to fix it - it was a DIET COKE!!! Slammed the new drink on the table and didn't speak to us the rest of our stay there.  THEN denied it all when approached by my husband, who had to escalate the situation to a manager. Horrible, horrible, horrible. Grow up."

Heads up, you won't be playing on your phone past your first drink. It may as well be Cheers personified. Customers and staff alike are all so friendly and hilarious, you'll get roped into ridiculous convos and debates. It's inevitable. The staff (myself included) will adopt you as our own. 15/10 would recommend."

Bartenders aren't too worried about giving good customer service, and their drinks are pretty lame as well. Could easily get their \"cocktails\" at the Bombshells down the road, with more of a kick and better attentiveness and service. The only reason I'm not leaving 1 star instead of 2 is because they don't care if you're drunk- they'll keep serving you! Lmao and the board games are a nice touch!"

It's perfect because my wife and I will grab two beers to go, drop a tip, and walk the square/walking trail up the street to get our steps in on our Fitbit. It's always exciting because the beers change daily to weekly. We've hung out inside on occasion which is perfect for card games and relaxing. The apparel for sale is typical of a REI/Bass Pro Shop. Expensive but quality.   Bar: rotating beer, wine, white claws  Bonus: Very dog friendly! And one of the only places open late."

The sweet girl behind the counter was left to be the \"burden of bad news.\" The owner didn't even bother to come out to apologize. So because I lost the receipt (it had the tags on it) I'm stuck with a defective $40 shirt that I ended up just GIVING back to them because what am I going to do with it?!?! Needless to say, I will not be shopping here again.  Side note: This is where I get my fiancés clothes since they carry Howler (my favorite), Duck Camp, and the lovely Sendero Provisions. I've probably spent over $1,000 in clothing because of the brands they carry, not to mention I spent $300 the day I purchased the shirt. Seriously do better. If your going to carry higher end outdoor gear maybe realize that you're dealing with customers who actually appreciate that."

Luckily there are a few outdoor tables and chairs for overflow but even the sidewalks get crowded with people just standing around drinking. One evening we managed to make it in and see what all the excitement was about and it's a cute little beer and wine bar/outdoors gear store. Cute merchandise but pretty pricey. The bartender told us occasionally a food truck will park behind their store so you can enjoy yummy eats with your drinks, otherwise no food menu. I liked the atmosphere of this place... cute little date night drink spot on the square. But I am a little confused by why it's so crowded all the time. The beer and wine list is good, but not anything spectacular. I don't get it. I'm sure we'll be back at some point if we can find a place to sit."

I didn't try the beer, so I can't comment on that, but the clothing selection was good. They carry Howler Brothers apparel, which is a company out of Austin that my fisherman husband likes, and Texas Standard clothing, which is a TX-based brand with cool (not kitschy) Texas-themed clothing that gives back to Texas non-profs. They also carry another local brand - Kermode Outdoors - which is new to me, but evidently founded by Georgetown residents. The store has a great vibe and the bar is a place I could see spending a few hours on a Saturday afternoon. Stores like this are what I look for whenever I shop local - a place that sells unique, cool stuff that someone has spent time thinking about.   4 not 5 stars because I didn't try the beer.

It's also pretty close to Austin, about 30 min, and very close to downtown dripping springs. Plenty of wine options of course, and a food truck nearby with some tasty snacks/bbq! It's definitely enough to be a dinner if you want that, too."

I really liked the rosé wine, and my friends and I ordered truffle fries from the food truck. The only thing I would change about our experience is that I wish we had made a reservation 24 hours in advance because you can't order charcuterie boards and wine flights without one.   Everyone is really nice, and on a chilly day, they even have blankets. I highly recommend making the trek out here!"

There is a winery and a brewery on site so everyone likely has an option they'll like = Best of both worlds. They have plenty of outdoor seating, which you could choose to sit in the sun or under the trees in the shade. We split a glass of rose and their sweet white and I would recommend either one. The sommelier was super sweet and helped us choose our wines. Would definitely recommend a stop here to relax and enjoy nature with a glass of wine in hand!"

                "description": "Completely unacceptable management. For about 2 hours a group of individuals where shouting at two tables, yelling sexually explicit language, swearing profusely, and were clearly unable to drive. At a place that prides itself in a family atmosphere, where kids are running around playing in the grass and trees, this is completely unacceptable. I am looking forward to management/ownership response to this review. In a region where wineries, breweries and distilleries are a dime a dozen, plenty of opportunities to take my business elsewhere when we come visit.  What should really concern the owners and management about what happened at Bell Springs is the fact that:  1) The Hays County sheriff was called after the incident because it was so egregious. Enough of these reviews and they will be lining up outside the parking lot for DWIs.  2) The staff (7:00 pm on 6/19) did absolutely nothing to cut off a clearly over-intoxicated group that was negatively impacting people around them  3) The staff's response (blonde and burnette hostesses), ver batim, to the vulgar language and rowdiness was \"free speech\" and \"you are the problem - I know those people\".  Fantastic - best of luck in your future endeavors . Your stellar response caused one of our group to cancel their wine membership."

However, they do have an outdoor patio, bar and high bar seating. The outdoor seating probably really nice in good weather.   Call ahead or make reservations online. It's very easy and they do allow you to amend reservations over the phone.   They produce really great wine and there's a great selection to choose from. The staff is very knowledgeable about their wines and answered all of our questions. Testing comes with a **small** array of cheeses, nuts and crackers."

Only reason I am giving 4 stars is because when you make a reso for wine tasting and charcuterie, don't expect a lot of cheese and meats HA! It was so small, we were cracking up. I would recommend bringing your own snacks and food! Otherwise, awesome spot and I can't wait to go back!"

There is ample outdoor seating under big shade trees! It's a pretty place.  There is also a brewery on site, but I cannot speak to the quality of the beer. We stuck with wine on this trip. I would definitely come back and try other wines and the beers offered!"

                "description": "This is a beautiful winery. Plenty of tables spread around the grounds under trees. Lots of room for kids to run around out there. We sat up on the patio with our dog and enjoyed a lovely wine tasting. We chose the solo tour which was $15 for 5 generous pours of delicious wine. All the staff we interacted with were very friendly and helpful. The one low point is the food truck. We got the currywurst for $10 which was good, but not a large enough serving for the price. The more upsetting part was the pretzel we got (also $10, which is very expensive). The prestel was small, hard (even though it was supposed to be a soft pretzel), and flavorless. The mustard cheese dip did its best to save it, but it wasn't enough."

                "description": "I have been here numerous times and always had an awesome experience but today was the most unacceptable experience I have ever had ANYWHERE. I was here with my family, parents, and my brothers family with a total of 5 kids (not unusual to see kids here). While here, we became aware of a group that was likely overserved and using foul/vulgar language that we tried to ignore for a long time. Once we heard the phrase \"fat c*ck\" at a ridiculous volume my husband asked them to please keep it down, which resulted in a huge altercation with various threats/insults from their end. Despite their behavior management still allowed them to stay. What's worth noting is multiple people had already complained about this group and others joined my husband in attempting them to quiet down- so they were affecting loads of people at the winery. Eventually things calmed down and the argument broke, but as we were leaving they said loudly for us to hear \"I'm so glad that douchebag is leaving\" so I gave them the finger as I was walking away (I will concede this was adding fuel to the fire but I was so fed up at this point) and they screamed to me \"FUCK YOU MOM\" across the grass. Managements response? Free speech allows them to say whatever they want. Apparently this nice hill country spot is going for the dirty 6th vibe. Save your money and go somewhere with enough pride to expel those who can't keep it together while I use my own right to free speech to notify everyone this place doesn't care about their patrons."

                "description": "I am a resident of Dripping Springs and have been a frequent patron of Bell Springs Winery. I found this family-friendly venue to be welcoming and beautiful. It was for this reason that I suggested that my kids, with their families, join my husband and me for a Father's Day celebration on Saturday evening, June 19th. When we arrived just before 5 pm, we found a good picnic spot in the shade near the bag game. We all noticed, or rather heard, a very boisterous group of 12 to 15 people sitting near the brewery. As the evening progressed, and I am assuming more alcohol was consumed, the group became louder and more profane. We attempted to ignore them, but soon it was impossible due to the volume and the increasingly prevalent and disgusting language. At that point, and because we had 5 young children with us, my son-in-law went over to the group and respectfully asked them to turn down the volume so that my Grandchildren would no longer be exposed to words like \"F*ck and C*ck\". He was immediately met with a barrage of personal slurs and threats. 2 staff members (2 young ladies, one light-haired and the other dark-haired) working that evening came over to the group, however, incredibly, the inebriated party was allowed to remain on the premises. Shortly after, every family packed up and went home, including our group.  When walking to the parking lot to leave, a particularly vile young woman yelled obscenities at my son-in-law and daughter. I turned around and went over to the group. When I arrived, I was also barraged with a variety of slurs and called a \"C*nt\". Once again, the 2 female staff members came over to the table to intercede. At this point, the dark-haired staff member shared with me that she \"knew the group\" of offenders, which helped me understand why these folks had not been asked to leave. If you happen to know staff, you can act like filthy pigs, with the knowledge that your actions will have no repercussion, regardless of the profoundly negative impact on everyone else looking to enjoy wine and food with their families.  To add insult to injury, staff had the unmitigated gall to suggest that I was the problem, not the drunk and vulgar group. When I questioned staff (dark haired young lady) why they permitted such obnoxious behavior from any patron, she suggested that hurling profanity toward others was protected under free speech. Staff continually suggested that our \"conversation was over\", indicating that they wanted me to leave. Clearly, the privilege of free speech isn't applied equally to all patrons visiting Bell Springs.  In the past 15 months, I have recommended Bell Springs to dozens of family and friends. Now, I plan to exercise my right of free speech in every forum available to tell acquaintances and strangers alike about my experience, advising that Bell Springs is not worthy of anyone's patronage."

This past time I went I got the Halibut - it was buttery, flakey, cooked to perfection. I could have gone without the tomato it came with and would have preferred different garnish. My boyfriend got the pasta dish that has lobster in it (I forget the name) but let me tell you...it's to die for! Best thing by far on the menu. My only complaint is that they only offer it limited times of the year. Perla's is so cute. Their patio is first come first serve. I made a reservation so we were seated inside. I wish if you had a reservation they gave you the option to sit outside. Definitely a great date night place. Be ready to spend some money, it isn't cheap, but the quality is 10/10.

                "description": "Food was decent, but the parking situation ruined our experience and we likely won't return as a result.   There is a parking garage behind Perlas where they supposedly validate your parking. Apparently there is a new system in place in the parking garage that requires you to scan a QR code to pay for parking then somehow you get it validated at the restaurant. However, when you pull into the garage there is no QR code. So I walked to the restaurant to ask how to validate parking. They gave me the QR code but I had to have my license plate. So I had to walk back to my truck to get license plate. By the time I got back to my truck there was already a parking ticket on my truck!   I reached out to the manger of this parking garage, Travis, to explain the situation, but he refused to waive the parking ticket even though I showed him a copy of my receipt from Perlas which proves that my parking should have been free not to mention the confusing process."

We got there an hour before our appt and host was very accommodating and sat us early. Not to mention we had our 4 month old in a stroller. We took the option to sit outside because the weather was great and they have an awesome patio. The waiter was very nice and very knowledgeable on the whole food menu and drinks. We wanted get something light since we have been eating so heavy on our vaca.   We split 3 dishes a ceviche, the lobster bisque and the wedge salad. All the 3 were very light, tasty and delicious!! It was exactly what we were looking for.   I would absolutely recommend this place!"

                "description": "The location of this restaurant is just fantastic, located in the heart of South Congress. They have a great deck, the service was very friendly and fast. We went for lunch and had the Ahi tuna tostada, calamari and grilled mahi sandwich. The best thing we ate hands down was the tostada. The tuna was like sashimi and it was packed with flavor from the aioli and topped with Serrano. Absolutely delicious! Our other two dishes were good, not great. The mahi sandwich was a bit of a disappointment, especially given it came highly recommended from our server. I felt like it lacked season and was very bland. Regardless I am intrigued and would like to return for dinner some time."

Jacob, my server, was incredible and every dish he recommended was beyond amazing! It was totally worth the flight. This is huge for me because customer service in my opinion, has declined drastically, so when I rave about an experience such as Perla's, it's #facts! This evening I enjoyed some glasses of Chenin Blanc, from South Africa, some delicious oysters (Jacob chose all of them), fried okra, crab cake and the famous potato crusted sea bass and a sea salt dessert! Thanks Perla's for the amazing experience! Thanks for the warm welcome from the staff outside and the lovely hostesses inside. I'll certainly be back and cannot wait! Be safe. Be blessed. Be kind and enjoy good food! Perla's"

                "description": "Been waiting a while to go here, and finally got to make it while it was still nice out; We thought there was supposed to be a happy hour, but it turns out/doesn't seem like there is one anymore unfortunately.  Naturally, we got a few appetizers, oyster shooters and oysters, plus the octopus that came with a savory sauce and potatoes. I'm not a fan of bloody mary's so the shooter wasn't my favorite since that's how they were prepared, and kind of spendy at that. The oysters were a small bit still good; again,  no happy hour pricing.  The octopus was my favorite, grilled perfectly, same as the potatoes, covered in herbs and a butter/mayo sauce that paired nicely.   We both got fish, mine had a bit of spice to it, and the ahi was very nice and fresh; Overall, pleasant meal, more expensive than we would've liked but glad to have tried it. Personally, I think it's better to just get some appetizers/drinks and save the entree for somewhere else; while it's definitely good, I think it's overpriced and could make something comparable for a fraction of the cost."

                "description": "Service was professional and prompt. The server, Donovan, was quite excellent at providing suggestions and information without need to go back and consult a chef or manager. What this says is that the restaurant (and chef) ensure the employees taste what they serve so they can provide info to diners. This is one mark of excellence.   The setting is beautiful. Since it was a pleasant autumn day, we opted for outdoor dining and enjoyed our decision. It's hard to write about the vibe but this is closer to a low-key fine dining. It isn't fancy but the food and service make it close.   We had grilled (or broiled) oysters and they were as good as the ones I had at Felix's in the French Quarter. We also had a sampler of oysters in the half-shell and we were guided by Donovan who knew the types of oysters and sources and showed us that by flipping the shell, the underside gives clues as to the waters they originated from.   Tuna Tartare was excellent (I've only had it as good in Aspen, Co for 3x the price).  Then smoked octopus and grilled red snapper. Both of those were outstanding too.   Price is reasonable for the quality but our bill was over $175 (we ate a ton and didn't care) this restaurant is right on price considering the quality on the plate and from the staff. We will definitely go again."

We split the calamari and it was among the best we've had in Texas. Top two, maybe top five ever. My wife had the redfish on the half shell and loved it. I ordered an oyster Po Boy but was disappointed in the size of the oysters and was very salty. The shoe string fries were fine by my tastes despite what some reviews state. Kind of high price for what we got for lunch but that's what you get now with the CA invasion of Austin. Seafood seemed fresh which is rare in Texas."

                "description": "This place was solidly booked for two weeks after we'd be leaving, but when walking by I decided to give it a try, and was surprised to have the hostess take out number was a half hour wait. Unfortunately we got seated exactly when lunch was cut off, so got just a mini menu, but that was enough--as we felt we were (over) eating our way through Austin. So we got drinks, calamari, and a coconut curry clam chowder. The calamari came to the table first, and was hot, seasoned well and came with two yummy sauces. I thought the clam chowder was awesome. The coconut curry base was very tasty. Fresh clams in the shell were very good. Nice chunks of bacon were abundant. The cilantro was the perfect herb for this. The only thing a bit odd were the potatoes. If they'd been cooked in the broth, it would seem that they should have absorbed some of the flavor. They tasted rather plain, and for that reason I wondered if they were from a can and added near the end. They were soft enough to mash up a bit, and that seemed to give them some flavor. Anyway, the soup was unusual and very tasty, so five stars, though the $18 seemed rather high."

We would have prefered the lower ones, which looked way more comfortable but were told those were for larger groups, even though some were still open the entire time we were there.  We scanned the code to see the menu and waited and waited (we almost left) for our server to finally arrive to take our order.   The drinks came out looking pretty, nice presentation, but flavor wasn't great.  We looked at the menu again to see if there was something else we might like but debated having to wait again to be served.  Instead, we drank what we got, enjoyed the lake view, and people watching, and when our server finally came around again we asked for our check.  Cute \"rooftop\" but not on my list to go back to."

The view itself isn't as great as advertised, as the balcony overlooks the roof of the LINE hotel and doesn't have the view of the downtown skyline. The drinks were just OK, and the food just didn't taste as good as it looked. The menu options are extremely limited as well.

Happy hour is 3-6pm which features a couple of food items marked down $2-3. Glass of red wine is $6. Their regular dinner menu is tapas-style, but full entree prices! Specialty cocktails range $13-16. If you're looking to get full, expect to pay $40-60 per person. Food is average for what you pay for.   Parking- the hotel offers $10 for 3 hour valudation. You can chance street parking which runs $2 per hour. The Mexican American Cultural Center has a moderately sized lot and is a 10 min walk away.   Beware of an automatic 19% gratuity added on, no matter your party size."

This place has such beautiful decor and is on the rooftop/patio, so there is a beautiful backdrop of Lady Bird Lake. You will definitely be taking tons of photos here.  We made reservations just in case, but we pretty much had the whole restaurant to ourselves for the first hour P6 was opened. Everything looked delicious, so we ordered quite a bit:  Vegetable Frittata: This was perfect for a light meal. Lots of veggies and the eggs and butter lettuce was perfect.  Shrimp and Grits: Soooo bomb. Every bit of this tasted great. Just wished they would have removed the shrimp tails as most other places do.  Patatas Bravas: The potatoes were great for a side/appetizer.  Sourdough Garlic Bread: I love a good garlic bread, and this totally delivered. And I like that fact that it was pull-apart bread.   Everything tasted amazing and we really enjoyed our time brunching here."

But we convinced our way out to the patio early in the night which was better (but a little chilly). Why would we want to come to a rooftop bar if we can't be outside, ya know?!  The servers were nice - we had multiple throughout the night. They occasionally came and checked on us. The place was packed on a Friday night.  We all had a lot of fun here and the drinks just kept coming! They were tasty and swanky.  There weren't many parking options other than valet that I saw but I can't remember how much that was. We had to walk through the hotel to get to the rooftop. The hotel looked very nice with mood lighting and modern decor touches.  Overall though, P6 was great - moody and fun!"

                "description": "Visited P6 for happy hour with a friend while visiting Austin and had a good time! We arrived when they were just opening, and luckily we had a reservation - it filled up really quickly after a bit. The space has a great vibe and a great view - even though it's not on the roof, the space offers a lovely view of the city and river and the open concept of the bar makes for a perfect environment to relax and enjoy some sunshine. The space is filled with countless plants and pink decor, which I truly appreciated - it felt quite posh and eclectic yet incredibly put together at the same time.   For drinks, I opted for the ladybird spritz, perfect for a refreshing afternoon cocktail. Featuring rhubarb, aperol, and cava, it was light yet flavorful, really being able to taste the rhubarb throughout the entire drink. Quite good! My friend went for the sundown cobbler, which she also really enjoyed. Since it was happy hour, we snagged some food too. We both split the pita bread with chimichurri and the hummus. We were given a bunch of pita bread, which was much appreciated! The pita was good, but not the best I've ever had (a little dense for my liking). The chimchurri was OK - the ratio of oil to spices was a bit off so it felt like it was swimming in oil. The hummus was quite nice and featured a nice touch of cashews and chili oil. I appreciated the inclusion of various veggies in addition to the pita for a change of pace! The hummus overall was good, but again, not the best I've ever had, but still filling and delicious and balanced our drinks well. While the prices of the cocktails were quite discounted from normal, they were still a bit steep, but to be expected when you consider the ambience of the place.   Overall, we enjoyed our HH at P6! I really enjoyed by spritz and the hummus / chimichurri was a nice balance. The prices are a bit elevated, but to be expected in relation to the space. If you're looking for a nice HH spot for visitors to Austin, I would definitely suggest P6!"

                "description": "Rating: 3.5 stars  My friend and I decided to stop here for brunch on Sunday. We didn't make a reservation ahead of time but were able to be seated right away indoors. (If you are interested in sitting outdoors - we were told reservations book out 1 week in advance so make sure to plan accordingly)  Even though the indoor space did not have the same ambience as outdoors it was still very nice and well decorated.   Service was very friendly and efficient.  For our brunch we decided to order:  --PATATAS BRAVAS: Well fried with a great flavor. Definitely a great brunch item to order! My only complaint would be they didn't really give us many potatoes since the portion covered less than half of the bowl it came in.   --FRITTATA: Ours was a veggie frittata that was filled with flavor and topped with a great tomato based purée. It did come with a giant handful of lightly coated romaine lettuce which seemed a bit mismatched. Additionally the portion of the frittata was slightly too small for the price.   --PICKLED PEARL ONION HUMMUS: Really good portion of food. The hummus is just bursting in flavor. There was also a ton of bread and veggies it comes with to dip into the hummus. Definitely a solid order!   All in all, a nice brunch option for the weekend if you are staying at The Line."

                "description": "My husband and I stopped by P6 for appetizers and cocktails while we were in town and we had the best time!!  The cute, Instagrammy interior is only topped by the incredible backdrop of the balcony view over the river. We got a shady table by the edge and kicked back with a rosé and carpaccio. The plating of the carpaccio was gorgeous, and it had a beautiful mix of salty and fresh flavors. The pita chips that came with it were perfectly crispy too!  This was the best view we were able to get while in Austin, and can't wait to come back! But next time - we'll make it in time for their amazing happy hour deals."

                "description": "Really enjoyed brunch the other day here on their patio that overlooks Ladybird Lake. Had a reservation for 6 and the hostess was able to accommodate my request of sitting outside, which I really appreciated. The ambiance is very pretty and totally Instagram worthy with their pink overhangs and colorful couches/decor. They also had semi-large fans for each outdoor table which was much needed in this Texas heat.   The food was really delicious and not too overly priced. For brunch, most of the plates were pretty small so, if you're hungry I would recommend ordering 1-3 plates and sharing if you have the ability to do so. We tried the Greek Yogurt Parfait, Patatas Bravas and Hummus and it was all sooo good! Will definitely be returning here."

                "description": "I came here with a couple of friends and we had a blast! The ambiance is incredible and I just loved the view! We came during happy hour, which is literally one hour, 4-5pm, and I ordered the Sundowncobbler and Homemade Pita bread. Im not a huge drinker, but I really enjoyed my drink and loved that there was fruit in it. The pita bread was incredible! I loved how soft and warm the pita was. It was perfect with the chimichurri.  Parking- You can park in the garage for the hotel, but they only validate for the first hour I believe, which is only $5. Luckily we found street parking next to the garage which isn't nearly as expensive.  Payment- I actually really loved that you paid online! It makes it very easy to split the check amongst friends without bothering the servers!"

                "description": "Views are excellent... IF you even get a table anywhere near them. This restaurant is poorly executed in my opinion. They have beautiful views of the river but there is no guarantee that you will even be able to see it from your table (even with reservations) and yet you're still paying \"fancy view prices\".   My experience: - Arrived at The Line Hotel (which is way cool btw) to find that there are no signs on how to get to P6.  - The elevator is super sketchy and in the back corner without any airflow at all (seemed like an afterthought or service elevator). - Originally was sat at a \"table\" (their seating are little vignettes of couches/patio furniture that is NOT comfortable AT ALL and really impractical to eat at) nowhere near the view. The tiny view that we did have was completely obstructed by a shade they rolled down. - We asked to be moved to a \"table\" with a view and were finally re-seated but still had a difficult time seeing the view as we were further back at a SUPER low to the ground vignette.  - The staff was friendly but the drinks and the menu items were overrated. - Stayed for an hour and a half, took some pictures, and went somewhere else to eat more food.  My order: - Sundown Cobbler cocktail - Yummy, but tasted mostly like sprite. - Paper Plane cocktail - Yummy, smooth, easy drinker. - Whipped ricotta - Way more food than we expected but the olives and the nuts were better than the ricotta. It lacked a lot of flavor and mostly just helped to fill me up.  Long story short - NOT worth the hype."

                "description": "Okay this is my favorite coffee shop in the Austin area period.  I love how big and spacious this new location is, but the coffee is WHERE IT'S AT.  Definitely come here if you're looking for the perfect date spot, study/get work done, or just to enjoy a nice morning coffee and breakfast.  We ordered a hand pour over, a Chemex, and a double espresso.  The double espresso came out first and this one definitely packed a punch - don't let the espresso size cup fool you.  If I was just here for the caffeine content, this one definitely would've done the job alone.   The hand pour over came out next and the presentation was super impressive!  They bring you the entire carafe with the dripper on top, so it's definitely a lot.  Considering this is only $4, you definitely get your money's worth!  This one was so flavorful and the fruity notes definitely stood out while drinking it.  Now the Chemex...just wow.  For $5, they bring the entire Chemex setup to your table and you pour our of it as you drink.  The fact that they trust their patrons with the Chemex really speaks volumes about how much they care about the presentation piece!  Looks aside, this coffee (I believe we got Ethiopian) tasted amazing and on-par with the pour over.  Don't let me forget the breakfast tacos.  This was such a treat.  I got the Migas breakfast taco and this one was stuffed FULL with eggs, tortilla strips, and pico.  It was delicious and filling and for $3, this one definitely hit the spot alongside the coffee.  I also bought one of their coffee beer stouts to take home...I believe it was the House United coffee milk stout.  If taking home, you either order beer in a Crowler (two pint cans) or a Growler (64 oz).  I can't wait to try their coffee IN THEIR BEER.  But most of all, can't wait to come back here every time I'm in the area!"

After a day of fun with the family tubing in New Braunfels we headed to Austin to try Slab BBQ which we had seen on YouTube and It didn't disappoint!  The staff was amazing we had the nachos, the donk sandwich and ribs ... it was amazing!!! The nachos great amount of cheese and bbq!!! The donk was so good, meat was falling of my bun and I forgot about my table manners and I was picking it up with my hands!! The ribs are so tender and awesome no bbq sauce was needed! and   The staff was so kind they gave us free banana pudding but we all were so full we could only take a bite. I ate my banana pudding for breakfast the next morning and enjoyed it with my coffee, the banana pudding was light and sweet; simple amazing!!  Sorry we didn't take pictures ... the food looked so good we all just dove in an ate our food! (We forgot about our posts and timelines) The food is awesome best first restaurant visit ever! (Even though it is inside a bowling alley)"

We actually tried this at BBQ Austin, among many other popular places.   I can be quite picky about brisket and wow this was in my top two of the 10+ we tried. Perfect amount of spice rub, tender, fatty, delicious. Can't wait to go back and have a full plate."

It bills itself as a BBQ joint, but I see this more of a BBQ-between-buns joint.  I wouldn't go out of my way for this type of barbecue, but for those who likes brisket sandwiches and the likes, this is a good place to go to."

                "description": "Ordinarily, I love SLAB, but the Door Dash order I just received from them was incredibly disappointing. One of the items I ordered was nachos, and the queso wasn't even completely melted. As I was pouring the queso on top of my nachos, two massive chunks of unmelted cheese (at least I hope that's what they were) came plopping out. Also, the brisket wasn't warm, as if it had been recently pulled from a refrigerator but not heated. So disappointing! Do better, SLAB!"

                "description": "This review is based solely on the food of our last visit. Our first experience with Slab was ordering a smoked turkey for Thanksgiving of 2020, and it was one of the best turkey's we've ever had. Smokey, moist, and lovely. But, since turkey is not a regular meat on their menu I am reviewing strictly on our last meal.   While down in S. ATX, I stopped in to give the restaurant a true try. Upon walking in, the menu was posted on the wall, but confusing. All we saw were sandwiches, no mention of meat by the 1/2 pound or pound and no price. Would be cool to know what options we have with a little signage. Is this a sandwich spot or a BBQ joint? Long/short, they did let us do 1/2 pound orders, so got some brisket, a few sides, and some beers.   Sides were solid. Twice baked potato salad and the smoked mac/cheese were both great. The brisket on the other hand was meh. Maybe i'm spoiled with Texas brisket and its smokey, red tinted smoke ring and crust. So it was a little sad to get something that was not that. The meat, while tender, was almost more like a pot roast. Seems like they take inspiration from many different styles (KC, Carolina, TX, etc) with sauces, so maybe this was the point, and I'm sure slathered with sauce and tossed on a bun it's probably pretty good. But if i'm going tit for tat on sliced brisket, elsewhere will allow you to fly closer to the Texas sun.    Not sure we'll be back if we're wanting true BBQ, but if we're in the mood for a BBQ style sando, we may swing by."

The tender, flavorful melt in your mouth, slap yo daddy and kick your cat good brisket. Tasty sweet BBQ sauce. Classic queso and what makes the whole plate a hit...chopped up pickles. A little burst of crisp vinegar to cut the richness of the cheese is a bite of what I hope clouds would taste like.   We drive from San Antonio to eat here and you should too. Call up your boo and tell them it's time to get weird and head to Austin.   What are you waiting on? Go on. Austin is calling."

                "description": "We were looking for a BBQ lunch spot and SLAB delivers! The meats are smoked to perfection and because we couldn't decide on what to try we got two of the best sampler options on the menu - the slider trio (chicken, pork, brisket) and the epic DONK sammich (all the meats - chicken, pork, brisket, sausage and all the sauces). We also tried two of their sides because YOLO - Gouda Mac and the twice baked potato casserole. Legit, UNBELIEVABLY good. My favorite out of the slider trio was the chicken - sauces were on point, chicken was tender and juicy. The Mac and cheese was EPIC - it's a wet Mac which I love. Super creamy, smoked Gouda is just divine. Twice baked tots were also good (but my heart belongs to the Mac). If you're here for epic then go with the DONK. Single portion was HUGE but it delivers on flavor! Stacked high with meats it's also smothered in delicious sauces, crunchy onions and jalapeños. Honestly, will come back for that! Beer selection is fantastic. Get you some SLAB!"

Sometimes when there's a new location, there's a drop in quality, but not here.   Its actually 2x bigger, nice and bright, just missing the Hip Hop Feel of the original location.   If you like BBQ or BBQ sandwiches, then this is the spot for you.   They gots a variety of meats for your meat eaters, sorry, I'm not a vegetarian so I don't know what they got for folks here.   The Nachos are awesome, prob best to share than eat alone.  If you don't know what you like, give the Trio Sampler a try, its a very nice place to start.   All the other sandwiches are massive (and good), and will prob put me in the hospital if I eats them again, so my goto sandwich is the McDowell, oh man, puts the McRib or any Pork Rib to shame, its executed so well.  Always tender fall off the bone rib mean between your choice of bun, bbq sauce, and pickles, so good.   The Sides are ok, but the Desert is the best, the OG cookie is so drip!

The Geeks Who Drink trivia night on Tuesdays at Lustre Pearl promises a fun time, yummy food, and tasty drinks.   What my group of friends didn't count on this past Tuesday was a female bartender's phone number scrawled on the receipt belonging to a married member of our party who had ordered food and drinks with his wife at his side. We also sat in plain view of bar staff for about 2 of hours and, although the married couple weren't all over one another like a couple of teenagers, the casual onlooker would easily see that they were together.  I love that Austin is very Texas friendly, and, who doesn't enjoy the flattery of getting the phone number of a young, attractive admirer?  However, as a person working behind the bar, I figure this bartender also has to be observant and gauge many things about a customer: their age, sobriety level, with whom are they sitting, etc. The bar area wasn't very crowded this past Tuesday, so we can't attribute this paper proposition to a simple misunderstanding.   So, couples beware. You might be forced to have that awkward conversation with your partner a few days after one of you is handed a phone number by the person you bought drinks from at Lustre Pearl.  The recipient of the phone number wanted to avoid creating a scene on Tuesday night (his wife would have likely had words with the female bartender), so had to hold his tongue for a few days before sharing his experience.  Lustre Pearl: please talk to your staff about being more aware of your client's relationship status, or at least being respectful of it... especially if they're gonna jot their number down on a receipt.  Plus 4 stars for food and atmosphere; minus 3 for lack of awareness and creating an awkward situation."

                "description": "This is my favorite bar in East Austin by a long shot.   I joined a cornhole league that played at Lustre Pearl East and it was the perfect outdoor bar setting. There are tons of murals around this bar (perfect for picture taking!) and picnic style tables outside. Most of the seating is outside with 4-5 tables inside, so definitely come on a nice sunny day. Lustre Pearl East also has a private event space that can be reserved. Parking is free and mostly along the street.  As for food, there are quite a few beers on draft and great food options. I order the brussels religiously and have never been disappointed... they're mixed with pretzels and topped with a savory sauce and beer cheese. Best brussels in Austin, and all for $7. I've had their wings and tacos too and both were delicious.  Of course I have to give a shout-out to the AMAZING bartenders at Lustre Pearl. They always remembered my order and welcomed me with a smile. Great people and great environment... definitely check out this bar if you're in the area."

                "description": "I've been a regular at Lustre Pearl Tuesday trivia nights for a couple months now. First off, five stars to the hosts. I've been to many Geeks Who Drink nights at bars around Austin and the folks who run the show here have the right combination of humor, expediency, and most importantly music taste.  As far as Lustre Pearl itself - the bar food is nothing to write home about. The tacos are nice enough but they have off nights and on nights and for $5 a taco you can do much better elsewhere. The drinks are not terribly priced but just keep in mind this is a nicer bar in East Austin so you more or less know what you're in for. As far as the space itself, it would be nice to have more places to beat the heat but the outdoor space is quite nice - just make sure you grab some bug spray before you head out the door.  Overall, this is a solid bar and a great place to hang out on a week night. Check it out!"

                "description": "Lustre Pearl has a great location but everything else is forgettable at best. When I was craving a club sandwich, I eventually remembered seeing a club on their menu, so I biked over to try it. I'd been there a few times before, but like I said, it hadn't made much of an impression on me. Unfortunately, the club was a waste of money and a dinner. The menu didn't say it had mayo, but it was drenched in mayo. The bread was limp. The other fillings were fine, but the bread and the mayo ruined the rest of it for me."

                "description": "As summer rolls around and you find yourself wanting to enjoy the weather at an outside bar, one place to consider is Lustre Pearl.  I recently came by for a happy hour with co-workers and got to try a couple of their snacks off the menu as well as a drink such as the:  - Loaded Tots: these are topped with brisket, avocado, cilantro, sriracha, goat cheese, and chipotle aioli - I mean, look at my picture. I don't have to explain how good it was. You got to try this one!  - 6 Chicken Wings: we went with Garlic Rosemary and that was nice since I haven't had a flavor like that on wings before. I like the strong herbal flavor in that one.  - Adult Chicken Nuggets: we went with the Ranch Rub on this and I liked how different it was to the garlic rosemary flavor. This one is stronger and richer, a must try for any ranch lover.  - House Sweet Potato Fries: some sweet potato fries are hit or miss, and this was a hit. The spicy miso aioli that comes with it is a good pairing!  - Lustre Lemonade: as a sweet drinker who's favorite fruit is Strawberry, this is all I could want: vodka, strawberry syrup, lemon juice, and soda water. Great refreshing drink for a hot day.  All in all, I give them an 4/5 since I had a great time! Good food selection, good drink selection, various specials throughout the week, and fun atmosphere to come with friends. I suggest y'all come try them out!"

                "description": "I've been to LP twice now, once for lunch (pandemic-ending period) and once post pandemic for happy hour. Both visits were good! Plenty of outdoor seating, I've never seen that they have indoor seating but didn't explore too much. There is a house on the property that may have seating inside. I've had the loaded tots and the cheeseburger and both were excellent. Music is playing over the loudspeakers but not too loud. Gravel and cement flooring. Plenty of free street parking. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area."

                "description": "Just go to High Noon, instead. You're welcome.  I rarely leave reviews, but I still can't get over our experience here...  Generally: Vibe was very bro-y (very San Fran). Drinks were subpar. Music was all over the place. Service was disappointing (I'll get into that later). The only thing it seemed to have going for it was the outdoor space. It was nice, esp with right weather. Tho some of the tall tables were awkwardly big, I wondered if they were built during covid to have people 6 ft apart? Either way, we were already looking up a different spot because the atmosphere was quite dull and boring.   Personally: I really dislike being treated poorly, when the alternative is so simple.... so thought I'd share here because it all happened so suddenly I barely processed it.  My 2 friends and I had been there for less than an hour, talking and sitting at the giant table minding our business. Two of us were still sipping on the first drinks we ordered, my other friend had a soda.... When out of nowhere this short rando interrupts us by loudly tapping his bottle opener on the table and just says \"YOU GOTTA GO\". We look at him, annoyed, waiting for the punchline.  He must have realized we were confused, because only then did he decide to explain himself (in a rude accusatory tone, at that) \"you can't stay here if your friend is throwing up in the bathroom\". More confused, I instantly checked in with my friend who used the bathroom, to ask if she was feeling okay, because she wasn't even drinking (she literally asked for a coke at the bar). The bro just stared at us, until he walked away..  First off, There's a better way to approach people. Period. Use your words. Treat people with respect. It's really pretty simple.   Allow me to share some tips, for the wyt bro from last night: - Rather than tapping something loudly on the table like a child, an \"Im sorry to interrupt you all.\" Or even an \"Excuse me\" as you're interrupting a conversation, would suffice.  - Rather than \"YOU GOTTA GO\" outta nowhere with zero explanation. Maybe an \"I'm sorry, to have to do this. It's been suggested that your friend was throwing up in the bathroom, and as part of our policy, we're going to have to ask your group to leave\". Use your words. - Or, you could actually do a decent job of assessing the situation and use your skills to read the room and recognize that the person you accused was not displaying any OTHER signs of intoxication because they were not drunk (or even drinking at your establishment). A check-in with our group could have also informed you to make a better decision. You could have also given a warning. There are actually several alternatives than following your ego trip.  But really, how cliché, another wyt bro doing the bare minimum, knowing he could go on in life giving zero effort to be decent. How original...  Secondly, We weren't some blacking out college students barely able to stand on 6th (who, by the way, also wouldn't deserve such a shitty response). We were sitting, chatting, coherent, physically functioning, PAYING patrons, sipping on meh drinks at your boring establishment.  None of us were making a scene. None of us showing signs of being affected by alcohol. My accused friend did NOT even order a drink there. She didn't have to be embarrassed by that bro - she hadn't even shared with us that her stomach was upset, yet. AND she had just shared that there was literally people hooking up in the other stall, like lol what kinda place are yall running?   Also, you do know there are other reasons why grown ass women (who aren't drinking) would gag in bathroom, right? Did you ever think about that? We had just walked over after having a 5 course meal at Intero. She said she was feeling odd and that all she did was gag in the bathroom. Like use your best judgment, vato. Read a book.  Third of all, we are literally sitting there checking out the new Lustre with my friend who is part owner of a bar on Cesar Chávez. We know the law. This was all so poorly handled. We didn't get into it then, because it wasn't worth the energy. But there's a reason there are other MULTIPLE signs listed for bartenders to be trained to spot intoxication: * Slurred speech * Confusion or disorientation * Loss of coordination * Delayed reflexes * Slow, irregular breathing * Unresponsiveness * Nausea and vomiting  And, if as a bartender, you're still compelled to ask a group to leave because their non drinking friend gagged, then at the very least approach people with respect.   Do better."

When I got my food I went to get the utensils, loads of dirty knives and forks. I washed my own using their hand sanitizer on the side. Food was ok, had some weird strand of fluff or hair in my salad. Couldn't pinpoint exactly what it was but you have to step up the hygiene factor either way. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and come back again and hope for a better experience. Maybe that guy is usually more engaging and maybe their hygiene is usually better."

The drinks here are made very well - not too sweet or overtly strong. My table ordered the adult nuggets, tots, sweet potato fries, and the chopped beef sandwich (which is brisket). The tots were definitely my favorite and easily shareable. I had the chopped beef sandwich and it was pretty good - wish it came with a side for the price you pay.

                "description": "We came to this place because of a recommendation from a friend. As soon as we arrive, we sit down at a table, there are no heaters or service. So we are slowly freezing to death in the cold. But hey, it could get better, maybe we can order some whiskey to warm us up right? WRONG! As soon as I leave my seat, to go order drinks for our group, I immediately get harassed by four power hungry servers/bartenders that tell me to put a mask on even after governor Abbot  stated that no more businesses require customers to wear masks. The main reason I'm giving a one star is because we were the only customers in the bar and there were no heaters in the blistering cold, service sucked, and the staff were extremely rude when they definitely could have handled it more professionally. Just be polite next time! Unfortunately we won't be coming back. Cheers."

Ambiance: Good selection of outdoor games and music playing. Nice indoor area as well as a lot of outdoor area. Dog friendly.  Service: The service staff is relatively friendly. I have been here quite a few times and most of the time it is good, but I have had poor service as well  Food/Drinks: I wish they had a better selection of beer to my liking, but they do have quite a few taps to choose from. Their food for a bar is actually really good. Their wings, a little salty, and pretty tasty along with their burgers and tots.  Definitely worth checking out"

                "description": "We had a work meet and greet here for lunch , so unfortunately I wasn't able to taste their craft beer but it looked so good I felt like I was drooling on the inside.   Really nice place with both indoor and outdoor seating. Bench style seating.   I was able to order everything from my phone after scanning the QR code.   I ordered a chicken bacon ranch which is what I normally get when eating California style pizza. It was very good. Although, everyone else ordered the South Austin and it looked really good, they all loved it, but The salad on a pizza just ain't for me.   I am not from Austin so I don't know what to compare to, but I will definitely be back to try another pizza and definitely the Hazy IPA.   They also have dessert pizza which I brought home and it didn't last 20 minutes."

The beer selection is pretty good and the pizza was yummy (but not blow-your-mind level yummy). I will say my boyfriend's pizza, The Flying Garlic, was amazing and so flavorful  The service was the best part for sure; I felt comfortable and taken care of during my meal. I'll probably try to visit their Parmer Ln location in the future!"

                "description": "Aviator Pizza was solid, not amazing, but okay. We grabbed togo and picked it up on our way home from the gym so we could just collapse and eat some pizza. We got one white pie with arugula on top. It tasted like the greens weren't washed, and they were all wilted and slimy by the time the pizza got home 10 minutes later.   The other pizza was better with a variety of meats and veg on top. But overall the dough felt a little undercooked on both and generally was a bit chewy.   I'd be willing to try this spot again and likely sit down to eat it in person and hope that it's better right out of the oven, maybe it just doesn't travel well? But pizza is a notoriously delivered food item, so I would hope that's not the case.   All in all, i'm not that impressed but willing to give them another go."

                "description": "Like the pizza here, it is one of my go to pizza places in town. The cheese bread should be illegal and the flying garlic pizza is dreamy. The quality has been consistnet and then it wasn't. This last visit, they came up a little short of the runway.  The dough was not cooked all the way and one of the  9 inch pizzas was 7 inches.  Emailed them about the short order about a week ago and have not heard back. I am disappointed and it just makes me wonder about quality control in general.  How could they not notice the pizza was almost 2 inches smaller than ordered or do they just not care? The lack of response indicates the later."

I think this means I should write about pimps and gangsters in purple Cadillacs.   No ... there were no purple Cadillacs here. Sorry! And I was the only one there. But I got me a pizza and a salad (no beer). Then went next door and dropped $300 in a cash game at Shuffle 512 because a Facebook friend/fan sat right next to me and we were having fun and gambling.   If I had gone in to Shuffle 512 first, I might have won. Therefore, theoretically, this was a $300 pizza and salad. I'd leave a woah emoji, but not sure if it will show up on Yelp. I mean, the emoji comes up but I have tried it before and it was just a weird space. And I don't want you to associate me with pimps, gangsters, and weird spaces (purple Cadillac okay).   As far as the pizza goes, traditional bar pizza. Good not great. Salad pretty solid. Atmosphere very good but I was there early so not 100% sure.   Overall, recommended as a feeler to see if it's for you."

I ordered Dem Berries beer and my honey ordered a mic ultra.  The pizza was a-m-a-z-i-n-g!!!!! The bread was out of this world.  The toppings were fresh and had delicious flavors.  The staff were nice however we asked for her to change the TV to the TX/OU game but she kept forgetting.  We asked her again and finally tried to locate it however the cable they had didn't allow the game so we had to watch it on our phone.  We wished they offered nicer plates and flatware; they gave us paper plates and plastic forks but we aren't fancy people so it was all good.  The place was super clean and relaxing.  I would definitely recommend this venue."

Their garlic pizza is one of my favorites, but the cheese burger and south Austin are also solid choice.   We always have to get their mozzarella bread because the cheese/garlic/butter/crust combination makes it one of the best things on the menu.   They have a huge rotating beer selection and plenty of seating if you're wanting to eat there. I've taken pizza to go a few times too and it transports well."

First off the pizza is great and love the beer selection BUT after ordering I used the restroom and there was a crew member that used the restroom at the same time and didn't wash their hands. I brought this up in comments about how they were doing when I had my receipt emailed. It seems whoever answered back did a half ass apology by saying maybe they were washing their hands in a different sink or were intending to wear gloves. I'm sorry but I don't wanna eat at somewhere where a higher up thinks it's appropriate for a worker to use the restroom not wash their hands put on gloves and touch my food."

The staff definitely appeared to be on top of COVID precautions.   The pizza was so so. The crust didn't impress. Sort of like a grocery store premade crust from a bag. The toppings were just kinda blah. The pizza didn't feel incredibly hot for being just out of the oven.   There was nothing wrong. It just wasn't all that. Maybe it was an off day."

The main reason he wanted to try it was to watch hockey.  We were immediately greeted and told to take a seat anywhere we wanted, a precursor to the excellent service that we received the entire time we were there.  The place is very spacious with a bunch of tables and bar seating, as well as plenty of outdoor seating, and a bunch of TVs. There is also what appears to be a stage space, most likely for their events like trivia and bingo. We sat at the bar and ordered drinks. It was a Sunday early afternoon so it was pretty quiet. We ordered a side of Buffalo roasted cauliflower per recommendation. My fiancé got the impossible burger with a side Caesar salad and I got the smoked pork quesadilla also with a side Caesar salad.  All the food came out relatively quickly and pretty much all at once. I obviously was too excited for the food because I forgot to take pictures of them! The portions were the perfect size and the side salads were not sad like some other watery small portions that you might get elsewhere. My fiancé enjoyed his burger and my quesadilla had a great texture and came with pickled onions, sour cream, jalapeño slices, and shredded lettuce.  Shout out to the service for being extremely friendly and fast, constantly checking in on us. We definitely want to come back to this place!"

I'm at a loss for words in regard to the preparation of this. Check the oil pools in the pictures. I wouldn't recommend this appetizer at all.   - PRETZELS - $10 Fresh baked pieces with white queso and spicy brown mustard (680 CAL.) -   Sooo..... Baked and then dipped in Oil? Also, avoid that queso. As far as ambiance... It was noticeably hard to ignore a certain mildew type odor while sitting. Sit outside if you must!

The chips were warm and the queso was fine but not the start we expected. Disappointing.  We were hoping to try several of their beers but since the appetizer was less than average, we had a beer each. The Lagunitas Sumpin Sumpin was nice and the 512 IPA was wonderful.   One of the best IPAs hands down.   We each had a beverage, ate our chips and moved on."

Cool vibe, big tables, seat yourself social distancing, and quite a few TVs. Servers kind of rotate between tables to make sure everyone is taken care of so they're super attentive. We had one main server though and she was sweet and personable. They had three different menus, which was kind of confusing, but we realized one was their main menu, the second was someone they partnered with, and the third was for their Smokehouse BBQ only served on Wednesday nights.   Go for the bbq! I was pleasantly surprised how delicious the bbq was. I got the two meat plate that came with two sides. The sweet potato fries and brussel sprouts were both delicious. My friend got the loaded sweet potatoes and really enjoyed it. Overall, we had a good time with some good eats! Would definitely go back again!"

I am getting out more and the Domain is one of my favorite places to shop(carefully), eat and people watch! Sunday I met my two adult grandchildren at the awesome Domain Shopping Center. After completing our initial agenda of a haircut and some shopping we were starving. When the three of us get together and we're going to eat 99% of the time we choose a place we haven't tried before.  There sat the Brass Tap Tavern.  As always, I took a look at yelp for reviews and the majority were very positive-always a good sign! We've gone to a small handful of restaurants that are available at the Domain but in the spirit of adventure we decided to try The Brass Tap.  It was a Sunday afternoon around 430 ... so absolutely not what I would consider prime time for eating. The Decor was beautiful. The interior huge, lots of brass which is beautiful, and a very smart, but earthy feel. A large screen TV on the wall which is standard these days but often takes away from the beauty of an establishment. They also have a decent size patio available and since the tavern is on a corner it wraps around it. At that time of the day on a Sunday there was one table inside that was occupied, and probably about eight tables occupied outside where we sat down. It took us a bit to see our waiter approaching with a huge front and back beer menu, along with a very cool looking food menu. It was obvious that he was feeling rushed however he did take the time to answer a couple of questions we had about the beer menu and he took our order. I let him know we would be eating also as he was already rushing off and said he would be right back to take it. 20+ minutes later he stopped back after delivering beer to at least two tables on that trip. We decided to order an appetizer to share. Due to our elevated hunger level everything sounded delicious so we opted to get the combo platter. It consisted of Boom Boom Shrimp, House-Made Tots with beer cheese or jalapeño beer cheese and Chicken Tenders with BBQ sauce on a bed of House-Made Angry Onion Straws - $15 this was an average size appetizer. I personally ate a couple tater tot's and some onion strings. There were also three different dipping sauces, one a barbecue sauce, one a queso cheese sauce and one that was kind of tangy with a little bit of heat. My grands polished off everything else that was on the platter. Our main dishes arrived shortly after we had gotten our appetizer. My grandson ordered a half pound Angus burger called The Pub it was  Jalapeño cream cheese, smoked Gouda, Applewood bacon, lettuce, tomato, cowboy sauce on a butter brioche bun - 11\rit came with french fries. The fries looked great as was the construction of the burger and toppings. Sadly the burger was requested medium rare and arrived medium to well done. After waiting on our food over 1/2 hr. the grandson decided not to request it be redone. My granddaughter ordered the PERI PERI GRILLED CHICKEN PANINI with Goat cheese, hummus on grilled Ciabatta bread - 10. It also came with fries. It looked good and my granddaughter really enjoyed it. When I asked her what \"Peri Peri sauce was She couldn't explain. Since I didn't want something that heavy(The Panini) but I wanted to know what that sauce was I ordered  the 3 BEER BATTERED COD  Tacos. They were dressed with lettuce , cheddar jack and pepper jack cheeses, Peppadew peppers and drizzled with Peri Peri aioli - 8.5 ,my tacos were served with some chips and tiny salsa on the side. I was glad the Peri Peri was only drizzled over my fish tacos as I didn't care for it. To each his own! So our tab for our appetizer,meal, one nonalcoholic bottled beer one draft beer and one beer described as more like wine was $61.86. For us the food rang out at about a 3.9 (out of 5.0), the beverages, we really didn't think my granddaughter would like the nonalcoholic beer but she tried it and as it turns out she doesn't like it. I ordered what was described to me as NOT tasting like a beer at all but like a sweet wine (I guess I must've missed the wine list because the website says they offer it)-after two sips that was enough of that. This is definitely not the Brass Taps fault as I am not a beer drinker but since I said that out loud before ordering off a two sided menu that looks like all beer I would've wished our waiter would have advised me that they did serve wine. All  of us rated the service a 1.5 out of 5.0.    I am not mentioning the name of the server purposefully. Although he could have told me they had wine that really is all I can say related to him.  The major faux pas for us was how long it took to get anything to eat or drink."

Come during happy hour where flights are $7. You really can't beat that since they're heavy pours. I'd highly recommend the Texas flight.  The atmosphere and vibe was dope. They had live music and she sang EVERYTHING under the sun.. from 70s to Michael Jackson to The Weeknd. Definitely made the place awesome.   Our server was great too! Highly recommend to stop by and grab a beer."

Good amount of tables and social distancing is very easy on the patio.   I love the servers here. In particular Janson was great! Super kind and approachable, very attentive. Super great service.   The food is good I've gotten the jalapeño poppers and the fried pickles. Both were really good  The drinks are phenomenal and I love how much variety there is with the beer.   Overall a great time."

                "description": "We chose to celebrate our New Year's Eve at the Brass Tap after snagging a few tickets for the 'Silent Rave' being hosted there that night. Since it was our first time attending such an event, going into it we thought things were going to be awkward, when in fact it was the complete opposite. Everyone had their headphones on, singing and dancing to one of three DJ's that were playing simultaneously on different radio channels. Even on this special night, the drinks were priced normally so kudos to that. This event turned out to be a very social affair.   If you're planning on going to an event like this, especially at the Brass Tap (Domain), I would recommend coming earlier than most to 1) grab a table to have a place to set drinks, otherwise how are you going to dance the way you want to dance? and 2) the line to get event headphones gets decently long and checking out the devices isn't a quick process.   5/5 for a fun organized event, clean venue, friendly bartenders, and a great night out."

Love pretzels but they seemed to be from the freezer to being cut up and dipped in oil. Inside was mush we told the server and he just let us know how much he loved them. Although we did not eat but 3 still charged.  Bartenders behind bar vaping, not professional.  I would avoid this spot."

Ordered an app and a flight with the intention of having dinner and watching the NFL game. Asked if the football game would be on and the server said sure. A few minutes later the screens tuned to a soccer game. Funny. We didn't stay. Upside - they had all the beers in the flight."

It's definitely our \"go-to\" local bar, and we pop in and out usually at least once a week, even it's for just for a quick drink. The management is the NICEST, most gracious bunch you could ask for, and they are almost always present, making sure everyone is happy and tended to. The bar staff is all phenomenal, no matter what time you go in. The have a game room, several TV's/projectors, and even have live music on certain nights. They have a great Sunday brunch deal that really can't be beat. They pour a great drink, and have a nice pizza menu to order from as well!   They have an awesome, very large, dog-friendly patio with tv's, heaters, and misters. They have plenty of dog bowls for your pup, and a water cooler inside for you to use. They have a great sense of community too, and often have events going on that are open to everyone. Huge thanks to Miguel, Tammy, Jordan, and Audrey for always being the best bar staff in town!"

                "description": "So here's the thing, we were coming to Knomad back when it was Nomad.  We lived walking distance away in the Windsor Park neighborhood about 3 years ago before moving further north.  This was before kids, a mortgage, and all the other amazing perks of adulthood.  We were just 2 kids in love hanging out at the bar with friends.  But then we thought we'd get married and the very next day had brunch at Nomad.  When we got our first pup together we brought him to Nomad.  Even when I was pregnant Nomad owner stopped by to congratulate us.  So see, Nomad is more than a bar to us.  It's where where our roads crossed, it's where we made friends and created a family.  We don't get to make it there often these days, but Nomad will always be home!"

Yes, I originally had fun in your establishment nearly two years ago, I wrote an honest review then, just as I wrote an honest review of what happened in your place last month.

                "description": "Update: Since posting my experience here I have received an intimidating Personal Message from one of the \"regulars\" here that basically said I misinterpreted my experience here as racism because the owner is a minority and that there are sometimes bartenders of color that work here. First off, what I witnessed was racism, plain and simple. And, for someone to try and brush it off as me \"misinterpreting\" it as \"some other reason for your friend not getting service as fast as she would like\", just goes to show the type of patronage here.  I also received a comment from the owner about not calling his bar \"overtly racist\" when it isn't. I am sorry to say I will not be removing that statement from my review as it was my initial experience there. That is the beauty of capitalism, freedom of choice, and having a review site to state your experiences openly and truthfully. I had absolutely no idea of this place before coming here, so there is no ill will or underhanded plot. However, when my friend and I experience something like that, especially in this day and age, I take the \"see something, say something approach\".   Respectfully, sir, if you don't want your establishment viewed in this light, then do not have employees who selectively treat patrons, especially new ones, in such a manner and then when confronted be a complete jerk about it. This all could have gone a completely different way had your bartender just apologized for ignoring my friend and served her. But, instead, he was the one who chose to escalate it and make race an issue. As a compassionate human person and a productive member of society, I chose the most vocal platform I had access to to bring this to the Community's, which you also reference in your reply, attention to ensure it is addressed and hopefully does not happen again. It is your customer's choice to read and heed my review and if it does have an affect on your patronage, you may need to ask instead of pointing blame outward, to look in-house.  Also, in response to my claim of racism in regards to our treatment here \"being a dangerous road to go down\", it absolutely is, but not because of the \"mob mentality\" of me and my fellow Yelpers voicing our experience. It is a dangerous road to go down to think that is in any way acceptable treatment of a customer, regardless of race, and especially because of it! It is a dangerous road to go down to not say anything and to be intimidated or guilted by having that behavior justified or brushed off. Casual racism is not ok and being vocal about it should never be called out as going down \"a dangerous road\". The danger lies in the complacency, not the action.  As for the $1.75 \"honest mistake\", please keep the offer of a refund. If that is how you define \"honesty\", yet another reason I will not be returning to this establishment.  *To clarify, I am straight out saying the bartender that served me and was a disrespectful ass to my friend behavior was racist, and since receiving an intimidating message from a regular here, by proxy the establishment, since this sort of conduct is not only acceptable here, but defensible by the regular patrons."

                "description": "Review of service*  Holy Racism, Batman.   You figure a guy that majored in cultural anthropology would have a little more of an open mind when it comes to hiring staff for his bar...  Hey Bartender... here's the best part... I'M THE GUY YOU KEPT SERVING OVER MY FRIEND who was standing right next to me. I literally walked up, not knowing if she ordered or was waiting, and within 3 seconds you asked what I wanted for a drink. This happened multiple times, we brought a group of 15 people to your filthy establishment, and sadly... the service and negative/racist mindset of the employee's shine through.   Granted... the owner of Nomad made the news a couple of months ago because he's in business with someone who attacked a guy with a Japanese sword and stabbed him with a dagger... but that's neither here nor there, or is that fact that The Department of Justice recently filed a civil rights lawsuit against the owners of many bars throughout the United States, accusing them of discriminating against non-white patrons. Would be a shame if this happened to Nomad.   The fact that I witnessed such blatant discrimination made me sick to my core, maybe the Austin Human Rights Commission should force your staff to undergo anti-discrimination training. Yes, that can happen (at your expense)   Anyways.... 1 star is 1 star tooooo many  - maybe come here if you support the KKK? I don't know.   \"No human race is superior; no religious faith is inferior. All collective judgments are wrong. Only racists make them\"  ― Elie Wiesel"

                "description": "FIVE STAR DIVE BAR!!  About two weeks ago, I checked out Surf by Surf East, which is an annual surf rock music fest, at Nomad Bar. King Pelican was the headliner. I saw them in San Antonio the last time I went to Texas, and knew this would be a great show.   Because I was staying downtown, I took a Fasten to the club.  Nomad Bar is in a mini strip mall near the Target by I-35. I saw a bus stop station nearby, but I went with ride share since I wasn't familiar with the area.   Nomad Bar has an outdoor patio area that's accessible only from the inside of the bar. I checked it out for a bit because it was such a nice night out, but went back indoors. The stage where the bands played is inside. Behind the stage is a projection screen. Most of the acts that night had YouTube videos looping in the background. The sound in Nomad is good for acts. Got some really good recordings inside.   I sat mostly at the high tables towards the front by the entrance. I split a pizza pie, which was tasty (an independent business does the food at Nomad). Drink prices were pretty good here; I stuck mostly to Dos XX. In between acts, I checked out the game room, where there are darts and an arcade game. The game room is well-lit, which is in contrast to the main bar/indoor area that's dark and dive-y (in a good way).   King Pelican were awesome that night (as expected). I would come back to Nomad the next time I'm in Austin. You should check it out."

We demolished it and ordered 2 more, each different. I'd go back just for the pizza!  I like the cozy feel to the place and that they have indoor and outdoor service. I also never had to wait long to order, which is rare and fabulous."

                "description": "Is this Dive bar with patio and small game room overtly racist? ..... perhaps. But what is racism?  Oxford states - \"Prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race\"...... The ironic thing is that the incompetent owner (Miguel) has just committed a racist act as clearly identified in his posts.  The blatant example being, the lack of communication to any of the three African American's that have left negative reviews in regard to this past Saturday's event.  Don't be too surprised, as it appears to be inline with his poorly managed business. Considering I've been phoning the establishment for two days now, only to be greeted with a recording of \"the mailbox of the person you're trying to reach is full and no new messages are being accepted, please try your call again later\"......... Well Miguel, I've tried my call again for several hours now. Perhaps you should place that book of Mein Kamph down and clear your voicemail.  What has sparked all of the recent one star reviews one may ask?  This past Saturday several friends of mine ventured into Nomad to enjoy a few drinks. Jordan, one of the bartenders seemed to be a little \"weathered\". I'm not sure if he had too many shots as I've seen him do in the past or what, but he apparently wasn't taking to kindly to the ethnicities standing in front of him, awaiting service. Instead he helped many \"whites\" and I use this term loosely, prior to them, even though they were positioned first in line. This wasn't an isolated incident. It happened more than once that evening, to more than one African American in our group.  Jordan has waited on me several times in the past, so I approached him and asked what prompted him to threaten one of my friends with being ejected from the bar.  When I mentioned that I've got too many witnesses that have the same recount he replied \"this isn't a court room, I don't care about witnesses\". Needless to say he was irrationally defensive and had no intention of calming the situation down.   The sad part is that I've visited this location several times for about a year. I initially noticed on my first visit that the establishment carried a slight Riff Raff tone and wasn't an example of \"class\". As I continued to patronize the location, I'd see female patrons wearing sandals reflecting heels that are in need of major pedicures, customers with dogs inside the bar area which appeared to frustrate some patrons, heck, even the Owner Miguel, was overly tipsy celebrating his birthday recently at the bar, and my girlfriend and I witnessed him acting belligerent and was showing butt crack, while cranking up the music more than once to the point it was annoying.  So Miguel, stop the PR nonsense and clean up your mess. As I look back through Yelp, you've been slapped with one star reviews about racism and poor service in the past. The fact it's still continuing leans more towards condoning your staff's behavior or cementing the fact you're an incompetent manager. Either way, you shall never see me cross your doors again."

                "description": "I'm sorry but I have to give Nomad 1 star for customer relations and satisfaction.   After an awesome UYE, (Unofficial Yelp Event), nearby with 31 in attendance. I suggested to 15 that we continue the festivities at Nomad, a bar/lounge that I thought would be a great choice especially since to me, they craft the best caipirinhas in town. When I first visited Nomad, Jordan crafted the perfect caipirinha, using a top shelf cachaça, gaining my respect. Last evening, I immediately realized that he was not in good form when he began using lemon instead of lime for my caipirihna, he corrected his mistake and said, \"It's been a long day\",  and I accepted that but what was unacceptable, was disrepecting a member of my group. It's going to be difficult returning to this venue."

                "description": "If there was a 0 star option I would gladly give it to the Nomad bar. Let me set the stage regarding why I have such little respect for this bar.   I attended a post Unofficial Yelp Event event at the Nomad. I noticed one of my friends ( a black woman) abruptly leave the venue with her sister. I was told that she had a confrontation with the bartender over not serving her. I later witnessed my Hispanic friend stand by an empty bar not receiving service even though 3 bartenders looked directly at him, yes they made eye contact. A Caucasian person walked up to the bar not 5 feet from my friend and he was immediately served. After speaking with my friend to validate what I witnessed I was disgusted by this behavior and left the bar.  Please note, as a Caucasian male, I had no issues ordering drinks. I also have a complaint regarding their drinks. If you are a regular you receive a healthy pour if you are a non-regular it's a pretty lite pour. Yes I was a bartender and know the count.  The important fact is that I witnessed discrimination against my friends of color. I really don't give a flying hoot about lite pours for non-regulars.  If you read the other reviews there is a pattern here and you can draw your own conclusions. I Paul Russo will never ever step foot in this bar again."

The thing that saves this place as a really good bar is the customer service, and really well made drinks. Plenty of sitting, with inside and outside sitting. I would definitely go back with friends! Side Note: Area is a little sketchy, so be situationally aware of your surroundings. I guess you could say that about a lot of places, though. I recommend this Bar!"

                "description": "I really like this place... yet another bar I've visited only because of trivia. I don't even know why I like it so much.  I shall describe. It is dive-y and in a really unremarkable neighborhood. There are flyers and posters all over the walls. The inside is kind of cramped and doesn't have a lot of seating; outside can be better although still cramped, but there are heat lamps! Roast like meat under red lights.  The pizza is like really good... again, no idea why. I think of it and dream of fluffy crust, the ideal amount of toppings, and wholesome flavor. They have twice now screwed up our order and brought the wrong pizza out - late and without apology - but I'll keep ordering it.  Dim, not overly friendly, and a little crowded... but good vibes. And good pizza, if you get what you want.  Well, the only thing is - I think they used to be the Nomad Bar and have no idea why they added the \"k.\""

                "description": "Nomad bar is a decent, tucked away, fairly average bar. It's average bar size for Austin, average pricing (maybe cheap) for Austin, average looking for Austin, and hires average staff for Austin.  The main problem this place has, is it's pretty much interchangeable with any other bar in this city. I guess they have an international theme, but they don't take it particularly far. The place comes across as a dive.  It's also not the largest place in the world, so you tend to feel cramped pretty quickly. This isn't a problem, though, as people seem to be generally polite and courteous.  The neighborhood is also not the best, so I would recommend only parking in the small parking lot out front, instead of parking on side streets."

What was the bar tender's response, who was also white, \"if you can't let it go, I'm not gonna serve you.\"  I was shocked.

I wasn't able to get the name of the bar tender, but I know Gus and Tony were the bouncers and just made things worse by also getting involved and blowing things out of proportion. They get one star because the green tea shots are actually really good (plus I can't even give less than 1 star lol), but other than that the service is terrible, and the music is garbage. The place is never really poppin anyways so honestly go somewhere else for better service, better music, and a better environment."

                "description": "Must try pizza place  Food: At first you think is a regular pizza but when you try the sauce and cheese they got it right. I got a margarita personal one and I love it! The only thing is that if you want crunchy Dough, let them know. I have my days that I want that.  Price: very reasonable.  Environment: people know each other a d it looks they are repetitive clients. As soon as I got there I felt very comfortable. It is a layback place, perfect for Family, Sports, Pizza time with the friends and music is super classic. They were playing the 3 Musketeers and II was just great to be there during lunch time.  Service: The server or manager made sure I like and enjoy pizza. I noticed that he will ask the clients on how was everything and he was really interested in knowing."

It's loaded with all the meat toppings! The sage sausage have a kick and it's such a quality pizza for what your pay for! The crust is crispy on the edges but fluffy and  chewy in the inside. I usually get thin pizza but decided to get regular crust and I am so glad I did! The texture is indescribable good! The bbq chicken pizza is equally amazing! It's unique and the bbq sauce is perfect balance with the feta cheese, chicken, and toppings! This place is a must try! I am so happy this pizza place exists in Elgin! I am excited to try the other pizzas on there menu! Order and pay online was super easy. Pick up time was on point and the pizza was still hot when we got home."

                "description": "My wife and I were driving home from Austin on Father's day looking for something to eat. I was craving pizza, so she lit up when she saw a sign for some outstanding pizza from Aviator Pizza coming up in two exits.  We decided on an 18\" to share and went with the pepperoni and basil with black olives. The cashier, and sole employee on the front side, was very friendly and humored us as we decided through the menu. Nothing really special there, but not everyone handles our humor or weirdness, so props to her. The pizza arrived shortly (plus for time) and we dug in. It was very tasty and the crust was very satisfying. I can't quite pin the taste, but it seemed like a home-made or high end dough because the taste lingered, and in a good way. It was one of my favorite crusts. The rest of the pizza was great as well and ranks up there with the best. Aviator Pizza is nowhere close to where I live, but if I take a road trip to Austin again, I will certainly make it a point to stop in. I'd go so far to say it would be worth leaving the city limits to get some better pizza."

                "description": "4.5 stars. Quick, yummy, affordable pizza on the way to Austin! Drive-thru window made it super convenient. Love how you can get 2 different toppings on a 9\" personal pizza. Maybe not the best pizza ever (I like Via 313), but definitely good for the price.  FLYING GARLIC (garlic butter base, chicken, garlic, spinach, feta, spinach, crushed red peppers) $9.95 for 9\" - slightly preferred over the Brussels sprouts pizza bc I loved the garlic and feta. Only complaint is that there was hardly any chicken, mostly garlic cloves.  SRIRACHA BRUSSELS SPROUTS and GOAT CHEESE (red sauce base, Brussels, goat cheese, honey sriracha, mozzarella) $9.95 for 9\" - the goat cheese was the predominant flavor which I enjoyed. Not much Brussels sprouts. Maybe this would be better on a white base rather than red sauce? Still good.  9\" pizza comes w/ 6 slices. I probably would've been satisfied after 3-4, but I'm fat and ate the whole thing. Shareable if you're not a big eater. Crust is thicker than MOD Pizza, I love bread!  CINNAMON PECAN DESSERT $7- basically the size of a 9\" pizza so it's worth the price. It was yummy! However, I wish there was more icing and pecans on it (compared to other pics), but I have a huge sweet tooth. Plain cinnamon dessert is $5.50  Picnic tables in front if you want outdoor dining. Connected to the gas station (sign is easy to miss). Plenty of parking."

                "description": "Was driving back from Austin and decided to grab some pizza to-go for dinner! I called in our order - pretty funny recording (like a captain getting ready for take-off to fit the aviator theme).. nice sticking to the character of its name! We placed the order easily and were told it'll be ready within 20ish mins. It was ready for pickup and packaged when we arrived. The place was pretty large, modern, and clean for when we re-open for dine in. But there were a few picnic tables out front and no one around so we decided to hang out and eat outside. Thick good quality paper plates provided!   The pizza was decently priced and we got the large 18\" - half Hawaiian and half Margherita. Can't say I like the flavors - the toppings were alright but the pizza crust was just bland.. zero flavors and maybe taken out of the oven too early cause it was soft and not so crispy along the edges. They do load the pizza with lots of toppings though. Can't say it's the best pizza I've had - not even close - but it filled us up and it was quick. Don't think we'll be making a return unfortunately."

                "description": "This was our first trip to an Aviator.  We went with high hopes because of the \"gluten free\" option. Well. It's pretty unfair to paint a restaurant as a good option for gluten free food with just ONE option. A GF crust. But. It really isn't. If you are gluten INTOLERANT,  this is NOT your place. It's really not much of a choice at all. Red sauce or pesto. Thats it. So you can have red sauce on a cracker. That's how the GF crust is. A dried cracker. Burnt crisp.  The other pizza crust... is like one size fits all. They take a single amount of pizza dough for all 3 sizes of pizza. I had a 9 inch pizza and it could have been a calzone. Its was WAY too much dough. I added portobello mushrooms as a topping and got about 10 small pieces. It just wasn't good.   In fact about all I can say that is positive is the Cream Soda. Everything else was just, meh."

                "description": "During a recent car club event, I called Cypress Creek from a restaurant in Wimberley to tell them our arrival was eminent. The lady on the other end of the call was quite nice suggesting they had PLENTY of space for our cars to park.  Well, they weren't wrong. Quite possibly the best photo opportunity of the entire weekend. Our attendees overlooking 24 cars perched in the beautiful trees of Hays County overlooking some of Mazda's genius. Free samples of crafted rum too?   I'd call that a win! Owners were quite attentive as soon as we arrived. Telling us the story of the brand; walking us through each tasting. Some drinks were ordered; maybe a bottle or two bought. Not sure we were the most receptive group being on a car tour in the Hill Country. Service was excellent!"

                "description": "Tucked away behind Wimberely mear Jacobs Well stands a small distillery with a small bar and large patio.   They offer free samples of the three different whiskeys with one of them being bourbon barrel aged using Rebecca Creek barrels.   The staff was friendly and well informed on the products. Currently they are distributing to smaller local stores and will start distributing to more stores in the future.   As it is August right now we couldn't tour the distillery because it was too hot but we were informed that the tours would start in October when it cools off.   The bottles are decently priced for hand crafted rum like this.   There are plenty of tables and chairs for groups, drink cocktails were decently priced, and property is a great change from the city."

They have a food truck on site. Their mojito was refreshing. They even let me be part of the cocktail making process. The owners were super friendly. For those that want to taste before buying, they offer free rum tastings."

The patio area in the trees was beautiful and they had this nice swing. I had the drink with the pineapple and vanilla rum.....sooooo good! It was so good my husband grabbed a bottle so we can drink it at home. If you're touring the area i would recommend coming here early and just enjoying the scenery and the lovely conversation with the guy at the bar!"

                "description": "Laura guided my boyfriend and my tour through the distillery.  She tries to schedule them so each party has a separate tour.  It's a really nice touch, because it shows they aren't trying to blow through tours by combining as many people as they can into one group.  The tours are $5.  We emailed her to set ours up.  We started with a tasting.  Laura had bartended for several years before the business started, so she made us a Vanilla Rum mixed drink in a sample cup.  It was nothing short of delicious.  Absolutely fantastic drink.  Atfer that, the tour started.  Laura explained how the business started up, showed us the distillery and explained all the functions, and then showed us the bottling room.  She answered all of our questions and was very personable.    We concluded the tour with 1 more sampling of their normal rum combined with a mixer.  Again, a totally refreshing drink.  We stayed and talked to Laura for about 20 minutes after and were on our way.  This was a great experience.  It's a humble distillery with a growing presence.  They've won a couple of major awards and you can definitely they definitely love what they do.  Makes for a really enjoyable tour."

                "description": "This place is the cutest, most quaint little gem.  If there's a local distillery, I always want to try out their goods.  I didn't expect it to be at someone's home, though!  Not that it's a bad thing.  Rum, for me, is a take it or leave it type spirit.  I typically use it only in cocktails.  I don't think I've ever wanted to sit down with a glass of rum.  Now bourbon?  That's a different story.    On arrival, I just expected a tasting only, but they actually make cocktails.  They have a small menu, or you can request whatever you want from the mixers they have.  Mojito?  Of course.  Want to go dive with a great rum and just some Coke?  They won't judge you for that, either.  They make their own version of Rumchata in house and it was SO DELICIOUS.  For real.  And they'll give you the recipe.    Pick your favorite of the three varieties: Crystal, Gold, Vanilla and buy a bottle.  Then pick up a bottle of vanilla extract.  If you don't cook, make your mom very happy.  That stuff is fantastic.  In the hotter months, don't be a jerk and demand a tour of the actual distilling barn.  We all know how distilling works.  If not, the internet is your friend.  They don't want to be in the high temperatures, and neither do you.  Let them explain the process to you while you sip a nice, cool drink instead."

It was a little expensive and no tours are offered but the tastings are free which is a nice change to the other places we have been.   Make sure you try the vanilla rum and take a turn on the tree swing! My nephew loved it.   Wish they would have more signs.... the first was easy, then we were feeling lost."

                "description": "The best part of this distillery is the location...a country vibe that is beautiful. Now for the bad news...The rum is a strange flavor. I have been to other rum distilleries and have never stumbled upon such a \"harsh\" flavor that could never be drank alone. That being written we decided to have a drink on the patio...I'm glad alcohol kills germs because the guy serving us had the dirtiest hands and fingernails I have ever seen in my life and I have children. For example when he grabbed our glasses from the cabinet it left a dirty grip mark. I was pretty much grossed out. It's too bad because again the location is great."

Let's examine the facts:. -- He led us through a tour of his small but highly functional distillery. -- He answered all of our questions about the process he uses, and even showed us some of the machine parts he's made. -- His wife made us two (nicely sized) tasters: a mojito, and another thing I drank even faster than the mojito that tasted like a lemon drop.  $5 each later, we skipped right down to Wimberley Valley Spirits to get ourselves a bottle, because the law is mean and David can't sell any of the goods on the premises.  Stupid Republicans, or something.  Now we check out our unopened souvenir, plotting and planning, totally giddy that we pulled into that questionable-looking lot with the signage for rum.

                "description": "I hate being this person that leaves bad reviews, but I just can't help but share my experience at Black Sheep Lodge in hopes it can help in the future.  I recently went to BSL to watch a football game and have some fun on a Saturday night. The atmosphere upon arriving seemed... overwhelming but rather cheery. It's a hole in the wall sports bar and I was hopping for a fun night.  Beware, if this is your first time to BSL, like it was for me, just know that NOBODY will help you. I had to ask other customers about seating and how to grab the attention of waiters. To start off, once my friends and I snatched a table, we waited 30 minutes and bothered 3 waiters on ordering drinks... all answering that they would let another waiter know. I finally got fed up and went to the bar to get myself the drinks and then was told, they would send a waiter over to the table to get our drink orders. It seemed to be a losing battle. We finally just asked for the drinks at the bar again and by the time we FINALLY got our waiters attention, we were hoping the service would get better.  After ordering and getting chips and dip, we were all done with our first drinks and trying to get the attention of our waiter for the second round. I kid you not, after 30 minutes of not getting our drinks, I went back up the bar and saw our order of drinks waiting to be picked up and just grabbed them instead of waiting any longer. After grabbing our drinks, the waiter came over asking if we needed anything else and we simply requested 1 water and 1 coke. You would think that would be simple and be done quickly... well you are sorely mistaken. We never received the drinks after reminding the waiter THREE TIMES. THREE DIFFERENT TIMES FOR ONE SIMPLE WATER AND ONE SIMPLE COKE. You couldn't even get drunk if you tried at this place.  I ordered the boneless wings in Buffalo garlic sauce and I thought the vinegar was going to create a hole in my stomach that the water I ordered three times could help.  Granted, they were busy and I feel bad if they were stretched thin. But it didn't help that one of the waiters that we requested help from would pause at the table next to us and sit with the group of people, acting like he wasn't working?  I hate to say that this sports bar is one I'll never care to go to again in my life, even if they paid me too. Which is sad because they have soooo many classic bar games that I wanted to play but never got to because of the fear of our table being stolen (meaning it was pure chaos on how nobody cared about seating).  I wish I could give the entirety of the experience in a shorter version but this is the shortest I can make it for the sake of making a point."

I was a huge fan when they first opened. Music. Community. Meeting new friends! It was great!  I have to say, I'm not a sports fan. And I really don't think we need another sports bar. But I know I'm a minority in this.  Playing important games here and there sure!  But when the TVs came, the Music died so much! The table sharing was less.  But you know what? I still feel like I'm \"home\" when I come here. And you can NOT beat the cheese curds!  So stuff your face, play some darts, and enjoy the locals! Because here we are!  Only gripe....

I was thrilled to find on my last visit they still have great food, a great vibe, and above all excellent service. The bartenders, my server, the droppers, essentially the entire staff were incredibly helpful... on a bustling Saturday night no less. However, there were a few rude customers. So if you're the type of person who respects people in the service industry you should definitely come by. I highly recommend it."

                "description": "Everyday Black Sheep Lodge has a special on drinks which is always appreciated for a gal like me who loves to throw them beers back whether it be daytime or nighttime. I really like their Trashcan Tuesdays (all Texas canned beers are $3!) to pair with my very own basket of cheese curds, a plate of burger sliders, and some crispy sweet potato fries! Sorry but I don't share my cheese curds when I come here.  Parking can be a thing but do know that there are about a dozen spots reserved for just BSL in the back behind Cindy's (go around back around the corner). There are also a few spots directly in front by the patio area. Otherwise I would suggest ridesharing to BSL if you got a group of folks who you plan on meeting up with.  This is a place where you can bring large groups for sure as there is plenty of space in the game room area AND inside area. I love the bar area too but it can be get crowded with regulars - which isn't a bad thing but something to note.  Service is fast and quick here every time I come even during peak or major game watching.

                "description": "Black Sheep? I feel a better name might be Counting Sheep. You see you will have plenty of time from when you place your order until you receive it for a nice long nap. It wasn't crowded and we certainly did not have a complicated order. We ordered two Chicago dogs and one Chili dog. There were no other tables outside and i counted 12 people inside, all at different stages of eating. I guess it's a global pandemic and the water was shut off in Austin so I guess there is a reason....but the hotdogs aren't boiled (I hope)--well I don't think I'm being very helpful unless you'd like to review the restaurant operations... And i really don't want to know all the details of how the sausage, errr hotdogs are made. I just want to eat them. It was kind of a Chicago dog. The mustard was served in a tiny package on the side and that seemed strange. The bun didn't have poppy seeds and it was kind of dry. Other than that it was tasty. I took a bite of the chili cheese dog and that was fine too. I guess if you're in the hood and you have the time (plan on extra time) it's worth a stop. At least one time. Then you can decide for yourself if you will return. I will not!"

We ordered food, 4 pitchers and got kicked out. 3 people, 3 hours , 4 pitchers and were actually forced to leave. While ordering the food and drinks we were given poor service but who cares at a sports bar. But after they got the orders we were kicked out for tabc. If you look up tabc rules on our tab we were in line, even if we were close it's a sports bar grow up. Games over and we want to watch the last 1.5 minute of a nba game, and we were actually forced to leave. I get following rules, but when you follow rules you don't know anything about, then you're just out of line"

The wings are quickly becoming our favorite, and the mimosas are really really well balanced! Honestly that's hard to find for me... there's always too much juice or the bubbles are flat... not here!

This is not your run of the mill bar food; the tenders and wings are some of the best I've ever eaten, no joke. The fried pickles and cheese curds are delicious. The onion rings are absolutely perfect -- hot and crispy, not greasy-- and it's always worth it to get the full basket. The Chicago Dog is one of my favorites too. I haven't tried the burgers yet, but I can't imagine I'd be disappointed in the least. Very highly recommended!"

                "description": "Not a bad location if you're trying to just go watch a game, chill with friends, or just kick back and let the Austin traffic die down. Lots of TVs so during football season I'm sure it's a full house. The drink choices and food are good, but there are a few minor complaints I have.  There are daily specials on select Texas drafts, cocktails, and other drinks. However, I wish there would be more choices of drafts because it didn't seem like they have any. But I really like the choices I tried, and they even have some others from different breweries. They also have select drinks in cans and bottles.  The food is good, but it wasn't really what I expected. I just had 8 wings to watch a basketball game. The Buffalo medium sauce was excellent, but the lemon pepper dry rub had a little too much of the powder on it, decreasing the integrity of the taste. But I must say the Buffalo sauce and the taste of the chicken wings were pretty good. Maybe a burger or something next time.  I think I'll be back during football for some games, or another time whenever I want to bring a friend. Go try it out and maybe you'll like it. Parking is available in the back by Cindie's, but get there early as spaces run out quick."

I plan to visit more and scroll through the list of options again.  There's also a number of daily food and drink specials and I believe there is a happy hour offered as well.  I typically come to here to watch [European] football  (soccer) with a cold beer and standard American bar fare.  My one gripe is that they have a pretty good burger that they just don't know how to cook at medium temperature. I've ordered it twice and reiterated that I'd like it medium and it comes out well done each time.  That's mad annoying but I'm still holding out faith that they'll get it right one day. The fries are pretty top notch.  Again, you can't loose coming here just on the strength of the beer selection alone.  I'll be back for a better burger experience soon."

The porch is chill and dog friendly though, so there's that. If you've got tons of time and don't mind being ignored and overlooked, it's worth a look. That said, you'd likely being doing yourself a favor by going to either ABGB or Loro, both of which are within walking distance."

I requested a drink that wasn't on the menu and not only did they make it for me but they put their twist on it and made it better! Let's just say after my party tasted my drink we had to order a round for the table! Thanks again Josh!! The Key Lime will make you think someone's aunt is back there making it with love  and the home made Oreo Ice Cream is something to talk about. We will definitely be seeing you guys again. Btw I won't be upset if you decided to put that drink on the menu..."

It's a fun place to bring your friends or coworkers if you aren't in a hurry and aren't afraid to spend a bunch on appetizers. The meals range from $15-$30. I've never been disappointed. The fish and chips are currently my favorite.   Some nights it can get really loud outside, so be prepared for that. It's almost always busy, so if you want to give it a try be safe and make reservations."

Reason for my quotation marks is because my gf and I came to hang with one of her friends and they wanted to have a \"cake and wine\" type of night so that's exactly what we did. The menu did not look disappointing so I'll definitely have to come back to try a plate.   The cheesecake I believe it was, was absolutely amazing! Definitely has a very sweet taste but I mean, if you're looking for dessert you should look no further.   We also had a couple of glasses of wine and cocktails. All fantastic. My gf ordered the fantastic beautiful and it was delicious!   If you're in the area and looking for some food or just a place to grab a couple of drinks while chit chatting, this is definitely the spot to hit up at the domain. Not loud but not too quiet, dim lighting to set the mood, and a very laid back atmosphere"

The Guacamole came with sweet potato chips and I ordered the number six chicken sandwich with kale slaw for the main entree. The chicken sandwich had the right amount of cajun seasoning. The burger and sandwiches here come with french fries or slaw. I feel I definitely did good by ordering the kale slaw instead of the fries because the kale slaw was out of this world. It was very good and fresh. Yum!! Highly recommend it.   Service and ambiance was outstanding."

                "description": "Currently writing with one button of my jeans undone - Doc B's food has me full to the brim.   Not usually a big American-food person but I was curious why this place was so well-rated and wanted to try it for myself.   I asked the server to let me know what are the best things on the menu. She was very familiar with the restaurants' offerings and she killed it with her recommendations. Here's what we got:   For appetizers, Housemade Guac and Oven-roasted Wings are must-gets. The Guac is great because the chips are unique: baked sweet potato chips! I could munch on these all night. Thankfully, the Oven-Roasted Wings stole my attention as soon as it landed on my table. Best. Wings. The Chimichurri sauce is addicting!   For mains, our server mentioned that the West Coast Steak Sandwich is the best. One bite in, I wholeheartedly trusted her. It's cooked to perfection and the bed of greens helps to cut the fattiness of the meat. The Chimichurri Steak was also pretty good but the steak on the West Coast Steak Sandwich was better. The fries were well-seasoned, perfectly thin, and crispy. Oh, we also threw in a Brussel Sprouts Salad, which was needed to balance the heavy meal.   - Our server was knowledgeable about the menu (+1) - Everything came out so quickly, I think in less than 20 minutes (+1) - Our server's recommendations were spot on and the food was great (+1, +1) - Very reasonably-priced for how good this restaurant is (+1)   That's a solid 5-stars in my books. Highly recommend!  p.s. I dined at the bar to skip the wait, which was going to be 45 minutes (7:30 PM on a Wednesday night). Reservations are probably needed because of how busy the Domain gets."

They have a good bar and patio with TVs for the big games. The server was clearly new to serving based on his awkward interactions with us. I ordered the Chicken Paillard (arugula, tomatoes, pickled red onion, and shaved reggiano with gold coast vinaigrette). I had to really dig for the chicken under the mound of arugula but it did have good flavors, just way too much rabbit food on top. The buttermilk fried chicken looked good so if I go back, I may have to try that."

At first we choose this place because most of the other restaurants had a very long wait time. We were both glad we choose to eat here. I don't remember our servers name but so many other servers including ours were very attentive and kept checking on us. What made our experience over the top was when  the manager, josh stopped to talk to us about the restaurant(history with the restaurant), different recommendations around the area. We were very appreciative of the conversations with Josh during a busy dinner time.  I had the chicken parm. it was very flavorful and the right portion of pasta for the chicken. my boyfriend had the filet and he said it was great. the Potatoes that come with are delicious as well. I had a few to try!  We definitely will be back!"

                "description": "Nice place, good service, but food was disappointing and pricey. $17 for guac?? Serving was big but no flavor other than avocado. Chips didn't go well with it. Had the wok bowl and wow no seasoning or flavor in the steak. The teriyaki was mildish which was nice to not be overpowering. Still just everything was not worth it and mediocre and not up to its ambiance feel."

The server even brought extra sauce without prompting.   My friend had the Cobb salad which looked amazing. Considering she wanted to go mainly for that I'd say it must be good.   We went on a week night which went decently without too much of a crowd."

It was what I expected, and the service was superb. Although, the small portions with the high prices is something to note. While many of the items were a bit high, the portions were lacking. Besides pricing and portion, the food is what you expect and good."

                "description": "One of the places we went for my wife's birthday week. She had been hearing good things and saw great reviews, we went with another friend who also has a birthday in June.  The place was very nice, you had indoor and outdoor seating, the staff wore masks. We sat inside as it was hot, there is a parking garage, the purple one, right across the street so that was nice.  Service was great and fast. We started with some drinks and candied bacon and chips and Guac. The bacon was very good, agreed on by all three of us. The water did not come with ice which I found rather weird but maybe it's not but they keep it filled.  Our friend has the Cobb salad, Shana had the Turkey Burger, and I had Chicken. They both liked theirs, my fries were really good but unless you dipped the chicken in one of the sauces they brought it was pretty dry. Good flavor but dry.  The food was good, they raved about the chips but the guac was not as great as they were hoping. Overall it was good but not as good as many review make it sound, I admit I expect more when the food it more expensive and two of the three meals being good is great but while I am glad we went, not going to be on my normal rotation of places to go on date nights."

                "description": "Food is awesome, but the system sucks. On a Monday at 1pm, we ordered a brisket sandwich, two salads, and a zucchini dish. The salads came to the table after 10 minutes about 10 minutes apart. Then the sandwich came about 5 minutes after that. After another 20 min, and we finally flagged down an employee who implied that the server probably gave up because of where we're sitting (which is out back with everyone else). She came back to tell us that we weren't charged for it, and would bring it out anyway. She did, promptly, and it was delicious.  The Mandarin margaritas are rockin', though small."

                "description": "One of Austin's most famous restaurants - created by the owner of Franklin BBQ and sushi chef of Uchi!  Perfect for large groups and almost always packed, Loro creates their dishes with a bit of an East Asian inspired twist and Texan BBQ spirit! The rice bowls come with a fish sauce that's really delicious, and pair well with the small portions of meat.   The shrimp was flavorful and the smoked prime bavette was incredibly tender - you won't overeat here with the portion sizes, but it's a great experience to try out with a group or on a date! The boozy mango slush was also SO yummy and definitely boozy.  - Crispy Potatoes ($6.25) - Chicken Karaage ($10.50) - Texas Sweet Corn ($6) - Sesame Rice Noodles ($5.25) - Curry Marinated Shrimp Rice Bowl ($14.50) - Smoked Prime Bavette Rice Bowl ($14.50) - Mango Boozy Slush"

                "description": "What a clever idea to pair concepts from two of the more recognizable Austin eateries in Franklin Barbecue and Uchi. The result is an Asian fusion smokehouse serving unique takes on some classic items. We called in a fairly large to-go order and then drove over to the location in the South Lamar District to pick up the food. The place was half full for a Monday evening so it wasn't overly busy. There were a couple of outside patios with seating along with a spacious interior dining area that had booths, high-top tables, and picnic style tables along with a bar.  Bar Food, Snacks and Veggies, Meats, Sandwiches, Rice Bowls, and Sweets were the menu categories. Our picks were the following... * Crunchy Sweet Corn Fritters (served with sriracha aioli and cilantro) * Crunchy Cabbage Salad (served with cashew-ginger vinaigrette, cucumber, and lemon zest) * Coconut Scented Rice (seasoned with lime leaves and lemongrass) * Tomato and Cucumber Salad (served with cantaloupe, cilantro oil, lemon zest, and mint) * Sesame Rice Noodles (seasoned with chili vinaigrette, black sesame, and green onion) * Malaysian Chicken Bo Ssam (marinated with yellow-curry yuzu vinaigrette and Thai basil) * Char Siew Pork Belly (marinated with hoisin sauce and celery) * Smoked Turkey Breast (served with apricot chutney and chicken skin) * Smoked Beef Brisket (seasoned with chili gastrique and Thai herbs)  The standouts to me were the fritters, pork belly, and turkey breast. The sweetness of the fritters was contrasted with the spicy aioli. The pork belly was sliced into small square pieces and coated with the familiar flavor of hoisin. The fruitiness from the chutney and the crispiness of the chicken skin gave a citrus tone and texture, respectively, to enhance the smoked turkey.  I do think the meat servings were small for the charged prices. For example, there was maybe a half pound of smoked beef which cost nearly $20. The quality of the meats was good, but I think the brisket was not quite up to the Franklin standard. There had been a buzz about Loro when it first opened in 2018. It has been on my to-do list for Austin, and I was happy to be able to sample a variety of offerings."

                "description": "I love Loro! I've been to their location in Dallas before, but the OG Austin location probably has an even better setup with a larger partially-covered outdoor patio area.  I really enjoy casual counter-serve type places like Loro where you just order everything at the bar - easier for big parties like we had too. Loro's draft list and drink options are expansive and fantastic, and you can't stop by here without trying their boozy mango or coffee slushie (they sadly ran out of the coffee slushies when we went ).  The food at Loro is some of the best food pairing for casual weekend drinking that I've ever had. Szechuan spiced karaage - just get multiple orders of this for the table and thank me later. The brisket is smoked onsite under Aaron Franklin's supervision, and is absolutely fantastic in a fusion pairing with pickled onions, chili gastrique, and Thai herbs."

It should be noted that the brisket id only available until 4pm! This brisket is amazing and worth the wait."

                "description": "Loro is a must if you live in or are visiting Austin! While they don't take reservations, waiting isn't too bad there. We got there around 6 on a Saturday night and were told it would be a 30 minute wait for 2 people. They have outdoor seating and a bar outside so you can hang out and have a drink while you wait. We ended up getting seated 15 minutes later (I think we just got lucky).  Once you get seated, you have to go to the front and order and then they bring it out. It gets pretty crowded at the front, so not quite ideal if you are planning on having multiple drinks or ordering more food, so it might be easiest to order all of them at once.  I ended up getting the Typhoon and frozen gin and tonic to drink and then shared the crispy potatoes, brisket, brisket rice bowl, and rice noodles. The food came out super quick, but unfortunately, the brisket was cold. All of the other food was great and even the brisket in the rice bowl was warm, it was just the brisket by itself.  Overall, I was really impressed by the uniqueness and flavor of all of the food and drinks! They also have a decent amount of meatless options too if you are vegetairan! I will definitely be back!"

Crispy potatoes, chicken karranga, grilled snap peas and the wonton chips and salsa were delicious. Very unique and interesting flavors that blend well together.   The pork belly and tofu bowls were well portioned and equally delicious.   Crispy chicken and brisket sandwiches were also hits at the table.   Service was prompt and friendly.   We will be back."

                "description": "Stop everything you are doing in Austin Texas.  If you are a fan of Franklin BBQ..... and ....., Uchi Japanese restaurant s.... Go to LORO!!!  It is the fusion of both of these fantastic restaurants!!!  I couldn't believe the great food and beverages we had here at LORO!  We started with the Heifenweis beer on tap which was very good.  We sat at the bar and the bartender suggested the flank steak Meat plate along with the pork belly rice bowl, snap peas and sesame noodles.  I don't know what made me agree to order this mess of food but when it came out I was sure happy I did!!   Our bartender's name was Huy and he sure knew his stuff!  The sesame noodles were fantastic!!  Kind of Pho like noodles but with Al dente texture served fried with sesame oil!  FAntastic!!!  Then the flank steak served with pickled radishes and cilantro!!  Really good!!  The snap peas with Kimchi sauce was super tasty but the pork belly rice bowl was the best of the lot.  If you come to LORO'a you should get this dish.  It's hard to explain but it's a fusion of thick bacon, rice, some sort of veggies and a  ginger soy sauce that would make you smack yourself in the head if you'd forgotten to mix it in.  It's simply magic.  It's ridiculous.  You gotta have it.    We paired it up with an Argentine wine \"Trento Negro\" which was again fantastic!!     We finished with a cookie that was kinda chocolate chip and kinda macadamia nut mix.... Served with a coffee slush that knocked our socks off!!!  Ambiance was Asian smokehouse cool vibes.  Staff was friendly and unbelievably helpful to midwesterners like  us.  Bathrooms were clean and prices were reasonable.    This is 5 star food served in a super cool atmosphere with great prices.  Do not go to Austin without trying this place.   It should be at the top of your list!!"

Loro did a great job. I loved the corn fritters and I got the cabbage salad and added grilled shrimp. Everything tasted amazing! I love the atmosphere and I currently work close enough to walk there. Perfect outside seating for the weather when I went. I will have to go back for happy hour. Food came quickly but there were a TON of people so if you are still COVID paranoid, probably just try to take out! Good luck!"

                "description": "Loro is so very popular, but they make waiting fun with a cute waiting area.  They have an extended parking which makes it less stressful.  I love ordering at the counter, but you have to be pretty strategic.  Look at the menu while wait and send someone to order immediately so that you can get that food!  We usually order a lot so that we can try everything.  Below is what I remembered from my trip:  My partner loved the Brisket Sandwich especially the sauce that came with it.  The Turkey was good, but odd.  It comes with mandarin oranges so it's kinda like have cranberries on Turkey near during thanksgiving   Their version of karage was surprisingly great!  Char Siew Pork Belly - pieces were great.  They were sweet and soft and came with hoisin,  Coconut Rice  had perfect flavor  Corn Fritters were hyped for me.  It was more about the sauce that made them interesting and you have to eat them right away.  Letting them sit for more than 5 minutes ruins the texture.  Smoked Beef Brisket was soft and amazing   Wonton Chips were also a bit hyped for me and they are VERY oily.  Potatoes were basic, but parents enjoyed them.  Singapore noodles are a solid crowd pleasure.  It's definitely a unique space with a kitchen that tries to be innovative.  It's definitely worth a shot.  Not all dishes are winners, but if you order enough you'll find something you like!"

                "description": "Cultural Culinary   The quick review is the food was excellent, craft beer ambiance, and dog friendly with outdoor seating.  I have driven along South Lamar for a long time but never stopped by.  My impression was it was too Asian for my wife where she may not like the taste.  After talking to my niece who ate there said we would definitely love it, so in looking for a new place to try Loro was on top of the list.  Built under huge oak trees Loro provides many seating options from bar, indoor, patio, and outdoor seating. It was a bit chilly so decided to sit at the bar noticing some sat outside under large heaters.  First you find your place to sit and then order at the bar.  It seemed to work well and gives that country bbq feel.   Taps of local brews were in front of me with decorations along the wall perhaps from a garage sale adding to the ambiance of Austin coolness. The menu was on a peg wood wall with old school lettering or scan the QR code using your phone. I ordered the Oak Smoked Salmon with Coconut Scented Rice. The bartender noted to return on either Sunday or Monday to try the Smoked Baby Back Duroc Pork Ribs where you will sing about it they next day.   We dressed Austin casual so not need for business attire or bow ties, and there seems to be quite a bit of parking even though saw a few arrive on e-scooters. The average age here is 20-30s which made me feel young here.   Looks like it's a place where the food is brought to you when ready, not sitting under a heat lamp. A side bowl was placed in front of me with a delicious looking piece of salmon in a puddle of some juice.  The rice was in a white takeout box. The salmon was extremely good and went along fine with my Live Oak Hefeweizen draft beer.  I was so tuned into my fish I forgot about the rice. I opened the little box and tasted it where it was very good too with a buttery taste. Forgot to ask for chopsticks but again lost all consciousness on enjoying my salmon. As for my wife she enjoyed the Oak Smoked Beef Brisket Sandwich where said the best she had tasted in a long while perhaps on our Texas Monthly BBQ tour.  Definitely added a pin on this place to my restaurant regular rotation where there are a few other menu items I need to try."

Yes the food is very high quality and is well sourced and prepared, however, I think that this restaurant has been so talked about and so highly regarded, I expected a lot more.  I got the smoked salmon rice bowl - the salmon didn't even taste like salmon, I felt like i was just eating smoked meat. The coconut rice is definitely a hit - I really like the nice sweetness to it. The rest of the bowl was a LOT of cilantro and pickled vegetables that didn't add much except take up space."

We also had the corn fritters and shared the chicken karaage (unfortunately not pictured because we devoured it) both equally great.   It was pretty chilly outside (Texas weather!) but the staff was working tirelessly to make sure the heaters were on for those of us waiting for a table. Such a great evening at Loro; we will be back!"

                "description": "The vibe of this place was great but we were really confused about the service/organization of things.   We came on a weekend evening and there were tons of people here. The parking situation was a bit confusing but we figured it out (there's WAY more parking than we thought there was). When we got to the line to check in, we got a buzzer so we could sit outside. We were told to not sit at any of the tables outside so we got some drinks at the bar outside and hung out outside on some chairs not near any of the tables. When our buzzer came, we went back inside only to be led outside to the tables and then told to order \"at the bar\". We were really confused if that meant the outdoor bar or the indoor bar and other people outside were confused as well. Turns out indoor bar was the right answer!  We ordered inside then came back out and awaited our food. We got everything except the corn fritters and had to remind the host about them. Overall, the food was good, but the chaos around the service didn't make the food worth it.   We liked the kale salad and the string beans. The corn fritters was a little too heavy for me (after all that waiting!)"

My friend and I ordered a couple of their plates from the HH menu to split and also two of their alcoholic slushee drinks.   What we got:  - corn fritters: in my opinion, the star of the show. They were so crispy on the outside and the inside was more chewy and had a nice bite.  - chicken burger: to be honest, I wasn't a fan of the seasoning on the chicken but my friend enjoyed it. - karage: these little fried chicken bites were crispy and yet still juicy. The cilantro topper helped provide a refreshing bite. - mango slushee: I believed this was mixed with sake but you really wouldn't be able to tell. Tasted like juice! - coffee slushee: this was the exact opposite of the mango one, the alcohol taste was strong but the coffee flavor was goo"

A taste of this and that with our family style lunch spread.

                "description": "TL;DR; Really quality food; cocktails are solid; service is nice with an interesting concept; cool vibes. Get the chicken karaage.  My husband and I came here for a date night on Saturday and had a great time. Seating was surprisingly easy (we got there around 6:30pm? We're seated at the bar within 5 minutes). We sat at the bar, which was nice because we didn't have to go up and order food/drinks (which is what you'd have to do if you are seated at a table). Bartender and service was nice and attentive, host was friendly but not annoying.   Originally, we came for drinks and try a few dishes to share, but everything sounded so go that we stuffed ourselves with too food to get to the drinks. I did try the Typhoon, which was pretty good. The frozen drinks looked good, but was too full of food to get one.  Would DEFINITELY come back for the food. We both got rice bowls (husband got the chopped smoked brisket and I got the char siew pork belly), the corn fritters, and chicken karaage. DO NOT SLEEP ON THE KARAAGE. So delicious--the sauce they drizzle on top is *chef's kiss*, the jalapeño aioli was a perfect pair, and it was super tender, juicy, and crisp all at the same time.  Corn fritters tasted great, only critique is that the sweet corn was SUPER sticky/gummy (stick to your teeth in every aspect)."

I stumbled upon the Austin Brewery Tours' website while searching on Yelp for ideas.   I had an awesome time exploring Austin's growing beer scene. I also had a great time meeting and making friends the other tourists on our tour.   I enjoyed all of the 3 breweries but the behind the scene tour at Independence Brewing Co. made it my favorite.   The price is very fair when you consider it includes your tastings and tips for your severs.   In a nutshell, a good alternative tour for those interested in the Austin craft beer scene."

                "description": "Apparently it's become a tradition that we do a brewery tour when we travel. One of the breweries I was told I MUST visit, while in Austin, was Jester King. Searched online for brewery tours that included this and finally decided on Austin Brewery Tours.  Almost daily tours, online booking was so easy, and we got a reminder, a couple of days earlier to our tour, via email.  Tour starts at noon.  Meetup time was 11:30am. At around 11:25am the van was there.  Out comes Shane, owner and tour guide. He immediately introduced himself, thanked us for being on time and proceeded to ask us our names and where we were from. Once the other people taking the tour arrived, we were all introduced and in the van we went.  During the time we were driving, he would ask us questions to get to know us better, and see the style of beers we liked. He also gave us an intro of each of the breweries we would visit. He made the time driving pass by fast and welcomed all questions we could have.  At each of the breweries, he explained the process and what we had included in the price of the tour. At Jester King, they even had a special release and he bought a sample of each (which was not included in the price but he gifted us with it) making sure we had the complete experience.    You can tell he enjoys doing these tours and meeting the people.   He even took us to Revolution - which was in front of one of the breweries we visited - to try locally made flavored gin.   So greateful he allowed us to do this quick stop - this was delicious, and gave me the opportunity to talk more with one of the ladies on the tour, exchanging ideas on recipes with the gin we had just tried.    Shane is grate at incorporating everyone in the tour and conversations.  He allows you plenty of time to enjoy each brewery and every beer you choose.   He is now friends with the staff at each of these breweries, which works on the advantage of everyone in the tour since we got excellent/ friendly service at each stop.  Best part of this all, is you meet new people, get to enjoy all the beer you can drink, and don't have to drive. Great way to spend a day in Austin.  If looking for a beer tour, look no further, this is it!"

No one In our group lived in Austin so it was good to get some info about the city and neighborhoods. The 3 breweries we stopped at were all unique from each other in size, atmosphere, and beers. At each stop you choose two beers to try which is great. We've been on other tours where you do not pick. We were given about an hour at each stop which was ample time. I would highly recommend this tour company!"

Of all the awesome people we met and food we ate, our guide Shane as well as the guys at the Lotus Joint food truck were freakin awesome!  SXSW had Austin jammed with a lot to do but Shane made sure we got to see Austin and its beer community like the locals do. He was insanely knowledgeable not just about beer but also about Texas. When you've solo traveled the world like he has, you gain a perspective that makes you far more relatable too which made him an all around cool guy to hangout with.  Most important.. The beers were phenomenal! (Try the goat tacos at Lotus also!)  In town for a day, a week, or a life time - Hands down recommend this for anyone in Austin!"

I was so pleased with the entire tour: Shane is an amazing host who took us around, shared lots of information about the area, along with the breweries. He was very friendly and ensured we had a good time. Even though it was about 1000 degrees outside, he kept the van cool and ensured we were cared for.  We had opportunities to not only sample excellent beers, but also visit several food trucks in the area. His rapport with the brewery owners gave us extra attention and really made us feel special.

His knowledge of beer in general along with his totally chill attitude and attention to every little detail ( making sure we had water along with our tastings to matching our individual tastes in selecting what we should explore ) was over the top customer experience!!!

Brooke was a wonderful tour guide, and she made good beer recommendations (especially considering that I'm not much of a beer drinker).   We did the Hill Country Tour and visited Jester King, Last Stand, and Skull Mechanix. Each tour had a tasting option (one where we all tasted beers as a group and the others where we each got to pick our own beers to try). After selecting beer to taste, we got to explore each brewery on our own before moving onto the next location. We had enough time to eat (plan on eating at Jester King. The food is awesome and we spent the most time there) and to drink at every place, while still getting to individually wander and see all that these breweries had to offer. We also got to take the Jester King tour, which is really cool.   I'd highly recommend an afternoon with Austin Brewery Tours!! Thank you Brooke for a great day!"

Tremendous job moving us from location to location while never making us feel rushed, so glad it wasn't on me to wrangle the guys when it was time to go :). Also, your beer recommendations were spot on! Same with your suggestions for things to do for the rest of the weekend.

We did three stops which gave us a good opportunity to try three different breweries without having to worry about driving, parking, or any of the attendant Logistics. The tour covers all expenses including tips which is a nice touch. You can tell that the tour is well organized and that the breweries appreciate the business. That means you end up getting much better service at all of the breweries than you sometimes get with such packages. The tour guide also is able to make excellent suggestions so if you don't have a lot of experience with craft beer this is a great way to learn. If you have any interest in a brewery tour while in Austin I highly recommend this tour."

                "description": "Another wonderful and flavorful dinner at El Monumento!  This has become our favorite place.  Their food is just straight up delicious- always. Had the enchilada trio in the suizas sauce; all of them excellent. And the beans cooked with bacon??  Holy hell- AMAZING.  Great sangria- get the carafe- makes sense and you will finish it.   Trevor was our waiter- what a fun guy.  Helpful, attentive and funny - loved him. Also- do yourself a favor and get the chocolate cream pie"

                "description": "I decided to come to Texas to visit two very dear friends of mine and they suggested this restaurant they're regulars at to have a good Mexican meal. To our dismay we had an awful experience dining here and had to cut it short. Before sitting to eat we had asked the hostess ahead of time if it was okay to sit on the patio with 2 service dogs. She said it was okay and sat us outside. A few minutes later a server came up to clarify and ask that the dogs were indeed service animals otherwise we'd have to leave and we confirmed they were. Then lastly we were approached by the general manager who came up to our table in the worst behavior out of everyone. She immediately spoke to us in a very rude manner and harshly said we have to leave immediately because of our dogs - after we had already ordered 3 drinks and just gotten our appetizers. We were very taken aback at her demeanor when she came up to us because there was no apology for the miscommunication, or spending $58 on food and drinks just to be kicked out, and wasting our time dining there for 30 minutes already and now needing to go drive somewhere else to have a proper meal. We had tried communicating with her how disruptive this was to our plans after multiple members of her staff had expressed the dogs were okay being there, but she wouldn't allow us a chance to speak and just talked over us stating that it didn't matter what any of the employees say and it is up to her. We still had our full drinks and asked if at least we could finish those first and wait for our food to be boxed to go, but she refused and said we had to exit the premises immediately with our dogs there. Keep in mind, I never go out of my way to leave negative reviews but this encounter was such an awful experience that I wanted future customers to be aware of the treatment from the management here, because I personally wouldn't want to support a company that doesn't care for their guests like we experienced.   P.S.  As we exited the restaurant we came across this sign up front of the entry door stating that no pets were allowed but service animals trained to aid disabled persons are ok? If service dogs are not allowed this sign should have been removed because it is very misleading."

                "description": "Dropped in for some frozen margaritas and some apps. From the outside the place looks pretty appealing, nice outdoor patio and courtyard area and with a slightly rustic feel.  Ordered some frozen margs and was more like a marg with crushed ice on the top, not exactly frozen.  Apps/quesadilla was alright, nothing to write home about but did the job.  Could see myself dropping in to see if the experience or foods and drinks change at all. First impression is it looks like it has potential but doesn't deliver."

                "description": "Second time coming here and it's a bit of a mixed bag. The staff is excellent, we were seated quickly and chips and two salsas brought out promptly.  I ordered a specialty margarita on the rocks and it was just ok.  The table ordered the chicken fajitas, enchiladas and carnitas plate. The fajitas were overcooked and dry. The edges were burnt and the onions and peppers were sliced way too thin and were over cooked as well. The portion was very small from my last visit, but shrinkflation huh?? The enchiladas were very good and the carnitas were the favorite. The charro beans were awesome. The rice was bland and one dimensional and the street corn was overly sweet. The salsa was flavorful but at least one needs a little more heat. The restaurant itself is really cool and clean. I will definitely go back but on a different night maybe try a different dish and drink"

                "description": "The food I got was not good, and borderline just plain bad. Beans watery, sour cream sauce slimy, rice tasted like cardboard. I liked the Brussels sprouts and the chocolate cake, but why would I go to a Mexican restaurant for those?  I liked our waitress a lot, as we were a big party and she did her best. But I just can't stand it when water isn't refilled timely, especially since I needed to wash down the nasty flavors I was consuming."

                "description": "We ate at El Monumento last night.  The venue is really nice, but the quality of the food doesn't match the way the place looks.  My wife had the shrimp asada and I had the beef asada and neither was very good.  The beef was really dry and overcooked.  I would have returned it, but the service was so slow and sporadic that I didn't know if I would get it back before everyone was ready to leave.  Cocktails were the best part of the experience, but not enough of a reason to go back.  This place isn't cheap either...they need to drastically improve food quality.  A Mexican restaurant in Texas that can't cook carne asada should make some serious changes asap."

                "description": "My husband and I are from the DFW area in North Texas and decided to visit here while leaving our Airbnb in Georgetown. We found out the place did not open until 3pm on a Sunday so we waited 10 mins in the parking lot. We noticed a large amount of cars and people started pulling in and waiting in line at the door! We thought that we needed to get out then and wait too. Right at 3pm, the doors opened, and waiters were lined up waiting to seat everyone. We snagged a great spot on the patio by the river. We only came for drinks and appetizers. We were happy to learn that happy hour was taking place from 3-6pm. Happy hour means you take $2 off most drinks and appetizers. It is a little disappointing you have to purchase chips and salsa, but it was only $1.50 with their happy hour special. The margaritas are very strong! The chicken flautas were so crispy and yummy. There is a type of cabbage slaw/salad that is served on top that adds extra flavor. The chips were extremely golden and crunchy, cooker to perfection. Their salsa is OK but you have two different once's (a red and green avocado). Overall the scenery is beautiful inside and out. Service overall is fantastic. I would visit here frequently if I was a local!"

                "description": "Passed this place a handful of times and decided to try it out. There's plenty of street parking nearby if the lot is full. Seating was quick for a party of three on a Wednesday night. They do take reservations so keep that in mind if you have a larger party.    ORDER  Chicken Flautas (start) Nachos (cut) Chips and Salsa (bench) Tres Leches   Food Flautas were good as were the chips and salsa. Nachos were surprising as the toppings were added to the chips and they're not the style where you can dip the chips. Not the style I'm used to but could be good for anyone trying to portion control.   Overall This would be a great place to take your out-of-town visitors because the service is good and the setting. I'd come back again and check out the bar area."

                "description": "Figured it was about time that I reviewed El Monumento. I went there for the first time a few months ago and it instantly became one of my favorite places to go for happy hour. I often try to switch it up and I pride myself in trying new fun places, but I'm a sucker for a nice patio and tasty drinks and El Monumento has both.  They also accept reservations and they have plenty of parking, so two thumbs up. We always order the queso flameado, the chicken flautas, the barbacoa street tacos and the quesadillas. Their tres leches is absolutely amazing so make sure you save room for dessert. I've liked all the drinks that I've tried and their monthly special drinks are always fun and innovative. The service has been decent every time we've been there. Nothing special, but nothing to complain about either."

                "description": "Haven't had a chance to return to El Monumento since Covid and didn't know what to expect but the four of us may have had our best meal there ever. We got a reservation a little earlier than normal so we could take in the Christmas lights on the nearby Georgetown square.  Paige was our server and she did a great job. She was very attentive but didn't rush us. We started with chips and salsa, followed closely by the queso flameato, gooey and yummy .  Our meals included tortilla soup, shrimp chili relleno, street tacos and one of the special plates. Needless to say we waddled out... Our experiences in the past were a little inconsistent but this time they were right on point. Looked like there were enough employees to take care of the good crowd they had. It was fairly noisy though. Lots of families and groups.  Thanks Paige, keep up the good work! As I'm prone to say when it's appropriate, this is a repeater! Happy Holidays fellow Yelpers!"

My favorite part about this restaurant is the outdoor seating and ambiance. It's relaxing, quiet shaded, and you can see the water below.   The service has always been pretty good, no complaints there.   The food is very good and the drinks too, their cucumber/jalapeno margaritas are perrrrfecccct.   I agree with many of the other reviews, it's much pricier than its competitors for very comparable tasting food. Post covid, you even have to pay for chips and salsa- which is unusual at a mexican restaurant."

The train had plenty of free snacks and we had our open table to play cards on the way up and back.  The Crew Chief even stopped by to give us some history on the different train cars which we really enjoyed.  It was a cold, rainy day but we still enjoyed the views on the way up and back and had a ton of fun exploring Burnet. We stopped by the Warehouse BBQ for lunch and also grabbed a coffee in town as well!  Well worth the trip and an overall fun experience!"

I booked that groupon for the North Flyer as my kids are in love with trains so this would be a nice treat for them.  They enjoyed Santa and the hot chocolate, I didn't mind the scenery as it was pretty.  Santa, Mrs. Claus, and the story telling was only for a few minutes of the 2 hour ride.    The biggest issue is, I really thought the ride will be in motion for the most part.  I know there are stops but it really felt like we moved for 30 minutes and sat still for the rest o the trip.  It was really annoying and boring to just be sitting for most of the two hours on the train.  In fact, I believe you don't even leave the small town of where the train first left.    They should consider playing Christmas music (I saw speakers on the train) to keep people entertained if we are going to be sitting for 90% of the time.  Overall this trip didn't feel worth it for the price we paid.  2 stars~"

The train was actually pretty cool, I've never been in a proper train before, I mean, it was old fashioned but still just a really really cool experience. We paid for the private suite and it was worth it, we also walked throughout the train which was a bit old west feeling. My favorite part was walking between cars to see the view unencumbered by windows.   We walked through all the cars (like most people on the train did) to see what the other cars were like. The giftshop car was the nicestest with big windows and plenty of room to walk around while balancing yourself on a rocking and rolling moving train.   Some of the private rooms give you an idea of what is was really like to ride a train across country with a sleeper car, teeny tiny shower, and narrow hallways. It was such a great experience.   Not sure why people complain about the views because mine were fantastic! I mean, c'mon. We live in Texas not Denver. I know what the hill country looks like. There's no mountains but where the hills meet the sky is expansive. It was beautiful."

                "description": "Easy to book your tickets online. Usually depart on time. Cart sections depends on price range. Very family friendly.  You pick up tickets on a building near by (about 25 meters). You just give your name and how many in your party and you'll get your tickets. Once you get your tickets, you'll walk to where the train is located, show your tickets and they will direct you to your cart. Once you find your seat/section...relax and enjoy the ride! The view to Borne is very relaxing and enjoyable. The train does provide drinks and snacks and some alcohol. Mask as of Jan 22, 2022 is required during the train ride. Bathrooms are located throughout various train carts."

                "description": "Full disclosure - I love trains, so I may be a bit biased around this experience. Having taken lots of scenic trains in Colorado/the West, I can see where some would be disappointed by the views provided on this ride - the route follows a state highway and what was probably pastures 20+ years ago is now developed as Austin sprawls outwards. The main selling point on this train is just getting to enjoy the most fun mode of transportation out there - a train! We don't often find ourselves in situations where we get to relax and enjoy a train ride, so any opportunity to do so is a winner in my book. However, there are some small improvements that could be made to the train cars/experience that I think would help overall: clean the windows both inside and out, re-upholster the seats, and add in PA voice-over announcements to give some brief history of the train line/cars instead of the volunteer attendant trying to yell it at a busy car. The time in Burnet is fine, we packed a picnic and enjoyed it at a park nearby the town square. Overall, I am glad to have done the Hill Country Flyer experience from Cedar Park to Burnet, but would say to manage expectations in terms of scenery."

                "description": "I liked my visit! I paid for the Cedar Park to Burnett ride. It's about 6.5 hours including a 2 hour stop in Burnett. I paid $60 per person for one of the more expensive carts the Rippling Stream one of the Adults Only lounges. And I'm glad I did. My cart had a lot of complimentary refreshments to choose from. And since we only had 10 people in my cart we pretty much had as many drinks as we wanted. I will admit we were the youngest people in our cart. So our fellow ride goers had higher expectations and were pretty disappointed with the look and feel of the train. But my boyfriend and I haven't experienced something like this before so we were excited and happy for the ride. So everything was new and great. I feel we're prepared for longer, faster train rides now. I really liked being in a cart with less people. We got to know almost everyone and we had great conversations. Daniel was absolutely amazing. His love for trains showed. And he was great to have conversations with. Great guy who answered everyone's questions and concerns.  We toured the entire train and it's nice seeing the other carts. There are definitely way more seats in the others. And they're nice too. My picture below was taken in one of the carts I toured in. (I only have videos of the one I was actually in). I will admit the city of Burnett didn't have much to see or do. I purposely brought my own food. After researching some menus I gave up on vegan options. Which is normal in small towns. It's a VERY small town. The best part was the little show the city of Burnett put on for us. The actors were great, friendly, and funny. A really great crew and was happy to watch their show. We were very tired by the time we had to get back on the train. We board at 8:15 and start the ride at 9. Because of waking up early and walking around the small town we pretty much fell asleep when the excitement died down. If you've been on a train before you might have high expectations. But if not and love new experiences and trying new things I think you'll really like this trip. I really enjoyed it. Thank you to all the volunteers for making this trip absolutely amazing."

I was disappointed in the destination but not the ride.

                "description": "Booked a sunset train ride for my husband and I and it was such a fun experience! We loved all the fun facts the volunteers had to share about the train cars and lifestyles of some of the riders back 100+ years. The sunset was magical and the night portion of the ride was really neat, having the moonlight illuminate the tracks in front of us. One of the cars is a dedicated gift shop/concession stand with a variety of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages to choose from. Everyone we came in contact with was so kind and made the experience that much more memorable. Overall such a great time - we would definitely book this experience again!"

                "description": "We had a great time on the Beer Train last night that was advertised as a sunset tour that was 2.5 hours long.  Note that you have about 45 mins moving time, then 40 mins stopped for the engine to be brought from the back to the front and then 45 mins back again. You don't really see much of the sunset, and you aren't moving for 2.5 hours. They also assign seats ahead of time, some of the cars were nicer and louder than others, so just depends what you're looking for. The association was responsive on social media when I had questions, staff and crew on board were all very friendly. They dont really follow any of their own posted rules about masks, no personal coolers, etc. so just something to be aware of- but I think this also varied by car. Overall we had a great time and would go again!"

Dirty cars, dirty seats, dirty windows with bleak scenery outside and Santa who gives a broken whistle. That is all for 2 hours trip. Even an obsessed with trains 4 years old was bored.  If you decide to go don't forget to take a mask or a respirator, it's hard to breathe inside because of dust."

Fortunately for me the plague was in top form. Was in the area looking for sustenance and 'Steam Train Association' showed on the map so I figured to pop in for a quick viddy before lunch. pulled up on a nearly empty lot, a shackled gate, and a locked door, the sign had the now common 'Closed for Plague' message which softened the blow of discovering \"...that the train and rail yard are not open for public tours or photography\" which meant the entirety of the museum was contained in the double-wide corner space in the strip. There's nothing inherently wrong with scenic train rides on vintage rolling stock, I've done it before and it's OK but that's just not my cup of meat. I was here for a bit of museuming but there was no museum to be had - nor postcarding nor touchable cars nor engines :-( sad face"

                "description": "My husband and I went on the Hill Country Flyer for our anniversary weekend and we were in the \"Rippling Stream\" train car. The Train itself is quite impressive and was my first time on a real train not subway. The First Class Coach option was really nice and the seats were spread out along with social distancing, we felt really comfortable. My only complaint was it was VERY cold outside and though they are climate controlled, it was really cold the first half of the ride - coming back was much more comfortable. I also wished the lay over time perhaps had been 3 hours to provide a little more browsing time in Burnet. It would be cute to do music in each train car from the era the train was made. Ours was built in the late 30's so it would be a nice little touch that's simple to do! They had complimentary snacks and drinks which was a plus. Can't wait to do it again in a private suite!"

                "description": "This was an excellent experience. We took the train from Bertram to Burnet for one of the special events (Wedding Oaks wine trip). The staff was friendly and seemed very knowledgeable about the history of each train car. If you have a chance to walk to the very last car and look out the back, I definitely recommend taking in that view. I would have loved to take a longer trip and will look for other chances to ride.  The website is a little hard to use. We would have really liked a private cabin for our trip but didn't see how to book that on the website.   I wish the volunteer in our car would have been a little less Chatty Cathy when we weren't talking about the ride. It was a bit of a distraction from our enjoyment of the ride. Also, riding during COVID was a bit out of our comfort zone already so we were sad to see at least two volunteers wearing their masks covering only their mouth, not their mouth and nose. The website goes into great detail about precautions and that is a basic one not being taken. (That being said, they did a great job with social distancing and I felt like the train was very clean.)"

                "description": "Enjoyed my first ASTA experience today.  Here's my recap:  - Purchased a First Class Lounge ticket so I had my own room in Rippling Stream  - Train left the station on time, arrived at Burnet on time, and left for Cedar Park on time.   We were only an hour late reaching Cedar Park because a car thought it could outrun the train, but it could not.  Once the accident reporting was complete the train resumed.   - Personal note:  I am a train nerd and love riding trains, so my threshold of being annoyed on a train is higher than most.  This will affect my review below.    THE GOOD:  - clean cars, fun to walk in between them, and if you're without children, the adults only first class cars are a must - Rippling Stream and Nambe.   Otherwise with kids, I would recommend the Maurice Beckham or Eagle Cliff.    - the trip itself is smooth and the volunteers are friendly and helpful.  You can tell they enjoy being there, informing and helping others.     - Burnet has an abundance of antique shops if that's you're thing.  Also the soups at the downtown coffee shop are wonderful.     - The shootout show in Burnet, while not having a worry about winning any acting awards, is fun for the kids and has a good ending.  They could trim some of the fat from it, and make it a more concise / engaging story - there were a few too many awkward pauses.  But I applaud the folks who are likely doing this for free.  And the kids loved it.     THE NOT SO GOOD  - The scenic ride - if you're from the area this should not come as a shocker - is not that scenic.  There's a great bridge over the San Gab river but otherwise it's unremarkable trees, backyards, roads, and strip malls.    But again, none of this bothers me that much because I'm on a train relaxing.    - Burnet:  This is a sleepy, very conservative town.  One sign to deter thieves in a store said, \"We got an alarm.  We got video.  We got guns.  DON'T BE DUMB.\"    While the downtown is a short walk from the train station, 2.5 hours here is way too much time unless you love antiques.   There isn't much else.   And as far as lunch goes, I highly recommend walking a bit farther past the first couple restaurants or else you'll have long wait times.   I went to a deli just a couple blocks away and it had no line.      - Announcements:  there are few.  Nothing along the way to alert you to landmarks or scenic opportunities (there is really just one, the bridge over the river).   But it would be nice to hear more than the pre recorded departure / arrival ones.    - The warm soft drinks:  no one wants green tea or apple juice at room temp.  There was literally an ice bucket next to these (but for scoping ice).  A second one to put these beverages on ice would go a long way.    - Lack of variety in snacks:  for a first class experience, at least more than the mini lemon cakes and mini cinnamon rolls would be nice.  Some savory, perhaps?   - chairs in the RS lounge car are what you'd find at your local dentist's waiting room.  I expected something that would at least remain comfy for 1.5 hours at a time.      OVERALL. - for the price I paid, it's 4/5 stars.  I knew the scenery wasn't going to awe, so most of my ranking is based on the train experience inside.  The quibbles above are all minor; chill the drinks, add some pretzels, get someone to donate an old leather chair or 2, and be a bit more chatty with us.    Those who really ranked their train ride low usually fall into the following categories, so please take them with a grain of salt:  - a/c sucked because it was Austin in the summer (hopefully fixable but not all that surprising) - solution is to go when it's not hot, the 60 days out of the year it's under 99 degrees.  I also think they have ironed out most of the a/c issues by now.    - Burnet was terrible, Burnet food was terrible, etc.  It's Burnet.  There's a reason it's not as well known as Fredericksburg.  You walk a bit father to get away from the crowds, you cross check their list of lunch spots they give you when you board  with a quick glance of Yelp reviews and you roll the dice.    - scenery sucked, super ghetto, etc.   Maybe because I grew up in St Louis, but using the word ghetto here is laughable at best.  It's junky, yes.  Unkempt, sure.   And truly, if you live in the region, you should know better than to expect breathtaking views.  You've driven on 183 east of 35?.  Same views.   If you're from out of town I could see valid point here since the website pushes it hard that it's scenic - but us locals know how much lipstick you can put on this pig.   So go check it out!  But go First Class if possible.  And be flexible about being home on time; like with any train, delays can happen."

                "description": "We rode the Hill Country Flyer which departs from the Cedar Park station and goes to Burnet, Texas,  where there is a two-hour layover so that passengers can disembark, do some shopping or grab some lunch or both.   Before leaving, the Burnet Gunfighters put on a show which is free to passengers, although they do accept donations.   The scenery leaves a lot to be desired, however that is not something that the Steam Train Foundation can control, they have a designated track and can not control who builds subdivisions or places gravel pits along the route.   If you are looking for a beautiful scenic ride, this probably isn't for you.  However, if you want to experience riding on a passenger train, and learning about the history of the railroads, it is a great experience.     They are very careful with social distancing and we felt completely safe riding the train.  I spoke with a couple of families that had young children and they loved it!   All in all, I would recommend it as a very enjoyable way to spend the day."

                "description": "I rode the Sunset Express on 5-29-21 with my family, while on a trip to visit Austin. I'm from Southern California (this is important later). The scenery was certainly nice in some spots, but not enough. The sunset was awesome, but the experience wasn't that great. We paid for first class and rode aboard Eagle Cliff. Some basic drinks and snacks were provided, but the train was understaffed. No attendant for our car. One very sweet elderly volunteer was doing her best to handle two cars at once. I decided to offer to help, which she was very appreciative of. She said it was great that I wanted to help and so I did. I helped stock drinks and snacks as well as stocked ice to keep the drinks cold. Later on, a female volunteer who looked to be in her 40s came up to the counter said \"Sir, you cannot be back there, what do you need?\" I explained the situation, and she kind of had an attitude. I was informed in a rude tone that I had to be a member to help, and was given no thank you. Being that I live in Southern California, there's no way I could really be a member. While all this was happening, the AC in the car was doing a very poor job at keeping the car cold. It was unbearably hot in there, and everyone in the car was complaining. The excuse given was that the car is vintage and has a lot of runtime. The car was very original, and you could tell. That roughly translates to \"we don't have the money or people to keep this car in tip top shape, and we don't have the money to upgrade it\".  Eventually, my family was re-seated to the Rippling Stream. That was much better, but it didn't change the overall experience. Cherry on top was we were over an hour late returning to the Cedar Park station.   Not worth the money."

                "description": "We also did the Xmas Polar Express train ride. Tickets were about $50 each. We also went with a friend and their kids too.   I'll give this train ride 4 stars. The kids were excited to see Santa and the ride was slow at times.   To start, one of the first things was a balloon guy. Ours was awesome. He was funny and overall entertaining. He had me laughing my @ss off.   Next came hot chocolate... it's hot chocolate.   After that was, singing Christmas Carols. They had 2 girls from McNeil high school. I felt sorry for them. They were nice, but they couldn't just get our car interested in singing.  A few of us sang, but overall it was a failure. I'm sure adult beverages if allowed/served would help the spirit. Great job to them but our car was mostly interested. It probably didn't help that they gave us a cookie just before they arrived so everyone was stuffing their face.   After that was story time, the lady reading the Story was animated and funny. Kudos to her.   She visited just before Santa.   Then Santa came. We were in one of the last cars so his visit was a bit rushed. He was nice and gave everyone a wooden train whistle.   ***********The entire operation is run by volunteers. So I'd like to thank all of them for their time!*******  This was he first time my son was not afraid of Santa:-)"

                "description": "This review is based on my customer service experience with Zena, not the train ride itself (although I may come back and give an update!)  Zena is a lifesaver. Not literally, but she has made my train experience 2x as good. I bought a Groupon because I didn't even realize there was a train experience in Austin. After the headache of scheduling, our trip got canceled. Zena came in to save the day. She mailed me another gift certificate that expired in a year (vs the next week per my Groupon) AND she gifted us a little extra!  Sounds great, right? Unfortunately, the GC could not be redeemed online. After multiple tries of calling in (and getting a forever ring - no pick up), I was getting irritated.   I emailed Zena back asking for her advice. She wrote back in 24 hours and apologized for their phone service. She even offered to reserve me herself. After a few back-and-forth emails, she answered all my questions and got us all squared away.  Our train ride happens this weekend and I can only hope that the experience is similar to Zena's customer service."

                "description": "You never know where your gonna find a distillery and or brewery these days. Yep folks, it's another #carclublife post. The club along with friends from Dallas and San Antonio headed east after the Texas Independence Day Parade. Libation education started at Derelict Airship AKA Violet Crown Spirits just west of Bastrop.   You've hear of strip mall chic? Think business park chic! Quite similar to my friends over at Desert Door in Driftwood. Matt was an excellent host explaining the history behind each of their offerings. Let's start with Absinthe. Banned for many years in the US and parts of Europe, small batch distilleries have been popping up in the US since 2007.   The anise flavor is quite strong and it's recommended you cut it with water. I've heard sugar cubes are common as well. Other in house offerings include an Elderflower and Jasmine Liqueur. Girlfriend and I's personal favorite was the Jasmine and we took home a bottle to pair up with other local spirits. A top notch experience from start to finish. Our group is excited to see this company grow. See y'all soon!"

We were able to sample the whole line of products and learned a lot about their process and the history behind absinthe and the Violet Crown Spirits. Worth a trip if you're in Bastrop or driving through!"

                "description": "Our first time dining here.  We were impressed with the food. The ingredients were very fresh.  Although the restaurant says classy attire don't let that deter you from trying it out. It's in a resort so resort wear is appropriate. Some people even wore jeans and shorts. Would we come back to this restaurant during our next stay at Lost Pines? Yes!  Appetizer: baked brie (7/10) with candied pecans   Entree:  Kid's filet with Mac and cheese- 8/10. The filet was perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked.   Chilean Seabass with Duck and Brussels sprout leaves - 8/10  Waygu ribeye with truffle butter - 8/10. Steak was pretty good and perfectly cooked.   Dessert:   Kid's chocolate gelato - 5/10 slightly icy and had orange rinds in there I think. My daughter didn't want fancy ice cream and didn't like the taste  Banana's foster cheesecake - 7/10"

                "description": "Worst steak of my life. I'm not kidding. I have blood pressure issues and am not used to salt, so I rarely think something is under-seasoned. This was by far the most bland under-seasoned steak I've ever had. It also has zero sear. It truly was like eating a boiled steak. I'm so mad at myself for not sending it back, but there is always the fear you will get your food spit in. So disappointing because it was my friend's birthday dinner and her snapper was also bland. Do better Stories! A steak that had zero sear shouldn't have left the kitchen when it costs $68!"

                "description": "Over priced but doesn't surprise me because it's a restaurant at a hotel. Ordered the Chilean sea bass $45 a la carte and it was served on top of this cherry or raspberry sweet sauce, omg horrible! Those two flavors don't go together. The sea bass was cooked perfect and very tasty!   Tuna appetizer was good. The shrimp cocktail still had some of the shell on it, very disappointing!   Jason ordered the filet and he said it was pretty good.   Loved the mushrooms.   Good wine list but way over priced.  Creme brûlée: no vanilla so it's tasteless. The custard part is too thick and not creamy and smooth like a custard."

                "description": "We got a set menu that came with a salad appetizer, entree, shared sides and a dessert. The salad was a simple green salad with blackberries and corn bread croutons. There was too much dressing though. The salad was pretty standard but the corn bread croutons was a nice twist. The salmon was amazing. I believe it was partially broiled because it was unbelievably moist but the skin was crisp. This was probably my favorite part of the meal. The dessert was a chocolate bomb with peanut butter mousse inside. It was rich and decadent, and delicious. The food was really good, but my major complaint was the service. It was a slow and they mixed up our orders and forgot my cocktail. If you have the time to relax then that might not be too bad but this three course meal was spread over almost three hours."

We had salmon, \"risotto\" (yes, in quotes), and chicken. All horrible. We left in disappointment and went downstairs to the bar hopping that a good Old Fashion would make us forget the bad experience. I'm sad to report, they have no clue how to make an Old Fashion either.  We are wishing we didn't come to this overprice, low standards place.   Save your money, go eat somewhere else.  UPDATE:  The bartender Justin downstairs was very nice about the Old Fashion and asked for feedback. He surprised us all when he came back with a much improved version after Googling the recipe. Great Job Justin!! Thanks for getting our drinks right!!"

So, I sent it back for the third time and came out medium well though I wanted it well done. Also, the sides we ordered were cold and they took it back to the kitchen and re-heated it up. Who does that? Ive been to many steak houses and this is the first place that's done that. Not happy with the food and service here."

We came to this restaurant with expectations that it would be as good or better and were very disappointed. The service was slow and the food was mediocre. For $50 plates that don't come with sides, I feel like I should be impressed. My sea bass was cooked nicely, but lacking any flavor. The Brussels spouts that accompanied it were burnt. My husband's chicken was overcooked. We will stick with the food truck next time as their tacos are $4.50 each and AMAZING!"

                "description": "We stayed at Lost Pines this weekend and had reservations for dinner at Stories Fine Dining at 8:15pm which we had tried to move up a little earlier but were told that they were fully booked. We walked over a little earlier just to stay nearby and checked in with the hostess. She was very nice and even walked over to us and said our table was ready so we were able to be seated at 8pm. Upon walking in, only half of the restaurant had guests seated. The other half of the tables were empty...but we couldn't move up our reservation? Ok. We were seated and greeted shortly by our server who was very friendly as well. She took our drink and appetizer order which came out promptly however my husband ordered a bottle of wine and somehow that took about 15 minutes to arrive as well. We were seated next to a table of 4 who was very \"vocal\" which kind of ruined the atmosphere (this isn't the restaurant's fault however it did affect our experience) so I will refer to the as the \"vocals\". Finally, we were able to order our entrees. Once ordered, our bread basket came out at the same time as our appetizer and the food runners were pretty attentive and quick as well with refilling water, asking if we'd like more bread, etc. We nibbled on our appetizers and got lost in conversation until we realized our food had not arrived yet. Checked the time, 9:15pm. \"Vocal\" table next to us had already complained loudly about the A/C in the restaurant and at this point had started to complain about the service and why their food had not come out yet either. (Let me just also emphasize that when I say \"vocal\", I mean obnoxiously loud enough that the guests from across the restaurant turned their heads in attention). They complained about the service to the manager on duty as well who was apologetic and served them with comp'd cocktails and who knows what else. Needless to say, their entrees quickly came out. Meanwhile at our table, our bread plates had been stacked up, empty bread baskets were on the table and still no entrees. Time check: 9:30pm. At this point, the kids are getting restless and still have not eaten and no one had checked on us in over 30 minutes so we asked if they could at least check on the kids' food. They said they would and disappeared once again. Servers continue to walk by without having cleared our table and running food to other tables. One of the guys from the \"vocals\" has now stood up and beckoned the manager one more time to announce that his food was cooked incorrectly. One more time check for kicks: 9:50pm. Still no updates from the staff on the hold up. We have been seated for almost 2 hours with no entrées. At this point,  with strong understanding and empathy for the staff who has had to deal with the drama at the table next door, we quietly called over the manager and server to ask if we can just cancel our food. The kids needed to be fed, my in-laws were exhausted and we were all losing our appetite with the lack of service. The manager apologized for the delay and asked if he could pack up our food for us and we kindly declined and said we would just pay for what we actually ate/drank. He turned to the server and said, \"Take their card.\" Then walked away. That was the last we heard from his that evening. With heads down in disappointment, we quietly packed up our troops just in time for the \"vocals\" to turn their heads and complain about something new.   We walked down to McDade's where we knew food was ready to serve and we could quickly buy something for the kids. I'm baffled by the experience we had at Stories considering it's supposed to be a Fine Dining experience and hope that this evening was addressed within their staff as a learning experience to find some improvement in service and management."

                "description": "Reading some of the reviews, I honestly think management took the critiques to heart and did some great changes.  I've eaten at some nice restaurants (see other reviews) so I know what good service and food is.  From the lobster bisque and wagu steak to the dessert, it was fantastic.  Great drinks and service was great!    And equally nice, the place is too pricey for families with screaming kids to dine at, usually, so it's a GREAT respite from the zoo this place turns in to in the summer.  Not a bad thing (all the families), but a break from the noise is a nice change.  Would be really nice if it was cooler to sit on the outside deck.  Will try that out when back here in the fall."

We arrived 15 minutes early and were spoken to so rudely.  There was even a comment made about closed toe shoes.  WTH.  This is a vacation resort.  They obviously were trying to pass off the restaurant as some over the top fancy place and treated us like barefoot peasants.  This should never happen in the service industry at an upscale resort."

                "description": "I'm shocked this place has such a high star rating. I've been coming to Lost Pines for years and finally decided to try the Fine Dining restaurant since our kiddo is a teenager, but we quickly wished we had eaten at Shellers. The atmosphere is generic hotel/airport restaurant blandness. We ordered drinks which took a good 20 minutes. After we ordered entrees they brought bread and the chef sent out an amuse bouche which turned out to be the best of our choices. Our food took another 45 minutes which was so long considering we had an 8pm reservation. My son ordered the buffalo steak which came out cold. He had eaten several bites when I tried it and was surprised at the temperature. Yikes! Cold steak is not good. I ordered the risotto and I saw it had vegetables but it was literally dripping with vegetables and beets on top which made it a red color after a few bites. Not sure who thought that was a good idea. Risotto should be light and fluffy and not soggy. My husband had a salad and the lobster bisque but the bisque had a weird scorched flavor and he didn't eat that either. We were just ready to go by then because it was so late and I was still hungry. The waiter was nice enough but didn't even acknowledge the fact that we didn't eat our food. I cannot recommend this restaurant except if you're just trying to escape the loud atmosphere at Shellers or Firewheel. But for the price I'd rather eat at Shellers and keep an extra $100 for myself. Hyatt could do much better!"

Staff was wonderful and amazingly attentive. More about them later...  Drink and wine menu was not necessarily large but plenty of good choices at all price ranges. Staff very knowledgable as well.  Menu is limited but more than enough choices for every taste. I much prefer this than those over the top menus that offer everything under the sun.   Deconstructed Cesar salad was very good and light, great start. Chef sent over and delightful Amuse that was very tasty as well. Breads were great.   For proteins both my wife and I went for fish, Scottish salmon and poached halibut. Excellent on both counts, moist and tender, seasoned great. Blue corn grits was VERY tasty.   Desserts were spot on as well.   Back to the staff now...they could not have done a better job.  The attention to their customers throughout the restaurant was fun to watch. Always there when needed, and always with a smile. I wish more high end restaurants would follow this model."

There's at least one steak, seafood, lamb and chicken dish available every night.  Not only are the dishes beautiful and delicious, you will also get full.  I must also mention, I thoroughly enjoyed their gellato.  The staff is knowledgeable and bring plenty of hospitality.  $25-$40 per person is reasonable for what you get here."

                "description": "It took over an hour for our steaks to arrive after our appetizers so clearly our ticket was lost or something. The waiter never said anything but a gnocchi was delivered to our table at 45 minutes with a \"sorry\" but neither of us like cream based dishes so I would have preferred they ask us if there was something we wanted while we waited and it would have been nice to receive it at minute 25, not minute 45. My boyfriend's steak was definitely medium rare when he asked for medium but we didn't send it back as we were worried it would take another hour. $16 for 3 shrimp in a shrimp cocktail!  The dessert menu is laughable with 3 items. So a 2 1/2 hour dinner that should have taken 1 1/2 and a $220 bill. I'm giving it a 2 as the hamachi appetizer was wonderful and my filet (although significantly late) was delicious."

From my experience, those with fancy good reputations are usually the miss, while those that are unassuming and quaint are hit.   Stories at Hyatt Lost Pines resort is hit. From the decor, to the menu, to the presentation, everything here is top notch.  The chef has many creative options on the menu, but the veal chop was my choice. Perfect.  We also ordered red velvet cake that was imprisoned behind a ghastly cage of chocolate. Also, perfect.

                "description": "This restaurant is located in the Hyatt Lost Pines Resort in Bastrop just east of the Airport off 71. I highly recommend this place for a special occasion diner and since it is located in a 5 star resort plan on spending the night..  The ambiance is very elegant with a vaulted ceiling and wood tables  spaced far apart for privacy.  The servers were always there but not not close enough to eavesdrop..  And the food oh the food is out of this world goodness.  We tried several dishes but my favorites were the Salmon with Horseradish crust, Truffled mashed Potatoes and my glass of Frogs Leap Merlot.  Guys if you want to get lucky on the first date I highly recommend this place -  restaurant + beds = great fun!"

The building was nice, but wasn't what I was expecting.   The vibe here is great. A lot of young professionals clearly \"working from home\" but needed to get out of the house for a few hours. Very friendly customers and staff.   I ordered a vanilla latte and it came out wonderful. They had an awesome selection of beers on tap if that's your thing.   If I am in the area I will definitely be back for a visit."

I was pleasantly surprised when I was able to order right away! I got an iced cinnamon sugar latte with almond milk which came out to about $6.25. The price is a little steep, but the flavor and milk substitute added about $2.   The coffee came out relatively fast and was pretty good! The cinnamon was subtle, but the coffee was smooth and rich. My fiancé and I both enjoyed it! I don't know if I would come out of my way for this coffee, but if I was in the area I would definitely stop by again!   The location is convenient and there are other businesses on the same strip to try out as well. I would recommend coming here and getting some coffee to go!"

Cappuccino was good but little thin, coffee was pretty good, cinnamon roll was just ok.  Overall, definitely worth a visit and really appreciate the way they're handling the business in pandemic!"

The outdoor seating is very spacious but it's pretty loud with the cars zooming past us.   The pumpkin spice latte was okay. Not amazing. My friend says her cappuccino is just like any other.  The WiFi is solid. There are real and fake outlets (literally a sticker on the wall lol). It's a nice place to work or study. I like the temperature and the music is an okay volume.   I'd come back!"

                "description": "Not a fan of leaving a bad review for a nice place, but I think I may have been served slightly off dairy milk here today (I'm not sick, but the taste was bad). I've been here a few times over the past years and it's a really cute, quiet spot for working. Today however I was served a matcha latte with a really funky taste to it. It seemed like the matcha powder used just sat in a thick later on top of the (1%) milk, without being well combined, and the milk tasted a little off to be honest. I regret not saying something but I think I attributed the taste to the matcha mixing issue at the time. The person I went with had a coffee which tasted fine, but used a different (dairy) milk from mine. Really a shame since my drink was so bad from the first sip, we just ended up leaving. Sorry stouthaus!"

It's pretty small inside, so if it's cold outside I wouldn't plan on finding a seat, but their patio is a nice addition with a beer garden feel. It is right off the highway though so don't go expecting a nice view of trees, but with the right company I don't think that really matters.  When I went the coffee didn't blow my mind, and they also didn't have any brewed at 1pm on a Thursday which was kind of strange to me for a coffeehouse so I had to wait. But that did mean it was fresh which is always nice.   They have fake outlets (they're stickers) which is kind of funny I guess but wasn't funny to me when I found a seat and my laptop died... they also have real ones though so don't worry.   All in all a cute little place and worth checking out if you're in the mood for a new local coffee shop. Or a low key place for a beer."

We had to wait about an hour for their food and in the meantime we had a glass of Astoria Moscato and watermelon wine on the porch. The weather was perfect and this created a whole mood. We then proceeded to their wine tasting room and tried some of their best wines. I've got to say the Astoria Moscato was their best. At least for those who like sweet wine. My husband liked many of their dry wines as well. Definitely going back with the kids so they can pet the donkeys in the neighboring pastures."

However, do not fret if you didn't, because the grounds are stunning. You can order a glass or a bottle, no judgment ;), from their double decker bus, that gave me some serious harry potter vibes. Then take it and enjoy the view. There is ample sitting. I would love to come back with reservations of course, and try a flight in their beautiful tasting room."

Plenty of outdoor space to social distance along with animals to interact with: donkies, goats and miniature horses! A decent selection of wines with one standing out in particular to our taste-buds, can't remember the name specifically but it was red wine cherry blend, maybe seasonal?

The tasting reservation process was pretty easy. The tasting price is very fair (5 glasses for $18) and the pours were generous. The wines were very good. I left with a couple of bottles. I definitely recommend the Christmas Cuveé and the Sangria wine. Once you finish your tasting, there is plenty of space outside on the patio or other areas to just sip more wine and just be.  A lovely experience."

I did like the outdoor patio and the arrangement of all the things. I enjoyed the red wines that they had. I really liked the season fruit wines--tasted like juice with how fruity they were (I mean that in a good way).   The food truck also served some pretty solid food. Really enjoyed the chili and cheese tator tots. The pizza was good too! The burger was a little disappointing though.   All in all, nice place to visit! Come check it out!"

What I really didn't expect was the fantastic food. Finding something a gluten free vegetarian could safely eat and enjoy was beyond my expectations but wow did they surprise. Best gluten free veggie I've ever had! Lovely afternoon here, we'll definitely visit again."

We made a reservation for a tasting. Well worth it to learn about the types of wine. The staff is knowledgeable and nice. It is a comfortable environment and you can ask many questions. After the tasting we ordered a glass each and went outside. We ordered a pizza from the mobile kitchen. It was wonderful!  I suggest going on a beautiful day and enjoy wine, good food and sunshine!"

After our hour of tasting 5 wines, we bought two bottles and went out to the property to enjoy the day and the live music. We had a perfect spot beside the musicians (who were very very good) and had an amazing view of the property. I was at peace with all the elements in place. I will be back, bringing family, and enjoying a bottle here and there."

                "description": "This is my second time visiting this winery. I loved it the first time and it left an impression on me to go back. Because of Covid, they are doing tastings by reservations only so that they can control number of people and properly space out in their tasting room. I'm sure you'll love a bottle to buy and you'll have ample time and space to enjoy it on their deck or yard after your tasting. Our tasting guide, Robert, was very knowledgeable about the different wines and a joy to converse with! They do have a good truck on their premises that bakes wood fire pizzas. I didn't try any this time because we already had brunch before coming. The port was my favorite wine. You've got to try it for yourself!"

                "description": "A year later and Wimberly Valley Winery is just getting better!  Our friends are members here and we joined them to go out and pick up their wine. While we were there we had a tasting.  They now have a full line up of \"fruit\" wines like Blackberry, Cherry and cinnamon, honey crisp apple, and others. They are on the sweeter side but for me were seriously tasty! I loved the cherry and the blackberry.  However at this time of year it is the mulled wine that truly wins the day for me! If you haven't had mulled wine I suggest you get off your butt, drive the distance, and sample some right now! It is so worth it!  A hearty and loud Ooooh my Goddie toooo Hottie to this wonderful glass of spiced wine that is served hot! It brings flashes of warm fire places, deep snow, thick sweaters and holiday cheer with every sip. It is my absolute favorite!  They are adding more structures to the location, the outside area is a divine place to grab a bottle and just sit and soak up the outdoors while enjoying a good sip with friends, and the inside is a great lush environment of comfy lodge like decor.  It is a great location with good people and a great selection of wines... not only theirs but a plethora of other wines as well. We always enjoy our time here!   One last note.... try the mulled wine! It is the holiday season in a bottle!"

                "description": "This place was definitely a one and done. There wasn't anything bad about our visit but there wasn't anything great about it either. They don't even use Texas grapes so these are all from out of state and only a handful are barrel aged. They were basic and not anything special. We came for a tasting so we tried a total of 5 different wines each (10 between the two of us.) They even serve store bought wines here!!! I've NEVER been to a winery that serves what I can buy myself at HEB. They didn't tell you anything about the wines other than \"this is dry and fruit forward,\" no explanation of the grapes used, how long its aged, etc that we've become used to at other wineries. Also the alcohol content must be very low in thier wines, we went on empty stomachs and neither of us felt a thing which is not the case at other wineries we've been to. I'd give it a try if you're in the area, but don't expect much. The grounds are nice and they have a cute double decker bus they converted but for us one visit was plenty."

My niece and nephew love taking carrots for the horses and donkeys and kicking the soccer ball around. The venue is just beautiful and even when their are tons of people there it just doesn't feel crowded, the layout is perfect.    The wine is top notch. I  like sweeter wines so most on the menu suits me but they have some dry wine as well for folks who love a dry red or white.  Slushes in the summer, warm spiced wine in the winter, fruit wines in the fall ... this place has it figured out!  Grab a Cheese tray and hang out for an hour or stay all day!"

Adam was our guide, and although we are native to the area, we enjoyed learning some new tidbits about our beloved city and enjoyed exploring breweries we had not visited. Adam even adjusted our stops to visit some breweries with cider and wine to accommodate different preferences. Biking on the east side was a blast, not too hard, Adam preps you for the hills, seeks out shade and hydrates you at the breweries. Great time!"

Definitely one of the high points of the weekend, and I highly recommend it to anyone visiting Austin!"

It would be okay to play some music as it's awkwardly quiet due to the lack of patrons.  Finally, the people at the counter seemed annoyed with people overall.  Another couple in  the parking lot stopped us and asked if we had the same bad experience so it was not just us."

Glad we stopped at this place after seeing a sign off the side of the road and following a winding path down to see this gem.  Very homey vibes with a great patio for outdoor seeing that just has a fantastic view of the hill country. Decently priced drinks consisting of either gin or vodka.  Seating is pretty limited inside, but the outdoor space is just amazing and honestly makes the experience really that much better. I'd highly recommend 'The Bullfrog' with vodka. Tasty drink, but not overpowering and has a nice kick (smooth vodka that doesn't burn like gasoline).  P.S. They have some cool looking merch! Make sure to take a look at their terrariums...they are wicked!"

However, this time I made a trip purposefully to stop in.  I am glad I did.  Frog Pond is a family-owned business and passion project. The entire family was behind the bar the day my friend and I stopped in except for mom and I think a daughter.  The family owns the land and has slowly overtime built the tasting room and production area themselves.  They currently make a vodka and gin.  They offered us a free sip of each to determine which we would prefer in one of their handcrafted cocktails.  Both had a nice flavor profile that blends well in cocktails.  Their cocktails were creative and they mentioned the family came up with the recipes together.  The cocktails were delicious and very reasonably priced.  Their space has a fun modern 50's theme.  They have an outdoor patio you can sit back and relax on a nice day."

It's very obvious that a lot of careful thought has gone into this place. The actual distillery is incredible. The whole place is just beautiful. Even on a scorching Texas Summer day, there's a strong breeze out on the porch.  It's a very \"Austin-esque\" type place, down-home and friendly. Although I don't drink, my wife enjoyed a cocktail very much and we bought a bottle to take home. They had some nice lemonade and infused water for me too.  Great design of the logo, bottles and everything. Really worth stopping in if you're in the area or just feel like a nice drive from Austin."

We started off at another well known distillery down the road and googled what else was close by and found this awesome little spot with a great view. They make small batches of vodka and gin at the distillery and make a few different drinks to try. Their porch was a great place to hang out while playing giant jenga and relaxing. I noticed cornhole as we walked in as well. We watched deer randomly wandering in the distance. The drink I had was great, a cranberry vodka fizz, so I had another. The indoor space is fairly small and the patio could fit maybe 30 people comfortably. It was not crowded at all when we were there on a Sunday afternoon. We'll go again next time we're in Austin!"

I am very happy to say that the product that they are offering, not only the liquor, is amazing. They couldn't have picked a better location to place their distillery. The hills of Texas, day or night, make relaxing on the patio with the variety of gin and vodka cocktails that much more relaxing. The bright pops of color when you venture inside of the distillery are such a delight and really made my girlfriend and I feel happy to be in such a welcoming place.   The gin was delicious and I plan to buy more bottles very soon. Don't think that my lack of praise for the vodka means that it isn't good (I am just not a fan of vodka..rough nights in college) but I definitely suggesting venturing out to this family run, local organization. You will not be disappointed."

                "description": "Delicious! The brisket and the pork belly were melt-in-your-mouth meat candy, exploding with smokey flavor. Yum!  The sausage was really good too, though I prefer more of a loose sausage like you'll get in some other central Texas BBQ joints. This was more firm but really good flavor.  I requested (fresh) jalapeños and sriracha in addition to the regular garnish of pickles, onions, and bbq sauce. The veggies were thick slices and the sauces flavorful. Plus two thick slices of white bread.  It was pricey, but any BBQ in Central Texas is. The differentiator here is the Vietnamese touches in the flavors and sauces. Two people in my party had banh mi and one had the King plate and they looked delicious too. Everyone in our party gave 5 stars for flavor, portion, and service.  Other notes: Decent parking. Good indoor seating, lots more outdoor seating. BBQ joint/bar vibe indoors, with notes of Vietnamese flair. Service was attentive and food came out quick.

                "description": "Food is pretty delicious but damn do they only give you appetizer portions. We bought two bbq plates and there was hardly any food on it and it was $20.00 for each of them. Very ilu underwhelming in that regard. Id say a bbq plate is worth $10.00.   The atmosphere is like any typical bbq joint. Service was very nice.  I wouldn't come back though since the portions are a scam."

                "description": "I came in last Saturday with one of my Yelp peeps to get the weekend started before going to see a little bit of comedy. We ordered drinks only.  The atmosphere of this establishment has a real ATX vibe as it blends central TX spirit with traditional Vietnamese cuisine. The mode last Saturday night was chill and as we walked in and were given a nod by the bartender. My companion ordered  a bozzy bobba shoot and another adult libation. I ordered a spiked tea cause \"baby, it's cold outside\". The drinks came out quick and were done right.   This is the type of place that is solid for good eats, a good time, a date night,  or to start off an evening of disorderly conduct.  #supportlocal"

They bring the food to you so you can't pay with cash. Went for lunch with the guys. The brisket was good. With the 3 meat you only get 1 slice of brisket. You get 1 jalapeño and cheese sausage. And some pork belly. I wasn't a fan of the pork belly. The sausage was good though. I can't lie. The moist in the brisket was tasty! The lean was good too. They got Mexican Coke was good too!"

We have been here a few times and love their food.    My favorite so far is the brisket banh mi and their potato salad. The brisket is smoked perfectly and the bread texture compliments the heartiness of the brisket well.  I love the fresh veggies they put in this!  The potato salad is hands down the best potato salad I have ever had at a restaurant. You have got to try this!!  We have ordered a few drinks in the past - they have a great Happy Hour.  You cant miss it - follow your nose to North Lamar and treat yourself."

                "description": "I really wanted this to be a revolutionary experience. The concept is so cool, but their menu is a little repetitive and the food was just good. Not saying that this wasn't an awesome meal, but I really wanted it to be something to write home about. And it just wasn't.   The banh mi sandwiches were very dry but the meat was insanely tender, though   lacking a lot of flavor. The cost is a little higher but the portion sizes are large and generous.   The real show stopper here though, is the bbq sauce. It's the right mix of Asian flavors and classic bbq sweetness.   It's worth the visit to see this take on two fairly different cuisines mashed together. But don't expect to be wowed away. It doesn't scream fusion to me, it just seems like they took some of the most popular parts of each cuisine and put them separately on the plate."

                "description": "This place was everything I had hoped it would be. Now I just wish there was another one in Houston!  This Texas Tower looks intimidating but just roll up your sleeves, topple that thing over, and dive right in. The jalapeño sausage has some sneaky heat. Perfectly crispy hashbrowns with beautifully salted pork belly. Loved every bite.  We also shared the pork belly and brisket banh mi's and smokin fries. Most banh mi places we are quick to grab the Sriracha and Maggie's Sauce but not this time. It didn't even cross my mind until days after.  The brisket has the most amazing flavor and so moist. Almost a shame to lose it into anything else. But a perfect addition to any menu item.  Such warm and friendly owners and staff.   Parking was easy on a Sunday afternoon.  CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK FOR MORE!!!"

                "description": "I have had a hankering for this place for almost a year. I had seen it on the Food or Travel network, and it looked awesome. It seems like they have some sort of little drink or food special every day. On Wednesday, it was Whiskey and Wine Wednesday, with $2 off either beverage. My friend and I sat at the bar. The co-owner was bartending, and she is super friendly. She helped us with a couple of beer choices, as well as which Bahn Mi I was going to go with. We got the Smokin' Fries, the Brisket Bahn Mi, and the Smoked Pork Belly Bahn Mi. All of the food was amazing. Even after I felt like I couldn't eat another bite, I kept snacking away on those fries. This place has a great vibe, they are trying to work on managing the temperatures of outdoor seating for customers, and they have lots of little activities, like trivia and swing night, throughout the week. I will absolutely be back for brunch; I got to get my hands on that Leaning Tower of Texas."

                "description": "The high ratings for Smoking Beauty are well earned. Large portions of delicious, creative, well presented food; a variety of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages; the choice of indoor or outdoor seating with two separate outdoor areas, one covered and one open; varying table heights; great music played at a level to be noticeable without being intrusive, and attentive, friendly staff.  On my first of what will surely be many visits I came on a Saturday with my husband for a late lunch. There were a good number of people there including a small birthday celebration but with two outdoor areas and inside seating to choose from we were able to sit off on our own at a lovely table outside in front of the restaurant.  Having not had enough caffeine yet I was delighted by the Vietnamese drop coffee and was impressed that they accommodated my husband's order of part Coke and part carbonated water. He was clearly hungry and/or unprepared for the quantity of food and order both Bahn Mi and loaded fries. I chose the brisket hash off of the brunch menu which was so good I ate way too much of the generous serving. Several days later I am still thinking about how perfect the sweet potatoes and brussel sprouts were in particular.  I am looking forward to going back again later and trying one of their cocktails with my meal which are rumored to be too notch."

Then ordered the brisket banh mi, it was a really interesting taste lol... it just tastes like a banh mi with brisket slapped inside. It was pretty decent, pretty pricey though for what it is ($12). Make sure to order the green and bbq sauce for the banh mi! It gives it a little more flavor."

                "description": "Smokin Beauty is a fusion restaurant that combines Vietnamese and BBQ cuisine. They have lots of indoor and outdoor seating. They even have live music on some weeknights. You order at the bar counter and take your number to the table, and they bring out your food out to you. We sat outside, but the service was slightly lacking as we had go back into the restaurant for multiple items like silverware and napkins. The meat tasted good, I would favor the pork belly over the brisket- the bread was hard and crispy for banh mi. I definitely would view them more as a BBQ joint versus Vietnamese, although they do have some interesting drinks with Viet twists. Overall, a good place to go especially if looking for late night food. They have they own private parking lot as well."

                "description": "Came by on a Friday night to see a friend's band, the Lone Star Debonairs.  Also wanted dinner... and this is the second BBQ place I've been to in less than a week!  Smokin Beauty is in the Vietnamese area of North Austin, and is a Vietnamese/BBQ hybrid.  They're a small place but have good outdoor seating and parking, and the weather this Friday night was perfect for eating and dancing.  The food: I ordered their brisket and pork belly salad with a creamy cilantro dressing.  The brisket had nice smoke and a good bark, and the pork belly was soft without being mushy or all fat, and really lightly flavored, showing off the meat.  Fresh, crisp veggies made it perfect  They also have Banh Mi on the menu, and a Viet BBQ plate with Texas BBQ and Viet vegetables."

                "description": "Smokin Beauty fuses Texas barbecue with Vietnamese cuisine. I popped in for the Double Fantasy Bahn Mi (brisket and pork belly). Served on a crunchy, fresh baguette, the meats were perfectly smoked and flavorful, and the pickled vegetables were crisp and colorful. If you prefer a bit of added heat, ask for jalapeños and sriracha. I also tried the slaw which was fresh and bright with Asian flavors.  There is plenty of seating outside. The decor inside is plenty nice with dark wood decor. The restaurant sports a full bar. This is such a great little neighborhood spot."

I told her we always carry mail past the pits and always wanted to try it. I ordered the brisket banh mi with potato salad as well as an happy hour cocktail. My friend got a two meat plate with slaw and potato salad. The salad was incredible, we both agreed. He loved the pork belly so much!  For the price point, it was absolutely worth it! Discussing the passion Matt and Tao have for opening this business during a pandemic is inspiring nonetheless. Stop on by!"

                "description": "Smokin Beauty takes the best of both worlds by combining traditional Viet style of cooking with American BBQ to give you a fusion you didn't know you needed... until now. You can find items such as the:  - Brisket Bánh Mì: I enjoy the twist of smokey, fatty flavors from the brisket as well as the creamy cilantro and soy sauce that it comes with. The fries are amazing, too! $13.95 (4.5/5)  - Leaning Tower of Texas: a brunch special that is a stack of 3 hash browns, brisket, jalapeño cheddar sausage, pork belly, sambal hollandaise (sambal is like chile peppers), and bánh mì veggies - this is a lot more filling than it looks, I definitely would suggest you share it. I thought it was pretty good. $23.75 (4/5)  - Pho Queso: you read that right, they take veggie pho broth and mix it in with melted cheese to give you a unique take on queso. The pro here is that it's vegetarian friendly, but the con is that the flavor is a bit faint and I wish they would use a beef pho base instead. It's still good however! $7 (3.5/5)  Overall, this is a great spot to visit if you're craving BBQ, but also want to try something different. They have an outdoor patio if you prefer to sit outside. They also have awesome customer service and the prices are good too. With that said, I give them a 4.25/5."

We ordered the pretzel and the sweet and spicy pickles. Both so good! Shared some flights and ordered the currywurst, bratwurst, and duckwurst. The duckwurst was great, but the sauerkraut was a little dry. The currywurst smelled amazing but we thought that, and the regular brat, were a little underwhelming and lacking a little flavor.

                "description": "Very welcoming Biergarten and cool Austinized Herman food await you here at Koko's Bavarian. We say Austinized because they dredge their schnitzel in red Chile rub before dipping it in a red-chile seasoned batter. While this was DELICIOUS - our autistic person (VERY sensitive to spice) who wanted schnitzel could not eat it.    The rest of us ate the schnitzel and loved it. So just a heads-up for the spice averse.   I got the Rabbit- Rattlesnake brat which was delicious - lots of wood-smoke from the grill and mine came with a side of Chef's secret spicy German mustard (diced jalapeño) that I loved!!  Others in our party got the schnitzel with potato pancakes subbed for the German potato salad, the Antelope Brat, and we split 2 orders of fries.  Fries are awesome here - definitely get them! Made from fresh potatoes thy are thick cut of crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. One order is enough for 2 to share.   VERY dog-friendly, bring your pooches who can handle the music and busy-ness of this Biergarten.   5 awesome food and atmosphere stars"

The inside has a decent number of tables, and the outdoor area is pretty big.  We got a lot of food so here's the rundown: - Pretzel = AMAZING. So perfectly soft and doughy and even better with the queso side. We ordered 2.  - Belgian Fries = crispy and hot and perfectly seasoned!  - Venison Brat = so good!  - Elk Brat = wayyyy too much whole grain mustard on top so I hated that part but the actual brat was good but the venison one was just so tasty.  - Potato Pancakes = soooo good! Comes 3 to an order but they're a fairly big size so easily shareable. Served with sour cream and apple sauce.   Will definitely be back!"

                "description": "East Austin is quite the canvas for places looking to offer different or newer experiences. While a lot has already been done in the area, there's an opportunity to, as they say, \"use the landscape to your benefit\" and add to it in ways that can compliment.  Koko's Bavarian is located in a general swath of the far East Side once reserved for industrial purposes. The area was known for a certain grit and was never to be confused for being family friendly.   Which is why, in this new world of viewing the same concepts with a different  perspective...it feels perfectly natural!   And the plenty of parking is an added bonus.   We dared to brave the amazing \"chilly\" Austin weather, 50 and sunny, as it made for a perfect set up to what Koko's offers.  Their beer selection was extremely diverse, which is a welcomed feature, especially if you've been making the brewery rounds...  The weinerschnitzel was great, although I will not purport to be a German fare expert. The Belgian fries were exceptionally crispy and, I don't care, you don't have to be an expert to know those potato pancakes were absolutely amazing.  The bee sting cake was beloved by everyone in our nine people party, me being the least impressed. All of this to say, eight out of nine loved it, so chances are you will too. The quark tart was definitely something to write home about  (even if home is in Germany...), a resounding 9 out of 9!  All in all, a great experience worthy of multiple visits and five stars."

                "description": "Koko's is a lot bigger than I expected. You see the outside host for seating, and there's plenty of if. If you go on a colder day, there is a fire and heat lamps.  Beverages A pretty large selection, and you'll have options for anyone from beer lovers to cider, wine, and schnapps, too.  Food  Sausages, schnitzel, potato salad, and fried pickles -- it's not a huge menu, but you're coming here for some German food, so it's to be expected to be a smaller range of options.  Seating and vibe  Great place for all ages. We had people with dogs and kids surrounding us, and everyone was very respectful, not letting their kids or dogs run around. It looks like there are seating options inside but more outside.   I'm giving four stars because we didn't dive into the food menu this time. We ordered the Belgium fries and beverages, which were excellent. We had quick service and loved the atmosphere outside. We will be back to enjoy more."

                "description": "I hate giving a restaurant a poor review in a Covid world, and this may be my first in years.  I also have to say I really like Tim Love concepts, but I don't think his team helped with the food.   To start, this is the worst German food restaurant we've ever been to.  The vibe was weird, the staff was not attentive and forgot half our order, and the food we got was awful.    The brat was far and away the worst sausage and brat we've all had anywhere.  The brat also came with onions over sauerkraut which is odd.  What's bad is that the sausage was better than the burnt chicken that came out cold on the inside.   The only win for this restaurant is their fries. The fries are good, and the sauces for the fries pair perfectly."

                "description": "I met a friend here for dinner one night and had a fantastic time! The ambiance was great, and on a nice spring day it was refreshing to be outside. I had the schnitzel and the second it hit my mouth I yelped... \"mmmmh!!\"... which then caused me to briefly choke, but it was worth it. The potato salad was also delicious, which is saying something because I normally don't like potato salad.   I took off a star because I think a $22 meal should fill you up, but I went home and decided to heat up a few slices of pizza because I was still hungry. Next time I'll get an appetizer or brot to go with it, but it was still a little disappointing... maybe it was just so tasty my stomach wasn't ready to quit."

                "description": "Yikes, this place is not ready for primetime.  Went with a pretty big group of about 20 people. We were all paying for our own food and drinks, which should be a pretty normal thing, but it absolutely wasn't. But I'll get to that.  I arrived late and our server was very quick to learn my name and take my order, so props to him. He helped me pick a beer to order and it came out pretty quickly. Unfortunately, someone else brought the beer and was going around the other end of the table asking who had this beer. When he got to me, I told him I didn't know if it was even my beer because the server picked for me. Not a great start.  I was hungry but thought $9 was pretty ridiculous for a braut. But my friend was enjoying his and he had it within minutes of ordering, so I said what the hell, I'll try it. 20-30 minutes later it still hadn't arrived, so I told the server to cancel the order and just close me out. Then it got worse.  \"What did you have?\" I don't know man, just the one beer you picked. He told me he had no idea how to split tabs which is just insane for this sort of a place. After a few minutes of him staring at his POS, I told him I'll just figure out who's paying and I'll Venmo then. Then I watched each person from our party ask the same question as they wanted to close out.  I also watched various staff come out with different food and drink items and constantly not know who was supposed to be receiving it. And not just within our large group... sometimes they brought food to our table that was for a different table. Just complete confusion on where things go. You know, what should be very basic for food service before you open.  I know it's a new place, and I did enjoy the vibe, but geez it was way too stressful to deal with everything that I won't be going back unless I hear they've properly trained their staff."

                "description": "I can absolutely see this restaurant being a hit for people who live downtown. The beer brewed in-house is priced fairly and tastes delicious. The location itself is cute and Instagram-worthy. The fries were awesome. As a casual place to grab a quick beer, munch on some appetizers and taste some interesting sausages, and then move on to the next venue, I think Koko's works great. For yuppie trash from suburbia who want a filling meal (points at self), however, it's hard to justify the trip due to the small portions, high prices, and spotty service.  First off, I'm almost certain that my server was high. I personally have no objections to anyone doing what they need to in order to get through their day, but from completely forgetting our orders immediately after taking our orders, to sending our our apps, entrees, and desserts to the wrong table each time, his vibing unfortunately kinda killed ours.  And I'd probably excuse all that if the schnitzels and bee sting cakes slapped, but they were pretty unremarkable in all ways except price. $22 for a small-end-of-medium plain pork schnitzel and a small scoop of potato salad and $10 for a tiny slice of bee sting cake that just did not hit. I've had bee sting cake before, and this one was quite dry, had less cream in the middle, and had nearly no honey-nut topping on top. Not a great way to end the meal.  Some of my complaints will probably be resolved as the restaurant settles and finds its groove, but man I don't know about those prices. Maybe $22 for Jägerschnitzel with sauerkraut and käsespätzle, but not for plain schnitzel served at street food portions.  Again, I think Koko's fills a niche as a great place to grab a pint/liter of delicious German beer while snacking on fries and just vibe, but as a restaurant, I don't think it offers enough value to be worth it. Especially not if you're a German food fan who lives over 30 minutes away."

We had their in-house beers, the lager and pilsner, both good, the other is a dunkel which we didn't get to since they serve the beers in a 32 oz mug, for $11, great deal.  We had the currywurst, antelope, and duck sausages, the currywurt came on fries instead of a bun and was my favorite but the duck was soooo good, sweet and juicy.  We'll definitely come back, the atmosphere is friendly and the beer is tasty. Next time I'll try a schnitzel!"

                "description": "We visited with a group of 4 adults and 3 hungry kids on a Saturday afternoon. Unfortunately you cannot order any food unless you have a table... and that is where is problem starts. We waited for 30 minutes for a table, but never received a notification even though there were 3 tables available (+ 6 tables marked as \"reserved\"). No other group waited to be seated (i.e. not crowded). One patron told us to just grab a table and not wait for a notification since \"This is the only way you will ever get a table\". When we tried that the waiter appeared to tell us that we could not do that but had to put ourselves on the waitlist (which we already did). When I asked him wether we would have had to make a reservation online ahead of time he told me that he doesn't want to talk to me. Really?!  We walked next door to Central Machine Works where they had plenty of space.  Look, I understand that the place just opened and might not run smoothly just yet. So I hope you make something out of this feedback:  (1) if your tables are freely accessible it does not make sense to have a waitlist since people can just skip the line. (2) If you do not have enough staff to service everyone close down some tables (3) Let people know what the wait time might be. (We we're told 15 minutes. After 30 minutes we were told it's another 30.) (4) If a customer asks a question at least try to answer.  Lastly: The House Lager tasted pretty decent and the food menu looks interesting. Wish we could have tried it. (Or that the kids could have had a pretzel while waiting.)"

It's truly a Cheers-esque environment where everyone feels welcome and everyone knows your name (and drink)! Marissa, Kiyani, Sophia and Aaron all make everyone feel welcomed and valued. We've lived here (6 minutes away) for 10 years and this is BY FAR the best regular crew they've ever had! Management is a revolving door, though, and there have been some great ones along with dozens of others (good and bad) who are no longer at this location or with the company. Drew, who is newish, though, is awesome and one of the best to ever grace this location's presence.  All I can say is, if you're local and haven't been but are considering stopping in - go here. If you're out of town and visiting - go here. If you're a regular - write a review. You know the folks here who make this your regular spot deserve the shout out. I, personally, feel bad it's taken me so long to give them a public shout out!  Management - you're lucky to have a team like this during this time. Treat them as the valued people that they are!  Thanks y'all!"

Went tonight finally to get some fare on patio since it was such a nice evening, and omg, we were blown away.  Stated with the fried pickles, I don't even care for pickles, but with the Buffalo sauce! Uhmmm yass these were amazing! Perfectly crispy, crunch of the pickle, and the zip of the sauce, it was pretty darn good!  I had the spicy passion fruit margarita, it was more sweet than spicy, but still tasty. I liked the blood orange Bellini a little better, and the house margarita was also good.   I got the coconut shrimp for dinner, again, perfectly fried, with a nice crunch. The coconut was subtle but I really enjoyed the chile sauce with it. I got a \"side\" of fries to go with it, the fries could have been my meal. Super generous portion, and do yourself a favor, add the truffle, Holy moly!    Our waitress was great, as long as every other member of the wait staff that touched our table. We came on the recommendation of friend and I feel I have to spread the love. This place is a must try, and I can't wait to come back!"

We came at lunch and though I was initially hesitant to bring in kids, there ended up being plenty off other families in there. The menu was upscale American. Given it was lunch time, we went with hamburgers and sandwiches. The main dishes were all really good and a decent portion (not too big, not too small). The sides we got were a bit under seasoned though. Lastly, there should really be a hamburger on the kids menu.   Overall, really enjoyed this place.

                "description": "The League is part neighborhood bar, part gastro-pub and I love both parts!    The bar and dinning areas are separated.  Despite both being relatively small, there's plenty of seating.  Choose from high-tops to semi-circular booths to high-back swivel bar stools.  And they have an outdoor patio as well, but not much of a view.   The League is a great place to meet a friend for drinks, a casual date, weekend brunch, watch Sunday football, or to just to ride the bar solo.    Excellent food with new, weekly specials, including a burger-of-the-week. On Mondays they have 2-for-1 burgers for dine in - can't beat that!  They also have cocktail specials to go along with their food specials (in addition to their menu and drink standards).  I wish they had a bigger beer wall, but the selection is serviceable.   The League is one on my regular spots and I've yet to be disappointed with their food, drinks, or service."

                "description": "We have been going to The League for a couple of years now. I get my hair done around the corner so it's convenient for my husband to hang at the bar. Sometimes we eat here and sometimes not.   Upside; Bartenders are always friendly and welcoming, they have great happy hour prices on drinks and apps. Also weekly food specials.   Food can be hit or miss. Between the two of us we've had everything on the menu. Club sandwich is always as hit and so is the spinach artichoke dip. Burgers sometimes a bit dry. The salmon is usually perfectly cooked. Fish and chips over battered and greasy. Prime rib sandwich is hit or miss.  Burger of the week this visit was Frito Pie Burger. I had the garlic butter grouper, which was a huge portion, but lacked seasoning on both the fish and couscous. Garlic butter was on the side, but was just melted butter with a chopped garlic at the bottom. No other seasonings.   We will continue to come hang at the bar and eat here occasionally."

                "description": "5 stars for service and 2.75 stars for food. My 4 stars are on the generous side.  We dined here this afternoon. The server was very nice and took care of us. I'd give her service 5 stars.   For our food we ordered the chicken fried pork chop, the full rack of ribs, the southern burger, and the kids Mac and cheese.   Our little guy loved the Mac snd cheese. It was decent and definitely not out of a box. It didn't come with anything else but was only $5.   Hubby had the Southern burger with truffle fries ($2 up charge). The burger was solid. It could have been a slight bit juicer but it was a good burger. The \"truffle\" fries were not. The fries were limp and soggy and sprinkled with Parmesan but had no truffle flavor at all. Actually when you picked up a fry the cheese all fell off too. Pretty bad fries to be honest.   Older son ordered the baby back ribs and enjoyed them. They were your standard fair. Similar to what you'd find at Chili's but they cost $30 and come with a side of mashed potatoes.  I had the  chicken fried pork chop. It was very over cooked and dry and was topped with jalapeño gravy but there was no heat or jalapeño flavor at all. The gravy made the pork chop less dry though. I subbed Brussels sprouts instead of mashed potatoes ($2). They lacked seasoning or flavor. I like the taste of Brussels sprouts so I ate them but they had no other seasoning that I could detect.   The food was all fine. Not bad but at their prices I would definitely not run back."

                "description": "Tonight I met a friend to taste their Prime and Wine deal. Half price bottles of wine and two sizes of Prime Rib. The beef was perfectly cooked, nicely seasoned and fork tender. The mushrooms cooked in a savory salty balsamic sauce were the perfect accompaniment to the prime rib. I asked for fries rather than the Yukon mashed because I know their fries are fresh and hand cut. Some people complain about soggy fries. Well, if you put them in a cardboard box to take home, they WILL steam in the box and get soggy. Duh! But ours were nice and crispy. The cut of beef was thick which I really appreciated as opposed to a wide thin-cut slice. I think it was maybe 3/4 of an inch thick? Maybe more. I'm posting a pick but I had already dug in when I remembered to take a photo. Sorry. I like The league a lot. Even the Mgr came by to ensure we were happy. Nice young man was our waiter. This was all good!"

                "description": "This place wildly exceeded my expectations.   We are in from out of town, it's a perfect Sunday spot for lunch and to watch football. The Sunday crew in the bar was super fun, our server Aaron was really kind   Their Sunday drink special is $3 mimosa and bloody Mary's.   Their gluten free bun is the best I've had at a restaurant, it is nice and chewy and stays together.   The chicken sandwich was great, a huge chicken breast with lots of bacon and avocado. They do a \"first timer\" complimentary dessert of their chocolate dump cake, my husband said it was great!"

                "description": "I ordered the \"elevated\" or perhaps called \"adult\" grilled cheese and tomato soup. The soup was very tasty and I would order that again.  The sandwich was not an adult version and not elevated. Cold congealed cheese on what looked like white bread. No spreads or bacon jam or fig or combination of cheeses.. nothing to elevate this sandwich to justify the $13.00 price tag.  I make 'em better at home."

                "description": "This place is our most visited restaurant since moving here thirteen years ago. As a former restaurant owner / operator, I appreciate the consistency and quality of the menu offerings. The facility is always clean and tables are cleared immediately when a party leaves. They have some really good deals, like burger Monday where you buy one and get one free. They also have a mouth watering prime rib special on Thursday that we can't wait to try.  One more attraction is , if you are into science or astronomy, you might be waited on by Galileo."

                "description": "We WILL be back! So, tonight my little family and I discovered this hidden gem. We had no clue about this place until tonight when I was looking for a family friendly restaurant, Little did we know it's only 10 minutes away from our house that we lived at for over two years. We were greeted as soon as we came in, it looked upscale and as soon as we sat down my husband said \"are you sure this is kid friendly\"  it ABSOLUTELY is. The food was amazing from the appetizers, main course and dessert. The customer service here was outstanding, I've waitressed myself for many years and have been to many restaurants and have never had service like this. Sam took care of us tonight and was so accommodating to us and our 1 year sassy daughter. Zach the manager on duty was also outstanding as well, he took care of us well for it being our first time there, We left in disbelief with the service we received... thanks yall! We look forward to many more dinners here.   Plus I got a nice tote for the to go food"

                "description": "Came here for my wife's birthday with some friends and we all agreed it was probably the best meal of our lives. The courses all featured spice in very well balanced dishes, and as a person who doesn't normally search out spicy food I had no regrets after this experience. The crab fingers were a fun and light way to start things off, just enough to whet the appetite without being heavy. I loved the curry sauce and the chili oil was enough to feel it but not enough to overwhelm the crab or curry. Next was a tuna tartare with more spice, this was really good but probably my least favorite of all the dishes. The biggest surprise for me was the charred cabbage. It was marinated lightly and then seared over flame, and the combination of those two steps made it extremely flavorful and easy to eat. I don't normally think of cabbage as something exciting, but combined with the spices and furikake mushroom curry sauce I'd go back just for this! Absolutely floored my whole party. The main course of pork three ways over dirty rice and greens was a hit, with a lightly tangy mustard sauce and simple, excellent flavors all around. Finally, dessert was a delicious cake with I believe a pumpkin sauce topped with a heavy cream and pumpkin seeds. I'd punch a child just to have that sauce alone, the rest was a bonus.   Most of my group did the wine course, allergies had me under the weather so I had only one glass and a few samples. Everyone agreed the wines paired really well, although feelings were mixed on the necessity of the dessert wine given the dessert was sweet enough. That being said, no one had complaints after the trip and we are eagerly planning our next outing.   The staff was amazing and we felt very well taken care of all night long. My compliments to Lenoir for a wonderful evening!"

                "description": "Recently went here with a friend for dinner as a visitor to Austin and while the food was good, probably  4/5, I cannot recommend this business as I lost my wallet in between this dinner and a direct drive back to where I was staying.   After retracing our steps and turning the place and car inside out, my wallet could not be found and two days later, none of my cards had been used. However, I did have $300 in cash and a $200 rewards debit card that was in there. Lenoir refused to pick up after multiple calls and messages, which they also refused to return. Once we finally got through, employees denied having it, despite there being only one logical place it could possibly be. So while I had a decent meal, I'm now out almost $800 with the added bonus of having to replace my REAL ID and cards"

We sat outside under a gorgeous tree, adorned with beautiful glass lanterns on a cool, moonlit night drinking bottles of wine and feasting on the chef's choice menu option, while trying not to fill up on one of the best bread plates you will ever experience. Each course was a bonafide gastronomical treat, coupled with unique and delicious wine pairings and curated by an exceptional staff with a level of fine dining service you are unlikely to ever experience in an environment as laid back as Lenoir.   And the desserts were incredible. We ordered them all.  Highly, highly recommend.   We loved it, think of it often and can not wait to return."

Service is always on point, knowledgeable servers on the wine, pretty solid wine list, limited glass selections tho, but I hate to say it but I recall when the food was equally as good... maybe it's the seasonal menu but it was a bit salty and generally underwhelming... I've had much better at Lenoir. Hoping to see a return of great food... quality of ingredients were on point I think it's the cooks... will still be back. Love y'all"

                "description": "Lenoir is a cozy outdoor space with delicious food. We came in with 14 people and they accommodated us in the back. We arrived on time and got seated promptly. We had a 5 course meal and only one wasn't to my liking. The char shui was moist and flavored well. I was a little skeptical at first glance but it turned out delicious.   My only gripe was that dinner took 2.5 hours. It cut into our other plans that we had that night. So, if you have a big party, plan accordingly.   PS - Because it's near a creek, please careful of water bugs... As I was cutting the char shui, one crawled across my lap napkin. Imagine a screaming woman frantically waving her knife around as her first initial reaction. Yep, that was me. *Raise hand* I almost stabbed my friend while trying to get it off me."

                "description": "As I drove up, I was unsure of parking and which building to go to! After I was pointed to the correct destination I found the ambiance to be quaint and inviting with a nice hint of sophistication. A semi-open kitchen with a trendy bar area invited me to relax and enjoy the evening on Lenoirs terms.    I'm a former chef, however when I order beverages, I prefer to tell the staff my interests and let them suggest my vino(s) of the night. My waiter proved to be worth his salt as my 'pearl snap' which was perfect. I'm not a fan of IPAs so this suited my palate. As for the wine, I opted for the matthieu barret from Rhone. I told the waiter I prefer French wines, especially being at a French restaurant and this beverage didn't disappoint. It was a light bodied wine with a great bouquet that kept me guessing what flavors were prominent. The Syrah/Shiraz seemed to have hints of oak and cherries while other flavors I couldn't pick out but in a fun way. Our evening started with the \"crab fingers\". The crab was cooked perfectly however I there wasn't much meat on them and picking at the claw proved tedious and the chili oil was a bit hot. That said the curry leafe leche was a true delight. We also opted for the tuna tartare which was fresh but the salsa macha again seemed to be aped up on heat. More on the heat aspects later.    As for dinner my date and I both opted for the oxtail tagliatelle. Again, heat was the star of the dish. I then asked the waiter why every dish had such a heat signature and they said it's fusion to the local vibe. To me I can't take heat so it brings the occasion down. That said, there's a true skill in the dish as the oxtail was cooked to perfection. Tender and flavorful while the kale provided a nice flavor contract being sharp to cut the fat from the oxtail. The pasta was al dente and married well with the sauce. Besides the heat, this dish was outstanding! The waiter suggested a desert wine of Malvasia-trebbiano. I wasn't a fan but my date loved it. Also it paired wonderfully with the coffee semifreddo. This desert was classy, filling, not to sweet and a wonderful capper to the evening.   All said, I really enjoyed my experience at Lenoirs and I suggest this establishment to anyone that wants to add flair to a first date while not being pretentious. The food is skillfully crafted, the wait staff knows their restaurant and the ambiance is romantic. An inviting experience not to be missed."

Go for the HH for 1/2 bottle robes and great mixed drinks the watermelon chiller was pretty and refreshing.  We got the cab franc bottle and was light and paired well with our meals. - HH bread with pimiento was interesting  -HH shrimp boil was different with fresh shrimp and okra and corn and something crunchy on top  - lamb vindaloo was not spicy but tasty and oddly accompanied very well with the sliced watermelon  - mp bass with Goan crab curry was delightful and complex flavors to create a light main entree  Service was so friendly and just stellar and we enjoyed our culinary experience for 2 hours on a Thursday night and in no way felt rushed  Romantic and fun place to be.  Highly recommended!"

                "description": "The best meal we've had in Austin. We ordered the tasting menu ($58) and 2 bottles of wine.   The tasting menu kept us excited and pleased the whole way through. The opening items (an Amuse bouche of falafel-like crisps with a lovely sauce and a sashimi with a tangy sauce) were so good. Blew us away.   Personally, the third item, gnocchi, was not my favorite. It is made from corn flour, not potato, which is slightly off putting. My friend described it as enchilada in bite form. I liked the spinach.   The steak was amazing. I liked the texture and the taste. It had a lovely chimichurri like sauce with leeks. The cucumber salad bopped too.   Finally, the dessert -- light and pleasing. Highly recommend trying the tasting menu if you come."

                "description": "While visiting Austin, I chose Lenoir for a romantic vibe with a setting that felt uniquely \"Austin.\" We went with the chef's tasting menu and didn't look back. We received a selection of 5 dishes that we mostly would not have ordered on our own, and we loved each one. Each dish was full of pleasantly surprising flavors and they were all beautifully presented. The tasting menu also left us happily full without being overstuffed.   To go with our meal, we chose a bottle of wine from their ample selection. They also offer a few cocktails, beers, and some wine by the glass, but getting a bottle seems to be the way to go.    Our server, Dustin, was fantastic. He was very willing to hear any and all dietary restrictions or quirks, and was happy to work with the the couple that I mentioned. He was clearly passionate about everything on the menu and his excitement for what we chose showed. He even gave us great tips on places to check out in Austin later that night.   Dining at Lenoir was a highlight during the few days we spent in Austin, the food was phenomenal and the atmosphere was wonderful."

                "description": "The tasting menu was really good-- a lovely birthday dinner evening in a beautiful space (located right by a creek, so lots of mosquitos unfortunately).   FOOD: Delicious and thoughtful menu. We did the tasting menu for a birthday, and it took about 2 hours (we're quick eaters, too). They asked very intentionally at the beginning if we had any allergies and dietary restrictions, which was really thoughtful. Slight side note that the plates and serving ware was quite cute, which is just an ancillary sort of plus.  SERVERS: Speedy and really quite nice. They had recommendations, provided bug spray, were knowledgeable about the beverages. No complaints.  AMBIENCE: Currently (Oct 2021) only outdoor seating. It was well-lit and covered overhead. Quite good dinner date spot.   BATHROOMS: Gender neutral bathrooms indoors. It's may be a 50-ft walk to the bathrooms? Two single-person bathrooms. Clean, stocked. No complaints.  PARKING: A few (Like 10ish?) parking spots in a lot, otherwise I think it's street parking."

                "description": "Noticed they were doing their Chef's Tasting menu (five courses) for only $29 during January so booked a table the last weekend of the special.  The wine patio was a perfect happy hour spot pre-COVID, and so it's no shock that with a few finishing touches like a tent and heaters, it would make for a wonderful dinner experience, too.  Anthony was our server and he was so on top of it all night long. In addition to taking care of the dietary restrictions of some of the group, he also was very generous with the wine pours!  I can thankfully eat everything, but just want to give a hats off to the kitchen for accommodating the two gluten-free diners. They even made a special dessert for a friend that is allergic to eggs!  The menu was pretty stacked with seafood options which made it light but satisfying. I am not a huge oyster fan, but Sweet Home Alabama were theirs tasty! The tuna pappardelle was interesting...someone's hot take was that it reminded them of a more sophisticated tuna casserole. Impressive there was no dairy in the dish but it had a creamy, cheesy texture. My favorite was the seafood stew-esque dish with the delightful bread for dipping.   The $40 wine pairing was a steal! Not only were the pours accompanying each dish full (not a sissy tasting pour), but Anthony would just magically top off our glasses like a vino ninja, so I felt as if I had prob consumed an entire bottle by the end. And, definitely not mad at that!  While the half off special may not be a thing any longer, I still recommend visiting Lenoir for a nice dinner out, with all the precautions in place/being observed."

                "description": "Wow. I wasn't expecting to love this place so much but it was a fantastic experience all around.  The outdoor gravel patio is like sitting in someone's backyard under huge oak trees. They have simple lanterns strung from the tree branches and umbrellas all around. I loved the ambiance.   We ordered the tasting menu and the wine flight. The wine pairings were one of the best I've ever had. I'm not a fan of white wine but the owner picked the best French wines that paired perfectly with each course.   The first course was a hamachi crudo- perfectly light with subtle flavor.  Second course was a green bean salad- this was my favorite of the night. The beans were lightly pickled then charred and served on a yogurt queso fresco sauce- HEAVENLY. I make a mean green bean but theirs was the best I've ever had.  Third course was shrimp and vegetables. This was my least favorite, and it was still amazing.  Fourth course was the char siu and watermelon. Perfectly cooked and the balance of flavors was delicious. I was so full at this point but I still soldiered on.  Last course was ice cream with almond crumble. I'm not a fan of ice cream but this was really good.  Our server Quentin made our experience an unforgettable one. We'll be back for sure."

                "description": "Partner and I went to Lenoir for a date night. It's been a long time since I've dined here and didn't realize they had this nice spacious beer garden! They are offering 50% off their chef's tasting which is a 5 course tasting. They serve things family style and had an upgrade to a fish dish for an additional $25. Overall the dishes were good, though the beginning dishes were a little spicy and acidic. I very much enjoyed the whole fish that they mostly deboned. Dessert was a flan and churro-esque cookie that was a light way to end the meal.   During COVID it felt safe dining as it was outside and it was well spaced. They do have a covered area which unfortunately we didn't get to sit under. There was some light rain during the meal which they provided umbrellas for, but awkwardly we had to hold it up ourselves. Most tables had an umbrella but ours didn't."

                "description": "We were so disappointed in this restaurant. No cocktails, only beer and wine. We did the tasting menu and it was awful. One dish was just cabbage. Nothing else....a 1/4 head of cabbage. The sauce with it was good but who wants to eat just cabbage for a dish? The wine was so bad - even on its own but none of it paired with the dishes. We're coming from SF so we're spoiled but at least match the wine with the flavors of the dishes. We were still hungry after the tasting menu and ordered the tagliatelle - which was amazing. All in all, it was a letdown and we will not be back."

                "description": "Service: 5 Atmosphere: 4 Food: 3.5  Came for the January chef's tasting menu ($29) outside. Been wanting to try this place for some time so there were definitely some expectations after having seen and heard about it. Overall it was a good experience, but the food was not as great as expected.   Started with an oyster on the half shell - how can you go wrong with that? They did it perfectly.   Next up was a winter salad, which had beets, roasted butternut squash, some tomatoes, and beer infused peanuts; the peanuts were delicious, and the squash was nice; I didn't care too much for the texture but the flavor overall was decent and fresh.   A cooked \"salad\" was next with roasted broccoli, mushrooms, walnuts, and grapefruit, with melted taleggio cheese on the bottom. Interesting mix of flavors and textures, saltiness of the cheese and bitterness of the grapefruit were different, but the broccoli were very large pieces. Nice to try but probably not something I'd eat often.   The main dish was a baked fish with shrimp, arugula, and sliced radish in a tomato soup. TBH it was kind of underwhelming for the main dish and a bit too bitter and salty for my taste. The shrimp and fish were nicely cooked but not my favorite on flavor.   For dessert was a coconut cake, and a rice pudding. I didn't try the cake, and I know that rice pudding should be al dente, but this was a bit undercooked. It was nice of them to whip it up since I couldn't have the cake due to gluten, but it just wasn't that great unfortunately."

                "description": "This is a nice place with date vibes. The food was great , me and my partner decided to do chefs menu, pescatarian version. Started with hush puppies, strawberry aguachile, avocado tostada, large crab stuffed fish and citron cake.   One thing I'm confused about still is if we got one order of each or was it two servings as everything came in 1 plate for 2 people to share.   We additionally had Pullman bread and peach, strawberry cocktails. Everything was great.   Advice: ask if you opt for chef menu do you get 1 or 2 serving of the item when 2 people are eating. I believe we got only 1 per item to share in which case you are better off ordering from menu yourself rather than chefs choice."

                "description": "Wow! We had such a lovely time at Lenoir! I was slightly worried when we arrived when the host told us that our table was not available and it might be 30 minutes. I realize they can't remove patrons! But, we didn't have to wait that long and they seated us in a little area while we waited and gave us a pitcher of water (and two glasses!).  We opted for the the chef's menu and wine pairing. We really, really enjoyed it. the ambiance was specular, outside under the Live Oak trees and lanterns. The servers were excellent. We will be back to try other items on the menu. Honestly, we felt like we were on vacation."

                "description": "When Chief was here bar service was stellar. I have been coming here since it opened. Now bar service is lackadaisical, inattentive, distracted and sub standard.   I like this place. The food is good the beer selection is passable and I can watch any sporting event live or read a book or both. But these two are killing the place for me. Ordered a beer and sat for 20 minutes with no one asking me if I might like to order food. Had to literally flag someone down to order a meal. That is not how this business works.   Wearing a mask under your chin until you walk up to a customer is not how this works either. And the tall one did that all night long. Now looking for a different place to spend an evening eating a meal and enjoying a beer."

Person who had seated me brought me a drink then nothing. Though a minimum of 5 different servers were standing right next to my booth.  I understand a restaurant may be short staffed but limit your seating if you cannot handle it.  I've had the similar experience here multiple times.  Last time I patron any of the restaurants in this local chain.  And \"the remedy\" after speaking to a manager when I asked for the check for my half drank coke...oh no need to pay for the coke.

Apparently you get service that way.   Literally just walked in and got sat, was busy due to a UT game no problem. And then we just sit and wait and wait and wait. The supposed waiter for our area literally helped everyone around us and kept skipping us. Idk if it was because we didn't have UT gear on or I was basically the only black person there at the time but ppl that just walked in the door got greeted before we did.   We just got up and left. There's no way the dude in the area didn't know we had not been helped as he purposely kept ignoring the table and was serving EVERYONE around us.   Terrible service."

We fancied burgers and thought that a sports bar would serve delicious burgers! What a mistaken idea!! We started with a cup of onion soup: it was edible, not delicious, a little strong on the acid side, but ok. Then came the burgers: a 3mm leather sole burnt to death!! Awful! Horrible!! My husband had to leave the restaurant and was sick in the car park!! The fries were smothered in fat... yak! The waiter on the other hand was a sweetheart!! VERY professional! When I mentioned it wasn't good, he immediately offered to comp them, which he did! I am tempted to say that he had been through a similar situation before, maybe several times!!! He didn't hesitate and didn't offer an alternative: he KNEW the food was bad! Shame on management to allow this to happen! It's a Burger after all, and we are in Texas!! Land of Beef!!

                "description": "Cover 2 off research always hits the spot it's got the best shoe string fries I can't seem to find anywhere else in Austin . Even though they may just be French fries and not a main course there is something so satisfying about them . My favorite dish is the buffalo chicken sliders , I personally get the blue cheese on the side with ranch to dip . These are amazing and have the perfect thin not to thick cut of chicken that's battered nice and crispy but stays juicy tossed in tangy but not spicy buffalo sauce. The bread doesn't take over the sandwich so that's not all you get full on and is super soft . They also have a buffalo chicken salad that has a good amount of chicken if your not wanting a sandwich but need to cure that buffalo craving . I've only had the burgers other than that and they are equally delicious again especially with those shoe string fries that are always crispy .  This place is relaxed and a good place to have a beer while you cool off after a long day or just dining with the family.  The staff is pleasant and the deserts are huge . Well at least the brownie is . If you like bars and burgers are in the area and don't know what to eat stop in and try the buffalo sandwich it's my go to and recommendation for cover 2 . If not that than at least grab a beer and some shoe string fries and relax a minute ."

They have rotating specials, soups and flatbreads. The servers and staff are all very friendly and hard workers. I also bring friends here and they have all loved it as well! They have great deals on their happy hour and a good variety of beers and wine that are not crazy overpriced. I have loved everything I have ordered and they have great portion sizes! We usually come for lunch or dinner, but we recently had brunch which was also fabulous. I had the chilaquiles and they were amazing! The portions are also super generous so I've left with leftovers multiple times. If you're a sports person, they have a ton of really nice TVs and always have games on. I am honestly so happy this place is close by and will continue giving them my business! I would also like to add that like many places these days, they have also experienced shortages with staff and when that happens, we have seen the managers out on the floor helping out and also working their butte off! This restaurant has amazing food, service and is such a great place to have a nice dinner, go hang with friends or just pop by for a drink! Thanks for rocking it Cover 2! Oh and the Round Rock location is also awesome as I went their with a group of work friends once they also had excellent service and the food was equally as delicious!!!"

                "description": "So today was my first day in Austin. I searched Yelp. I drove by a number of joints. I even walked through Whole Foods. Alas nothing struck my fancy. Heading back, I swung into Cover2. I'm glad I did.  The greeting, Silvana as server, and the whole support staff weekend terrific.  I started with a cup of French onion soup. It was just a tad too sweet for my taste. I'm also a purist in looking for a single crouton under the  hood (of cheese).   The fries and prime rib sandwich were a pleasant surprise. I will typically keg wrestle you to keep the horseradish sauce off the plate. The sauce here actually was mellowed very nicely and didn't fight the meat. The fries were great! Nothing more need be said.   This was a terrific first meal in a new town. This might become my extended kitchen it was that solid of aa performance!"

I try to give servers the benefit of the doubt cause maybe they're short staffed but after multiple issues with the same server and seeing tables sat after us putting their orders in and getting their food, I'm getting disappointed with the downhill service at Cover 2.   We received our drinks at 6:45 pm. Left money on the table for the drinks and left the establishment at 7:20 pm after our server ghosted us with empty drinks and no food order placed."

Staff here was nice and friendly. food was hot and fresh, I had the franks red hot chicken sliders that they had as a special and was good.  Flatbreads were split between the table and were good as well.   Drink prices are not that bad.  Nice walk to our room from here and was convenient."

We never had an empty water (or beer) glass, and they were just plain nice. With so many restaurants struggling with staff and service, it was a welcome change. The food was top notch as well! I had the brunch burger and my hubby had the mango habanero wings, and we split the queso and chips. (And by the way, their queso was hella good, especially considering they aren't a Tex-mex restaurant!)"

One reason i loved the place was their unique 'curly' french fries. Yesterday, i was quite surprised to see they switched the curly fries to the scoop shape that their sister pub, Brick, serves. Meh. Friends from north Austin would often ask when I was going to Vincent because they liked the curly fries. My friend with me yesterday, said the same thing, whaddup?  i know it's not earth shaking but it made Vincent stand out for me. BUMMER"

Got cut off because we were a large group that had a large tab even though no one showed signs of having been over served. Don't plan on returning at this point. Wish something close had a late kitchen, but at this point I'd rather have Top Ramen than go here to get food after 10. Slow service and management that pretends to have people's best interests makes it a no. Food is good, but management that seems judgy makes it a no."

My first review came shortly after opening and we all know it takes time to get things in a good rhythm and sorted out, especially in the restaurant business.  The menu was a little odd to me when opening but has since won me over. They often have specials and have even opened up for lunch. Last weekend they had a crawfish boil at a very reasonable $7 lbs. The beer selection seems to be somewhat static, fortunately they have several to choose from, but it would be nice to have several rotating handles, given we are in one of the best craft beer markets around. I was a bit surprised to learn a local Pinthouse beer was $7. It's only a dollar more than at the brewery, but still, this isn't LA.  All and all, I like the direction this place is going, nice outdoor, dog friendly patio, food specials and hopefully some new local beers on my next visit."

Most places are these large indoor/outdoor spaces with music and food trucks. Or located downtown. Or you have to drive 30 plus minutes.  Vincent's Sports Pub is just down the road from home. It has plenty of TVs. I mean plenty. You can stand or sit anywhere in this pub and watch your game. AWESOME. A lot of thought was done here with the placement of TVs.  Service outstanding. A very friendly and nice Team. You like beer. You have choices. Lots of drafts and bottled beer choices. Great feel. Very welcoming pub. Plenty of tables. Great looking bar. Nice crowd. No jerks or muscle beer dudes. I judge a place if my wife would feel comfortable alone. Vincent's Sports Pub passes with high marks.  The food is very tasty. I had most of the apps and was very happy. Tasty. Great to share. Shrimp dish very good. Crispy. Wings have some pull and good. Nice pub menu. A scratch kitchen. I did not feel or taste it was a frozen product.  Vincent's Sports Pub will definitely be my go-to pub for drinks and sports on TV. It has a nice welcoming feel. Combination of design of the restaurant, the bar placement, the tables, food and most importantly the staff.  Plenty of parking. CC friendly. Union payment option."

Vincent's sports pub just opened recently inside a small shopping center that includes a nail place, a dental office, and a cosmetic store.   We met up on Wednesday around 4ish and the place was quite busy. I found a table near the bar and my friend showed up shortly after. The waitress handed us the drinks and cocktail menu for our viewing pleasure. The drink menu on the back included 31 drinks on tap to include cider options.  My friend and I ordered our drinks and those were a little slow coming out to us both times. My friend had a cocktail so that is more than likely the reason plus it was busy inside the bar. We didn't order any food but what I saw did look pretty good.   Overall I really liked this place and reminded me of place that I have been to down in Buda. Everyone seemed friendly and it was a down to earth bar. I foresee myself coming here again in the future."

                "description": "Great place with some really delicious food! We found this on a list of best burgers in Austin so put it on our radar. My wife isn't the biggest burger lover, she has to be in a very specific mood so it surprised me when she said she wanted to go give it a try.  The inside is pretty dark (it is a bar though so can't really fault them for that.) Have a small patio outside which is dog friendly. Though it is right off Burnet, the parking lot is a bit tricky and can easily be missed, especially during high traffic times.  The guy behind the bar was pretty friendly, especially when we told him how we found out about the place. We went during lunch so we kept it simple. Order of cheese curds and I got the Cobra burger and my wife got a basic beacon cheese burger.  First, these are by FAR my favorite cheese curds in town. The breading has a bit of a spicy kick to it that really makes them even more delicious. The burgers come with fries and a pickle spear. It was juicy and perfectly cooked. Great flavor and the Cobra burger has a good kick to it. My wife has literally been asking me to go back for the last 2 weeks so we went again today and it was all just as good as the first time. So check them out, just be cautious about the parking."

                "description": "Love this place.  We were looking for a place to watch the UT game and have a bite to eat Saturday morning and stumbled into Billy's. Great beer selection included our current go-to Electric Jellyfish.   For food we started with the cheese curds. Incredibly crispy. I'd put theirs up against Any I've had in Wisconsin.  Finished up with a cheeseburger and fries. Both were Shockingly good. Not just good for a dive bar, flat out legit.   Can't wait to go back."

                "description": "In the past we haven't had the greatest of experiences here but we decided to give them another try. It was  a very different experience this time and one that will keep us coming back. Our bartendereress, Mikey, was the sweetest person we've met in ages. She was extremely cheerful, very accommodating, and always kept a good close eye on this. We watched her interaction with other customers as well, and she always took such good care of everyone as if she had known them for a hundred years. The food menu is quite extensive, and everything we've had in the last few trips has been really good. Good Old Pub grub! The beer selection doesn't change as often as we'd like but at least they do keep some really good local or Regional beers on tap. Would like to see a few more selections switching in and out occasionally now they were hooked. Tonight we came in we weren't really too hungry but we needed to eat something so she suggested the chicken Philly which she was able to have split for us. It was actually very very good. We will definitely be regulars here. It's amazing what a bartender can do to bring business in, our last battle experience there was a bartender who seem to have a  snarky attitude, very opposite from Mikey!"

                "description": "Review for Billy's on Burnett  TLDR: a perfectly above average dive bar  For the food: I ordered Billy's \"The Shults\" burger. The wait time for the food was perfectly reasonable. The burger was well seasoned and well constructed. The only real complaint was the pickle on top was rather small and lackluster. The fries were fresh and crisp, and also well seasoned.   For the drinks: Billy's offers a more than ample beer menu with the common stock, as well as a decent selection of local breweries.   For the atmosphere: Billy's certainly fronts the image of a dive bar, and does so very well. Dimly lit, slightly crowded, and a prominent bar situated directly across the entrance all help establish the environment they want. The patio in the side is well shaded, and has much less road noise than I initially expected. The only complaint is the flies on the patio are out of control.   For the value: Given the location, I can't really blame Billy's for the prices. I feel like I payed a bit more than what I would have wanted for what I got, however, that feeling isn't uncommon in Austin in general, and especially Burnet.   Everything else: there's virtually no parking at Billy's, however there is some street parking within easy walking distance. And yet again, the flies on the patio are on another level."

                "description": "Billy likes Billy's on Burnet. It's a dark, divy beer bar with a solid food menu including many fried appetizers, from wings to okra, and myriad burger and sandwich options, even hot dogs and an entire column of veg-head choices. I myself enjoy the indulgence of a cobra burger w/fries and a fine Texas craft beer, of which there are many. The burgers are pretty darn good and the beer is cold, so what else do you need? Entertainment? Billy's has you covered with a pool table, darts, several TVs and some arcade games in the back. Other notes: there is a patio and a small parking lot, but there is street parking nearby."

                "description": "Aaron Franklin has long touted Billy's on Burnet as a superior restaurant for the best in burgers, and once again, he is correct about food.  The folks at Billy's did confirm that the James Beard Award winner is a regular.  The menu's, order source and pickup is at the bar.  We were clearly the only \"non-regulars\" there that day.  But, we were warmly greeted and walked through the extensive menu of burgers, sandwiches, and yes, beer options.  We will definitely be backed to try many of the other options.  The prices were very reasonable as fries come with the burgers.  The burgers were delicious, juicy and HUGE.  The burgers are served open faced.  If you like to cut your sandwich in half, the basket makes this a bit difficult.  The only downside, I gained a pound.  There is plenty of parking, the inside is much larger than we expected, and yes, it is a classic dive."

                "description": "Very disappointed by our experience for takeout tonight. My husband wanted a patty melt and I wanted a club sandwich. The online ordering and curbside pickup were easy and user friendly. The food, specifically my club was a big let down. I was expecting a traditional triple decker on toast style club. It was on a hoagie and even worse, there was a dark hair in the lettuce on my sandwich. Needless to say, lost my appetite after that, I tossed it. I added, in advance a 25% gratuity because that's how it works ordering curbside and during COVID19 I've been wanting to support local businesses and their staff. Won't be ordering takeout again."

                "description": "I went to Billy's for the first and last time on Sunday afternoon. They said they allowed dogs on their patio, so I figured I'd bring my well trained 3 year old pit/bulldog mix. Everything was great for 45 minutes. My dog met 3 other dogs and got some puppy rubs from about 5 patrons on the patio, and then everything changed in the blink of an eye.   An intoxicated man holding his toy dog stepped up onto the patio and immediately zoned in on mine. His dog growled at mine while my dog whined and wagged her tail because she just wanted to meet another dog. The intoxicated man sternly asked me if she was a rescue to which I replied \"no, I've had her since she was six weeks old.\" To which he replied \"Your dog is aggressive.\" I told him he was aggressive and he went all in and said \"if yOur dog touches my dog, I will slit it's throat.\" This quickly turned into a heated altercation where I knew something bad was going to happen if I stayed, so I removed myself from the situation.  I went into the bar to let them know that there was a disgruntled patron out on the patio that threatened to slit my dog's throat and the bartender asked who it was. I pointed him out through the window and she said \"Oh. He's a regular, that's so weird, he never acts like that.....\" and just shrugged.  As soon as I took one step out the door, this regular of yours, Stefan, got right back in my face, chest bumping  me, trying to rile me up by calling me insults and slurs. He went over the top and came out with the statement \"I can't wait for you to throw the first punch, so I can sue the shit out of you.\"  I'm a General Manager of another local restaurant and I understand the value of a regular customer, but sometimes if a regular oversteps their boundaries they need to be handled. Y'all are an establishment that's main priority is providing a safe environment for ALL of your customers, not just your regulars. Y'all could have prevented this whole situation from escalating and chose not to. I'm honestly more disappointed in your staff than I am with the situation with Stefan.  Out of my four years here, this was the worst Austin experience I've ever had. You guaranteed the fact that my friend and I will never return to be a potential regular for you because we shouldn't have to question our safety."

                "description": "I was very let down by my experience here. My friends raved how good this place was.   I walked up to the bar and explained it was my first time here and how did it work. The two people behind the bar, a heavily tattooed dude and a middle aged lady, were less than hospitable. I forget his exact words but something along the lines of what you see is what you get. I was waiting for my friend and just wanted to get a starter while I waited. I ordered the chili cheese fries. Lady says no, we don't have that bc of the water boil issue. I said ok. I asked if they just weren't doing appetizers. She said they were only doing fried things. (Correct me if I'm wrong but fries are fried, right?)  I said can I get queso and chips? - no.  Mmm ok can I get a blue moon- no.  I made a joke at this point bc it was awkward and like what the hell. I said I'm really striking out here. She said they had something similar and went to get it. Then this guy standing next to me orders chips and queso from the dude bartender. When the lady brought me my beer back I mentioned this and she freaked out on the dude bartender. I ruined the other guys opportunity to get queso and they made him order something else. Oops. Then I hesitantly asked if I could get frito pie. Finally I got a yes. But that yes makes no sense. I couldn't get chili cheese fries but I could get chili and cheese on Fritos? I walked away confused and put off.   My friend showed up and we decided to split a burger, we didn't even want to ask the employees what they recommended because of their foul, unhelpful, annoyed attitudes. Even my friend was like what the actual F. They were straight rude. We ordered a burger. The bun was soft and that's about it. Nothing special at all. Food was a 2, service was a 0 so as much as I hate to leave reviews like these, they get an overall 1.   Customer service, a smile, a friendly demeanor go a LONG way. Won't be giving this place a 2nd Chance."

Service was really fast, even when all the trivia people arrived/ ordered all at once. If you are coming for trivia/ an event, you need to get there really early for a table. If you are coming to just hang out, double check that there is not trivia/ an event that day. A few folks walked in, saw all of the tables packed and left.   Food reviews!  -Veggie burger: solid patty, hefty amount of avocado. Not the most interesting veggie burger, but definitely solid.  -Turkey Rueben: yum, devoured quickly -Chili cheese fries: Also yum, also devoured quickly. An excellent topping to fry ratio.  -Roast beef sandwich: The person who ordered this said it was good, but wasn't going to order it again. Said it was a little too greasy/ soggy.  - Fries: They are really well seasoned but they are also really unevenly cooked. One fry is perfect, the next one seemed almost raw."

How bout two bucks off any Real Ale draft on Thursdays. Here take your 4 stars Billy. Minus one star for being a Green Bay Packer Bar (kidding).   Billy's is a chill neighborhood bar to grab a bite and have a beer or two. Their draft selection is awesome with all your favorites plus a few that will surprise you. Checkout their burger menu it's pretty extensive. I opted for a boring cheeseburger with fries. Burger was cooked perfectly and served on a bed of spiced up fries and it paired perfectly with my pint of Real Ale amber. Will definitely return but not on a Packer game day (Go Pats!)."

                "description": "Round Rock struck gold with having this place open their second location here. In a sea of mediocrity surrounding this business ground, lies a place that offers not only fresh seafood, but actually chef driven concoctions that taste good! The environment has the ability to feel casual and formal at the same time. We couldn't score a table as a walk in, but they do have community tables which we ended up having to ourselves as a group of four. Our server had the memory of an elephant and had a way of elegantly displaying all the ingredients and preparations of any dish in question without feeling like he's reading a script. I ordered quite a bit and got to sample a generous variety of items.   They have a modest selection of raw oysters, with almost all of them being from the east coast and residing from PEI. I imagine this has to do more with what their distributors can get their hands on, but I'm gonna guess they mostly stick to east coast oysters.   The crab fried rice doesn't look like anything special, but goddamn is this good! They use huge chunks of crab meat! The rice was fluffy, buttery, and the black garlic was a nice touch. I like that this isnt a mountain of a dish but rather an appetizer. Absolutely worth getting.   The Tuna tartare stack was much better than anything I imagined! Avocado slices on the bottom are aesthetically pleasing, but are an annoyance when your sharing among friends and don't want to destroy the structure of the stack to divide up the slices.  The peel and eat shrimp were my least favorite part of the meal. I really couldn't taste much of a shrimp flavor. You had to use the cocktail sauce in order to taste anything. Perhaps they didn't get the best batch in from their distributor, but I expect fresh shrimp to have more flavor than my ice water.   The Snapper collard was not exactly what I was expecting, so removing my expectations, it was good for what it was. I thought I was getting Hamachi Kama. What they serve is the whole collar of a snapper, breaded and deep fried. The meat off the jowls (if you can classify it as that) was flaky soft and juicy. The breading is reminiscing of a typical fish fry. It was good, but for my personal preference, its not something Id go out of my way to order.  They offer some good guacamole. They give you what seems like three whole avocados worth in the bowl. The chips they provide do taste good, but they have terrible structure for the thick guacamole you're attempting to scoop up. I ended up having to use a spoon to distribute the guac on any chip I ate.   Bbq shrimp was not at all what I was expecting. Yes the shrimp itself was good, but the sauce they use in it was a umami explosion of flavor. I could drank a gallon of that stuff. I keep the plate and sopped up as much sauce as I could with the grilled bread they provided.   Ceviche tostada was excellent. Well dressed, plenty of meat, plenty of veggies, and full of flavor. They give you two small tostadas, rather than one large chip.    The bread and butter was ok, but I personally think the bread was a little tough. I do like that it was sourdough and could smell it. The whipped butter is standard and nothing to comment on.   I didn't order any of their cocktails, since none of them interested me, but my friends told me they make well concocted drinks.  While the experience itself had some tiny missteps, it would be a misrepresentation not to give this place glowing accolades, especially considering the other options nearby."

                "description": "I came across Salt Traders while looking for some good eats in the Round Rock area and after eating there I felt the experience was underwhelming. The food wasn't bad, but not as good as I was expecting. My fish and shrimp platter had pretty decent flavor but barely had much shrimp or fries.   The grilled oysters were the biggest highlight of my experience here. I enjoyed those more than I thought I would and would recommend ordering them as a starter. I am assuming they don't use the gulf oysters that they serve for these because the texture, size, and flavor felt pretty different."

                "description": "We were headed to IKEA and decided to have lunch nearby. I was able to convince my husband to try something new and he is very thankful for that  It was past 1pm on a Friday and this place was already packed. The decor is pretty nice. It has this coastal vibe that immediately transports you to the shore.  I asked for a gluten free menu and they do have one! Win!  Right away our server brought us the smoked salmon sampler. For my husband with chips, for me with a cucumber as I'm gf. I ordered the clam chowda and it was simply AMAZING. The best one I have eva had! It is very creamy, a bit on the salty side which is never a problem for me, the clam wasn't chewy and the bacon was a great addition. The leeks just added a bit more flavor to that. It's perfect. I would highly recommend you try it.  For mains my husband went with the fried shrimp , fish and fries and he said it was phenomenal. I could only take a picture when he had already had all the shrimp. As you can see the fish fillet is very thick, therefore it's really moist inside. He also said the tartar sauce was outstanding with the perfect addition of lime to break the fat of the mayo.  I had the pan seared scallops with butternut squash purée, roasted sweet corn and bacon bits. The flavor profile was really interesting. Scallops were very fresh and with that awesome sear on the outside, but still very moist on the inside. The butternut squash brings some sweetness to play which goes very well with the corn and we have the crispy bacon to add some saltiness and also some more texture to the plate. Just wish there was a bit more food.  For dessert we had the flourless chocolate cherry pie. Thank God for gf options!!! And also some decaf coffee. The towelettes just add that additional care to the whole service and more charm to the place.  I highly recommend this place!"

                "description": "Each time I come here, it's always pretty busy and crowded. Today, it was quite the opposite. I guess Texas folks ain't about this cold life (me either, truth be told). Anyways, we had reservations for 3:30 but arrived like 2:45 and was seated immediately. If you know me, then you know I love my seafood. And I literally come and binge on the appetizers.   Well nothing have changed, seafood is still amazing, drinks are great and services is outstanding!"

                "description": "This restaurant is a 5 out of 5 for me. I absolutely enjoy eating here. The raw oysters are always my favorite to snack on (tip: on Mondays, their gulf oysters are only $1). I've also tried their chowda fries which are delicious. It's everything you would expect with chowder but better because you also get fries (this dish itself can be heavy and filling). Definitely one to try if you're looking for something to warm your soul. Their lobster roll is good too. I love the lobster meat but I wish they served it as a warm, hot sandwich rather than the chilled one. Nonetheless, still delicious!   Now don't get me started on their dessert which is also worth noting here. All their desserts are made in-house but there is one that really hits the spot. This dessert has a warm chocolate brownie topped with a scoop of Vanilla ice cream and drizzled with caramel. If heaven was a dish, that would be it because it just transports you into another world. Worth saving some room in your stomach for!"

                "description": "We've been a fan of Salt Trader's Costal Cooking in RR since their opening five years ago and not surprisingly we dine there 2-1 over Jack Allen's, our previous go-to place. We've never had a less than wonderful experience there with the diverse menu and bold bright flavors and textures of amazingly prepared seafood and American cuisine and wonderful drinks.  The newly transformed Flat Top Fish Tacos are unbelievably good as the two hearty tacos are prepared Birria style with caramelized cheese crust on the flour tortilla and with substantial amount of grilled black drum with a street corn filling along with the cup of aromatic tomato-shrimp soppin broth and tomatillo-lime rice with pickled chilis.   Other favorites include Grilled Oysters and Fried Oyster Lettuce Wraps for Starters and the  Fish Enchiladas and of course fresh Oysters and Daily Specials and Seasonal Deserts.  FLAT TOP FISH TACOS 17 crispy cheese flour tortilla, street corn,  tomatillo lime rice, pickled chilis,  charred tomato-shrimp soppin' broth"

The service was on point and the food was plated beautifully. It felt very decadent and I don't even care for seafood. I personally recommend the hush puppies.

I've eaten here probably a dozen times, sometimes with a group and other times with my husband, at busy times and relaxed times, weekends and during the week.

I also wish they had a stronger horseradish. Their horseradish came shredded instead of as a sauce, and it barely had a taste. The ceviche was great and so were the hush puppies, but I personally wish the hush puppies had more corn. We also ordered drinks- The Rum Around and Frozen Grapefruit Rita- which were really good and strong."

                "description": "We found ourselves in Round Rock, TX on a recent Saturday, early evening, so we decided to stop by Salt Traders Costal Cooking on IH 35.  We found a couple of open seats at the bar.  Our first orders were a couple of craft cocktails, the Gin and Housemaid Tonic and The Rum Around.  Both were good, but upon reflection, for the price, regular cocktails would have sufficed.    We kind of went crazy on appetizers, having Gulf oysters, grilled oysters, crab fingers, and the crudo plate, which was yellowfin.  All of those dishes were \"off the chart\" crazy good, with the exception of the crudo ... the white sauce used was way too sweet for the awesome fish.    When we finally ended up at the main section of the menu, we ordered the fried oyster lettuce wraps and the simply grilled fish of the day, which was redfish.  The tartar sauce served with the lettuce wraps was delicious, but a bit too much was slathered on the wraps.  IMHO put a dash on the lettuce leaves and let the patron add as desired from the small cup of tartar sauce that comes with the dish.  The redfish was terrific, but no one knew why the place would have farm-raised redfish from the Indian Ocean when we have fresh redfish 200 miles away in the Gulf of Mexico?    Keeping it local, we ordered the Becker Vineyard Reserve Viognier, and it was delicious.  In closing, a special shout out to our waiter Nathan behind the bar, service was attentive but not intrusive, so nice to have a great waiter with a great attitude!"

                "description": "Really high end modern cuisine in an unexpected area. North Round Rock really isn't the place you'd think of for high quality seafood and a great classy bar scene, but that's exactly what this place had.  My wife had the scallops and they were seared perfectly and tender in the middle. Couldn't ask for better.  I had a fish sandwich, but I'm picky so I did it without the slaw, which was a mistake because it needed the crunch and the sauce. I'm sure it would be a 10/10 with that.  Definitely go to this place. We were treated like gold and the food was excellent!"

                "description": "For my birthday, I chose to visit Salt Traders. We hadn't been there in a little while, and good seafood is always a treat.   My husband and I arrived in the early side, during happy hour (3:30-6:30 on a Thursday), so we could enjoy a leisurely meal. We started with drinks. I had the frozen grapefruit margarita, which tasted like a regular margarita. I loved that the salt on the glass also had citrus peel.  Our appetizer ($5 off during happy hour) was pot stickers. They were excellent, and the portion size (6) just right for sharing. The sauce was wonderful.   I ordered one of the day's specials for dinner, seared monkfish. It was served over fingerling potatoes and topped with a great salsa. The monkfish was tasty  but a bit on the chewy side... and the potatoes were barely undercooked. My husband had fish and chips, always a good choice at Salt Traders.  Dessert was vanilla creme brulee topped with peach sorbet. Excellent!   Service was excellent. We enjoyed Patrick's sense of humor and the stories he told.   We will be back again, without a doubt!"

                "description": "Idle Hands are the Devil's playthings!  This Rainey Street Bar is a cool place to lounge out, relax with some Cuban drinks, and enjoy some live music! They've got a small stage set up in the front, to entice people to join them on their elevated patio, which is covered in astroturf. I'm not sure that the place is handicapped accessible, since you have to climb stairs to get in.  The interior looks like some sort of coffee shop. There's a bar where they're pouring imaginative drinks. In the rear, there's an outdoor patio that's a bit more intimate than the front patio. The place is clean, and well lit.  It's a fun place to hang out under the shade of their big oak tree and relax in the sunlight. The vibe here is always relaxed and chill. They serve bar food here, but I didn't opt for any when I came. Think Cuban fare, with burgers and fries."

                "description": "We visited for the first time during SXSW week, due to the bands they had booked for their outdoor stage. Several of these were bands that draw a sizable crowd (think festivals or medium sized halls), and unfortunately Idle Hands isn't set up for that kind of crowd. Not even close. People were lined up waiting to get in and they were at capacity.   The open patio is out front, shaded by oaks, and covered with astroturf. It's not big, by any means. The stage is a small dugout box that instead of being raised, seems to be sunken down below patio level. So if there's a sizable crowd, you may be able to see the tops of the band members' heads onstage, unless you are 6'5\". Maybe. This might be okay for a sparse crowd, but these weren't sparse crowds, and I have a feeling that Rainey Street often draws crowds.  That particular day, there were giant costumed sports characters trying to make their way through the wall-to-wall crowd. They couldn't really see through their costumes, so they knocked over some things and bumped into people who were trying to watch the bands. It isn't a kid venue, so it wasn't clear why they were there. They may have been wondering the same thing.   The indoor area looks like a modern coffee shop cafe, and they have a full bar. We did not try the food. Our mixed drinks were well balanced and tasty. Some staff were friendly, others were just not, to the point that it left a fairly negative impression of the place.   This week at Idle Hands for us was a two star experience. Others have had a better time when visiting on less busy times and for reasons other than seeing live music shows that draw a crowd. So keep in mind that your mileage may vary, depending on the day and your goals for your visit.   Rainey Street has a lot to offer within a couple of blocks, much like the West 6th Street of old, before the live music scene moved east of I-35. So if you don't find what you want here, you might find it close by."

When we walked in, everything felt perfect so we booked it on the spot.    We had some random requests like being able to adjust the music volume, film in the space, have dedicated security, and have a custom drink and glass (photo attached).  Idle Hands was able to accommodate everything (thanks Matt!).  During the event, Gabriel from Idle Hands helped ensure all of our guests were well-attended to.  Everything went super smooth, if you're considering a private event, you're in good hands with Idle Hands :)"

And as a bonus they have live music almost every night!!    My faves: The Painkiller - it goes down way too easy.  The Lover Boy - a killer chorizo-infused burger that will make your mouth water.   Lots of great staff and be sure to save room for the dessert! Tyler is an amazing baker who makes all the desserts for this place. The cheesecake was incredible!!   A few words about Covid restrictions - I've seen most of the bars on Rainey - almost none of them are following the protocols. I feel like this place is the exception. No lines or large groups gathering on top of each other inside. Outside seating spaced well. Staff all have on masks. That plus the food, drinks and service mean I'll be back many more times. The menu evolves some too, always like a place willing to add and try new things while keeping some of the faves on the menu.  Thank you Idle Hands - finally something good out of 2020!"

                "description": "Nice joint on Rainey which punches above its weight in terms of drinks and food. Rainey in general is a bit of a mixed bag but this place was surprisingly good.   They have a Cuban food focus and use an interesting ticket system with every drink you get that you can redeem for food (probably to ensure enough food sales to stay open during Covid). I had about 4 Painkillers, a properly dangerous pineapple/coconut/orange and rum drink that was delicious. Summery is the best way to describe a lot of their cocktails.   Had some of the best fried plantain chips I've ever had with guacamole and ceviche. My only complaint was I wish they had comfier seating for hanging out and it ended up shortening our time we spent there (lots of high chairs and hard back seats). They dont have a decent back deck like a lot of Rainey places do so the seating was mainly up front where speakers were blasting, including the neighboring businesses music. So it ended up being a little chaotic.   Either way its a nice spot. Service, drinks and food were great so I think we'll drop by again."

Read all these reviews raving about it and thought it'd be better. I guess y'all were smashed from the fancy cocktails lol. It wasn't bad, just didn't really standout and for $12 for a burger and fries, I think there's better options in town. My fault for expecting culinary excellence from what I assume is a bar kitchen."

                "description": "LADIES, if you want to feel uncomfortable, if you want to be harassed, assaulted and invalidated this is the place to go! The manager Tyler is incompetent and does not care about the well being of his customers.   Never going back to this bar again and I suggest you don't either.   Been coming to this bar for years with no issues, ever and have spent SO much money here (I live on Rainey). The staff have always been great until...  Tonight I had a group of young girls create a conflict with my group of friends for no reason. They swarmed our table and harassed us - pulled my friends hair, STOLE MY FRIENDS PHONE and, on top of that, a man that was part of this group forcefully grabbed my arms. The bouncers did nothing to get our phone returned nor remove a girl who pulled my friends hair and was cursing me out and flipping me off. They made me sound crazy when I asked for help. My voice did not matter. I asked to see the cameras and conveniently there are no cameras located in the front (which is absurd given that this is where all the tables and chairs are). It is one thing that these mean girls tried to start conflict with me and my friends for no reason, but this man grabbed my wrists so hard that I could not move and I had to front kick him in the stomach to get away. This is not okay under any circumstance and the fact that the bouncer and manager turned a blind eye is disgusting.  I wish there were cameras because I would press charges. This is so incredibly degrading as a woman and I am still shook that appropriate action was not taken."

                "description": "This is a generous two star offering. Love the location, the great local talent playing on the porch and our drinks were very tasty.   Big however...  The food was pitiful. The black bean burger was an oversized sopping, crumbly mess with zero flavor and the fries were cold and uneventful. The ranch may as well been runny, salty mayo. My lady pal got the plantain chips with guacamole. They gave us tortilla chips with guacamole. My guy friend went in to ask for the plantain chips that they were supposed to come with. He took a photo with his phone of the chips and dip to show the bartender and he practically laughed in my buddies face and mocked his photo taking as a means to justify his request (he's in production and art, okay? Let the guy make art and an example of your crappy food).   The man brought us the plantain chips out a few moments later to go with the guacamole. Which was the worst guacamole I've had. Del Taco makes better guacamole. Salt? Lime? Heat? Maybe just try to make it flavorful...  Oh and the quinoa bowl-- that one veggie thing. What the heck even was that? It had no sauce; oil or spices to bind together what was basically a sad bowl of vegetables and bitter arugula.   Way off the mark with the food, guys. Good thing the music was kickin' and the mezcal ritas were nice n' zesty.   Get drinks and an earful or music and skip the food. All 3 of our dishes were very weak."

My roommate and I came from SF, CA, and on our second night we randomly stopped here because of the live music - who actually was a contestant on the voice!! WOW!!!! We ordered \"That One Healthy Thing\" and some very specific drinks made by Brennan. He is an amazing bartender! I hope if the owner sees this, he/she gives him a fat raise.

Someone at our table spilled a cocktail and they replaced it quickly and for free!  One cool thing about this bar is that they give you tickets every time you order a drink, and tickets add up to be free food items! Their fries and chips/queso were good.

                "description": "I can't comment on the bar itself since I didn't get the chance to drink there, but it's decent burger at a great price.  The burger itself was overcooked and dry; I don't know if this is normal, if the kitchen was having a bad series, or if the customer can request medium-rare.  Something to consider for next time.  And there should be a next time too, because this is still a great deal: burger + side for under $10.  Sure, it'd be nice if cheese wasn't an upcharge, but that's really a minor quibble.  Inside, the décor is funky and vibey, much like the other restaurants and shops in this North Loop neighborhood.  What stands out most inside is the massive album art print from Stone Temple Pilots's Purple.  Thanks to this, I haven't been able to get \"Interstate Love Song\" out of my head for the past four days."

                "description": "Came here with the coworkers on a Friday right after work. This is a great spot with an outdoor seating area in BOTH the front and the back (which I didn't know at first).  Their drinks are pre-California exodus cheap, so grab a beer or two or three. They also have grub. There's plenty of burgers to choose from, a coworker said their portobello burger is bomb. I got the burger special, which was arugula and blue cheese. My burger was slightly overcooked and a coworker's was well-done, so you'll have to be mindful of that; if you like yours med-rare or medium, I would call it out. I thought they were pretty generous with the blue cheese, but the burger itself could have been slightly larger; they're thick but relatively tiny. Buns are toasted. I think next time I'd go with one of the classic burgers since I felt the burger special was really heavy, the arugula doesn't bring enough balance for the funkiness of the blue cheese. The parmesian fries were alright, a tad too salty for me.  The guys behind the bar were nice, a bee got stuck in my bottle and they kindly replaced it.  PARKING: there's a few spots out front, but there's plenty of parking around the corner in the residential area.  Come for the drinks, stay for vibes."

                "description": "It's a good dive, with tons of beer on tap and surprisingly good food. Lots of vegetarian options too. Service is pretty decent considering how grungy the place is.   However: I definitely got at least one drink in a dirty ass glass, and the kitchen staff is, shall we say, pretty casual about food hygiene. And yet I still liked it somehow. Maybe because so many other places in present-day Austin are just gentrification normie hellscapes-- this is a nice change of pace."

The seating is a bit hodge podge cabin lodge so you might find yourself standing if it's crowded, but as is the case anywhere that's solid. All the drinking options for all the drinking types. The burgers look legit, but I didn't have one.  Bundle up and throw 'em back."

I guess they don't care about this pandemic at all.  I watched the cook scratch his head, grab his phone and text then started to assemble a burger without a care in the world or concern for cleanliness.  So if I were you I would eat before I go to this establishment."

You can order everything from burgers to mac and cheese to sandwiches. There's even veggie options for those of you who are vegetarian! The fries are great. The beers are awesome and there's a big selection.  It is pretty hot here here though, especially outside during the summer. I love the location and sometimes it's hard to find parking but it's a great spot for a beer and some food. It does get crowded but the service was still quick."

                "description": "I have been to the Workhorse Bar three times before yesterday, and those experiences were all 3-4 stars.  But this most recent visit was teetering on between 2-3 stars.    I ordered the White Manhattan, which has always been awesome!  This visit it tasted like they poured me a glass of watered down Moonshine and added a twist of Orange.  I ordered a second one just to make sure it was just not a bad pour.  Nope the second one was as bad as the first. The odd thing is they bartender who made them both, was the same bartender who has made them for me on my prior visits.     We were also quite bothered by the loud group behind us slamming their cards on the table as they played some unknown card game.  They were overly loud and obnoxious.  We were not the only customers who were annoyed.  The other pet peeve I have is when large groups of people stand at the front door of an entrance to smoke cigarettes.  On this visit there was always a group of 3-7 people puffing away well within 15 feet of the front door.  People...please go smoke out back on the patio.  The upside of this visit was the music from the jukebox.  For $2 we were able to select 8 tunes.  Music selection is random, but good."

                "description": "Workhorse is the perfect little neighborhood bar. It has a fairly large and very affordable selection of drinks, an all-around-the-clock \"happy hour\", great bar food and a nice staff! They also have a jukebox (select 4 songs for a dollar) and a patio in the back.   In the food department, they've got a good selection of sides and appetizers, as well as burgers, salads and fries. Vegetarians will be pleased to find out they have several veggie options, including two types of veggie burgers and many sides. The food is cheap and tasty. I don't know about you, but for me that's getting pretty close to my definition of heaven!   If you want available seating space for the duration of your stay, I recommend visiting between Monday and Thursday. Friday and weekends are very popular nights and you might not be able to find a cozy spot to sit, although that goes for most bars.  If you pass by the North Loop strip one evening, you should definitely drop by and have a taste of Workhorse."

It's located in such a chill part of Austin, so it's perfect when you feel like going out, but not going out (if you know what I mean)! They have a ton of beers on tap and handful of yummy sounding cocktails. We didn't eat here, but when we saw their blue cheese bacon burger with huge azzz onion rings on the side we were wishing we did! It was totally embarrassing, but my husband accidentally spilled his first beer on the bar and the bar tender did a great job at not acting completely annoyed at him, although he was. He even poured him another which we were not expecting at all, so that added to our great experience here! Highly recommend, but only if you're not a high-maintenance little princess because it definitely has some grunginess to it ;)"

                "description": "So this was our last stop in Texas and WOW! I am so glad that we had our anniversary dinner here. Yes, it is reservations with a deposit. I am not aware of whether or not they accept walk-ins. However, they were accommodating when I had to make a sudden time change that very day. They were able to make it work with our new time-frame with even better seating. So I take that as a win-win.   It was a set tasting menu of 10 courses with 2 of them being dessert dishes. We did not do the wine pairings because we were enjoying the cocktails. You can add a couple of supplements if you do not think that the 8 other plates will fill you up. Some of them were small (bite-size) plates. We did order two supplements with our dishes and I think that was honestly the perfect course.   Food was amazing, I cannot explain how delicious and how different everything was. But it all flowed together. Even our supplements, they made sure to give them to us at the perfect time.   Service was great. We were lucky enough to sit at the bar area so it felt like we had someone there for us at all times. They made sure to explain every course to us and even gave us some background to our drinks and the restaurant itself.   Yes, it is very pretty pricey. You need a $50 deposit per person and the supplements and cocktails are not part of the meals. The wine pairing is also an additional cost.  However if you're looking for a nice, and delicious place to possibly celebrate a special occasion this is the place to do that."

Expensive, though. For two people, it was $330 (includes $50 tip) I've never spent that much on dinner for two before. (Eberly in South Lamar was previously my most expensive meal.)  I'd definitely go back, but likely only for special occasions. They said menu changes up for the seasons, so maybe we'll see them again in the summer.   FYI: $100 deposit for reservation gets deducted from total."

                "description": "Barley Swine really know how to keep you guessing! Their technique and execution of dishes are pretty unique to what you typically expect from a nice restaurant.  Highlighting the top three dishes from the prefix menu, which they only do now since COVID.  Tostada has a nice crunch and the fish was fresh with a pop of acid!  The duck was so juicy and prepared how duck should be rare with the fat of the skin rendered out a bit. Never had chili oil with duck and it was incredible! It gave it an Asian like vibe to the dish.  The mushroom dumplings are an add on and are worth it if you love mushrooms! The umami bomb in these unique rectangular dumplings was unexpected! And the  baby spatula to scoop the sauce over them was something I never experienced before.  Overall head to Barley Swine for a nice meal that won't completely empty your bank account!"

It did not disappoint! The tasting menu flow was perfect. We started our evening with some delicious small bites. Our fav main course dishes of the night were the tostada, Muscovy duck and dry aged Akaushi ribeye. Duck is usually not my fav thing on a menu but their Muscovy duck with sweet potatoes was my fav dish of the night. I was literally licking the plate clean. Service was outstanding, they were constantly prepping for the next dish. It really was an experience like no other. If I had to pick on something, it would be the desserts. I was not a fan and for me, dessert is an important finish to a meal. I highly recommend this restaurant!"

It is very well managed--huge shout to the Manager Stefan who guided us through the menu and went above and beyond to make our experience a special one.  Their tasting menu is so good and well curated - every plate was perfection and no detail was overlooked.  The tasting menu comprised of the following:  Appetizers:  2 year aged country ham on mini pancakes (yes mini pancakes), Deviled Egg, Tamale and Spicy Beef. The Tamale is like no tamale I've ever had!  Main Course: tostada crudo, black cod, muscovy duck, Dry aged Akaushi ribeye/donut. Everything was delicious but the ribeye/donut is out of this world! Probably one of the best plates I've ever had.   Desert: Caramelized fennel ice cream/caraway/ orange and Butternut cake/curry spice.   Not only is the food outstanding, the ambiance was very thoughtfully curated (lighting, sound and architecture).  We are lucky to have such an incredible restaurant in Austin."

We were not at all impressed by the food. The atmosphere was nice and the bar tender we had was amazing. To add to that the cocktails were refreshing. So we were excited to dive into the food.  Fast forward to our first serving  My wife threw up the mussels and then after that she just wasn't pleased.  Being a foodie I was shocked that she was so let down.   I was expecting to have a bomb of flavor explode in my mouth.  The duck and rib eye were chewy and she left more than half the food on her plate each time.  The bartender noticed and asked to box it for us.  Needless to say our dog enjoyed it.    Not worth the time nor the money.  We won't be back and will spread the word"

They were incredible and the bonus was getting a view of the amazing kitchen and the crew! This experience was truly remarkable and the price points were perfect! They were warm, welcoming and listened to my likes and dislikes and accommodated accordingly. Barley swine would certainly be one of the key reasons why I would move here.

                "description": "Currently my favorite restaurant in Austin, Barley Swine offers a tasting menu that beautifully combines Texas flavors with upscale plating and technique. If you want to impress an out-of-towner with a nice meal while also showing giving them an accurate and varied taste of Texas, this is the place.  There are so many dishes with lots of components, and so it's difficult to break down every dish (particularly because the menu changes often enough that any specifics will likely be obsolete by the time you end up eating here), but I can say that in the multiple times I've been here, I've had some iteration of a tamale in the small bites, a fish course, a duck course, and Akaushi steak for the final savory course. Some tasting menus have highs and lows, but Barley Swine's seems to get gradually better with every course.   If you can afford to do so, I highly recommend adding their shiitake dumplings with soft scrambled eggs. It sounds like a strange combination, but it's a shockingly good umami bomb that should be experienced at least once. While the menu changes throughout this year, this dish has become something of a signature for them, and once you try it, you'll know why.  The service here is extremely unpretentious considering the caliber of food they're serving. Servers don't even have set uniforms. Everyone just looks and acts like Austin foodies who are happy talk about and share food with you, and I love that.   If you're as comfortable having wine as you are sipping on cocktails, then the choice between the wine pairing or having their house cocktails is an extremely difficult choice. Both options are awesome, but unless you're looking to get messy drunk in an upscale restaurant, one option precludes the others. Gun to my head, I'd probably opt for the wine pairing, if only because it potentially gives you access to 20+ year old bottles that you'd have a hard time finding. But I'll be damned if their \"Follow the Leader\" (a corn infused mezcal cocktail) isn't one of the most intriguing drinks I've had in this city.  While the snobs at Michelin don't think Austin is worth considering, I wholly believe that Barley Swine is as good as a lauded place like Gramercy Tavern in NYC, and it easily beats the shit out of some of the formerly Michelin starred restaurants in Las Vegas (stares shadily at Picasso). The atmosphere is inviting; the food is exciting; and the flavors are quintessentially Texan."

                "description": "My husband and I have been watching way too much Top Chef, so we wanted to treat ourselves to a special meal. I'm so glad we chose Barley Swine!   I'll start with the service, which is top-notch. When we arrived, we were warmly welcomed by the crew and shown to our bar seats. I wanted to sit there because you get to see into the kitchen. It was really fun being able to watch the chefs in action. Our servers were both very attentive and knowledgeable about the wine and food. You feel like it's all very personalized just for you which makes it feel all the more special.   As for the food, they're only serving the tasting menu right now, but that's definitely the way to go. It allowed us to try a bunch of different flavors, and it was nice not having to think about what to order. They start you off with four amuse-bouche dishes. My favorite was the (raw) spicy beef over a kerupuk style beef cracker. Then you get a crudo and fish course. The crudo was great but honestly the fish was over cooked. That said, their sauces are bomb so I still enjoyed it. Some of the other dishes that were particularly tasty was their beef and donut combo and the sorbet. The whole meal was nicely paced and flavors were complementary.   Definitely do yourself the favor and enjoy a meal here soon."

                "description": "OMG - flavor bomb!!!   We had the tasting menu of 9 courses (some one bite) and wine pairings.  First of all, fantastic pairings.  Each and every course was so creative, excellent style in how they present food but the flavor was outstanding.  I can't stop thinking about it.   House made salumi on masa cakes with cocoa nibs,  shishito pepper with a tempura batter stuffed; deviled egg filling on a nut cracker with trout roe and pickled green beans, Tostada crudo, beef tartare on mushrooms; black cod/mushroom/hatch chile dashi and smoked kale; muscovy duck/sweet potato; dry aged ribeye served with a savory donut with a brie like thing in the center; carmelized fennel ice cream, butternut squash cake with curry spice ice cream was to die for.  We also opted for the supplemental beef dumplings in a truffle sauce with freshly slides truffles and pea shoots.  We sat in the bar area and the service was outstanding by both bartenders!"

Always recommend grabbing a couple seats at the chef's table to watch the magic happen. Menu is ever changing but we really enjoyed the duck and wagyu this go round. Sit back, sip a fantastic cocktail and let the masters do their thing!"

Flavorful, with the different textures coming together in a way that was fun to eat. We also got the Kanpachi ribs and collar add on which was totally worth it! Service was great - prompt and our server described each dish really well before they came out. We sat right out front in a cozy spot next to the window! The decor was rustic and whimsical. It was my birthday so they provided a champagne toast for my date and I!"

                "description": "On a recent trip to Austin, I tried this place based on recommendations from Austinites.   I strongly suggest you make a reservation. We arrived about 15 minutes late, called to let them know, but we were still unable to get the type of table we had originally requested. You should also know, when making reservations they request a $50 per person reservation fee that is later taken off your total bill. For two tasting menus, one wine pairing, and three cocktails, the bill was $500.  This establishment is known for seasonal tasting menus that are in constant flux. They had two (usually there were three but they had run out of one) additional dishes that could be ordered on top of the tasting menu; but to be honest, the richness of the plates was sufficient enough to curb your hunger and make you feel full. The dishes were very creative. My absolute favorite were the small bites. They consisted of pierogi, radish bagel, tamale, and spicy beef. The texture of the pierogi was perfect, and the flavor was perfectly pickled. The radish bagel was fresh, light, and crisp. The tamale was a perfect fusion of Japanese and Latin all in one little bite. I could have used way more than one! My least favorite dish was the halibut, but the wine pairing made it more palatable. The duck was perfectly cooked, but when they mentioned that it was cooked with a sous vide for 48 hours, then seared over the grill, it made much more sense of how perfect it was!! The ribeye was a over cooked, chew, and tough to break down for my taste. It was served more medium that medium rare. My absolute favorite dish of the night was the poblano Texas sheet cake!! It was served with a peach sorbet (if I remember correctly), topped with chamoy, and garnished with sunflower seeds!! This was such a creative dish! And again, I could have eaten three of these!!   Overall, this was a great experience. The servers were attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly. I was thoroughly impressed with creativity behind each dish. I also LOVED that the restaurant is ZeroFoodPrint and Carbon neutral. I highly recommend this restaurant!"

They were gracious and willing to accommodate my preferences.  Once seated, we received a personalized menu with dietary notes and individual mask holders which I thought were nice extra touches.  We chose to add on the shiitake dumplings and were so glad we did. Definitely one of the standouts of the night. The scallop dish was also a hands down winner!  Recommend for a special evening out!"

However, the f was good, but not phenomenal, for the cost. We sat for 3 hours, which is about 1.5 hours longer than expected. I honestly don't think I would go back and 100% prefer Odd Duck. I wish I could rate this 3.5 stars."

                "description": "Love love loved my experience at Barley Swine! Whenever my boyfriend and I visit a new city, we like to do at least 1 tasting menu and this one was great! In comparison to other big cities, this tasting menu is pretty affordable but still a great experience. The tasting comes with 10 courses with optional add-ons you can choose for about $10-$15 each. Including the add-on's we had a total of 12 dishes: 1. Shrimp Dumpling: Plated very nicely and also extremely flavorful. One of my favorites 2. Radish bagel: The concept of this dish is not very unique but it still tasted SO good, I loved it. Basically a bagel, cream cheese, and a pickled cucumber on top lol. 3. Smoked kohlrabi: small but tasty 4. Spicy beef: Beef tartare served on a rice cracker. Really unique flavors and textures. I didn't expect to like this one (not a huge fan of beef tartare) but this was great! 5. Crudo with Fruit Vinegar: Raw fish with smoked watermelon. The tastes in this dish were so unique and flavorful. I'd never imagine biting into a watermelon and getting that smoky flavor but it worked so well with the fish. 6. Halibut with Green Beans and Pecan: I must say this was my least favorite of the dishes but it was still not bad. The halibut just wasn't too flavorful 7. Muscovy Duck/Cured Leg: This course comes with 2 duck dishes. One is a plated piece of duck, the other is cured duck on a cracker. Both were so tasty! 8. Dry Aged Alaska Ribeye + Donut: This course also comes with 2 dishes. For one, a piece of ribeye which was small but so juicy. It also comes with a donut topped with some chopped pieces of beef which tasted great too! 9. Carrot rainbow sherbet: The first of 2 dessert courses, very unique and yummy 10. Chamomile buttermilk pie + Dewberry: I loved this dessert! Plated nicely and also so tasty Optional Add-Ons: 11. I HIGHLY recommend adding on the Shiitake Dumpling. This was recommended by our waitress as it's one of their classic dishes and I'm so glad we listened to her. I don't want to spoil anything for you because this dish has a nice surprise. Just trust me and get it ;) 12. Dry Aged Akaushi Beef Rib: This dish was tasty as well but nothing too special or fancy. I was already full with the initial 10 + Shiitake Dumpling Add-On so this wasn't necessary for us. If you're super hungry then maybe add it on.  For cocktails, we ordered the Peach Whiskey Smash, Acapulco Gold, and Barrel White Aged Negroni - all great!  In terms of ambiance and service, I'd also give 5 stars. The kitchen is open so you can see all the fun going on behind the scenes. We had several waiters serving each course, giving a great description of each, and answering any questions we had. Halfway through our meal, apparently there was some difficulty with the customers sitting next to us - which we honestly did not notice - but because of this, one of the waitresses gave us a free wine pairing with the halibut dish. I greatly appreciated that they went out of their way to make sure we were having a good experience.  Will definitely come back next time we're in Austin! 10/10"

The decor was great and inviting, they have a theme of pickling everything so a lot of jars around, it looks cool with the lighting.   Staff was very cheerful and pleasure to be around, they were still following Covid distance protocols regardless of the full capacity mandate now. My family and I truly appreciated that.   The tasting menu was delicious, I'd highly recommend if your want to try and not of everything on the menu, the donuts and the braised ribs were by far the star dishes. I would highly recommend this establishment.   Enjoy!"

It's also a rooftop setting which gives it an awesome ambiance and makes you want to stick around for a while.  Our bartender (I believe his name was Brandon) was super nice and chatted with us. They have a giant Operation game that actually works, as well as giant Connect 4 and giant Jenga. A few TVs are behind the bar showing sports. They have an old cigarette machine once you reach the top of the stairs and I'm pretty sure it still works.   The entrance is on the sketchy side especially when you're 4 females walking in around midnight on a Wednesday. The sign outside on ground level is tiny and only says Shiner. Inside the door is an ATM machine. Then it's a loft-style staircase all the way up to the roof/bar. Once you climb the stairs it's like Disney World. I definitely would have spent another evening here if we were in Austin longer."

When the weather is nice, it's the perfect spot to kick back and be urban cool. They also have a large beer list that includes a few hard ciders too. However, if you want food, go to another top rated a BBQ spot and then head here for the rooftop."

                "description": "I've never written a negative review before as I typically find them to be petty. I this case it's well warranted.  My bandmates and I played a SXSW show here on 3/16/19. When loading in, the entrance was unstaffed and we simply loaded our gear up the stairs. No problem.  Loading out was entirely different. As I'm coming down the stairs, clearly loading out with gear in hand, I witness a door person yelling at my bandmate \"Get the f*** out! Get the f*** out!\" and aggressively walking towards him. His tirade did not end there. Keep in mind, it's obvious that we're loading out as we're leaving the establish with guitars, amps and various other gear. And we're doing so directly in front of the door person. He knows very well who we are.  As I'm walking back in, the bar manager is coming down and I calmly tell him that the door person is being needlessly aggressive. Instead of attempting to de-escalate the situation, he begins arguing with us, claiming that we hadn't been ID'd. First, they weren't ID'ing at 4:30 when we arrived. Second, even if you believe him, there's no excuse to respond by yelling, screaming, cursing and intimidation.  What he failed to realize is that under no circumstance is it necessary or appropriate to react in that way. Period.   This place, at least on this occasion, is staffed and managed by people that can only be described as unprofessional and unhinged, and in absence of even the smallest amount of self discipline, potentially dangerous.  There are better places to see shows. There are better places to get a drink. There are better humans at virtually any other establishment.  Don't waste your money here."

                "description": "Flew into Austin on a Wednesday and got a tip that there's a bar that does Whiskey Wednesdays... it turns out it was Shiner's Saloon! The good: a friendly enough bartender that served us $1 whiskey and soda's. I mean come on, that's a great deal. But I was left really disappointed with the brisket nachos. This is a BBQ town right, so where was the brisket? I could barely find it in my plate of chips and cheese. It was good enough for bar food, but I really expected better. Then again, they did have free live music. This place is smack dab inbetween a 3* and 4* review, but the subpar nachos sways me today to give them a 3*."

They were out of sliders and pepperoni rolls. The tacos were OK but not great.  Beer selection was good.   We came for the atmosphere and were underwhelmed.   Win or lose a Steelers bar should be rocking.   Cheers for the turnovers, but no encouragement or even yelling at the TVs."

                "description": "This is a place that has been on my bucket list for a few years and we finally tried it and will be back again. The facility is pretty cool as far as decor. Clearly, an architect was involved in the design with ample seating in dining areas, bar and outside. The staff is young and enthusiastic. Our server whose name is pm b (Kinda funny name) was particularly nice and accommodating . My wife ordered the Ruben and I got the pimento burger and both were quite satisfying. Being a former restaurant owner/operator, I appreciated our server's knowledge of the menu. They use a team system here which I love so when your food is ready, it is delivered immediately.  I have only two suggestions that could make for a better experience: 1. people working the bar; Don't throw the empty liquor bottles in the trash. The loud crash is unsetteling. 2. Management, dont let your modern attractive facility get seedy. Our seat cushions in the bar area should have been repaired long ago. This isn't a big expense. and look for other signs of wear around the interior.  Clearly, this is a popular place and we will be back."

I live in the area and I do want this place to thrive. We are lacking in places like this. I'd like to chalk it up to staffing but I have been to dozens of restaurants in the past two years that have surely have had staffing issues and this is the first one I've written about on this medium.   The food is great, the drinks are great but I really got turned off on the service here. I just sat at the bar for a couple drinks and a small meal. The bartender was horrible. Not with the efficiency, but wow, it was all about her. I heard her say the following things to other staffers: \"welcome to hell\". \"If he's not here, I'll walk out\". Constantly criticizing the bar setup from a previous shift (which I'm sure was a result of similar staffing issues she was facing).   I asked her name and I think she said \"heather\" but she just mumbled that and walked away. So quickly that I knew she was just pissed at the world. While she was so obviously busy by the account of her commentary, she definitely had time to shake drinks in a mixer so loudly around the entire bar in a rhythmic fashion to get everyone to look at her. It was the \"heather\" show.   Couldn't handle it."

Food is what knocks this down a bit. I got the biscuits and gravy which was wayyyy to much biscuit for the amount of gravy given. Getting the chicken added is a must.   The carnitas poutine was super salty. I get that both things are meant to be like that, but this was just too much. I wish there was more pickled onions and jalapeños to balance it out.   The happy hour menu and times looked pretty good, so I'd definitely return to try that out."

Ousthouse is consistent and you will never have a bad time. Recently had their Shepards Pie. Rarely have I... fantasized... about a dish; reminisced about their unique take on a classic. My wife, who lives abroad for a time, even stated that it was made better here than by our friends across the pond. We are excited to see this business grow and adapt their dishes more. As we are a multicultural household, we would love to see more Persian Cuisine take center stage on the menu. My only critique is that the cocktails could us a refresh."

However, it's laid back, chill atmosphere, and modern feel makes it a great spot for almost any occasion.  The food was pretty good. I did get something i could make at home. However everything was cooked nicely apart from the bacon. It was a little bit too charred for my taste. Potatoes were tasty, eggs standard, and the rye bread tasted more like a sour dough. But still good.   Mimosas were a good deal as well!   Overall we had a great time and most likely will return again!"

We were searching for some dog friendly spots and came across this gem! We sat on the front patio but when we left, we saw there was also a back patio that was a bit more lively! I also took a stroll around the inside and it has a super cool looking bar, great lighting and lots of seating. We loved our cocktails, apps and entrees. We had a Manhattan, Old Fashioned, and Pom of Your Hand and they were all delicious! We also had the shishito peppers as an app and I had their seasonal soup which was served in a nice cast iron bowl. My husband had the Shepard's Pie and was super impressed! I had the falafel burger and fries and it was super tasty and filling! Our server was very friendly and attentive and my husband thought it was great that she said \"awesome blossom\" since he said that's only the second person he has ever heard say that aside from me (where has he been?). Anyway, we want to come back soon and check out some more of the menu options and drinks! We highly recommend this spot that is dog, family, and happy people friendly!!!"

We came here because we found some good reviews on Yelp, but have to say I was a bit apprehensive about how long it's been since the last review posted for this place.   This restaurant seems to be a family go to place where people just eat and never care to leave a review.   This place a gem! We came in for an early dinner and were surprised by how good their food and drinks are.   I wasn't really found of the butternut squash soup but we were in the mood for trying so we did it.

This is the kind of place I would come to for dinner but I wouldn't bring anyone here to impress them or to treat them. I only say that because the impression of this place I got from the ambiance and the menu was that I would be in for a stellar meal. I ordered the Brie Burger believing the brie and the flavor profile would offer pizzaz but I was not razzle dazzled. It was just the feel of eating a better than average burger.  The carnitas poutine got me a little eager to taste more flavors as I had that to start.  It could have rivaled a couple of poutine offerings that I've had in Montréal aka the poutine capital of the world (sorry Quebec City).  I am happy that all the greens were fresh to round out the meals well.  I felt like portions and servings were well balanced.  If I lived in the area, I'd dine here again."

His service gets 5 stars (and we made sure his tip showed it). We started with the bacon beignets which were not really like beignets. They were crispy on the outside and more like cake donuts on the inside. Only got like two pieces of bacon in the whole serving.  The food came to the table very room temperature. My father had to send his biscuits and gravy back to reheat (no one wants congealed gravy). My mom and I got the boring breakfast plate. I asked for my eggs over medium and they definitely came fried hard. Also the house cured bacon was bland and extremely dry. My Aunt's chicken cacciatore pasta tasted good and we liked the strawberry pancake we ordered for the table a lot.  Overall, service was the highlight but the brunch options are not worth a second visit."

We were in no hurry so we had another beer and looked over the menu.  It was obvious that Oast was short staffed and everyone was doing double duty. Thank the pandemic!  Nevertheless, tHe staff was very friendly and the service was adequate.  However our burgers were not very hot and my pretzel bun was stale. The fries were very good. In better times, this will probably be a very nice dinner option."

                "description": "First, this place is perfectly nice and probably worth going to again if I am back in the area but would easily be convinced to try something else.  My evening began with the Ancho Margarita.   Unlike some places this chili inspired drink isn't like drinking hot pepper juice and is delicious.    The fried cheese curds with ranch dressing were tasty but nothing particularly gourmet as a novice home cook could prepare this with the same results.     The disappointment came with the main meal.  The French fries were cold.   From our vantage point we could watch the kitchen workers.  They kept a big bowl of French fries that the kitchen leader would use to place portions on out going plates.   They rarely sitting it under a heat lamp, so they were cold and unmemorable.   This is probably the easiest and cheapest thing on the menu to prepare well.  The rest of the meal was perfectly ok, but noting that stuck out as particularly special.    The ambiance is nice, but extremely loud when there's a full house so you have to raise your voice to be heard across the table."

Darts, friendly staff and patrons, and a wonderful outdoor space. AND I accidentally left my wallet at the bar and the staff reached out to me via Facebook and mailed it back to me! Amazing! Will definitely come back to The Grackle on my next trip. Cheers!"

                "description": "Hmmm.. okay here is my truth. I came here with my husband and another Yelper. We were told the place shuts down at 10 pm so we had a few hours that we can stay here. I guess the 'Rona comes out at 10:01?  We found a table and ordered a counter near the front. When our drinks were brought out, we were instructed to take them off the tray ourselves. There was a slight confusion over two drinks (which one was which) and I watched the server shuffle both drinks around.  Even though we were supposed to be the ones touching them? Got it.   I did like the large selection of drinks and there was a food truck on the property. I didn't try anything so can't comment on the food.   Overall, I would come back maybe when the 'Rona is done. Some of the staff on site were not the friendliest. Also, be careful if you have to use the restroom, only 1 person is allowed in at a time. I was glad I didn't have an IBS flare up while there because that could have equaled a danger zone."

The outdoor patio is great for my smoking friends and it's covered against rain and the hot ass Texas sun. Pool is cool, bathrooms are decent.   What else do you want?  Also, I heard they have a rotation of pretty sick DJs that come through. I plan on going this week!"

We had one drink and left. In the scheme of dark, dank, and dirty bars, the Grackle is a contender. I'm thinking that public health in Austin doesn't inspect businesses that don't serve food. The Grackle isn't alone in the shithole bar, pub, concept. It wasn't the worst I've seen but it's close. We were expecting a dive bar vibe but this was not even fun."

I ordered 4 drinks for some coworkers. The jerkoff that owns the bar playing bartender was very rude and had no customer service. I didn't order the drinks as fast as he wanted so he was rude. He was understaffed and didn't have the intellect or maturity not to take it out on his customer.  There are many options in Austin with good customer service. Don't waste your time with a shitty beer selection and rude arrogant bar owner.  I from Austin and been here for 40 years. I don't need more shitty people ruining my town. Time for the Grackle bird and its owner to leave town.  I will never go to this bar again. Go to the many great bars on East 6th. Avoid this place like the plague."

The serving action will commence as the bartender shuffles off his brooding reverie and we'll ALL be deep in our cups!  Nay nay!  Only those who know this gentleman can immediately get drinks for themselves AND their friends.  Sure is nice to have friends in low places and you'd be hard pressed to find lower. So, I left.

We had been there for about half an hour before someone came up and told us there was no outside booze allowed in the bar. We said, okay it's a gift, no one is drinking it, out car is miles away we took a Lyft. Within 30 seconds the conversation went from, we can't have outside alcohol in the bar, to, literally, \"I don't give a fuck get the fuck out\". That's literally how the bar guy spoke to us. After a 30 second conversation. I can't even believe that that's how they spoke to us within 30 seconds of saying that you can't have a bottle of booze that's a gift in a bag to get us to leave.  Of all the times I've been kicked out of a bar, that was the lamest, most stupid reason ever. If that guy is reading this, you're a fucking douchebag and a fucking idiot. To not even attempt to find a solution to the situation is absolutely pathetic. Put the bag behind the bar. We'll grab it on the way out.  Literally go somewhere else for drinks.

Decent craft beer selections on draft and they run affordable specials. Food is fairly average in flavor, but comes out hot and fresh. The atmosphere, service, and prices have us coming back often."

They have a small but decent selection of beer on tap that we're bound to revisit.   All the food we ordered was very average -  we could find better pizza, fries, fried mushrooms,10 minutes in any direction. However, it's very spacious inside and even during lunch time on a weekend, the mood felt pretty relaxed (maybe it was an off-day?). A good spot to bring friends for having a few drinks and a conversation."

                "description": "First timer and I was not impressed at all. First of all they don't offer jalapeños on their pizzas which is a unpardonable sin in Texas, and an instant turn off for me. I guess they do realize they're doing business in Texas ?!?! I had the Carnivore which was alright at best. It has Salami, Pepperoni, Sausage, Meatballs, Pizza Sauce, Mozzarella, and Calabrian Peppers. I did add several shakes of the red pepper flakes to at least give it some kick. The fried mushrooms were good as was the Hefeweizen. My son had the Bianco which has Cream, Olive Oil, Fresh Mozzarella, Ricotta, Roasted Garlic, and Basil. He said it was very good. He also had the Sublimely Self-Righteous beer. They offer several menu choices for food as well as several beers. The staff was very friendly and the place was very clean. We might return but it won't be anytime soon as we won't be rushing to return."

The specialty was a bit salty from the tapenade. The knots were wrapped like cinnamon rolls... cute! The were just a bit tough though. The marinara that came with it was good too. I am gonna try the margherita next time."

Super friendly staff, fresh ingredients, and all public areas are spotlessly clean! This visit The Mr. ordered a small house side salad, which was was a very generous size. He ordered Build Your Own Pizza: pepperoni, salami, mushrooms, and red onions. I ordered the meat lasagna...large enough portion to feed two people. Love the marinara used in the lasagna. It was very light, fresh, and not sweet. (Some places add a lot of sugar to their pasta sauce not Tony C's). Not ordered this visit, but make sure you get the mozzarella sticks, made fresh in house, not Sysco Foods frozen. Photos of those beauties are in my previous review."

                "description": "Pizza is not easy to get right. Sure, you will always enjoy a pizza because it's freakin pizza. But getting that right formula that keeps you coming back is rare. That's why, up until now, I only have two favorite pizza places (Home Slice and Slap box). But now Tony C's is added to that very small list.   Really good pizza slices with the right balance of meat, cheese and crust. And really great flavor throughout.   Sorry I haven't tried the other menu items ( I'll get to them eventually) but the pizza is so damn good, that it's hard to deviate.   The Round Rock locations is huge with plenty of places to sit and a nice bar area. Highly recommended to pizza lovers.   Oh, and I cleared out an entire Cesar salad. Which is saying a lot for me."

The pizza was very different than anything I've had in Austin. Excellent crust, quality toppings and definitely all fresh ingredients. The Carnivore was just spicy enough to make you want to keep going back for more and the Truffle was not your average fake truffle oil flavored pizza. The mild hints of blue cheese and fontina took this over the top!    Support local and eat their pizza - it's delicious!"

There's TVs all around the restaurant, so you can catch all the football games! Beer selection covers something for everyone and they had frozen wine drinks that looked good. Half off beer pitchers on Thursday's and half off sangria on sundays.   I've never been one to rave about a salad, but omg the dressing on the Greek salad was out of this world. Even my man was in love and ended up hogging it from me.   I was there to kill time before a baseball, but will most definitely be back for pizza and game watching!"

We're from Houston, but have been here to visit several times and...THEIR PIZZA IS BOMB!   Great family place-covers all bases and tastes. Friendly, fun atmosphere with 50's and 69's music playing often. Pizza is even good for takeout, which is quite popular, as well! They also offer salads and LASAGNA! (Marinara or Alfredo sauces) - see my photo of the menu for details!  TONS of seating - long tables for large groups. Nearby, newly-opened LaQuinta Hotel's guests , including sports teams, families, conference attendees, and other large parties, will love coming here, not just for the seating and atmosphere, BUT FOR THE PIZZA!!!  We visit Austin regularly, and always make it a point to visit-whether we dine in, or bring it back with us-that is, provided it makes it back...whole, lol."

                "description": "Absolutely phenomenal pizza!!! The wifey and I arrived 30 minutes after they opened, we were the second customers there. We ordered the chicken Parmesan pizza as recommended by our cashier and an order of garlic knots. It was a great recommendation.   The garlic knots came out first. They were so warm, soft and garlic buttery! They came with their house made marinara, which was sooo good! Those poor garlic knots were gone just as quick as they arrived.  When the pizza came out, it looked amazing but I was a little concerned the chicken Parmesan might be a bit dry because it kind of looked that way. Let me tell you, the pizza was spot on! The chicken was well seasoned and cooked, definitely not dry. The crust on the pizza was amazing!!! I'm craving it again as I write this review!  The atmosphere was also laid back. They had beautiful wood bench seating, which could accommodate a large party/gathering if the place is not to busy. Service was also excellent.  Honestly, the best pizza I've had in a while! I highly recommend this place if you're in the mood for delicious pizza!"

We shared the largest size pizza, split a fried ravioli app, and gelato. We also enjoyed a few drinks on HH.  We usually go to slapbox for local pizza, but dare I say it, this place has better pizza in my opinion! Not as greasy and it's closer to us. Their HH runs from 5-7. My boyfriend got 2 October fest beers and I had a glass of PG, a frozen bellini and a sangria, which were all $2-3 off depending on the drink. The frozen bellini was very good and I don't normally drink frozen drinks. I did not care for the sangria at all, though.   Everyone was very friendly. In regards to COVID, everything was very clean from what I saw.   Shoutout to the manager, Catalina! She was very genuine in her table checks and we both believe she's a great asset to their team in QC."

Service was great, place was clean, and they seem to be taking COVID restrictions seriously.   The pizza was pretty good. Not as good as Slapbox/600 Degrees but just a notch below (on par with Pinthouse). Came out quick and was hot. Beer selection was pretty good - had a local brewery Oktoberfest.   All in all, worth returning and will try to nudge my kids into agreeing to go here instead of Hat Creek next door."

Food: we tried the toasted ravioli, garlic knots, Italian chopped salad and pizza. The food came out quickly and was very tasty. While the prices were not cheap, I do think you get a good value for what you pay for.   The only improvement we'd suggest is letting customers open a tab and be able to order both food and drinks on it. We were told they're already working on this though!"

                "description": "This has been one of our favorite local places for years now. The new owner, who previously worked here, is a real stand-up guy and has been nothing but awesome towards us. He has taken on a lot more than being an owner; he actually works his business and takes serious pride in the place. Having taken over just before the pandemic, and knowing what that did to restaurants all over, it is hard to see people leave such horrible reviews. You can tell some of the reviews might reflect the person leaving them and not the place itself. Do not let those deter you from trying this place. You will not regret it. The area outside was a great addition for the dogs and kids run around. We have favorites but like try something new from the menu when we go and have yet to be disappointed. Also, pretzels and beer cheese with beers...mmmm!!! My husband likes big beers and I like Kolsch. Want wine? They have that too. They always have something that makes us both happy and that is what keeps us going back for more. Every time we have friends or family in town, this is always on the list to take them. Help keep this local gem afloat! They deserve it! And remember, the more we go now, means the better the place will be in the future. He has plans up his sleeve but that takes revenue :) Keep it up, Dig Pub!"

The manager told us she was the manager like 50 times so we'll never forget that she's the manager.    \"I'm the manager\". \"So I'm the manager and I can add beer to our menu if you like\". \"I'm the manager, so I make decisions\". \"So I'm the new manager here and I can make things happen\".   It was definitely a laughable but enjoyable experience. Nothing to special.  Just convenient because it's located nearby.   The guests were mostly old white people. The outdoor area is nice.  At least they have that, so you're not cooped up inside a small space with die hard Trumpers who hate everyone and everything different than them.  ."

                "description": "Evening in the suburbs and the dining options were dwindling. I was getting hungry and being out with my buddy meant that I'd have at least one more beer. My friend went through his mental list of places and came up with The Dig.   We arrived there and fortunately got there in time, it was a slow night and the kitchen was about to close so we quickly made our choices. I saw that they had Scotch Eggs and I'm a sucker for Scotch eggs, but unless you're a vegetarian/vegan what's not to like about an egg wrapped in sausage that's then deep fried?  I also ended up getting their Buffalo Chicken Sandwich because...actually why do you need a reason?  The egg was good, a little thin on the sausage side but the mustard dip added a little more savory. The sandwich had a good amount of spice but the sauce was pretty runny so it was messy but otherwise good.  They do have a lot of taps and I appreciate that they try to have a little bit of everything and focus on locals. I get that they have to strike a balance between locals who want a beer that's cold, yellow, fizzy and domestic and crazy whale chasing beer nerds that are into barrel aged, wild/lacto, hopheads but for my visit it was a little more on the tame side. I had a sour from Prairie and a local mead which was great and at the time, that was about it."

                "description": "Drove by here today and thought I would check it out and I liked it! I ordered a Peacemaker Beer, an ale that tasted good. The next time I want to try the Blackberry beer. The name itself is appealing. Since it was close to dinner I figured I should order food instead of going home and cooking. I got the fish and chips. You can order the 2 piece or 4. I got the 2 piece with cut fries. It was cooked good. The fish was flaky and not oily. The pubs tarter sauce was good.. the fries were very good too..   The service was very good. There was a sign to sit yourself which I did and within 1 or 2 minutes my server stopped by to get me started. She showed me the ropes and got my beer and food quickly. I was really surprised at how fast my food came out. I can say it was just under 10 minutes but I was still surprised at the promptness. There was quite a few customers but the servers were on top of it. They talked to the customers as if they were family.   The place was clean and there was good parking. The beer menu had several types of craft and IPA beers. I'm  pretty sure I will return when I have time. My total cost including the food and beer was only $14, amazing! Thank you Dig Pub for being in Cedar Park and giving up another place to get a beer and some grub in a friendly way!"

The Sunday brunch is fabulous and should be famous, and the hollandaise sauce is definitely the best I've ever had. Topped off by Guinness and fried pickles, brunch was a hit. The chef hinted at more things in the works, like beer pairings and monthly specials, so we can't wait! Way to rock the craft beer, and now the food is being perfected by the chef, formerly of Snooze, Loro, and now the Dig! Awesome, mate."

We stayed long enough to finish our beers and while we were drinking, staff propped the booth bench back together. I disassembled it twice but they kept putting it back.

                "description": "This place is interesting. The right side of the restaurant looks pretty nice and lively and the left side of the restaurant looks like they gave up or ran out of money on decorating and just put a few tables out. They also have an outdoor area but no shade so I didn't want to sit out there unprotected, otherwise, it would have been nice because I had my dog. It was a bit busy so unfortunately had to sit on the left side (maybe everyone else there agrees the right side is better and that's why they all preferred to sit there). It didn't look or feel particularly clean and I'm a clean freak so I didn't particularly enjoy sitting there.   The service was fine; the waitress was nice. The food was pretty decent, but nothing outstanding or memorable where I feel I have to come back again. It was fresh though and I appreciate that for comfort food, it wasn't soaked in oil. I think the ambiance had already turned me off so I didn't enjoy my food as much as I would have it was clean.   They are known for their beer but I don't drink beer so take my review with a grain of salt. Clearly I'm not a dive bar kind of girl (unless it's out for drinks and bar hopping) but plenty of people are fine/really like those types of places so if you do, you'll enjoy this place. I'm not knocking this place and I would come back if friends wanted to go but I like more of an ambiance when I go out to eat."

The adults got the Thor's Hammer and BLTA with fries and the table shared scotch eggs and pickle chips for apps. Sandwiches were straightforward and tasty and the fries were thick but crispy outside and soft inside.   Scotch eggs were better than Renaissance festival... but could have more sausage.  Pickle chips were average bar food. Overall, good meal and fair prices!"

Backroom access requires one must know the secret knock before the peephole opens and challenge  password ensues.  Dont even try without the invitation, but fortune favors the bold.

Their bar itself is not one of the biggest bars there is but the overall atmosphere seems to be a mix of chill and lively without being too much at times. Located just a stone's throw away is the elusive Bar Ilegal, which used to be a really subtle and unnoticed mezcal bar before Rainey became what it is today. Overall Clive Bar is a great place to warmup for a night out on Rainey, esp with Container Bar just across the street."

To be honest, I was wandering down Rainey Street on a Saturday night, with certain bars with lines wrapping the block. Clive Bar though, seemed chill with no line and a decent amount of people where I could still have my own personal space.   Quickly got in and into the bar, bartenders were easily accessible which is a big bonus. 2 specialty cocktails for $20, I'm not complaining. Both drinks were made with love and a little heavy hand but you'll never hear me complain about it.   Another bonus, I was able to snag a table for our group and we were set for the evening. They had an awesome DJ playing 90s + 00s hip hop and RandB. Super dope bar with a cool outside space (Cornhole available) with a mezcal speakeasy as well.   For all the lines and drunk people, I'd come back here for a chill, lowkey night."

Well if I'm honest, she was watching the game, I was people watching!  The location is great. It's on a corner and has a good view of the street below. The rustic vibes and good music made for a nice time. The bartenders were all very kind and worked quickly. The drinks were made very very well. I had their signature Mule and my friend had a Strawberry Fizz. They were $10 each and I felt worth every penny. Now by 4:00 a younger rowdy crowd came in and the relaxed vibe changed. They stood in front of the tv and those of us watching the game quickly decided to leave. I am not taking away any stars for this because  I had a really good time and the bar itself cannot be held responsible for the how people act. Just go early"

                "description": "Clive Bar holds a special place in my heart and is probably my favorite bar on Rainey Street.  When my husband and I started dating in 2011 it was where we would go often.  It was a different Rainey Street all together back then.  There were only like 3 bars in the area at the time.   Clive Bar used to have the frozen peach teas that were amazing!  I still think back to those and wish they still had them.  I usually ask every summer if they will bring them back - I really really wish they would.  All the bartenders here are amazing and super nice!  I love their drink menu and they have a nice selection of beer on tap as well.  They have some infused liquors too that change out every now and then.  Honestly if you don't know what you want just ask the bartenders what they recommend and tell them the flavors you like and they might be able to whip something up for you.    I also love the openness and atmosphere at Clive.  No matter the season it is always good.  They also have a Mezcal bar that is open on the weekends in the back.  If you have never experienced this I would highly recommend trying a flight to taste.    So if you are on Rainey Street - don't skip Clive Bar - it is a must stop for sure!"

First, the bar has both an inside and outside area - the outside area is reasonably large, so that's where we spent most of our time.

One fun thing about this bar is that they have cornhole outside. Of course, it's only one set of boards, and you'll have plenty of other people wanting to play, so you can pretty much play a few games max. But a few games of cornhole is better than no games at all! One small negative about the place is that they had some pretty subpar BBQ restaurant serving food there (on a Thursday). Granted, it's not like the bar itself is serving the food, but I would have preferred they allowed a better restaurant to take up real estate.  Overall, I definitely recommend people come here and have a drink. And if you don't like it, you can go to one of the other many bars on Rainey St. :)"

                "description": "My review will focus on Bar Illegal. My friends and I were on the hunt to find speakeasies in Austin, and Bar Illegal is one of the easier ones to get to. It is visible from outside Clive Bar, but to get to Bar Illegal, you must walk through Clive Bar's outside area and into the small building that is roughly the size of a shed. The small structure seemed to be made of stones, and it had many cultural items representing Mexico that were spread around: religious paintings, prayer candles, skulls, and other decorations. There were only four other people not including the bartender and my group of three. I would approximate the 'comfortable limit' would be 10 people. The bartender was well educated on the topic mezcal! He got a sense of what we individually liked to drink, and he selected a different type of mezcal for each of us. I drank my mezcal as a shot since it's a little too strong for me, but the bartender suggested drinking it slowly. The prices of the mezcal were all under $10 for shot glass sized servings. The bartender was also awesome enough to suggest other speakeasies and tell us 'passwords' for one."

                "description": "I'm a huge fan of mezcal, so when I heard a bar had a speakeasy-ish room in the back that specialized in it, clearly I had to pop in and check it out. I do feel like it would make more sense for it to be its own yelp page, as while it is owned jointly and running under the same liquor license, the purpose (tasting high quality mezcal) and menu (just a long list of mezcals) are totally different from the main bar. I didn't visit the main bar, just Bar Ilegal.   Anyway, unsurprisingly, it's tiny (could fit maybe a dozen people before it'd start to get uncomfortable), but when we were there, around 9 PM on a Saturday, it only had about 6 people in it - I suppose a bar for just tasting mezcal is pretty niche (they do have 4 mezcal cocktails as well, but they honestly didn't look like anything particularly spectacular). The bartender clearly knew his mezcal very well, and prices are actually surprisingly reasonable for a spirit-focused bar. I asked to try the smokiest reasonably-priced mezcal he had, and got one - Del Maguey's San Luis del Rio - that I absolutely loved, a half-pour for $6.50 (I also love that they do half-pours, for if your primary motivation is \"sample new mezcals\" rather than \"get crunk\"). Based on previous experience with places like this, I assumed it was a truly ludicrous markup and that I had just found my new favorite affordable mezcal, but nope! It's a 70 dollar mezcal. So, happy that I got to try a 70 dollar mezcal (it was delicious), but also a little sad because now I'm still looking for my \"can always keep a bottle at home\" affordable type mezcal. Oh well.   But anyway, yeah, if you like mezcal, you have to check out Bar Ilegal. Really wish my favorite mezcal bar locally would do mezcal samplings like this one does."

The interior is dark with leather studded bar stools and a few tables at the bar. The bartenders were friendly and attentive with good pours on our Maker's for $7 each and specialty bourbon drinks for $10 each.  They have an awesome Rock band that plays each Sunday afternoon. Really good set-list, front man, and rockin' guitar jams."

                "description": "During our first night in Austin last week, we ate at Emmer and Rye and then walked up Rainey looking to get the full experience so we tried out a handful of places. Clive really stood out to me as having the full package.   The inside space is cozy and lodge-y. Coming from MKE, we felt right at home. The outside deck and patio space is huge. Plenty of room for everyone to spread out and still keep a game of Bag Toss going.   Later in the week, we were with a bunch of our KW coworkers and one of our party members thought it would be a good idea to try out Container Bar. Wrong. It was a like an undergrad frat house in there. SO loud, SO sweaty, SO many college kids. No offense if that's your thing. Clive Bar SAVED THE DAY.   Get the Matthew Pecan-aughey."

My parents were staying at the cabins at onion creek right behind this place and when we stopped I saw a dog inside so I called my parents and said meet us up here and told my husband whoa we gotta pet that dog!  I enjoyed the bead as I had never had it before and loved the inside decor and how the place is set up.  Cozy if you want it, outside on the patio ( not for us since it was raining) up at the bar or in large tables.  If you're in the area its definitely a must."

                "description": "Hill Country Tasting Room is a wonderful find - I strongly recommend it! We rented out the entire venue for our rehearsal dinner, and it was absolutely perfect. We had ~50 people with an outside catered buffet dinner, and the venue was the perfect size - it still felt intimate during the speeches, but there was enough room for everyone to sit, eat, and mingle. The layout worked really well for us - for dinner, people could sit and eat on both the ground floor and mezzanine, and for speeches people mingled on the ground floor while the speeches were held on the landing. We love the atmosphere there - a combination of industrial, rustic, and chic that totally matched the vibe we were going for!  Planning was a breeze too - first Lindsey and then Deepa were both so accommodating and answered all our questions. Especially compared to some of the other venues I was talking to, Hill Country Tasting Room responded so quickly, kindly, and didn't mind when I asked a bunch of questions! I would definitely recommend them for hosting an event.  The drinks themselves were also amazing. We loved that it was all Texas beverages, and there were so many options! We were so glad to find a place that offered such a wide variety.  On the actual night of the rehearsal dinner, the bartenders were so helpful - I even got comments back from a couple of guests stating how nice they were! I can't wait until our next visit to the Dripping Springs area - we are definitely going back!"

                "description": "Two friends and I went to Driftwood Tasting Room and asked to do a wine tasting. The only employee there, Antonio, said the tasting would be $8 for four tastings. The menu had a long list of beer, mead, and cider as well as wine. We asked if we could mix and match the tastings between these drinks, and the employee said yes. We then asked, several times, if this would still be $8 for the tasting. He again said yes. When we went to pay, we discovered that our bill came out to more than twice that amount. Apparently, the tasting was not $8. He told my friends that we received full pours, and that's why it was more. Here's the thing, WE DIDNT ASK FOR FULL POURS; we asked for a tasting. The employee took it upon himself to give us the full pours, which we did not ask for and shouldn't have had to pay for. We left upset and confused as to what happened. One of my friends went back into the establishment to discuss a refund. We didn't want to all three go in and cause a scene, since the man was kind to us, we just wanted to remedy the situation. Apparently, he reexplained the full pours THAT WE DIDNT ASK FOR and then offered my friend $10 out of his pocket. She felt guilty about this and didn't ask for compensation for the other two of us that did a tasting. I repeat, tasting and not full pour. I'm not sure why he would offer us his own money instead of trying to correct the problem initially. Maybe he knew he was wrong? Or maybe he just wanted us to go away and not complain? I really don't know why he would do that. We discussed it more and felt upset about the whole situation and how it was awkwardly handled. It was a damper on what was supposed to be a nice day out. I decided to contact management through the Driftwood Tasting Room's Facebook page the next day to see if we could be fully refunded for the employee's mistake. I explained everything to the manager, Lindsey Pierce, who, of course defended the employee. I understand this, and I have nothing against the employee, but a mistake was made and I wanted it corrected. I didn't mention the $10, since it went to my friend who spoke to the employee. Apparently, this gave the manager reason to believe that I was lying. She said that my friends could contact her for a refund and I could get one after I returned the $10 cash, which I didn't even get, but ok. I mentioned how she was treating me like I was lying and like I was a criminal for complaining about what happened. Lindsey Pierce then THREATENED to take me to SMALL CLAIMS COURT for SLANDER for writing this negative review. All I tried to do was express my dissatisfaction and try to get a refund, and the manager treated me so impolitely and with such disrespect. I would never want to go to a place where the management treats a customer so rudely. There are better places down the road where the servers charge you what you expect to be charged and the managers are polite and genuinely care about your experience at the winery. I'd avoid this place at all costs simply because of how the management treated me when I tried to explain what happened."

                "description": "This place is a hidden gem and definitely a much needed place for the growing area. It has huge potential and I hope they get enough business to stay in business! I live nearby and it's a nice place to grab a drink. Beautiful interior! The glasses of wine were a little pricey compared to the nearby vineyards but everything else seemed reasonable. The guy serving my friend and I was super friendly and helpful I hope they continue to have great service. The only things I would recommend would be to maybe add a couple TVs without sound on to keep some of the guys happy should there be UT games or golf on. The bar is a beautiful spot to hang out. I'd also recommend having some nice big glass jars with some pub mix or nuts in that folks could purchase by the scoop and maybe even a cheese/meat plate or some olives. It's a great hidden gem for us who live nearby to be able to have an upscale bar with great local beer and wines. And sometimes someone in a group doesn't want wine so it's nice to have the options! Something for everyone. Hopefully eventually a food truck or some dinner pairing event would be fun. I have seen some really cool events advertised on fb but haven't had a Chance to make it in to one yet. I will add as I have two kids I wouldn't recommend this a place for kids as there isn't really an outdoor space. A great date spot or place to meet friends for a small birthday. Bonus would be to add a happy hour or special pricing for driftwood locals!!"

The restaurant itself is pretty new they have a really simple menu and a great selection of beer on tap I should mention margarita on tap so good really craving one of those right now  Our server Ethan was very friendly gave us really great service.  We ordered a few drink I really liked my old fashion is was really good.  We really enjoyed our good everything was perfect especially my steak it was cooked to perfection. My husband also enjoyed his burger he said it was the best burger he's had.  I am definitely coming back to try something else thank you for the great service and being so hospitable"

                "description": "What a great restaurant! I was in town visiting my brother in law and he said he really enjoys this place so we went. Our waiter was friendly and patient. We started with the chips and queso, which were absolutely fantastic. We grabbed more chips because they're delicious and homemade. Highly recommend them. My husband and BiL got the patty melt and I ordered the chicken sandwich. I was very pleased with my sandwich and tots as were the boys.  My BiL and I both got the sangria-rita our waiter recommended and I loved it. Wish it was bigger, but absolutely no other complaints."

                "description": "We came during peak time on a Saturday evening. This means we are seeing them at their most challenged time. And I was a little \"hangey\" having to wait a half hour to be seated. But it was worth it. The waiter checked back with us every few minutes (mandatory for a good restaurant). And our order was delivered hot and fresh in a reasonable amount of time (a little slow because they were very busy - but in a reasonable amount of time).  We had chips and queso as an appetizer. The chips were the thick, homemade type. And the queso was their own recipe with ancho cili drizzle, crema, some sort of pico de gallo, etc. Really good - exceptional.  I had a chicken sandwich. It had a lot going on (in a good way). It was not just a run of the mill chicken sandwich. And the sidewinder fries are fresh and homemade.   My wife had the watermelon, which she also said was really good.  Overall, some creative foods that were well executed, and on point service  Definitely give this place a try."

                "description": "I've had take out and dine in. After 3 consistent visits I can truly say this is my new favorite neighborhood bar. Eliana has been my bartender every time. She is amazing at referring a menu item or drink. All of the staff are pleasant and the vibe is definitely upbeat and happy. They are inclusive and go above and beyond to make sure each guest has a pleasant experience. I hade a Hell or High Water cocktail followed by a Pineapple Express. The drinks are fairly priced and worth the price. For food I had a Wrangler Patty Melt that knocked my socks off. I did substitute the Texas Toast for a regular toasted bun. The Jalapeño mousse gives me all of the feels and the carmelized onion gave the burger a sweet smokey taste. I'm not a french fry fan so I opted for the Mesquite-Sriracha Tater Tots. All I can say is ORDER THE TOTS! Even the side house salad was delicious. They toss the salad in a sweet and tangy dressing that's just enough. I love that this place is so close to home and does takeout. I will become a regular!"

                "description": "Sorry this is a little late but I wanted to give a review. I stopped by here a couple weeks ago for dinner. The place was full, but they squeezed me in at the bar. I asked for a menu and a beer. The bar tender let me sample one of the beers on tap. I liked it so I ordered one to drink. I also ordered a patty melt with tater tots. The burger was think and made to order. I had to cut the burger because I did not want a big mess from trying to get a bite into my mouth. The burger was juicy since I ordered it medium and very tasty. I can say it filled me up. The beer was cold, nothing better than a cold beer, well almost nothing.  The atmosphere was as most sports bars are, a little noisy but people seems to know each other and they were friendly. The bartenders were busy but kept getting those drinks. The servers were also busy taking food and refilling cups of the patrons. There is outdoor seating but it was one of those HOT Days so I was glad I was inside. The parking is decent but they share with several other businesses. It was not too far away from the entrance so no need to wear the sneakers unless you want to.  Thank you Republic Kitchen + Bar for being a good neighbor and giving us another option to dine in Leander, Texas."

The kids had chicken strips and mac n cheese. The beers were good and cold. I love how they bring the beer in icy glasses.   We chose to sit outside but soon discovered the flies were way too many to be able to eat in peace. We couldn't stop waving our hands or the flies would land on the food. I'll go back, but sit inside next time."

                "description": "Decided to try a new place tonight, and glad we did! I had the patty melt, it was good. The only complaint I have about it is that they put the bread on the grill to get grill marks, but all I tasted was burnt toast. They do the top if the burger bun the same but it's not as grill marked. So next time I will ask for them not to do that, I hate black charred burnt toast. My husbands burger was good as well and both the tots and fries were tasty and perfect portion. They have a big bar with a good variety. I had a Hell or High Water to drink, and will definitely order that again. Delish! And last but def not least the service was great! Our server Kelsey was attentive and very sweet. Definitely looking forward to the next visit...word is they have a good weekend brunch, so we'll be checking that out."

                "description": "The chicken fried steak needs seasoning. It was missing some salt and the sauce over it was so much it took off the breading. But the mash and veggies had great flavor and tasted good!  Texas Smash is good if you like a honey whiskey, I don't.  But the old fashion was just how I like it!  Overall good place to try, the service was good. They have tvs on but I'd recommend that they put subtitles on all of them so since we can't hear them we can at least read and know what is going on."

I almost threw up because I was worried how much raw chicken I had eaten. I wish I would've take a picture but I got so grossed out I tossed it immediately. I understand sometimes cooks can be rushed and I'm sure this rarely ever happens. Everything else was great but I couldn't get over the meat being raw."

Out of some Cabernets. They were out of everything we went to order. The server could not have been more kind and sweet. She said it was because they run out of a lot of things on Saturday nights so Sundays they're just out. Well, I did a quick review of the comments on this restaurant and this is apparently a running theme. 1. Shame on me for not checking the comments before we came, 2. Shame on them for not resolving this clearly on-going issue. I know times are tough, but just close on Sunday nights if you cannot have more product delivered. We finished our drinks and left without ordering dinner at all."

                "description": "I didn't love this place. I totally understand that with COVID, many restaurants have had to cut back their menus.   With that being said, it seemed like breakfast-y food definitely prevailed during our Sunday afternoon visit. Seeing that they do a Sunday brunch, I get it, but always pictured that included a few other options not focused around eggs or waffles.   My husband ended up ordering their burger (which isn't even obviously advertised as a burger), and said it wasn't anything to write home about. My mother-in-law had their chicken sandwich and seemed to be okay with it. Not much fanfare from my husband's stepfather or his girls.  I ended up ordering the chili and didn't have any major complaints. I would've loved to see more in the \"siesta\" part of the menu that wasn't a salad.   My other complaint was the noise. The music was so loud that we could barely hear each other across the table, which pretty much awkwardly split our party in half. At first, we tried to get past it by borderline yelling, but that got old.   In between waiting for condiments, I asked our waitress if there was any way to knock the volume down by a click or two. She mentioned that she would see what she could do, but that it wasn't guaranteed since \"people pay for it\". My brother in law ended up seeing the jukebox in the corner, and while that's fantastic, I don't think it's too much to ask to keep music at a reasonable level in a place where you'd expect your guests to socialize at their table."

                "description": "This was one of the worst experiences we've had in a restaurant in a long time.  The server was rude, the manager condescending (strangely, I don't remember him being so rude at Texican) and the place was dirty.  The table was sticky, and they knew it, even said there was nothing they could do about it because it was \"resin\"...it wasn't.  We ordered four entrees, and they came out in stages. The first ones to hit the table were cold.  The third followed five minutes later, and mine didn't show up for another five minutes, at which time I told them to just keep it.  The \"hash\" was runny and not at all hash, the scrambled eggs cold, bacon underdone, and no condiments available; when we asked for them, they acted like it was an imposition.    $92 worth of bad food and crap service.  Very disappointing considering the executive chef was wearing a Fox Hole chef's coat, and Fox Hole is one of my favorite places in this area; I assumed from the get it would be extraordinary after seeing that...I guess not.  Oh, and word of caution, when the server handed my fiancé the mobile payment device, she selected the 20% tip option.  Make sure you watch out for that...there is no signage indicating there is an automatic gratuity so the servers have NO business choosing their own tip amount.  Update: while we were out of town, we discovered my fiancé's debit card had been hacked.  Oddly, the odd charges started AFTER using the mobile payment device, which was WiFi powered.  I cannot stress this enough...BEWARE!"

                "description": "Probably closer to 3 1/2, but I'm feeling semi-generous.  Think mall or airport food court, but with better quality and execution.  The hard part for our first visit was deciding which restaurant to try.  I ended up trying their Japanese restaurant and my dining companion tried the grilled cheese restaurant.  First and foremost, this is not a user friendly experience.  Every one of the restaurants is a self serve counter where you use a keypad to order.  The format of the keypad/menu isn't easy to follow.  More than one diner (besides me and my companion) needed to figure out how to order a drink.  (FYI, you order the drink from the keypad, then you get your cup when they call you up for your food.) Additionally, customizing an order can be a bit of a challenge. A lot of the online ordering platforms have customization options, but Main Streat has a space to enter your requests with the on-screen keyboard. Fortunately, the kitchen staff does a great job of reading and accommodating special requests.  I had the pork potstickers, which are some of the best in town.  They're crispy, but not deep fried and the sauce has a good flavor.  I also liked my noodles with the beef skewers.  The beef was high quality, but it would've benefitted from being flipped on the grill as one side had grill marks and the other side was just grey meat.  My dining companion had one of the grilled cheese sandwiches, which she described as good.  Once you figure out that you need to order the drinks at the same time you place your food order, you'll find the drinks in the limited seating area by the bar.  HEB has its own version of the Coca-Cola Freestyle machine which offers products from Coke, Pepsi, and Maine Root.  They also have sweet and unsweet tea as well as lemonade and strawberry lemonade.  The food is high quality and there are a lot of options available (surprisingly no burger or Italian options, though).   The awkwardness of ordering and very limited dine-in seating means that Main Streat will be someplace that I'd only stop by when in the area and probably during off hours."

                "description": "My husband and I stopped in for a small bite to eat and something to drink. There is a full bar but was a little surprised to learn that there is no cider on draft. Okay, what about cans? Nope, all out even after checking in the pack. FYI, this is attached to a grocery store. I can not have beer due to a barley allergy and I am gluten intolerant. I settled on a red wine blend which came from tap. We live in Austin, it would definitely benefit this place to add cider options.   The overall setup was great and enjoyed a drink and a small bite here with my husband. I can't wait until the weather is better and people move on from the 'rona so they can maybe have some live music or events where people can hang out.  They have a whiskey Thursdays that offers some discounts. If I was a whiskey fan I would probably check that out."

                "description": "I'm going to start this by contradicting the haters who compare this to HMart and space that was otherwise not making money for HEB. When this store opened, this space was \"cafe mueller,\" heb's first bar/restaurant, and I miss it! They had the best burger in town and really good brisket.  They had an outdoor play yard for kids. A lot of the outdoor seating area was sacrificed to add the Curbside buildout during COVID.   The food hall concept also opened during COVID, and conveniently has you order at a kiosk for each vendor. Very safe. All the seating is in the (very dark and cold) bar or outdoors, and there is less of it than there used to be. Also, I don't think any of the vendors have kids portions, and half the seating is bar height, so I'm no longer interested in bringing my kids here - total bummer, as we all loved cafe mueller. With the kiosks and separate bar, I am definitely not inclined to drag my kids here - I'd have to herd them through all the kiosks and the bar to get everyone's order in, and then pick everything up by vendor, and would be unable to have eyes on my kids at the table while doing so. You now need to go into the bar for drink refills, where I wouldn't sit with my kids because of the bar-height tables.   The pickup part is what makes the food court feel like an airport - everyone is just kind of waiting around. There are no lines, unlike cafe mueller, which always had a line, but the standing around makes it feel depressing.   The food is ok. I like some of the vendors more than others. My favorite is Calle Taqueria. It's a good place to pick up lunch to go midday, or for ordering from Favor.   The one advantage to Main Streat is that it tends to have no delivery fee on Favor, since it's at HEB. However, if you order from more than one place, you get more than one runner, since every vendor is a separate order. I suppose you can make one order at one vendor, and contact the runner to go to other vendors on the same run.   HEB, if you're reading this, I know you're collecting data. Windsor Park and Mueller has lots of families. Is there a way you could once again make this space friendly to families with small kids who want to get a bite to eat while doing the grocery shopping? And more of a community gathering space, with more seating? I used to meet up with a cyclist group here, and I don't think we could do that in the current configuration, nor will I visit with my kids for the reasons described above."

                "description": "Main Streat is the Food Court inside the Mueller HEB.  For a supermarket food court, it is not great.  The gold standard for supermarket food courts in Austin is Hmart.  They have a huge roomy pleasant space.  They have six-eight magnificent restaurants each of which would be in the top third of their category in Austin.  They are all Asian but different kinds of Asian.  Restaurants that fail at Hmart Food Court are typically still better than most of the other restaurants in Austin.  That tells you how good the successes are.  At Hmart, you can get really good drinks from two nearby vendors and the TV has fun things to watch.  At Mueller, Main Streat is jammed into a leftover hallway that was not earning any other kind of money for HEB.  The stands are small because there is no room.  The cramped hallway food court is an unpleasant place to be.   You are not drawn to it to fantasize about the wonderful dishes you could be ordering.  You are supposed to eat next door in the bar or in the patio beyond that.   The bar feels like a garage. It has high chairs so you do not sit too long. It is not a nice place to linger.   The patio is okay.  The selection of restaurants is not great.   My Asian food loving vegetarian wife found nothing to love in the one Asian stall.   HEB's barbecue is functional at best.   (The gold standard in supermarket barbecue is Whole Foods. Bowie BBQ is in the top third of the city.)   The Mexican stand is ho-hum.  So the duck-fat fried chicken place would have to be amazing to make Main Streat any kind of destination.  If you are at HEB Mueller anyway and you need lunch or a drink, you could make this work.  It is not a destination draw."

                "description": "OK, whoever named this place \"Main Streat\" should be fired. Please, go word vomit on yourself and leave the rest of us out of it. Other than that, we had a mostly wonderful experience here on Saturday afternoon when we took our daughter here as a TREAT after she got her stitches out at Dell.  We're doing an overall review since we ordered from two places: Roots Chicken Shak (yet another idiotic spelling; why is grammar so uncool these days??) and Calle Taqueria.  We'll start with Roots: --Kale salad: tasty; did NOT appreciate so many breadcrumbs and definitely was appalled to see two whole anchovies on the top (that's a pretty baller move). --Fried chicken strips: Fine. The whole duck fat thing is a gimmick though because we have pretty discerning palates and you absolutely 100% cannot taste the difference. --Original fried chicken sandwich: Amazing, definitely one of the best ones we've ever had. Loved the sweet potato bun and the kale slaw.   Calle Taqueria: We're considering this place one of Austin's best-kept secrets right now because the food was some of the best that we've had in town, especially considering the price point. --Smoked brisket Quesadilla: incredible. Bursting with flavor, loved the cheesy underside. Sooooooo good. Superior in every way to the one that we've had in this style from Vaquero Taquero. --Al Pastor taco: see above word-for-word. DELISH. The only bummer here were the sides. We loved the street corn but the corn itself was limp and sad-looking. The refried beans were also...just weird. Something tasted pretty off in them.  As for the space, it's more like a little hallway than an actual food hall. It was clean and spacious and there's plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. A couple things that aren't intuitive are cups for water (you need to get them from the restaurant vendors) and that the loudspeaker doesn't extend to the outside for when your order is up (which is really dumb considering that's where most people will want to sit during Covid). BUT THEY HAVE NORMAL COMPOSTABLE STRAWS HALLELUJAH!!!!! Thank you!!! And all the silverware is individually wrapped as well. Those small touches did not go unnoticed or unappreciated. We will absolutely be back again."

I got the chicken fried rice and I could tell they used quality ingredients because the food was fresh and tasty. The rice wasn't heavily over soy sauced either. The pay/self ordering stations were a pretty cool touch, too. Would return to try the other restaurants and even the bar. Docked 1 star because it wasn't anything to rave about but very delicious. Especially before you have to grocery shop (never shop hungry)"

There also a bar where you can order drinks if you're in the mood. Another bonus- there are tables where you can dine in or sit outside, so you don't have to get it \"to go\". So far I've only had the bbq and the Japanese food, and they were both very good! I'm looking forward to my next trip back where I can give the others a try. Definitely check it out if you are in the area and want to get a quick bite to eat."

                "description": "I came to this place with no expectations, just meeting a few friends for some live music and a couple drinks. I showed up before my friends and chose to sit at the bar rail and order an old fashioned. The bartender who I believe to have been the manager was wearing a Clemson University quarter zip. Idk if this guy was just having a bad day or what but boy did he make it obvious.   This guy was rude from the jump. Extremely short mannered, made the worst old fashioned just dumping simple syrup all over the outside of the glass and just tasted bad and left me with sticky hands. I asked what wines were available and was told they had mini bottles (2 glasses each) for $40+ no thank you.   In my opinion a bartender or waitstaff should make you feel welcome, make you feel appreciated for your service especially with Bars having been shutdown for almost 2 years with a hundred other options in a 4 block radius. I felt like I was doing him a disservice by showing up with a few friends and ordering drinks. The bar had maybe 10 people in it at the time so staffing was not the issue.   My advice, get out of the industry. Go find a job sitting behind a computer. Wouldn't recommend if it was the only bar open in town."

When we went there, they had 2 food trucks. One did pizza and salads and the other hamburgers and other food.   Inside of 5 souls is wicked cool.  We tried many of the red wine and they were alright.    The staff is super friendly and patient.  They also have non alcoholic  daiquiri  for the kids. Just a few flavors, but the kids enjoyed them. Of course they did they are just like smaller but more expensive Slushies.   The wine itself is pretty good and a tad on the pricey side IMO. $12/glass or $36 per bottle.

                "description": "Not 5 Souls, but 5 Soul.  This isn't really a winery, the grapes come from far, far away, from the land of California. This wine bar seems to be the alternative to the brewery across the lawn. This is part of a larger complex of pickle ball courts, disc golf course, brewery, and artificially turfed biergarten. This is a very family friendly place. Like one other yelper said, maybe too family friendly. \"Mommy! That's your fourth drink already!\" Don't mind screaming babies? Love having kids come and interrupt your drinking to ask questions? This is the place. Children are largely unattended here- you're drinking in a big play area. In fact, you can rent the wine bar for your tyke's birthday party! There's plenty of things for them to do. Whoever thinks it's appropriate to bring their children to a brewery and get upset when you curse ?  They serve up charcuterie plates that are prepackaged. They're in the fridge. The wine comes in pretty bottles. Based on the price points, it's encouraged to just get a bottle instead of going glass by glass. My favorite thing about this place is that they have (G-Rated) games to play, so everyone can play!  Parking was a bit of a challenge, but the place is clean, well lit and easily accesible."

Co-located at the same address on Bob Wire Road as Frontyard Brewing, this facility is an impressive one. Their tasting room had lots of space - both indoors and out.   The indoor space was open and airy with tons of natural light from floor to ceiling windows and a modern interior. The service here is also a highlight as we noticed that everyone = the servers, bar managers and the owners were ALL making sure that everyone's experience was top notch. We found them to all be very friendly and personable - like those cool neighbors that you REALLY want to hang out with. One thing I liked is that this tasting room also had great energy to it - something that is missing from a LOT of tasting rooms and even some breweries.   Outside, the covered patio is large with plenty of seating for friends, families. The yard is extensive - an amazing space to bring your kiddos and just let them play and have fun.  This really is the kind of place that you wish was only 5 minutes (and not 45) from your house - so check them out."

                "description": "Happy to find this little gem of a tasting room! We've enjoyed CL Butaud wines for a couple of years after discovering it at Antonelli's Cheese Shop. It's a shared space with Wine for the People, just off Fitzhugh Road, which is quickly becoming a brewery/distellery/winery Mecca.   Whether you like white, rosé, or red, CL Butaud has what you want. Light and clean white wines. Crisp, but not sweet rosés. Love the BIG, BOLD reds. The Grenache and Tempranillo are both awesome! My favorite is the Cease and Desist, a 50/50 blend of Syrah and Tempranillo.   We've been tasting wine for years near and far. This is the way it should be done. Best experience ever. Reservations encouraged. Get your own picnic table outside and enjoy your stay. The sommeliers are friendly and knowledgeable. The winemaker, Randy Hester, will likely visit with you and share his philosophy and insight into the process. 100% Texas grown grapes.   Dog friendly. Outdoor games and food trucks forthcoming. Did I mention I'm so happy they've opened a tasting room!"

                "description": "I soooo enjoyed my wine tasting at Texas AVA, which is a shared tasting room with CL Butaud and Wine for the People.    First, the outdoor space is great.  There are about nine picnic benches, well distanced, and most of them are covered/in the shade so you aren't baking in the Texas sun.  There were also nice design touches and little decorations, such as  tablecloths and flowers on the table, so the space felt very picturesque.  Next, there are three options for tasting: all CL Butaud wines, all Wine for the People wines, or a \"duo flight\" so you can try wines from both winemakers.  I brought my mother with me to the tasting and we decided to both get the duo flight.  I enjoyed all the wines we tasted, but my favorites were the Sparkling Chenin Blanc (Wine For The People), the Pa Pa French Rose (CL Butaud), and the Carbonic Petite Sirah (Wine For The People) (we added that last one on to our wine tasting, even though it wasn't included in the flight we chose).  What made the tasting even more special, beyond the outdoor space and the wines themselves, is that both winemakers were on site and pouring the wines.  We had the opportunity to talk to each of them, which made our afternoon feel like a very special experience.  You can tell they both have such passion for their wines and their passion is infectious.  We ended up buying five bottles of wine and I'm seriously considering joining one or both of their wine clubs.  If you are looking for a spot to hang out with friends and family and taste great Texas wines, I highly recommend visiting the Texas AVA tasting room.  I've already told my friends about it and I am planning another visit very soon!"

We tried both CL and Wine for the People and there was not a bad wine to be had. We organized a large group to celebrate a birthday and they took great care of us. We were impressed by both the wine and the service. Thank you so much to the lovely staff and wine makers there!"

                "description": "Came to try out the mac n' cheese! My three year old had no complaints, so I assume it was good They have two versions: a baked one that comes in a very hot soufflé dish and a kids version, and we got the kids' version (our waiter, Colin, recommended it on account of it not being baked so my kiddo didn't burn herself).   I had the Green Goddess salad, which was excellent, though I may ask for the dressing on the side next time (it got a little soupy towards the end there), and a Colleen's Coffee (bartender was great, but it's basically an Irish coffee and I wasn't very impressed with the quality of the coffee used but that may just be because I am spoiled these; it's basically what you'd expect from restaurant coffee)  The atmosphere was quiet first thing in the morning, and Princess Bride was playing on the TV above the bar. Fantastic!"

In short, the service was slow and the food was not seasoned.   -Biscuits with honey butter and tomato jam: amazing! To die for! -Deviled eggs: bland but beautiful -Mac and cheese: it was good but missing something  -mashed potatoes: amazing! -shrimp and grits: amazing! -my friend really didn't like her cocktail. I wish I remembered which it was -the punch was great  We waited a while to get our order taken, but once it was taken the food came quick! Getting the check and having it paid for was a pretty long wait--all while seeing our server walking around and not working on the payment.   I'm not sure I'll be back, honestly"

                "description": "My mom and I were looking for a place to have dinner. I checked for nearby restaurants on Yelp and came across Colleen's (which I had bookmarked and forgot lol). Colleen's is located in Mueller. When I was a kid, Mueller was the site of the old airport. I cannot believe how much this development has grown! There's tons of shops and restaurants. We parked in the garage which is $1/hour. There's also street parking (paid). The garage was a short walk from Colleen's (less than 5 minutes).   The décor of this restaurant is so cute! I love the disco ball hanging over the front door. They have a small bar and a nice patio out front. The staff was super friendly and our server Shelby was awesome as well as the other servers that brought out our food and cleared the table.   Food and Drink:  Pretty as a Peach - gin based cocktail. Really refreshing and delicious!   Deviled Eggs - I love deviled eggs and these were on point! I loved the flavor from the mustard seed and the bacon and chives gave it a nice crunch and saltiness.  Biscuits - we had no intention of ordering these, but a couple at the bar ordered them and when we saw them brought out, we asked Shelby for an order lol. Three hot fluffy biscuits that came with whipped honey butter topped with a sprinkle of sea salt. It also came with tomato jam. The jam was really good and we didn't realize it was tomato until our server told us. I would have been satisfied with just the biscuits lol. Yummy!  Brussel Sprouts - We ordered this as a side to our entrée. They were roasted perfectly and had an herbed date vinaigrette which gave it a nice sweetness to compliment the savory flavors.    Pan Roasted Redifsh - the fish was really good. The filet was a bit smaller than I was expecting, but it had a nice crispiness on the outside. It came with corn, red bell peppers, and lima beans in an onion sauce (soubise). The description on the menu also lists okra (which is one of my favorite veggies), but it wasn't in our dish. We didn't realize it until after the fact.   When Shelby brought our check, she explained that the bill has a 20% service charge included which helps front of house as well as back of house staff. On the site, it also mentions the 20% service charge. She also explained that tipping on top of the service charge is appreciated, but not mandatory. So with the fee plus tip, our bill was pretty pricey for two people, but the food was absolutely wonderful and the service was exceptional."

It is a small restaurant packed with many tables and chairs. I do think you could easily take a romantic date here and feel satisfied.  The menu is set up for the southern taste, with fried chicken and collard greens, shrimp and grits and even a cheeseburger. I actually had a crab soup and cobb salad while my adult kids had the former. We all enjoyed our meals, feeling full but not stuffed afterwards.   The restaurant is located in a nice area away from the hustle of downtown and the Domain. There is a large parking garage behind the restaurant to park your car. It is a paid parking lot at $1 an hour but Colleen's validates you for 3 hours, so no issue. If you are looking for something different, check out Colleen's, I think you might like it. I did!"

                "description": "We ate here for New Years Eve and I was blown away! I saw that it has good reviewes but I am vegetarian so I wasn't sure if it would actually be good for vegetarians. It is. There were vegetarian options on the menu which was nice. We got the fried green tomatoes for an appetizer, I had the roasted butternut squash as an entree and we shared the hummingbird cake for desert. All three items were exceptionally good. My husband had the pork rib and he liked his dish too.   I was really surprised at how much I liked the butternut squash. When I saw it as the only vegetarian option I assumed it would be mediocre. It was actually SO GOOD. The goat cheese melted perfectly with the grits and the semi-sweet butternut squash worked well with the rest of the dish being savory. I also really liked the crunchy pecans and the buttercream icing for the hummingbird cake. It was delicious! I would go here again.... the only problem is they only have ONE vegetarian entree! Also, if you are vegan I would not suggest this place because I did not really see many vegan options on the menu.    If the chef or owner sees this review I have one suggestion for them. They should add chicken fried oyster mushrooms to their menu! It would be so perfect for the southern style theme of the restaurant and it would be a great vegan option for anyone that has a strict vegan diet. Iv had chicken fried oyster mushrooms at honeymoon spirit lounge and it was SO good and I think a spin off of that dish would work well here too."

No complaints there. The decoration does give me cute southern vibes.   Food- 7/10- my waffles were so hard. It seems as if they had been sitting out for a while and got hard and they were just warm. I didn't finish the waffles because the were that hard. The chicken was way over seasoned and dry. My bf ordered a bagel and said it was ok not the best but ok.   Restrooms are gender neutral- not an issues.  If you come during 11a-2p on Sunday they charge you automatically 20% service charge on your bill. Considering if you are coming with a big group it could get pricey including 20% gratuity."

I find myself craving their Colleen's Cobb salad, which--with the addition of Deviled eggs--might be my favorite take on the classic Cobb salad that I can remember having. Their cocktails are also tasty (and strong). One of the added perks is that it's within walking distance of where I live in Mueller, but the convenience is just one of the many things that keep me coming back :)"

                "description": "I found the food and service at Colleen's to be as pleasant as the ambience and indoor setting. They have multiple hot sauce options (one of which, as someone who loves spice, was actually spicy!), and it complemented the potato hash well. Their take on deviled eggs was an interesting one, and though I only sampled a few of their menu items, the ones that I did were of high quality.  I did find it slightly undesirable, however, that an automatic tip of 20% was priced into the bill, and a separate line for tip was present for the customer to tip onto the amount that already had tip included. Had I not been paying attention, I might have tipped twice. I personally had a good experience with the service, however considering the volume of reviewers that have mentioned the service, I find it an interesting option to strip the customer of the option to tip how they see fit."

                "description": "I will give this place 4 star rating based on the quality of the food.  But, we waited almost an hour for our food.  We were visiting the local children's museum and decided to come here for lunch.  We came at 2 pm on a Sunday so it was packed.    After a 30 minute wait,  we ordered our food at 2:30.     It seemed like the might there might have been a shift change and we got lost in the hustle.   Our waiter and the manager seemed to avoid eye contact.    When we finally talked to our waiter, he apologized.    When got our good at 3:30,  the food was tasty.   We ordered the deviled eggs which were tasty and one of my favorite items in the menu.   The biscuits were warm and flaky.     We were eating relatively healthy which I don't recommend at this home cooking restaurant.  The Caesar Salad with Grilled Chicken and Cobb Salad with Grilled Chicken was also tasty.   The Colleen's Brunch Burger was not too large but overflowed with great flavors.  The Four Cheese Mac and Salad was one of the best I have had.   I even snuck in some Fried Chicken from my son's Chicken Nuggets and they were delicious.    They were kind enough to take off 2 appetizers from our bill.  But like previous reviewers, I was cut off guard with the added on 20% service tip.  I was a little surprised with the service that we got.  The waiter did tell us about the \"livable wage\" and I felt that he repeated to other customers in the past.  I do support the restaurant industry during the COVID 19 crisis.   I do understand the cost of food and labor has gone up.  I  was also planning on leaving a 20% tip.   However, I think customers may balk at the required tip.   That being said, this is common practice in places like Miami were people don't tip.  I would return when they are not as busy because the food was tasty.  Don't be caught off hard with the required service tip."

Each item fit three packages and the packages for into the bag without taking over. Not too much packaging and not too little.  I ordered a Cobb Salad, which I thought would have egg crumbles but there were 3 hard boiled egg halves. That was a good surprise even though I ordered deviled eggs too. All shall be eaten in time. I asked to sub dressing and they did. Thank you.  Not many places makes collard greens and it's always different. I don't have a favorite but some address definitely better than others. These were not spicy, not vinegary, not salty (all reasons why I don't like some places' greens). They were maybe a touch sweet butt well-balanced. The biscuits were soft and not dry at all.  I wish you could tip the restaurant, especially BOH, fire such great food. Yeah, I just ordered a salad as the main but everything was MADE by hand, not just prepped. The biscuits, salad dressing, deviled eggs, greens, tomato jam.   Thanks to the staff here! Your food is great!"

Which was fine as I got to walk around the area to check out other restaurants.   We had the cornbread, fried green tomatoes, buttermilk fried chicken and shrimp and grits. I enjoyed the cornbread but the others were ok. I felt like there was something missing when I was eating and so sorry, I had to ask for hot sauce. The food was a little bland in my opinion.

                "description": "This is in my top five fried chicken joints in Austin--and might even be my top. Hear me out.  They have a boneless fried chicken breast, friends. Not chicken tenders, but an actual adult person sized piece of fried chicken. It is sooo hard to find this in ATX, I've tried. They also have a thigh, for those of you like my mom who prefer dark meat. And they are both super tasty!  I wouldn't say I tried it and was like \"this is the best fried chicken I've ever had\", but I've been here twice, and both times it was solid. Also, the biscuits are among the best I've had. Again, nothing fancy about them, just a good, soft biscuit. I'm not crazy about the mac and cheese, but I am vrrrry picky about mac. If you like it creamy you might enjoy this (I prefer it casseroley.)  Our server was great. I was prepared for the mandatory 20% gratuity, and it didn't bother me none."

                "description": "Everything here is a BANGER! Great food. Great location. Great vibes. Able to get a relatively last minute reservation in.  Came here for a Sunday brunch and it's now my favorite brunch spot in Austin. I am thrilled I settled on the fried chicken and fried green tomato. They both came in a sort of biscuit slider fashion and were absolutely amazing. Didn't expect them to be so good, even on the second day. I appreciated the pickles to be a sweeter cornichon. The best side is the Mac and cheese. This is a true southern side dish styled Mac. Went great with the fried chicken. They have a section of brunch drinks as well, and the cocktails I tried felt like a sweeter aperitif, perfect for brunch. If you're having trouble picking something off the menu, I would recommend just copy into my order!  Our waiter was a bit slow, but it was a busy Sunday morning, so no worries there! Overall, 5/5 would recommend to anyone local or visiting!"

                "description": "We were leaving Austin on our way back to Dallas and found this incredible spot through yelp - thank God! It was freaking DELICIOUS. To try several things, we ordered the fried chicken dish with gravy n mashed potatoes, baked mac n cheese, and tomato basil soup. OMG - I could eat here every single week. The food and drinks are presented beautifully and tastes very homemade.   The restaurant itself is super cute and totally Austin appropriate. Keep in mind they include a 20% automatic gratuity to the bill, which we were happy to pay to our server Rose, who was very kind and delivered exceptional service. We will be back next time we're in town no doubt."

                "description": "Colleen's kitchen is a super cute restaurant in a newly developing area which I can tell is going to be a great area to visit.   The food was super delicious. The chicken pot pie crust was so flaky and the insides weren't too liquidy, but it was just very homey overall. The shrimp and grits were also really flavorful. I kind of wish the portion sizes were bigger but it's the perfect amount if you want room for dessert there or somewhere else in the plaza.  I visited for dinner and was able to grab the last chicken pot pie, but I feel like this restaurant has more of a lunch vibe, so I would definitely visit again then to really get the full experience.   The servers were super nice in checking up on us, recommending which drinks were in season, and just chatting in general.   And a plus: they validate parking for the garage behind them!"

                "description": "Southern cooking with an expert hand, Colleen's kitchen has been somewhere I've been wanting to try for a really long time, but somehow never made it over until end of the year team lunch. And ya, it's not the world's lightest lunch, but it will definitely bring a lot of joy to you and leave your belly nice and warm and [a little too] full :).  Don't sleep on the starters. The bacon wrapped dates are flavor grenades of salty, pork, fatty, crispy, sweet flavor. They play very well together and other than wishing there were more dates per order, it's very good. The fried green tomatoes are also excellent with some comeback sauce with a kick.  Entree wise, I got my southern standard fried chicken. It's got excellent crunch and is deboned, so double win right there but it's also very well flavored, with hints of cayenne undergirding the bird. The potatoes are rich and just chunky enough and pair amazingly with the gravy. Collard greens have just enough bitterness to cut through the rich heft. The shrimp and grits looked really good too and my coworkers who did get it all raved about it.  All in all, thoroughly impressed and a great place for a meal if you're in the Mueller area."

                "description": "First time here. It's very cute on the inside with great cocktails. We started off with the fried green tomatoes. Personal preference I've had better. They lacked a lot of flavor but the sauce made up for it. They are great portion to share. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken dinner with the green beans, mashed potato's and biscuit. Portion is huge enough for 2 meals. Can't go wrong with any of the above but I'm dreaming about the biscuit. The hubs ordered the pork chop, also very tasty. Will eventually make it back in for brunch.   Covid-Indoor/outdoor dining, tables spaced out far enough, all staff wearing masks and guests required to wear masks anytime not seated at the table. They did start adding an automatic 20% gratuity which is stated on the menu and our server told us it's  \"so the front and back of house staff could earn a livable wage\""

                "description": "I had been here before with my wife for a glass of wine, but last night's experience gave us a bit of a \"bad taste\", and we likely won't be going back.  There was no menu with the prices/wine choices listed, and only one red wine available.  We were served a taste, and it admittedly was not the best red wine we've ever tasted, but decided to go for a glass since that was all they had.  When we were told our total was $27 for 2 glasses of wine, I almost hit the floor.  A bit on the spot, as we had already been served and did't want to be rude, we reluctantly paid for it,  however we did not enjoy the wine nor time there because we felt like we had been seriously ripped off.   She was apologetic while ringing us up, but it would have been nice to have been informed the price, or at least charge us for a \"normal\" glass of wine seeing that was the only option for red.  In looking at the photo of the menu on this page, there isn't even a glass over $12, so wondering what we were served?!?!"

This place is so beautiful and spacious inside! Was pretty crowded since I went during rush hour. Also, parking was a bit difficult to get. There are 3 other big restaurants near by and it gets packed to where people park on the sides.   Same exact menu as what I could remember from the one on Burnet rd. Their service was pretty fast for all the food we got. Started off with the appetizer - Beer mates, basically a cheesy bread. Nothing too special but a good starter if everyone wants more food. Had two medium sized pizza for the 3 of us. Ordered \"The Works\" \"Ohh Lala\". The works is basically their deluxe pizza, can't go wrong with that! The Ohh lala was on the sweeter side with the delicious arugula.   There were plenty of beer choices to choose from. Grabbed an IPA (completely forgot the name). Would definitely come back again! ;)"

Expect a bit of an adventure trying to find a seat at this location during busy hours. It's a chill place to sit, eat and watch sports or hang out with friends and have a couple of drinks.

Walk in and turn left to place your order at the counter.  If you want to drink .. walk in and go straight to the bar.  They have salads, apps and several speciality pizzas ... sized from individual to family. You get soda from the fountain (cherry, cream, cola, etc) or beer from the tap (too many to cover here).   There are a few booths and tables but mainly it is community seating at 20' long tables. Kind of cool I think.  TVs everywhere ... watched baseball and ESPN. I bet this place is lit on Sat and Sun for football.  So the food? I really liked the beer mates .. garlic cheese bread. Good size and flavor for just $5. I had the pear honey pizza .. add blue cheese, basil and pancetta. I really liked the way the flavors all stuck out .. sweet, herby, salty ... love it!!"

I only asked to either give us two tokens or refund us the price of two drinks. I reached out twice to management with hearing only crickets. At this point my entire tab should be refunded for lack of consideration and loyalty of a company."

                "description": "This is a good spot to come hang and catch a game on the TV while you enjoy some craft pizzas and beers. You order the food and beer separately, food from a walkup counter and beer from the bar in the middle of the restaurant. You get a buzzer puck when you order food so the servers can locate you and bring it to your table. We ordered the Beer Mates and Pizza Roll appetizers to start and two pizzas, the Oo La La and the Shroomin' Goat. Food timing was staggered and the only real hiccup was that the Beer Mates appetizer order seemed to have gotten lost because we had to ask for it after all the rest of our order had trickled out, and it then took about 15min more for it to finally arrive. But, when it did, it was piping hot and fresh, so that's good. Food quality was very good and we enjoyed everything we ordered."

                "description": "I thought the name referred to the beers they serve and while that is probably the inspiration, I find it sad that it also refers to the amount of grease in their pizza (about a pint).  If you love pepperoni or sausage  grease then this is the place for you.   If you don't then don't get these meats on your pizza.  I hope the kitchen learns about skimming  fat off their more flavor proteins to prevent the crust from being a fatty sponge.  Happy Sunday everyone."

They've got a smaller indoor area to sit and enjoy the AC, or the backyard patio has plenty of room with long picnic tables. Many a live music to enjoy the afternoons with. The staff and the customers are a friendly bunch so stop in, enjoy a cold one and enjoy the good vibes."

From the moment you walk in, it's clear this spot is beloved by the locals. The crowd was a solid mix of tourists, cowboys, retirees, and working stiffs.  The tap selection is small, but they go out of their way represent Texas brews, even hosting a tap from Acopon, which is literally about 20 ft away. It's dog friendly, with a patio and a small performing space for musicians. This place just oozes history, it's definitely worth a look if you find yourself in Dripping."

                "description": "This Dripping Springs spot is stellar for many reasons. Low key, 99.9% percent locals hanging out in the evening. Excellent bartenders over the years. Super cool owner too who I obviously know because of my tenure in this town.   The Barber Shop is so cool in fact that my wife and I chose to renew our vows there for our 10 year anniversary. Complete with a hail storm, cake balls from nearby Well Yeah Cakes, and a Elvis impersonator in his second ever appearance.   Beer is always cold; wine list is tragically minimal to the regret of my wife (think tiny bottles like near the airport). Yet, it's charms outweigh it's negative aspects. Heard these days there is a sammich outlet on site for food instead of ordering from nearby Pizza Cave or the shi*ty fried chicken at the gas station.   Biggest note here: It's little Rooster's favorite bar :)"

Sat was their 6th anniversary so the shop was packed with live music out back and a special cask beer being offered.  I have been coming to the Barber Shop for years as a good friend of mine lives in the Springs and we always seem to default here. Take note this is a beer and wine bar only. Yes, they have soft drinks and water as well. This is a dive bar extraordinaire so there is no need to get all decked out to hang out. There are plenty of draft and bottle beers with all the usual craft suspects and always a few surprises as well. The venue is dog and kid friendly so don't step on Fido and keep your cussin to a minimum.  Friendly patrons, good service, and a great beer selection that's the trifecta. Stop by when you are in the area. Lastly don't be shamed by asking for a haircut...."

In the early, early, early, early days it was a gas station and my dad told me they'd stop here for gas when traveling cross country in the 50's. I love this place because it's got a great history, the building rocks (pun intended), and the beer selection should satisfy most any beer drinker; lots of variation. They also serve wine and some non-alcoholic drinks. Children are tolerated until 9 pm. There's an area out front to gather and stand, an inside area to order and sit down, and a backyard area -- some covered, some not -- with picnic tables and chairs. There's music on some nights, a great after-work vibe, and friendly atmosphere throughout. Easy Texan drinkin' and relaxin' all the way. Stop by if you're in the area."

Have a beer with friends (or soon to be friends) and enjoy the Texas casual ambiance. They also offer ciders and the wine selections, while not vast, are good quality choices for the major wine categories. The beer offerings are superb. I've been coming here since they opened (5 years ago?), remains one of my favorite bars."

I went in last night (Tuesday/Halloween)for the first time in a long time. The World Series was on and I decided to grab a beer and hopefully see the Astros win with other Texans but... they lost. The crowd was small and friendly but I did feel like a party crasher because they all knew each other and were passing the guitar around. I hope this place hasn't turned into a towny bar because it never was in the past.   I'm going to have to go again to make sure or at least that's my excuse to go get good and affordable craft beer."

They offer pizza by the slice, half, and whole, which I thought was pretty unique.  We got the half pulled pork carbonara...chef's kiss! Very mild, comforting flavors. The runny egg yolks and perfectly cooked pork made this dish."

                "description": "Toss serves New York styled pizza, Texan style that either comes in a slice, half or full pie. The half serves 4 hearty slices, which is an easy share (or not). I ordered the Spinach Artichoke pizza, which was a half pie topped with romano cream sauce, chicken, spinach, artichoke, and mozzarella (also typically served with bacon, but I'm particular about bacon). Surprisingly, the Spinach Artichoke pizza was not as creamy or savory as expected. The chicken was dry, and you definitely need to add a dash of salt to this.   We also ordered 12 wings, half in the Sambal Glaze and the other half in Sesame. The wings were crispy, but needed more sauce. I would advice to ask for a side of both sauces to slather on top. My personal favorite of the two was the Sambal Glaze, as this was sweet and spicy."

                "description": "Came out here on a Friday night with a crew of 10 and had a pretty decent experience. Parking can be tough here, just heads up.  The table was ready right away and we sat a table the style of a picnic table. The menu had a pretty good amount of options with gluten and dairy free options available. The server was pretty cool and very thorough in ensuring that everything came out correct.  The pizzas are huge so the half pizza is good for most people with a regular size appetite and if you get the full pizza it's plenty big to share. The pizza itself was decent. Crust was a little on the harder so left the crust at the end. I had vegan cheese and mozzarella cheese and one of them just was not good at all. I believe probably the vegan cheese, was trying to avoid excess saturated fats and in turn kind of ruined the pizza.  It was a pretty decent experience, but would go to Pinthouse before I were to come back here. Most everyone else in my party enjoyed there food so my situation may have just been what I ordered. None the less, I would give this place a try if you haven't already and see for yourself!"

I order contact-less delivery pick up outside but was going to order a quick to go beverage- but decided not to due to being shooed away so quickly. The guy who grabbed my food I'm assuming \"manager\", I could tell was in a bad mood. Asked me my name - which by the way is unique found my order and then asked for my full name. (What are the chances out of 4 orders) briskly gave me my food in a huff and went back to were the female workers who were behind the bar as if I couldn't hear him go on to complain about a gal whom was fired. Bummer manager guy- you shouldn't bring your 'tude into a customer interaction. The food was better then the 1min service. I'm thirsty."

The pizza is fresh and crispy, large slices and really easy to eat. Stopped in on a Sunday evening to watch some football and eat food pizza. There are plenty of beers on tap and a selective cocktail menu. There is some seating inside with plenty of seating outside."

                "description": "I've been to Toss a few times now and I have to say, I think this place is super underrated. With names like Home Slice in the area, I understand that people may forget to check out other pizza places, but if you haven't tried Toss yet, you're MISSING OUT. I've been for dinner before but the breakfast pizza has my heart. The crust is the perfect balance of crispy and soft, the topping options are endless, and there's a $15 mimosa deal (a full bottle of champagne) to wash it all down. Also, if you're a fan of ranch on pizza, their homemade ranch is unmatched.   Not only is their food good, but I am also always so impressed with the service. One time when we were in for brunch, there was also a large group that had rented out the entire outside seating area. I'm sure the team felt swamped but we couldn't even tell because we still felt like they were paying us more than enough attention. Regardless, our waitress continued to apologize for the \"slower\" service and even discounted some of our meal.   COVID Precautions: All employees and guests are required to wear masks when not seated. Seating is limited and hand sanitizer is provided."

Be sure to check their happy hour deals before going too because they have a lot of amazing offerings. Great casual environment or perfect for takeout. The indoor dinning is a little small, so if you want a table maybe make a reservation or go early. I will definitely be dining here again soon."

So often, I find sides of crispy brussel sprouts to be underwhelming. Not this one! I was absolutely wowed and Toss nailed it! Big fat brussel sprouts that were perfectly crispy + goat cheese, beets, and walnuts. Yum! Also have to give a shout-out to our server Emily. She's the only one who showed up for her shift last night, and you would have never known they were understaffed. Her boss was helping out, but even still, Emily was on top of it. Also, as far as the wings go, my fiancé gave them an 8/10. We had a great experience and will definitely be back for more wings, sprouts, and hopefully pizza too!"

Pizza arrived cold and even on the reheat was worse than frozen pizzas from the grocery store.  I'm pretty sure it was not fresh and had been sitting out for awhile.  Minimal sauce and chewy crust.  Should have went with Digiorno."

                "description": "Great pizza and fantastic outdoor setup that allows for a casual time to eat and watch some games. If you want a fun time with friends and family, come here.   Texas BBQ Brisket Pizza is a good pick. Brisket was tender, but a tad dry. Sauce was sufficient without being over sauced.  Tasted like a sliced BBQ sandwich with pickles and onions.  Yummy.  The margarita was solid. Good sauce.   The roasted veggie did not have enough goat cheese. Also the artichoke didn't go well with the rest of the vegetables. Recommend to hold that.   Only real recommendation, improve the parking. You don't really need 6 curbside pizza pickups?  Neighborhood has parking restrictions."

I'm a picky eater, I like what I like and if I don't I'm not gonna fake like I do , I've had nasty pizza before so it's possible to mess up a pizza but I played it safe with a regular pepperoni and 10/10  baby I even ate the crust (not much of a crust eater ‍) I got half pie which was 4 slices  (should have got the whole ) I also had a Cesar salad that was really good to the dressing was creamy not watery $8 for a serving great for one or you can split in two like an appetizer which is what I did everyone at my table enjoyed their pizza as well there were no complaints from anybody  Now however I did not order drinks because I'm pregnant so I can't tell you but my husband  got a house margarita and he actually got two so I guess it was good   now if you want to sit on the patio be prepared to share the space with dogs and smokers I feel they should have a designated area for the smokers on the patio it sucks for us that like to eat outside but also have to endure that smoke very inconvenient for us pregnant women as well but everything was perfect  We also got to chat with Logan he wasn't really our server but he jumped in in times as if he was he has awesome customer service he suggested beers for my father in law let him try to make sure he was satisfied my father in law even went to purchase the beer Logan introduced him to from the next door store thank you Logan for your great hospitality!"

                "description": "Toss has recently became a top contender for me when considering where I should go for pizza.  The main thing here is they have a wide variety to choose from. For example, I got:  - Texas BBQ Brisket Pizza: what's interesting here is that their full pizzas are 20\"!! So, getting a half pie ain't no joke because it's still quite big. Smoked brisket, pickles, onions, and bbq sauce base? Yes please!  - Margherita: they allow you to do Cauliflower Crust for $3 more, so I went with that for a healthier, lighter contrast to the pizza I mentioned above.  - Hand TOSSed Wings: I was very surprised to see that they have 11 flavors to choose from. I got their Toss Sauce which is your classic \"buffalo medium\" as well as a side of their Spicy Toss Sauce to try out which has ghost peppers in them (warning: they are SPICY!). For the second flavor I got the Bacon Ranch dry rub which takes grounded bacon and mixes it with ranch seasoning - too good!   - Stuffed Pretzel: I got this as an appetizer before all the food came out and it was a great way to dive right in. It's stuffed with pepperoni and cheese. To dip, I suggest you get marinara and queso for the best of both worlds of saucey and creamy.  - Warm Brussels Sprout Salad: now you may be thinking... why go to a pizza place for a salad? I don't blame you for thinking that, however, let me put you on: this was phenomenal. It had no business being this good! Brussels, beets, goat cheese, candied walnuts, and a balsamic dressing? Phew. A MUST try!  - Smores: I wanted to get the cinnamon donut holes originally, but they ran out of cinnamon so by default I got this. They were fine, but I felt this was something I could have just made at home.  - Watermelon Press: I got this because I was looking for something refreshing. I am not big on watermelon, so I wasn't the biggest fan - but if you are, this is something you'd enjoy.  Overall, I enjoyed everything I got. The prices are fair, there's a lot of items on the menu, and the service was good. I also got to see a self-driving delivery robot come by! I had a great time and give them a strong 4/5!"

Their social media game is strong, they post specials on Instagram that are so delicious looking that I have to come right in. The weekends can get very busy with a super long wait, but they take reservations via OpenTable. Make sure to reserve at least a day in advance if you're trying to visit on a Friday or Saturday.  I love sitting outdoors because they have fans when it's hot and heaters when it's cold. And of course, I love looking at all of the patio dogs. The food and drinks are great! Oh the desserts have been fantastic as well. We look forward to being \"regulars\" here for a long time to come."

                "description": "PRO: Good interior decoration.  CONS:  Poor management, poor service and communication, unpleasant noise from Air Conditioning.   We booked a Lucky Arrow cabin via Trip.com.  Shortly after the completion of payment, we received a confirmation email from Trip.com with a receipt attached.  \"Please show your confirmation number and PIN number to the reception.\" \" Check-in after 16:00.\"  \" 2- person breakfast included.\" We later found out that none of this information was correct.   (1) When we arrived at Lucky Arrow Retreat around 7pm, there was no reception to be found and we were trapped outside a closed gate. We tried the PIN number from the email, it turned out to be incorrect. I called Lucky Arrow a total of 8 times and sent a message to an \"assistance number\" printed on the lock of the gate. No one answered the phone. We were stuck outside the gate for 20 minutes and very frustrated. While we waited, there was no reply back from Lucky Arrow. We almost drove to Austin to find somewhere else to stay. We eventually got a text message back asking our names and gave us the instruction of how to unlock the main gate and our reserved cabin.    After we got past the main gate, we found there was literally nobody managing the property. We did not feel safe staying here due to the lack of any assistance from them if there is any emergency going on during our stay.   (2) There was no breakfast despite what was advertised.   (3) The exit gate remained OPEN when we were leaving after self check-out. It appears that anyone can drive in from that exit gate which gives the guests no privacy and makes the place unsafe.   The Lucky Arrow Retreat needs a lot of improvement in communication, as we did not receive any information regarding the check-in procedure and it was difficult to contact any staff during our stay."

                "description": "I had a lovely few nights stay at Lucky Arrow. We traveled with friends - 3 other couples and their kids - and stayed in a cluster of four cabins. It was the perfect pandemic vacation: we were able to socialize with our friends and still have our own spaces, without being indoors together. I don't think I'd have enjoyed it as much with strangers staying in the cabin cluster with me, especially since each pair of cabins shares a hot tub (which was delightful to relax in!) and all four cabins share a fire pit.  The rooms were clean and modern looking, the beds comfortable, and the air conditioning great. They have basic toiletries and good towels. There's very weak and unreliable wifi at the cabins; I recommend you come here to disconnect. I had good cell phone service with Verizon. The cabins have mini fridges but no kitchens; if you want to cook, you'll have to grill outside. Bring your own charcoal and lighter fluid!  For shared amenities, there's a lovely outdoor pool, and a big space with a large fire pit, grills, and picnic area with tables and swings (and some covered seating if you need shade). The pool has a 1-foot area with lounge seats, and lots of nice floats. We visited during the week, and it wasn't very busy; our group spent a lot of time at the pool and were often there by ourselves. There's a small walking trail, too.  It is quite pricey; I don't normally spend this much on a hotel. I'm not sure if I'd stay again if I weren't going on a group trip (with pandemic friendly housing.) If you're going with a group, call and see if they'll give you group pricing.  Warning for those who are planning to spend most of their time in Dripping Springs drinking: if you visit on a Monday - Tuesday, as I did, most of the wineries and breweries (including Bell Springs, which is attached to the resort) are closed."

The grounds are really nice and accommodating to friendly conversation with other guests. The cabins are modern and feel like an upscale hotel room.

                "description": "Very little privacy and poor management. Had a grounds keeper hop, that's right hop, on to our patio while my wife and I were changing. Wife was and is still pretty traumatized.  Took us forever to find management to let them know we are out and they told us they would pay for our room at the holiday inn. They did not.  Recommendation to LAR:  If you are going to run a wedding at your retreat, maybe consider additional help managing the facility. Only having 1 worker who is trying to run a wedding at your grounds isn't going to cut it.  * to managements response:  You want me to call you again? I'm sorry, but your response to my review makes it sound like this is the first you have heard about this incident. Is this correct? If so, this is disappointing because that tells me you have not taken steps forward to improve."

                "description": "Came here for a mid-week staycation. We had the place almost all to ourselves since it was mid-week in September. The weather was amazing! We rented one of the breezeway cabins with views+hot tub+fire pit. There was firewood at the cabin when we checked in. We had a fire and hung out in the hot tub to look at the night sky both nights. It was so quiet and relaxing, exactly what we were looking for. The breezeway cabins are beautiful and fun! The pillows, sheets, and bedding were comfy. The breezeway two-seater swing was cute to sit in while sipping coffee. It would be nice if the room with the couch and wet bar also had soap and a couple dish towels by the sink."

This was the perfect place to unwind and still feel safe during all this Covid madness.  The check in process was all online, so we didn't have to worry about social distancing.    The rooms were so adorable and you could tell they really put time into every single detail to make sure you have an amazing experience.  We were able to sit around the fire pit, have smores and enjoy the quiet starry night with no city noise or much light pollution.    The location was beyond perfect.  It's just far enough away from town that you feel like you are truly on vacation, but there was still an HEB and tons of food options within a few minutes drive.  The gated access to the winery next door was a wonderful perk.  Highly highly recommend staying here!"

Only complaints were that there was no map provided, nor customer service available, so we had to drive around and try to find outlet yurt at 10pm. Which was fine - we found it fairly quickly. Other complaint is that it looks like the person cleaning might of got distracted and left the room, without putting the ac back together or bringing her cleaning towel. Also not a huge issue. Will definitely be back!"

                "description": "Lovely glamping space close to the Hill Country and within an hour of Austin, but ludicrous pricing policies will prevent a repeat visit. This spartan campsite with tiny houses and yurts (with a bathroom space shared with pool guests) offers a close to the city getaway with minimal amenities. But with a per pet fee of $150 PER ANIMAL plus a nightly fee, they don't seem to understand how out of touch they are with pricing policies of similar establishments. With two dogs under 20lbs, you're looking at $350 just in pet fees prior to any rental rates for just two nights, and therefore Lucky Arrow won't be getting any repeat visits from us."

                "description": "There are few things more excellent than Texas Spring, and we were delighted to spend a weekend of the best time of year out in the hill country at Lucky Arrow during their opening weekend.  There is a central event space and bar / pool area at the top of the hill with yurts as well as more conventional accommodation tucked into the trees below. We stayed in a 'courtyard cabin' one of four arranged around a fire pit with a hot tub. Which was bright and airy with the squishiest mattress, soft sheets and plenty of space to set up our travel crib for our three month old son (they also have them there if you're coming from further afield and need to borrow one)  We spent the weekend listening to live music and sipping cocktails by the pool, wandering the shady trails, admiring the view and toasting s'mores on the fire pit.   Close enough to Dripping Springs if you want supper /HEB - but far enough out that the stars are super bright and the night is gloriously quiet. They're well-behaved dog friendly, so we'll be back with our (only moderately well behaved) hound. And for a yurt, I only peeked my head inside one but I'm desperate to stay in one soon!"

I stopped in during the week with no preconceived notions or ideas of what to expect. So what did I learn? Its a cool little craft beer bar with some great food items.  The night we came in they had a distributor there handing out all kinds of marketing swag, stickers and such. It wasn't pushy at all it was just laid back and I loved it.  The beer list now that is a headache - there's so many choices! OMG :)  It's around the corner for me and I have already stopped in about 3 times. Each visit has been the same for me - just perfect.  So far it isn't log jammed with crowds of people which I enjoy being able to sit without the typical ATX line w/a 20 min or more wait. Let's hope they are busy enough to stay around but not too much that I can't sit right away! ;)  Thanks for the great local vibe you put on guys. I love it!"

I realllllly wanted to try the soft pretzel because reviews were good and it looked amazing! The first few bites while it was hot were so good, but as it cooled off and I became satiated, it was just alright. I wouldn't be surprised if the cheese sauce that came with it was the same as the sauce on their macaroni and cheese. I think it tasted familiar. I gave the tomato soup another try, and it was just alright too. It's got a funny tangy metallic aftertaste. House pickles were fresh and interesting but I could only eat so much before they became overpowering. This time they included beets, green beans, and okra. I checked on their spiciness and was told they had a kick, but it wasn't too bad for me. I hate to say that the best thing I had was a free piece of Halloween candy from the bar. I really want to like this place. The owner was there most evenings and is friendly. However the food never meets expectations and is a little pricier than I'd consider appropriate."

The bar was sparsley populated for a Saturday night, though they did have a live band playing.  I got a Founders Solid Gold beer for $5.50 and ordered the pork belly hoagie for $12. The food came out pretty quick, but it felt like the kitchen staff wanted to get ouf of there and kind of rushed it together. It was just OK, not the kind of food I'd expect from a 4.5* establishment.  Nothing really wrong with the place, but I don't see how the ratings are so high. Perhaps there's people living in the building and they're just pleased to have a better than average bar in their building? I don't live here, so I don't know if I'll ever make it back in.  Bottom line: good bar, but so many bars in Austin, it didn't grab me as anything amazing."

For vegetarians, they have the best avocado toast I've ever had and that's coming from someone in LA where we are as basic as it gets. I've also had their shrimp benedict that is not currently on their menu which is so yummy. Lastly, I usually don't like micheladas but they make the best!! The mix is homemade and it taste like perfection with the new Zilker rice beer. Thank you!"

                "description": "We were walking around on what was quite possibly the rainiest weekend this year so far and went to another place which had a 30-45 minute wait time. We walked around thinking we'll have to go back to our friend's apartment and drive somewhere when we ended up at this place purely by happenstance.   The good, the bad, and the ugly:  The good: The presentation of the food is so pleasing to the senses. Just as pleasing as it is to look at it, it is equally pleasing to your taste buds. I substituted my chips for the beets and oh boy, what a great a choice that was! The guy taking the order (Oh, btw, you have to order at the bar) told me that some people don't like them because they taste too earthy. I have never understood how people cannot enjoy eating beets. The highlight of the entree was supposed to be the portobello mushroom burger served on a bed of creams with some guacamole and aioli but the side of beets totally took the center stage. The vinaigerette they were sitting in when mixed with the cheese totally elevated the dish and give it so much dimension once you really mix it in together. You really want to take pictures and tell your food that this one is for the gram. I'll let the photos speak for themselves  The bad: Portions are a little bit on the smaller side but that could possibly be because we have huge portions in Houston. Or that I have a food addiction. No one else seemed to have that problem so you can just ignore the last statement. But, the service was a little lacking even though the restaurant was pretty empty.   The ugly: This does not necessarily apply to me but my friend is a vegan and they don't carry soy milk. Their reasoning, we put it out but no one used it and we were throwing it away. Solution could be, just give it to people who ask for it?!  I think, overall, we had a really good time over here. The food was great. On Sundays, they have live music where we were told that the music doesn't get so loud that you are not able to hold a normal conversation."

                "description": "Rolled in here for the first time on Saturday afternoon and had my eye on their reuben. I was NOT disappointed! They brine their corned beef for 11days and it is juicy, crumbly perfection! The kraut they use is actually on par as well, w/the perfect balance of sweet and sour.  I am not gonna lie, the reuben here might just hold a candle to my all-time ATX fav at Waller. They are different stylistically, but both hold their own.  While I was here Saturday, I did their little sampler pour of one of my fav high abv beers, Wake up Dead on nitro by Left Hand. It was just what I wanted. At 10.2%, doing a full pour is a bit much, but their little $3 sampler was perfection.   I also discovered their \"Wine Wednesdays\" during my Saturday visit and after the gracious bartender Phil (who I have affectionately nicknamed \"GreenBay\") let me sample their 1000 Stories Bourbon Barrel Aged Zin. I was smitten from first whiff and in full lust after the first sip. I knew I had to return to make a half price $44 btl mine!  As luck would have it, my schedule allowed me to come in on the following Wed. I am not going to lie, I was so looking forward to doing damage to a bottle of a 1000 Stories all by my lonesome. However, because my \"luck\" has always been spelled w/a capital \"F\", they had just sold their last btl of 1KStories when I walked in. I was heartbroken. But, the wonderfully empathetic staff here not only let me sample the Substance Cab (it was a lovely cab, but I had my heart set on the BB-aged Zin!) before offering me a glass from the last open btl at HH pricing. GreenBay even let me kill what little remained at the end of the night. Great service will always make or break any experience, in my opinion.  It was busier than usual due to it being ATX Beer Week, but even the patrons at this place were gracious. There was not a seat to be had in the house and this kind man at the bar let me have the very tightly squeezed-in seat next to him.  BTW, the reuben here is so nice I had to have it twice! It was just as perfectly delicious the 2nd time as it was the first.  I will definitely be back the next chance I get for another attempt at Wine Wednesday and anytime I need an old school reuben fix. So glad I discovered this place, its vibe, and wonderful staff!"

The food was just okay and the service was eh. They do have a large selection of beers though. The place is very small inside a d the bathroom are somewhat outside....sucks in a cold night. It's definitely an interesting little find. Not one of my favorites though."

                "description": "Came only for the beer. 2 dozen taps and although mostly local, they hit all the types. Packed inside but nice patio that's extremely dog friendly. Parking is street and WiFi available. Free music co Stanton with a stage literally in the corner ready to go on short notice. Specials daily and happy hour until 7pm on Tuesday through Thursday. Food looked good but I was here for the beer. Fresh draft line makes me happy so no complaints here. One TV and friendly service. Floor and tables clean and although loud it's not in your head intrusive. Really can't ask for much more from a neighborhood bar."

I visited not too long ago and had their eggs benedict for Sunday brunch which was nothing short of amazing. He ordered the Hi-Hat plate which he also enjoyed. We ate and marveled at the talented jazz band that was finishing up their set. This place is cozy, has an enormous selection of beer, and a knockout menu for you to explore (with daily specials). I would come here again and again.  10/10 would recommend this place to others."

                "description": "First off, we wasn't planning to come here but looked what was in the area and this place popped up. When you go in, the area is a bit small. You can grab a menu off the wall and then order from the bar. They have a few chairs for bar seating and about 6 tables inside varying from a two seater to a six seater, and there are about 3-4 tables outside and then a bar top around the patio. If it is pretty warm, I would definitely recommend sitting inside. They said that this was the busiest they'd been so food took longer to come out than usual 30 min-1 hour. It was definitely worth the wait! I ordered the eggs Benedict with a cilantro sauce on top and it had chorizo as well! It was greatly prepared and was the perfect amount of food. The biscuits and gravy are also pretty darn good! You can pick how you want your eggs with it, and it also comes with bacon. We only did self serve water, but our total was $26...in the halfway mark price range. WORTH IT THOUGH! The staff are polite and try to do everything to accommodate you and keep up with other customers/work. The only reason I knocked off a star is due to the seating inside, making it hard to fit everyone!"

Can't say that I've ever had chorizo in my Egga Benedict so that was interesting. I'm not sure if I love it but it's def decent. I'll have to say the mac n cheese stole the show hands down. I added it to my order after the bartender and another customer both recommended it. I don't normally eat mac n cheese but I'd def order theirs again!"

The owner greeted us and came over to chat...really nice guy with a lot of well deserved pride in his establishment. We ordered 4 appetizers as a meal. THEY WERE HUGE!!! Easily could have just had two! Everything was delicious. Their pretzels are the best I've ever had, taco was amazing... it was all great. Excellent beer selection on tap, and good live music too!"

He was very personable, patient and flexible with how we spent the allotted time. It was a great outing and a very different experience!  On the evening I went it was just our smaller group on the tour so we had full control of the jams, cooler and schedule. We definitely held up traffic a bit when on some of the main roads but the motorists and bystanders we came across waved and cheered us on. Thankfully there is a motor on board so it's not necessary to be fully exerting yourself peddling.  Recommend for a fun activity. Ask for Max!"

                "description": "Hipside Peddler is such a FUN thing to do because it is not every day that we get to ride around Austin on an electric assisted bar on wheels, while sippin' on an alcoholic beverage that makes you feel a little bit prettier and blasting your favorite music so loud, that you think you're at the club!! ;))   Sounds fun, right?! :))   Trust me, you WILL for sure get points for creativity if you book a tour w/ Hipside Peddler to celebrate a special occasion.   We booked the \"Eastside tour\" w/ Hipside Peddler on Saturday, 11/14/2020 to celebrate my friends 40th birthday and we had so much FUN! This was my 1st time so I had no idea what to expect but I can say that I am so glad that we were able to safely celebrate my friend's milestone birthday during this time of pandemic craziness.   Since sharing is caring here are a few of my \"Helpful Tips\", \"FYIs\", and \"Likes\"...  FYI:  *You will be peddling the same way you would if riding a bike so be mindful of your foot wear and you will be getting a mini workout while peddling.    *There are mini fans above each seat that you can turn on, if needed.   *The peddle boat driver does have a plexiglass barrier between him and the passengers as a COVID safety precaution and the peddle boat itself is all open w/out any walls.   *You can tip your peddling boat driver in cash and via Venmo.   *The \"Eastside\" tour is 2 hours long and we made 3 separate stops at different local bars for 15-20 mins each so you can use the restroom, cool off, take a few pictures w/ your peeps and/or buy a drink while relaxing at each bar.   Our awesome peddle boat driver was Matt and he also made a 4th stop at an Italian ice truck.   *Each passenger must submit a liability waiver and you can do it electronically. Once your tour has been booked, you will get the waiver emailed to you.   Helpful Tip(s): *BEVERAGES~I recommend that you bring your own ice chest already filled w/ ice and beverages (no glass containers are allowed) and there is an open area in the middle of the peddle boat for ice chest storage.  *FOOD~only snacks are allowed and I suggest you bring snacks that are easy to munch on since you will be peddling while eating them. ( ex: mini bags of pretzels, individually wrapped cookies)  *MUSIC~The peddle boat does have a stereo system that is very loud and has a usb that you can connect your phone to for music. I highly recommend that you create a music playlist of songs that help set the vibe that you're going for.   I made a playlist using Spotify of all the songs I wanted to play.   Lastly, I just wanted to give a huge shout out to Matt, who was our p.d driver because he really did a GREAT job of explaining \"all things peddle boat\" :) and putting us at ease so we could fully enjoy ourselves. This was so appreciated because each of us were newbie peddle boat passengers.   Stay AWESOME Hipside Peddler and for sure I'll be seeing you again very soon!   ~Rebecca out"

                "description": "Made our 1st trip to Mueller Farmers Market on 8/23/18 It was over 100 degrees outside and we were all ready for a cool refreshment (my 5 year old twins, 3 year old, husband, and myself). We arrived right at opening and found SoCo Gingerbeer. The girl (maybe late 20's early 30's) did not acknowledge our presence as we were the first and only potential customers. She was also extremely unprepared. After a couple minutes standing there waiting on her (she was adding ice into the large containers) she FINALLY spoke to us. \"It will be a few minutes\" she said brashly. No smile , no welcome, it was as if we were inconveniencing her.   I felt uncomfortable and completely unwelcome but we stayed because our littles were thirsty.   Finally, after 10 minutes after opening, this gal was ready for us and she gave us samples upon our request. Also, zero empathy or apology for making us wait on her.   The samples were as hot or hotter than the temperature outside and really off putting. She sampled some hot ginger beer herself and remarked to herself in a gloating manner how great it was. It was a joke. She had a huge chip on her shoulder. Perhaps having a bad day, but I have worked years of customer service and you NEVER take it out on your customers. So unprofessional.   The customers thereafter us (a mom with two young girls) were also waiting on this chic and not treated with a welcome as well, unfortunately. The entire time, actually, this employee never cracked a smile or had any intentions of carrying out at the least, mediocre customer service. It was appalling and quite bothersome.   Suffice to say, we left. And I wonder how many others she has turned away."

I went to the Lakeline Farmers Market on a hot day and was very pleasantly surprised how refreshing and delicious the Beet Ginger Beer was great. It would be wonderful as a mixer but I find it just as refreshing as a cool down cocktail. I got an inside word from the young lady Elaine at the booth that they are going to serve a prickly pear flavor next weekend. This time I'm going to pick up two bottles. If you reuse your bottles you get a discount that's so great too!"

We got a cup, and tried the other on tap, jalapeño lime and the extra ginger- all good (though I don't like the flavor of sweet jalapeños) but hibiscus was my favorite. After downing it we went to the car and got our growler and went back to get some to go. Hibiscus was sold out so we did the extra ginger and it was soooo spicy and good. Kudos to them, they're doing good work in their ginger beer."

                "description": "I really wanted to like this place - as I need a local cigar shop- but you cannot overlook their blatant disregard for local COVID requirements.   First, the shop is quaint and located in a very cool shopping area off of HWY 12. They also have a decent selection of classic and unique cigars. That is the positive.   However, they are selfishly thumbing their nose at COVID regulations. The staff does not wear masks or require patrons to wear them when they are up and about. There is absolutely no social distancing and it is usually packed to overflowing on weekends.   When a business refuses to abide by local and state guidelines in something as serious and life-threatening as COVID, it makes you question where else they ignore health and safety protocols. I do not trust that they keep their shop or the tobacco products safe and sanitary if they are unwilling to adhere to these basic guidelines. This should be a MASSIVE red flag for anyone thinking of shopping here.   I do not trust an establishment with this mindset, nor the local authorities that refuse to enforce these rules. It is shameful."

We quarantined with each other for months. We stayed 6 feet away from one another. I know; I was there nearly every day. It's difficult for any business who had to navigate the tricky waters of early 2020's pandemic onslaught. It was new territory for everyone and significantly different messages coming from authorities in the \"know\".  And with all that being said, you have a fairly recently opened small business trying to survive.  IMHO, anyone hating on this establishment is welcome to stay away.    Great cigars, great beverages, great community support. Don't change a thing.  Levi"

When by pure coincidence I met a couple who I have not seen in years. We mentioned that we had cigars but it was too windy to smoke em. They said there was a chill cigar bar right up the street. We watched Tiger make a par on 18 and off we went.  We were greeted immediately by Allison, the manager, and given a quick tour of the venue. There are comfy seats and a small bar area that serves beer, wine, and water. The humidor is laid out very well and their cigars are stored perfectly. Allison patiently explained that there are two sections in the humidor the usual favorites and \"her\" boutique cigars. I selected a beautiful light Nicaraguan rolled cigar. This baby smoked smooth right down to the label.   The lounge itself is ventilated nicely so you are not smoking in a haze or smoking your cigar and other guys cigar as well. There was also a good beer selection. We had a blonde ale from Two Wheel Brewery in Buda. Good choice.   Smokey's is a chill venue, friendly patrons, and professional knowledgeable staff equal 5 stars all day!"

I love that many of the cigars in the humidor are made by guys in Texas, especially the ones by a veteran who lives nearby. How cool is that? Make sure you talk to Allison too. She gives you the low down of every cigar and helps you find the perfect one for you. She's really nice and very helpful in her descriptions. My husband and I are looking forward to a date night at Smokey's."

We thought their airstream would be a fun \"man cave\" addition to an otherwise very feminine wedding...boy were we misguided!

As a woman, I feel like creating a space where women feel welcome in what is traditionally considered a masculine space is a clear indicator of the quality and professionalism of their business.  Not only was Chris helpful, very communicative and and priced well - he and his wife were so much fun to be around! They both made our day special and unique and I highly recommend them for events. They definitely went above and beyond to ensure the day was special and went smoothly.   The airstream itself is luxuriously appointed and classy. Their cigar storage and bar amenities were top notch and I'm sure their huge tv would be great for sports games and such. Definitely a fantastic addition to my big day and I'd highly recommend them!"

                "description": "Went here on St. Patrick's Day to grab a Reuben with my girlfriend.  The pub is dark and divey, but it also has a nice outdoor patio area, that is dog friendly. There was plenty of parking when we showed up which was nice - it can be a challenge in their area.  The sandwich itself was fantastic. Rye bread, warm corned beef, melted Swiss, sauerkraut, and the cherry peppers I added were all perfectly complimented by the orgy sauce the sandwich was smothered in.  Honestly, the only thing disappointing was the chips. They were ice cold, unsalted, and relatively flavorless. I put on some Yellowbird Serrano to give it some flavor and used them to scoop up what had fallen out of my sandwich. I just can't help but think how much better they would have been fresh!"

                "description": "On a recent trip to Austin upon arriving around lunch time we checked into our AirBnB and were in need of some lunch quickly!  Our AirBnB host recommended Gourmands as a good local spot.  We headed over and found there was plenty of parking and it was very quiet on a random weekday around lunchtime.  I like their system of scanning the menu and just ordering from the table, however it was sort of odd to not interact with anyone upon entering.  The only real greeting we received was from someone poking their head out of kitchen to let us know we could sit anywhere and order with the QR code. I imagine that would be a but different when the restaurant is more crowded though. We ordered some soup in a bread bowl and a couple sandwiches.  The food was promptly brought to us.  The bread bowl was awesome, along with the chili.  The sandwiches were also good, high quality bread and everything on the sandwich tasted very fresh!  Gourmands was a solid place to get some fresh food quickly without having to wrestle with parking and lines in some of the more populated areas of Austin. Good lunch spot!"

                "description": "Gourmands is one of my favorite takeout places in Austin. I usually get the Second Deadly Sin with fresh avocados. The salads can be weird, and I'm not a fan of the soup+bread bowls, but conceptually they are interesting.   Eating in at Gourmands is more fun if you go alone. The atmosphere is very traditional pub, so if you're seated at the bar having a meal and your drink, you'll almost always find good conversation. It's less fun to go with someone for a sit down meal, as it really is more of a bar than a restaurant, even though the food is pretty good. Quirky's not exactly the right word. It's idiosyncratic, and kind of addicting?   After Thoughts for Advanced Listeners: I want to be at a place in my journey where I can eat a Cleopatra and not feel I'm missing out on meat."

But when it was delivered to our table it was just in a regular bowl. When I asked they said well yea they were out of the bread.  I understand being out and that is cool but if they would of told me that when we ordered we would of ordered something else.  Our server asked if we wanted anything else. But never mind.  Bummer."

I got the Po-Po. This was basically a BLT but they put an amazing garlic mayo spread on it. I think the best combination is to have it on wheat bread. It was so stellar that as I finished and looked up, my bf and two friends were only halfway done eating! Definitely going back to this place!  Street parking, outside patio, bar inside with seating as well."

                "description": "I really wish I loved this place more because I was so excited to bread bowls, but it fell really short of my expectations. My friend and I sat in the outdoor patio area, and there were so many empty tables with eaten food left on the tables that hadn't been cleared yet. Summer is coming, so there were a ton of flies that were attracted to the food that eventually came to bother us when our food arrived.   My friend and I ordered spinach and artichoke dip to share, and I had the clam chowder and Deadly Sin sandwich combo. Firstly, the spinach and artichoke dip had so much cream cheese in it that it didn't taste like artichoke or spinach. It was really thick and gloppy, and I felt heavy just eating it. My clam chowder was really lacking in the clam flavor, and it also wasn't that good. The sandwich was okay. Nothing special about it.   I am pretty sad that I didn't love this place because prices aren't terrible, and the concept of soup in bread bowls is awesome. Not many places in Austin serve that. However, they seem really understaffed and the food itself isn't good enough to warrant a second trip."

As a non-drinker my tastebuds didn't compute this right on the first try. The soup and bread bowls are delicious but of course they leave you feeling extremely full! I'd been craving a chicken salad sandwich, so the Foghorn Leghorn hit the spot."

Their delivery system is a bit cumbersome and has glitches but they're aware and make it right when it messes up. In person, this place has awesome ping pong table set up as well as a great outdoor space. It's a great hangout. Chill and has great food - the two best things you want in a gastro-pub."

The sandwiches are beyond incredible and can't come recommended enough! Right now, you seat yourself and order from your phone at your table via a QR code.   We got the Second Deadly Sin and Chili, and both came out delicious and served with house made pickles and chips. The Black Bean soups is in incredible vegan option I've had multiple times.

                "description": "A combo lunch that doesn't skimp on portions for only $10?!? Hot dog! Well, more like hot soup and sandwich or salad (no hot dogs on the menu).   The soup is served in a bread bowl (French bread, not sourdough!) and they have four or five options. I went with the broccoli and cheese which was more like queso with a few chunks of broccoli in it, but heck, maybe Gourmands knows me better than I know myself, as that's probably what I really wanted anyhow! I scarfed it down and had to stop myself from eating the entire bowl of bread. The chicken salad sandwich was lovely, but because I went full hungry girl on the soup (and homemade chips), I didn't eat it until the next day for lunch. Again, a lot of combo for your buck!  The place definitely blends in with the neighborhood, it's dive-y looking on the inside with a bunch of cheerful regulars at the bar (also the type of establishment you'd see a baby on a hip and a beer in hand), a TON of tables and booths for groups, and ping pong and skee-ball in the back. They've got a small parking lot, too."

We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip which we always do and it was literally milk with artichokes it was pretty gross. Then it took over an hour to get our soups and sandwiches. THEN on top of that i ordered the royal and they gave me mushrooms instead of meat (which I didn't order). I did tell the waiter and all he said was sorry(didn't offer to fix it).

I can see this place being an awesome, standard spot to grab a drink with regulars on any given day or night, but what we came in for was their highly-rated bread bowl soups and dang - they don't disappoint. The bread was soft and the perfect consistency - sturdy yet edible, which I feel is hard to come by with bread bowls. They offer a lot of great lunch options, like a soup and salad, sandwich and salad, or salad and soup. I went with the cobb salad and their black bean soup. To be fair, the server did warn me the soup was spicy, but I was definitely sweating a bit while sipping this delicious soup. The bread was a wonderful compliment to the spice and really soaked it up so I could keep going back for more!  On the way out, we noticed a room in the back with skee ball. Yep, we will be back for sure."

I was so glad I was so wrong!  First off, the idea of the Beer Museum is just fantastic! A friend who is adverse to anything museum related actually enjoyed the lil displays and info-snippets when we got to experience the Beer Museum at WhichCraft. So, if you are a beer nerd, then this is the kinda thing that will capture your interest.  Second, there is not a brick n mortar location as of yet (however, you can help make that a reality by donating on the website), so as of now, this place is completely mobile. You can see where their next location will be on their website as well.  Third, Matt and Virginia, the founders and curators of this beertastic brainchild are two of the nicest people you will meet and it was great talking beer with them. Some of the beer memorabilia they had on display was just awesome!  Fourth, you can purchase Beer Museum gear and spread the gospel. Since purchasing and sporting my Beer Museum shirt, I have gotten stopped and asked about it more times than someone wearing a tshirt probably should.  So yeah, check them out and support a beer cause!"

                "description": "Such a great addition to the neighborhood! Perfect place for family night. Who doesn't love pizza. There is great outdoor seating and has a playscape for the kids. The pizza is good as well, there is a combination for someone. There is plenty of seating inside too. The lunch deals are such a good deal. The staff is friendly, we like to do the curbside orders on nights when we are too lazy to cook. It's fast and easy, plus there is so many options you don't feel like you are eating the same thing over and over even if you come here weekly.   The new COVID ordering is nice though you don't have to leave your table and you can split the check among who orders what. It is annoying for those who haven't had it set up on their phones already but otherwise it's super easy after the initial set up."

                "description": "My fiancé and I have been here 3 times now, and we enjoy our visit every time. The pizza is good, the selection of beers and ciders on tap is pretty phenomenal, the soda selection is great as well, and the vibe of the place (Parmer Lane location) is family-friendly and fun!  This time, we ordered The Lazy Goat and the Buffalo Chicken pizzas. The Lazy Goat gets a 5/5 - it was perfectly balanced, and I loved the artichokes and goat cheese with red sauce. The Buffalo Chicken was just okay, I'd give it a 3/5 - it was as expected but left you wanting something more.  In the past, we've tried the Chicken Bacon Ranch (3/5), Ground Control (4/5), and The South Austin (4/5). The focaccia bread sticks are also good!   Overall, it's a nice place to drop in after work or to get Friday night pizzas from. When the weather is nice, it's fun to sit outside - though I can't recommend the high top table chairs, as they are quite uncomfortable. We will definitely be visiting again!"

I especially like the unique and earthy flavor of the cheese.  The bonus was they delivered a growler which I'll check out later...(it's later and yummy Pilsner) Will I order it again!?! Probably not. But it was a solid meal nonetheless."

                "description": "I met up with a group and was definitely impressed with the spot. I loved the outdoor seating area and the playground. My little one was occupied the entire time and barely took time to eat because she didn't want to stop playing! The pizza was delicious. We shared a simple pepperoni pizza and cheese focaccia bread. I liked that the crust held up well. It wasn't too think or thin - just right! My kid finally up ate 3 pieces when she sat down from playing. If you are a parent and looking to have a cold beer and relax then this is definitely the spot for you. They have tons of beers on tap! Beer, playground and pizza - how can you not be a fan of that?!"

I ordered the major tom, pepperoni was very crispy but the veggies were a little undercooked would've preffered them a bit more cooked.  The meat almighty was better, pepperoni was crispy and the cooked ham was very tasty (i dont usually like ham that much!) The dough was doughy, and floppy."

                "description": "This is the worst experience I have had in awhile with management. To begin, with follow my pics.. I ordered a major tom (supreme pizza) with EXTRA sauce thru door dash. At 7:55 within a few min I received notification it was being picked up.  I call store to inquire how is that possible if it was freshly made. The store hung up on me. So, I worked w door dash who asked me to wait for delivery to see if there is a quality issue. I did just that, only to receive a pizza that was warm but based on the cheese amount, semi chilled veggies I knew I wasn't too off base when I had my reservations about it to begin with.  I call store - ask for manager, even though I know door dash will ultimately handle. However, I just wanted to know how you can make a pizza in 5 min and say its fresh. Manager says sorry for the hang up like she's singing to a tune of a tiny violin; then tells me they don't have base pizzas sitting around (kind of like Villa in the mall that adds toppings when u order). I ask why is there so much cheese then and no sauce. Clearly cheese is added and is already rubbered up. Short answer and ultimate answer from her was another unbelivable sorry and to work with door dash.   What's sad here..Villa Pizza (mall pizza) is better than this any day. And I'm kicking myself for not going with Salvation pizza instead. Aviator down south was awesome but this Parmer Lane site is lacking customer skills and good pizza."

                "description": "2nd favorite pizza in Austin!  I love pizza. If I were choosing my last meal it would be a toss up between pizza and beer or filet mignon and merlot (or Shiraz). I digress...pizza...it must have a great crust-never EVER soggy, a well-balanced sauce, and just the right amount of cheese. Lastly, the maker must not skimp on the chosen toppings.  Well done, Aviator! My friend and I shared the \"pizza of the day\", and it was fabulous (though I don't remember the name of it). The crust had that initial crunch followed by the perfect chewiness. We each had a light beer with hints of blueberry-um...yummy!  Aviator is new to this location, and still getting established, so it was dead inside. I suspect this will be a popular lunch place for nearby companies such as Apple, Oracle, etc. There is a huge outside play area for those of you who have kiddos-great for birthday parties.  I prefer quieter places, so it misses the mark for me regarding atmosphere. You can see the pizza makers through a glass window, and the kitchen appeared clean. There are ample choices of beer and lots of great food options too. I've been twice and suspect it will be a fav of mine. Give it a try. Let me know what you think."

                "description": "First time I ordered from here was through Door Dash and we enjoyed very bite of our order. Second visit we decided to dine in. It was crazy packed on a Friday evening but they had plenty of seating indoors and outdoors!  We ordered the Foccacio cheese sticks (basil, mozzarella and goat cheese) - a hit for us when we ordered to go previously. We also tried something different which was the Monty. We also ordered a Caesar salad- pricey for a salad in my opinion but this is a good option if you feel like you need that balanced meal!  The Monty was the least of my favorite. We have stuck to ordering the Flying Garlic Pizza after our first visit and it never disappoints. It has become a must order for us and will continue to stay that way!"

                "description": "As another reviewer said, they should change the order to list Drafthouse in front of Pizza.  This place has an AMAZING tap selection, even better than Pinthouse.  They also have a great outdoor area and sometimes they have live music.  The pizza looks amazing and the ingredients are fresh but the dough has no taste.  Pinthouse on the other hand has an amazing crust and severely limited outdoor seating.    I really hope the crust changes because the outdoor area and taps would keep me coming back.  However I can't see going here over Pinthouse.    If they nailed the dough I would absolutely chose this place"

                "description": "Today, I ordered a to-go order for pick-up so I could do yet ANOTHER lunch and learn... how much learning do I really need to do?????? I ordered two items: the caprese salad and the black olive and caprese pesto grinder.   Caprese-  Caprese salad is a simple Italian salad, made of sliced fresh  mozzarella, tomatoes, and sweet basil, seasoned with salt, olive oil, or  balsamic vinaigrette. This is a menu item that really can't be 'messed up'. It is simple and to the point. This caprese was accompanied by a side of vinaigrette.  Black Olive and caprese pesto grinder-  This item was unexpectedly good. This meatless Monday treat contained black olives, mozzarella, red onions, baby spinach, and a Roma tomato pesto base. This sandwich provided a balanced mixture of sweet (from the tomatoes and red onions) slightly sour (from the mozzarella) and earthy (from the pesto) bites. Although hearty in its contents, this sandwich was actually very light on the palate.   #supportlocal"

The 1st time I wrote off because I thought it was a fluke. Also, I know the staff is busy on a Saturday night and it's tough to find staffing these days during COVID. Maybe I'll try eating in store next time.   But cmon now, my wife is pissed off because I convinced her to get Aviator over another pizza shop.

So many options but I'm not sure if this will be high in my rotation of pizza places.   I do like the restaurant space. The outdoor area is nice and kid friendly with the playground. Aviator has a wide selection of beers (at least from what I could tell). I think the pizza is good but unfortunately I think there are better places for pizza. Weirdly, I think their normal pies (with red sauce) are kind of lackluster. I did enjoy their non-traditional pies. The chicken bacon ranch and the taco pizza were pretty great!"

                "description": "On this deliciously lazy Sunday, the darling husband and I knew that pizza was just the only thing that would do. Jersey Giant Pizza, he suggested? Quick, easy, cheap, and reliably tasty. Closed on Sundays, I lamented. DeSano's, I countered? His eyes lit up, but then I remembered that, although we adore DeSano Pizzeria Napoletana to bloody distraction, we should probably try something brand-new for a little variety...and for me to review! Why not? Enter Aviator Pizza and Drafthouse!  Local? Check! Solid reviews? Check. Hubby's a helicopter pilot and trying out this place is, therefore, too hard to resist? Check. Cute pizza names? Check. Yummy pictures? Check. Let's do this!   (Note: all three are takeout 9-inch pies with no mods, except for hubby's deletion of the green peppers on his Ground Control.)  The Greek: this one was my flavor profile to an ABSOLUTE T! It reminded me a bit of Joe's Pizza at Star Pizza in Houston, but better! A riotous feta, pesto, artichoke, basil, mushroom, and kalamata olive party on a crust! Hugely flavorful! This goes on the culinary Rolodex post-haste!    The Flying Garlic: very garlicky! Shocker, right? Lol! Well, we are garlic people, so we endorse this pie whole-heartedly! The buttery crust, the garlic cloves, and the feta were just unctuous!   Ground Control (minus green peppers): Hubby liked this, but he didn't super-love it. He kept snagging pieces of the Greek and the Flying Garlic. I asked him what his least favorite part was, and he said that it really wasn't fair to judge it on such a small pie. He wants to give it one more shot with a larger pizza! His theory is that small pizzas make the fillings hard to shine. Makes sense!   As I write this, though, he's literally humming Ground Control to Major Tom as he kicks back on the couch playing Call of Duty: Cold War with a warm and happy belly, so I consider this a solid win. We'll definitely be back soon to dine in! Thanks, Aviator!"

                "description": "I've passed by Aviator several times and finally decided to try it with a friend.  We came at 8pm and the place was fairly busy. Unfortunately, the ordering process itself was very confusing. You can either follow a bunch of arrows to the counter and order (with few menus available), or you can seat yourself and order through a QR code and have someone bring your food to you.  We chose to go to the counter and ordered two Bear King beers that had great flavor- we were allowed to sample before ordering which was a plus. There were 50+ beers/wines to choose from so endless options... you can opt for a flight too. We also ordered two small pizzas (BBQ Chicken and Spinach and Artichoke) that came out in ~10 minutes. The pizzas had a thicker crust and were DELICIOUS! I'd definitely order again.   There were plenty of picnic style tables inside and out, and the outdoor patio had beautiful string lights, a playground, umbrellas, and lots of open space. Parking is easy in and easy out, and the staff were friendly.  Overall, I'd recommend Aviator. Great quality pizza in North Austin."

I just love an establishment that recognizes the armed forces, it has special meaning to me.   The menu is filled with military jargon which is pretty cool when you order."

                "description": "My boyfriend and I visited Bombshells on St. Patrick's Day evening in pursuit of having a few drinks and something good to eat. Upon arrival, the parking lot was packed so we thought that was a sign we would have a good time. The hostess told us it would be a 30-35 minute wait. We were seated in a booth after 20-30 minutes. I ordered the Pearl Harbor per the waitress's recommendation and he ordered an Old Fashion. Our drinks took a while because apparently they only had one bar back helping the bartenders. After taking a few sips of my drink, I noticed all I tasted was pineapple juice. I'm not a heavy drinker, but I do want liquor in my cocktail when I order one; it tasted like straight juice. Also, my boyfriend's drink was DISGUSTING. It tasted horribly bitter, not at all smooth and tasty like the Old Fashions he usually gets elsewhere. Regarding food, we ordered chips and queso that tasted stale and the salsa that came with it was watery AS HELL. I was so unimpressed with their menu that I didn't even order anything else. My boyfriend ordered wings and fries for us to share. By the time that came out, the waitress had brought us someone else's wings so she had to take it back and bring the correct one. Like everything else, the wings were nothing to be desired. I don't even think I ate any fries; I was just ready to leave. We barely ate the wings and didn't even take them to go. I guess they didn't have any bussers because there were so many empty, dirty tables around and people steadily coming in to be seated. The best thing Bombshells had going for it was the music. It was also a very diverse crowd: old, young, Black, white, Hispanic, gay, straight, couples, singles, friends, families, everybody. Hence the 2 stars. It's a shame because the vibe is there and the space of the place is really nice but our first impression of it left us feeling like we wasted our time and money. Therefore, we don't recommend it and won't be returning."

                "description": "I felt a little uncomfortable tonight as there was a girl walking around and asking people to buy cookies for $10 and when I said no thank you she suggested I make a donation instead. I'm not sure if she was family of someone working there, but it was awkward that they let her ask for money and since she never left the table we felt pressured to donate money to her with no idea who she was or if she was actually using the money for the purpose she said. Other than that, everything was great!"

Proceeded to ask what our waitress recommended as an appetizer and she said she didn't recommend anything on the menu. Poor attitude, customer service was bad from the moment my waitress began interacting. Seemed like she didn't want to be there at all.

We we're seated finally. Then after about 10 min with no drink order taken from us, a waitress goes to a table where a gentleman was just seated, sat down with him and started taking his order. He wa seated righ next to us. We got up to leave and let the manager know why we were leaving and she acted like she could care less. Have never tried the restaurant out and I can assure you we never will. Good luck with business. You're gonna need it with the staff you have. Sorry I can't rate the food."

I went on Saturday at about 11:00 this place had about 10 girls 2 at the front talking while I'm waiting to get seated , which took (5 min) for the girls to even come back from where they were at . So I finally got to the both still not being serviced properly. I waited 30 minutes before I got up and went to the front and asked \" So IS ANYBODY GOING TO SERVICE ME\" ? Like why come to work if you're not going to work .  I usually come to this place every time I'm in town but tonight was my last ."

                "description": "It was a pretty pleasant Sunday evening for me. I got out of work after being positively complimented throughout the day, just feeling pretty damn fucking good today. I decided to take a nap, then of course decided to get food to celebrate my day. I went on to take a nice hot shower, freshened myself up, and went out for food.   Initially, I was planning on going to Cheddar's but that wait time there was way too long. We're talking 45 minutes. I haven't eaten all day by the way. You know what was close by though? Bombshells. What was the wait time? 5-10 minutes. I wondered why but I didn't question it. It's kind of like when you need to take a shit, and you're just hoping to go to a nice restroom. Anyway, I was pretty surprised.  There was a younger woman who was the waitress our table. First thing she asked was the drinks we wanted. \"Three waters please.\" I was then asked for my card right away which was fucking weird as shit as I didn't receive any food yet, nor did I get an order placed for food. I just sat there and started to ponder a bit. We get the waters but no offering of a straw for our waters, which I also thought was odd. Not really working out the way I'd like for my first time actually dining in.   NASCAR was on for a bit on the TV monitor screen, and then it changed to Women's soccer for the Summer Series (GO USA!). We finally get an order in. I ordered the Grilled Tilapia entree with Alfredo sauce smothered on, steamed broccoli, and Spicy Mac 'n' Cheese. The thing was that the poor waitress didn't even know that there was an option to top the tilapia with Alfredo sauce and shrimp. She mistook it that I wanted to do two different dishes. I'm just like, \"I can guarantee something will be wrong.\" I kept quiet for a bit because I was pretty annoyed.  The food comes out. No shrimp on my dish. Eh, fine. I proceeded to eat the food and it was pretty decent. I liked the Alfredo sauce a lot. The Spicy Mac 'n' Cheese was okay at best. The steamed broccoli was good. I noticed one thing the entire hour being there--I've never once was asked for a refill on my drink, nor were we properly catered to with the courtesy of asking how everything was during the feasting of the food. I'm now really annoyed and frustrated.   The more I noticed things, I observed other tables and waitresses actually having an interaction with each other. The waitress at my table could have given two fucks about my guests and I. Cold shoulder was given to us several times, with the same waitress kissing the asses of the table served behind me to patrons that came in after we did. She was also missing for extended periods of time.  Little did she know, I actually am a frequent high-tipping gentleman with a whole lot of damn money to blow. Sadly though, she dropped the ball highly. I guess it could have been the way I looked or the stereotype that I may not be worth the time to serve--who the hell knows? What I do know is that I was still nice enough to offer a 15% tip even after all of the shitty service provided. I was thinking about stiffing her but thought to myself, \"I think she is new, and they've probably thrown her to the wolves.\" Mind you, we had to let her know that the ticket was wrong. That shouldn't be something on our end to do but we did because we knew something was already wrong to begin with. First impressions are EVERYTHING, baby.  I'll make it known that having a pretty face ain't going to cut it in a face-to-face customer service field. That has to be backed up with a great demeanor, capability, efficiency, eagerness to perform on the job, and always a solid first impression. This young lady needs to be trained more, and I think it's at the fault of the actual restaurant not properly training staff that I'm seeing all of these shit reviews about the service alone. My ass got to experience that instead of the positive side.   I'm extremely disappointed and just hope Bombshells fixes their BS quickly. This restaurant can be more than just the typical chain, especially if it was better ran with its employees. I don't fault the waitress for not knowing better because for all I know--this can be her first serving gig. However, this spot missed the mark highly. Easily, I'm a customer that can bring numerous guests with me, ordering items on tickets of several hundreds of dollars a sitting quite easily. Not going to happen now after all of the mishaps this evening. I'd rather drink bleach.  .5 stars/5 Stars: Absolute abomination. I certainly doubt that I would ever come back to this spot. I would rather serve life in prison in Angola than come back to this spot."

First of all I guess they didn't get the memo that we are in a pandemic since the rent a cops weren't wearing mask or enforcing the rule to   customers coming in and out of the establishment.  They were to worried about flirting with the waitresses.  I get it..they are kind of cute but come on..do your job!  Also there were about 9 of them working last night and only three were wearing their mask correct or even at all.  The bartender had hers around her neck the whole time while breathing directly over your food...smh..very disappointing. The wings themselves were okay but nothing to go back for.  I will be going to a place that the employees know how to actually wear a damn mask."

Also the batter that the pickles were fried in was pretty gross. The chicken wings tasted like they were barely seasoned. Drea our server was awesome and had a lot of patience because I know the group I was with was definitely annoying. The bartender was also cool. The drinks snuck up on everyone because at first everybody thought they tasted watered down and then all of a sudden they felt it (lol). Overall we definitely would not go back it just wasn't worth it."

                "description": "If I could give it zero stars I would .I'll start by saying we had to wait 5 minutes for a table remind you this was a Monday night around 950. Got seated and literally waited there for 15 minutes and still no server. I walked down to where the kitchen was, poked my head in and said hey can we get a server for our table. A girl came by afterwards and asked did she(the unknown server) come by yet we said no. Five more minutes went by and my brother had to yell at a server to come over and serve us. She was nice enough to do it considering she wasn't are Initial server. We order all our stuff drinks and food at the same time. Btw the drinks were very weak tasted like juice and syrup. I ordered the Philly cheesesteak which was nothing to brag about. My brother told the server it was my moms birthday so she offered to buy her a shot. When it was bill time my brother asked for the manager to come over to explain why we had to wait so long and to at least cut the bill down for waiting so long. She said the birthday shot was considered the \"freebie\" and that she talked to the server and that was it. No apology no nothing . I will never visit this place again. They didn't deserve my money or time !"

                "description": "Literally had the worst experience here on Friday evening. First of all the service was terrible, it took about 30 minutes after we sat down to get someone to take our order. We had to go to the front and ask for a server because no one was attending to us. After that, it took another 15 minutes to get our drinks. After we ordered our food, that took another 30 minutes to come out and when it did come out, my food was missing. The waitress didn't say anything so I figured that they were still making it. Only after 15 more minutes passed by and the waitress finally came back did she ask where my food was to which I responded that I had no idea. She then went back to the kitchen and after about 15 more minutes, my food came out. While everyone was eating, they found that my nephews chicken was raw and we had to bring up that issue as well.   The manager ended up coming out and taking my food and my nephews food off the ticket but it was still a very terrible experience. I wouldn't recommend going here to anyone."

                "description": "A Special Wing Outing   In searching for a new place to enjoy chicken wings there was one place I have not been to in a long while, The Park. At first I thought I should have made reservations where the place was packed but luckily there was a table available. The place felt like an upscale sports bar and great place to hang out.  TV monitors were all around showing various sports programming. The place was a bit loud but if you want a quieter atmosphere then suggest sitting in the partially outdoor bar area. Plus the patio area would been a good spot for those still cautious where patrons were seated really close together.  I ordered the 5 Garlic Ranch Rub Farm Fresh Wings along with a draft beer.  The wings were really good having a unique flavor among other restaurants. From my experience chicken wings tend to taste better from restaurants than wing places. They tasted like were slow cooked with nice spices on them. It had a side of ranch sauce to dip them in.   We had a great time here and be back for more."

Beer - barely cold Michelada - no flavor Mexican Martini - There MIGHT have been alcohol in it; at $10 Chicken carbonara -Rago and noodles NO FLAVOR; this is why I cook at home Wings - must have a had a sale a my Sam's for Tyson Buffalo Chicken Wings  The Oasis is know for their atmosphere and horrible food. The Park falls into that category.  Maybe they have a different menu for weekend brunch, but their regular lunch is not good."

                "description": "Overall, a good place for a large group to grab drinks. I went to happy hour here with 8 of my coworkers and the outdoor seating was really spacious and well distanced from other tables.   Highlights: Their frozen margaritas (pretty strong especially for my low alcohol tolerance lol), the free tequila sampler my group received (:, the service, and the fact that they are really flexible with splitting checks for large groups!  Needs to be improved: The food was way too greasy and there weren't any plant based options for my vegan coworker. It would be nice if they had a smaller selection of dishes that were better quality and with half the oil added."

                "description": "A great, always reliable spot! They have a ton of outdoor seating with lots of shade, and excellent deals on drinks + food. Definitely a sports bar vibe, with lots of TVs, but never gets too loud (at least when I've been there) as it's really spread out. They seem to have a nice separate outdoor space that people sometimes use for private events, which I love!  The food is good -- typical burgers, sandwiches, salad, tacos. I love that they have the option to get any time of burger/sandwich on a gluten free bun or a lettuce wrap. Their lettuce wraps are huge and keep everything together! I got the Hippie with grilled chicken and loved it -- the chicken was blackened and spicy - yum! My boyfriend got the Fat Chick (not what he ordered..whoops, but still was delicious). Fried chicken with gravy, mashed potatoes, and sautéed veggies. They have a \"Hot\" (adobo) and \"Skinny\" (grilled) version of this. Nice to see some healthy and more indulgent options.   Definitely recommend if you're looking for good food, strong drinks (and some fun cocktails), and a nice place to hang with a friend or a group!"

                "description": "Actually really good, chill spot. At first, I was thinking I was going to be walking into an Applebee's and I don't think I was that wrong but where The Park separates from Applebee's is the fact that The Park is actually has good food. Well at least their burger was amazing.   Friendly staff. Good, really good, drink happy hour. We sat outside and while a normal outside sitting decision is dangerous in Texas heat The Park actually made the sitting experience enjoyable.   If you are confused on what to get, as I was, may I suggest The Rebel burger. A good sized, well done, burger with fried pickle chips on it. My thinking is this. I'm going to get pickles anyways, I might as well get them fried as well."

The service was very friendly and she gave a great suggestion on the mushroom burger.  The fries were perfectly crispy and not to large of a serving that I was overly stuffed.  I love that their burgers don't come with mustard and mayo and will only add them if you request it.   The hubby had the park burger with onion rings, which he enjoyed buy nothing extravagant.      I did like that they were playing old music videos."

                "description": "After going to the domain location for the first time in January of 2022, a friend invited me to the location on slaughter and I was excited to go do the brunch special that's $16 because it was amazing at the domain. All the the food was old and just sitting there, we were there for about 2 hours and not one did they change anything out. My favorite thing to get is max and cheese and I checked 4-5 times to see if they changed it out. I didn't want to be rude and ask someone to change it out to I asked our waitress for a side of max And cheese (already $5 extra even though it's included in a $16 buffet) so she brought me the photo of the Mac and cheese in the smaller plate which looked like they scooped it out of the Mac and cheese that had already been sitting there. It was dry and barely tasted like cheese. This place doesn't even deserve 1 star! I was super disappointed. We ended up having to order food on top of our brunch special because the food was so old and nobody would replace it for TWO HOURS. The domain location is the one I would recommend instead."

                "description": "ordered: -burrata -steak frites  the burrata is more or less standard fare-- about what you'd expect. but the rest of the dish are what elevate it. the burrata is nestled in a bed of spring mix with a bright green pesto topped and confited tomato. the dish is served with thickly sliced and buttered bread that the menu calls focaccia. aside from the rosemary in the bread, it was much thicker and fluffier than any focaccia i'd had before-- reminiscent of a texas toast. the sunflower pesto was a pleasant surprise. the sunflower stood in nicely for pine nut and was a nice textural foil to the burrata by adding a subtle crunch that is not typical of pesto. while still rich, the sunflower made the pesto a bit lighter than your standard pesto--which again paired nicely with the richness of the burrata.   the hanger steak was well seasoned and had a nice crust on it. the flavor of the meat itself was buttery with a very even gradient of pinkness throughout. the fries however were nothing special. the flavor of the tallow wasn't especially noticeable and i noticed the size and shape each fry was cut to was uneven-- though this didn't seem to affect the texture of the product much."

                "description": "I really wanted to like this restaurant. There seems to be mix reviews here on Yelp. BUT from my own experience, it was awful. The service was good and the servers were super nice. Unfortunately, this particular evening I got food poisoning from whatever I ate.   Mocktails - 5/5  Starters:  Crispy Brussels Sprouts - 1/5 Odd Bits - 1/5  Pasta:  Bigoli alla Carbonara - 4/5  Meats and Mains:  Wagyu Coulotte - 1/5 Wagyu Bavette - 1/5 Sirloin - 4/5  Sides:  Charred Broccolini - 1/5  The servers and service was fantastic. The mocktail they came up with was super tasty. Their pasta was really good. That's where the positives end. Both Wagyu steaks were way under cooked and raw. Very little flavor and not a good Wagyu at all. The odd bits I ordered, were chicken hearts. I'm going out on a limb, and thinking since they were also under cooked, that's where I went wrong. The sides were not good at all. Bland, flavorless.  I left the restaurant and headed home, not knowing the fresh hell that awaits me on my trip there. Within 10 minutes on the road, I was forced to pull over on the side of 290, projectile vomiting for almost an hour. I felt absolutely terrible for about two days. Sad, I really wanted to try this place."

The spinach and mushrooms were well seasoned and delicious.  The Caesar salad was amazing. The dressing was delicious and the chicken on top was perfectly grilled. The flavor tasted like it has been brined for a while--perfectly salty and tender.  The brown butter cake was not very good and the fries were just alright.  Overall, food: 4.5/5 Service: 4/5  Very pricey but you pay for high quality ingredients."

                "description": "I was seriously disappointed by my experience here at salt and time which had been highly recommended to me by a friend. They missed pretty much every mark in terms of a good dinner experience. Let me elaborate.  We got there an hour before closing around 8pm, and were going to try to get in and out quick and didn't want to make them stay too late after closing. Well, we didn't have a choice because right off the bat we had to wait for menus for probably five minutes, waited another 10 for the waiter to come take our order, and when we finally placed our order probably 20 minutes had gone by so we put our whole order in at once.  We ordered the little gem Caesar-type salad, a ribeye (MR) and Teres Major (mr).  We waited (literally) 45 minutes for our salad!!! Waiter kept telling us it was coming and at the 40-min mark he asked \"you guys still haven't gotten your salad?\" Seriously!!!? It's your job to bring it to us and we've asked you about it three times now!  Keep in mind the restaurant was nearly empty by now. When we finally got it there was minimal apology and he seemed very nonchalant like it wasn't a big deal and turns out it wasn't even little gems. I grow little gems and serve them at the restaurant where I work and was super excited for them but this was just a regular iceberg wedge. After 1.5hrs of waiting at this point, steaks came out. Sauces were all wrong and not what we ordered and my steak was over cooked! Clearly medium and not medium rare since my partners was cooked correctly, there was an obvious difference. But at this point, being checked on by our waiter was a ten minute affair so we just shut up and ate it because it was getting late. There were no apologies, no comps, and the waiter kept trying to push us on dessert when we clearly were ready to leave. Dropped the check and proceeded to say \"there's no rush!\" ... yeah no sh*t I can tell that's definitely a motto here. And on top of that there was automatic 20% gratuity. I usually don't mind that, because most restaurant that do auto-grat have good service where I would've tipped 20% anyways. but it should not be a motivator for the servers to not give a crap about their tables like it is here.   The steaks tasted good but for the price, the horrible service and the inability to get orders right, this place was a total wash. You can get better steaks elsewhere for a cheaper price, where you actually enjoy your dining experience. Maybe in the future if they got new staff or management this place could be a really nice restaurant but for now, I can't recommend it."

                "description": "Came here on a burger recommendation. It was a nice little place for brunch. I don't if I was just bad at finding it, but apparently they only have the brunch and dinner menu on the weekend. The lunch menu is only offered on weekdays so if you're wanting to come here for the lunch menu on the weekend, you are out of luck.   But their brunch menu still does offer a burger, the Butcher's Breakfast burger to be exact. It's pretty much the normal Butcher burger but with eggs and bacon added on, and i think cheaper too. I got it medium and it was a nice, hearty burger. It was a juicy, steak-y patty and the brioche bun was quite soft. I probably should've just taken the bacon and eggs out and eaten it separately though. It got a little to big for me.   Beef fat fries are a must try though. Nice soft potato filling, with a slight crisp. I might be wrong, but I tasted a hint of cinnamon and it had a quiet deep fried donut flavor that I am all too familiar with. Very addicting.   Came here on a 1PM Saturday and there was no wait, but I do here it does get crazy busy during dinner times so make sure you have a reservation. Our server was really sweet. The place overall had a calm and chill atmosphere and felt very clean."

                "description": "Best burger in town without a doubt. My friend was singing it's praises for a while and so a group of us showed up all ordering it. Go figure. But it lives up to the hype for sure. It's basically made from trimmings from the butcher shop, so it's ground pretty fresh, seasoned well and honestly tastes almost steak like from the cuts, so highly recommend medium rare or medium on the burger. It's also massive, so no chance you'll leave hungry. Some fresh veg and a nicely toasted bun round off the sandwich. I would also recommend adding some bacon at least to your burger, as it's crisp contrast and who doesn't like bacon.  As if that's not enough, the sides there are also A+. The beef fat fries have a lot of flavor, but also thick enough that you can appreciate the pillowy potato inside. The what I assume house made ketchup adds some needed acidity to all the food but jives well with everything. The shishito pepper app is also really good if you can tolerate a little bit of burn.  Service is a bit on the slow side at the restaurant, so I would definitely recommend getting a reservation if you can but also being patient and just enjoy the decor and conversations with people. The appetizers came out same time as the food too, so waiting an hour for food at 1pm on a Monday afternoon sounds a bit long, but good thing we had good company at least."

Having worked in the industry I politely asked two people if I had been given a sirloin by mistake and they both said no. OMG.  All the servers were in a bad mood ... probably because of something happening with the restaurant. I thought outside would be charming, but it was full of flies.  The catchup was great, though."

                "description": "This was my second time at Salt and Time. I figured that if I picked a non peak hour reservation I would have a better experience that the first time but I was wrong. We ordered the burrata to share since it was one of the things that I tried to order last time I was there but they did had ran out. I ordered the steak and frites and a glass of Pinot Noir. The entrees came out but the burrata was nowhere in sight. We asked the server and he said he had forgotten but would put the order in and comp it. Not ideal, but we were looking forward to it and said okay. The hanger steak was inconsistently cooked (some parts were medium, others medium rare and there was a tiny part that was definitely rare). I did not mind cause it was delicious anyway. The showstopper was the chimichurri... very bold flavors. The burrata was worth the wait although I would have still preferred it as a starter. When we got the check, we noticed we were charged $2 extra for each one of my husband's beers. We let the server know and he promptly took care of it. However, another employee (perhaps the manager) seemed upset about it and kept saying pretty close to our table that the price for the beer should be $10 instead of $8 like it says on the menu and that he had requested that correction in the menus he had printed. I understand they should have been corrected to reflect the price increase but that is in no way our fault. Good meal though, but wish we had gone somewhere else."

                "description": "Absolutely loved our meal at Salt and Time. I got their burger and it was fantastic. Cooked perfectly medium rare, juicy as can be, and with a bun that really held up. The reviews don't lie. GET THE BURGER. Oh and the fries were bomb too.   My wife got the BBLT (beef bacon), and I have to say, it was the best BLT I've ever had. On top of favor, the portion was ginormous. Though, it didn't hold up as well as a leftover.   All in all, highly highly recommend, especially once they open dine in. The patio seating is nice but way too hot during the summer"

                "description": "Pretty miserable experience. There were at least 5 open tables when we sat down so they were not busy. It took 10 minutes for the waitress to give us a menu and immediately ask for our drink orders. 20 minutes later we get them. We've been here for 30 minutes and haven't gotten to place our order yet.   I order the $52 filet as did my friend. I ordered mine medium rare, he ordered his medium. His looked well done but he likes his meat well done so he didn't care. Mine however was completely raw on the inside. Not \"cooked rare\" raw. This thing was seared for maybe 10 seconds. It was also very tough. The waitress just dropped off our food and we were waiting for steak knives for 10 minutes until I walked to the hostess and asked for them.   I sent the steak back and it took at least 25 minutes to get it back. At this point so did not want to pay $52 for a reheated steak so I asked another waitress to grab me a burger instead so I could get the hell out of here. They come back with my steak, which was missing a piece, that had clearly been thrown into an oven or microwave to increase the internal temperature.   If you're coming here expecting an artisan or holistic steakhouse experience, go somewhere else. If you're looking for some $15 cocktails to drink in a gentrified strip mall butcher shop, this is the place for you!   My experience was so bad that I considered contacting my credit card for a refund. It was that bad."

The flavor was amazing! Wow! I have a favorite burger place in Hawaii called Teddy's and so far I haven't had anything tipped that until today. I normally don't get my burger med rare but damn it was good! From the ketchup and the fries to the burger! I loved it! My first experience was great! Too bad I'm an out of towner!

                "description": "Went last night for quick dinner and was absolutely blown away. First and foremost the Beef Tartare is probably one of the best beef tartares I have ever eaten in my life - the mix of flavor was just incredible, and the steak was perfectly diced! I could eat this everyday. Absolutely superb.  We also got the Cesar salad to start which was another hit. For the main we shared the Wagyu NY Strip, side of fries and broccolini, and the sweet corn agnolotti. My ONLY complaint was that there wasn't a larger portion of the agnolotti, delicious stuffed pillows of creamy sweet corn. Service was friendly and hospitable, will definitely be back!"

This was definitely not my experience.  Our server was awesome and the food was amazing.  We ordered the charcuterie + cheese board, carpaccio, salads, pasta and steak.

                "description": "Salt and Time, in east Austin, is a wonderful butcher shop, as well as a great restaurant.  Covid brought the addition of the upscale butcher shop, complete with many house-made items, terrines and fine meats...very impressive selections.   During Covid they also expanded into a new patio for dining, complete with large overhead fans, which made a very pleasant setting on a warm evening.   My daughter and I enjoyed a really great Charcuterie Board, that included 4 wonderful house-made meats, accoutrements and sauces. We shared it and both loved it.  We also shared their absolutely delicious Butcher Burger, made from steak trimmings. It was cooked perfectly and served on a brioche bun with all the trimmings, and the best French fries we've had in a long time.    We will definitely return to this east side neighborhood gem!!"

                "description": "Brunch today allowed me to check another big name off my list. I heard their Butcher's Burger is the best in Austin, so with nothing else calling to me off the menu, I had to try it. It was ok, I think? It was so tall and hard to eat that it was hard to really process and appreciate the flavor. They cooked it right, but the runny egg made the bun slide everywhere and mayo seemed like overkill. The Beef Fat Fries were pretty good, but not so good that I felt compelled to eat the whole serving. My favorite thing was the Charcuterie Plate that we split before the meal, especially the summer sausage, mortadella, and unidentifiable pink pickles. My friends loved their Steak and Eggs. I tried a bite of a friend's French Toast and would have gladly eaten more! While we were waiting for our food, browsing the butcher shop was interesting, and I liked seeing what products exist even if I wasn't in the market to buy anything. Service was attentive. I'm already planning on coming back again sometime because I know other carnivorous friends will love it. But now it's time for an afternoon nap!"

The restaurant made a mistake on a dietary restriction, and while the server was defensive and tried to minimize the issue, Jack stepped in and offered an incredibly humble apology and took care of us.  Mistakes happen at even the nicest restaurants, but what stands out to me is how the restaurant handles it, and in this case Jack saved our experience and ensured we would return.  The food is fantastic - the biscuits are to die for, the grits are delicious and somehow they cook their brussels sprouts to melt in your mouth.  Highly recommend Fixe!"

We went for brunch. The best part of brunch was the menu's pricing. Very affordable for downtown Austin which you don't see very often. I got the burger, it was good. But a little dry and lacking in flavor. Fries and French toast were good. If I was to go back I would try their biscuit breakfast sandwich. The party I was with said their biscuits were delicious. We will definitely be back to try dinner next time.  Pros: price, service, cleanliness, and ambiance   Cons: improve on flavor in dishes"

This place is great for large parties and it's beautifully decorated.  I had the CIDE-car, their apple cider version of a side car... Very tasty and STRONG! Biscuits were big, fluffy and flaky like they came from biscuit heaven and your great grandmomma was the one making them. The deviled eggs were DELICIOUS and I'd like to think of myself as a deviled egg connoisseur. Cinnamon roll. Better than ANY cinnamon roll you've ever had the pleasure of stuffing in your mouth. ABSOLUTELY DIVINE!!! And the chicken fried ribeye with white gravy and collards..... All I can say is babyyyyyyyyyy this was definitely the definition of Southern cooking and hospitality. Our server Katie was ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!  Here is what the others in my party had to say:  To start I had a Cide Car to drink, deviled eggs, and a mouthwatering buttermilk biscuit. My entree was the Chicken Fried Ribeye, served with a side of braised collard greens! I finished my meal off with a hot and fresh cinnamon roll! Everything was delicious! I cleared my entire plate! The service was amazing! Katie went above and beyond to build a strong connection! I definitely give everything a solid 5!  It was an amazing experience from the front door to the table. The manager came by to make sure everything was good. Katie (Server) she was so on point and made the dining experience pleasant. If you ever get a chance to go please ask for her. She took pics of us and made sure the table was happ. For me this place was a solid 5 and I will be back soon!"

I even asked to surprise me with any drink (with a few notes) and all my drinks were also well balanced and delicious.  Food - impressive.  Get the biscuits! Made fresh, so soft and fluffy. Comes with butter and honey. We also ordered the beets, and brussel sprouts. Both were great but the beets were delicious snd had more creative flavors. My man got the pork chop. He took a bite, closed his eyes, and leaned back. I've never seen him do this. Are you ok? Apparently the pork chop is really good. Melts in your mouth. I got the red fish which was tender, perfectly cooked and not dry. Also I don't like \"fishy\" tasting fish and this one was gentle in flavor. The risotto was flavorful and creamy too.  Parking - they have valet but it's slow. The guy was overwhelmed because he was working Alone in a saturday night downtown. Not his fault at all but def piles up.  Def a special date night spot"

We started with a round of drinks. I ordered the Cold Brew Martini. If you like a strong drink, this is perfect for you. My friends also ordered mimosas and spicy Bloody Marys, which they were very happy with.  For entrees we ordered: - Fried catfish with French fries and hush puppies - Pulled pork sandwich - Fried chicken biscuit sandwich with two eggs  - fried chicken sandwich with fries  With a side of: - duck fat roasted potatoes - French fries - Boudin country gravy  - Fresh biscuits  We had no complaints about our food at all. The potatoes and fries were cooked to perfection and the gravy was so creamy and delicious. Collectively, we all agreed these were the best biscuits we'd ever consumed. They bake them in house right after you order them, making them hot, flakey, and melt in your mouth. 10/10 would recommend.  My only complaint would be it was a bit pricey for brunch and almost all the sides were al a carte"

Hot, fresh, buttery biscuits served with butter, honey, and jam. Those might be the best biscuits I've ever had. For the entrée I ordered the Pollo Frito Loco Biscuit, chicken topped with slaw and honey. That was friggin great, super crispy chicken on a butter biscuit.

We ordered the brussel sprout appetizer, beat salad, biscuits, fried chicken and a couple of lovely drinks!  I loved everything food and drink wise but I felt the chicken was beautifully done in the middle and burnt (slightly not bad at all) on the breading.  The salad that goes with the chicken, the Brussel sprouts the beet salad drinks and biscuits are rave worthy!  We LOVED them! We also LOVED our server/ bartender and all the attention to detail for a very fantastic upscale and super comfortable restaurant!  We left with full bellies and full hearts!  Thank you!"

The atmosphere was great, However, the brunch menu is very limited in variety and is overpriced for the portion and quality in my opinion. The pollo frito loco was dry and the duck fat potatoes were very bland and slightly uncooked too. They are extremely limited on gluten free options for their brunch menu as well."

The food was pretty good but the biscuits were hands down freaking amazing. I highly recommend!  Also got the Brussel sprouts and pork chop. No complaints with either, but not craving a second order of these either. Biscuits were definitely my favorite item out of the experience.   Nice place for date night or dinner with the parents.  Parking PSA: Fixe only offers valet parking but there's plenty of street parking/lot parking nearby. I recommend looking around versus spending even more on valet."

                "description": "So this is my third time at Fixe. Each time has been great. The first time was the night i got engaged and its been a special place for us since. We had some St Louis friends in town and they were game so six of us headed over there. First i have to mention the wait staff. It is glaring when you get great service now that when you do, it is really special. Wyn was alternately flirty and fun (with six big gay bears) but most importantly she was excellent at her job. I'd go back even if the food was bad for such good service.   The food is not bad. It is great. We started with the deviled eggs. They're so good. And the biscuits. Omg that is how a biscuit is supposed to be made. Flakey and perfectly cooked. I had the pork chop and sampled everything. The pork chop was prefectly cooked and smokey in a good way. They had really tasty carolina gold rice grits. Its nice to see restaurants supporting bringing back heirloom grains that actually taste like food. The peach cobbler wasnt as good as my mom's but it was purty good. I wouldnt go for the desserts but they were fine at the end of a great meal. Food is an A and the service is an A+.  Definitely worth your hard earned money if you're looking for upscale southern dining."

                "description": "It seems like Fixe Southern House has had its moment already - the empty tables both inside and outside at 7pm were both a blessing and a bit nerve-wracking. I called ahead of time to ask if they were dog friendly on their patio, and they are! I saw no reviews of being dog friendly on Google, Yelp, or on their website, so that was a nice surprise. They even brought a bowl of water for my pup. FYI, you can find street parking nearby quite easily.  The food was pretty great overall - our table shared multiple dishes. I enjoyed the homemade biscuits with seasonal apple butter and the pimento cheese and focaccia dish. The beet salad was so sweet and savory at the same time - delicious! I enjoyed the lobster and crawfish pot pie but wish I had eaten it faster when it was piping hot. The fried chicken was a bit burnt some places but did have a great crisp. The deviled eggs were deviled eggs and nothing to rave about, and the broccolini was a bit salty. I still really enjoyed my time there.  We didn't try any drinks but we did get dessert! The pecan pie was very sweet and heavy, I only had a bite. I did enjoy the blackberry cobbler and ice cream. How delightful.  Overall, a solid service and food selection make this a great stop for southern food. Perhaps an even better place to stop than some other spots in Austin for southern food due to ease of actually getting a table and nice/upscale (although not super modern) ambiance."

                "description": "Great atmosphere and friendly staff. The reputation of the restaurant is excellent southern biscuits. However the brunch menu had mostly glorified breakfast biscuits that were dry and overpriced. The Pollo Frito Loco was an attempt at a fancy honey butter chicken biscuit. The shrimp and grits tasted like it had velveta in it. We also ordered the Duck Fat potatoes. $8 for unsalted, unseasoned potatoes.  I would not recommend this food for this price point."

We also had the pork chop that was cooked perfectly and absolutely delicious. We tried the beet salad which was tasty but a bit plain.   Disappointed in their cocktail list as there were very few options and they didn't have much mixers or fruit to muddle in. The service was also slow but pleasant."

Since it was cold weather, we ate inside but they have great patio seating for warmer weather.  Decor is modern, not fancy but nice. Owners source from local vendors which I respect and highly support. Service is always good as well.  We all ordered the double cut pork chops and they were flippin' fantastic!! Haven't had them that good in years (Perry's Downtown Austin.) This is an easy to get to hidden gem in downtown Round Rock and definitely worth the drive and absolutely a repeater in my book.

We ran out of coffee and water several times and had to wait 10+ min, even with asking other servers. The table decided to order a round of drinks but couldn't get him to take our order before we were done with our food. He bodily ran into my mothers wheelchair twice and didn't apologize or say anything - she has bone cancer and it really hurt.  The food was alright, but when you have to ask three people for syrup for pancakes it doesn't really matter because they will be cold by the time you eat.  My husband and I used to really like this place, seems to have really gone downhill."

I placed an order to go but sat at the bar to wait for a little while. Smallish inside with a great patio space, nice staff, and amazing food! I got the sweet and spicy burger with sweet potato fries and it was exactly what I needed on a Friday. Beware of the habanero paste! My lips were on fire but in a good way. Wish I took a picture but trust me, it was a beautiful burger. My only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was waiting longer than expected for my food. I placed my order at 4:45, before the dinner rush, and they said about 20 minutes. I got a text saying my order was ready after 20 minutes, arrived, and they said it would be a couple more minutes... or rather another 20 minutes. But I was still very pleased with the quality for the price!"

The brunch food was just average, I think this might be a better spot for dinner. I had a Bloody Mary and it tasted like watery tomato juice with no spice or horseradish. My boyfriend had the shrimp and grits - he really liked the shrimp on it but the grits didn't have much flavor. The best item that we had was the appetizer of chips and queso but we subbed fries instead of chips - SO yummy. The queso was spicy and the fries were so crispy.   We would probably go back for dinner and drinks to see if it's better!"

I ordered Shrimp and Grits and she ordered the Full Monty (American sampler)  Our food was all cold nothing hot or remotely warm. They didn't seem too busy so maybe they are working out some expediting issues. My grits were mediocre at best maybe if they were warm that would be different and the shrimp was fishy and rubbery. I've never had grits that were like a smear on the bottom of the bowl/plate but that's exactly what this was.  My daughter said her eggs tasted off and her fruit was clearly on the brink of, if not already spoiled. The best thing on the plate was the potatoes  I'd give them another shot just maybe not for brunch this time."

                "description": "We hadn't been by here in a little while and we're looking to go somewhere different than \"the usual\".   The good: We were seated quickly and there were quite a few staff in the restaurant to help so we didn't have to really wait that long for anything. In fact, once's we're done my wife said, \"we should start looking for the bill\" and here comes the waitress with the bill. This is really surprising in light of the challenges that other restaurants are having with staffing.   I like that this place is in downtown round rock and I like the overall aesthetic with wood beams on the ceilings and the house converted to restaurant feel.   I got a special off of their hatch chili menu and it was very tasty and a pretty decent sized piece of fish.   The not so good: While the food was tasty, I was missing some of the expected hatch chili flavor that I would expect to find when ordering something off a hatch chili menu  My wife's fish was a little tough, but again the flavor was good  If you get cold easily, make sure to bring a sweater. The temperature was pretty frigid and because of the small floor for the restaurant there wasn't really a way to find a spot where the you don't get blown on by the AC.   Wrap-up: All in all the food and service were good. A few tweaks and I think this could be a 5-star review."

Staff were friendly but noticeably uninterested as some were preoccupied scrolling on their phones and others even hanging out at the bar. Our waitress was at least attentive.   For food I ordered the salmon frittata, and the hubs got the pork belly hash and a $5 orange juice that was clearly brand made and from a bottle that probably cost just as much as the charge of the 8oz we were served. Flavor wise, my food was delicious tho slightly salty. However upon arriving to the table, the pork belly hash looked smaller than my entree. For $16 you'd expect strips of pork belly on top of the sweet potato hash - what you really get is 10% protein, 20% dry biscuit, 30% hash, and 40% arugula garnish. Redeeming quality was the perfectly poached egg.   Definitely a happy hour/small bites spot but wouldn't recommend for brunch or a full meal. For $50, much left to be desired"

Both were pretty much flavorless and dry, even with sauce.  All in with 2 drinks, soups and meals it was $100 before tip.  The fries were great, but otherwise I don't think I'll bother visiting again.  I wish them the best and may make a trip again just to check in and see if they've sorted stuff out."

                "description": "My fiancé, baby and I came here for a nice Friday night on the town. We had heard how great it was and was anxious to check it out for ourselves. Upon checking in we were told there was a 45 minute wait...fair enough. We walked to Finley's to grab a quick drink. We were both surprised when we got a text only within 20 mins! When we came back we were greeted by the hostess who was an absolute doll and showed to our table up front. Let me just say - customer service was top notch. Exactly was we hoped for. Our waiter Chandler was amazing! For an appetizer we ordered the bacon wrapped quail. It was superb. We both enjoyed it very much. For our entrees I had a side Caesar salad and the Dry Aged Ribeye (with asparagus and a cheddar potato cake), my fiancé had the Pecan Smoked Pork Chop (with asparagus and a cheddar potato cake) and for our 2 year old we ordered a kids meal with Mac and Cheese and Fries.  Let's start with the Pecan Smoked Pork Chop. While it was the tastiest of our entrees it was just a bit slightly overcooked...but delicious despite that. Okay on to the ribeye. I get this is not a steakhouse so I probably shouldn't have ordered it, but I had a craving. For the $45 price tag we were very disappointed. The thin cut steak very under-seasoned. The \"cheddar potato cake\" was just okay...its basically a mound of mashed potatoes with a cheddar crisp on top. The asparagus was okay but I like the small asparagus better and these were ginormous.  I noticed the baby wasn't eating his mac and cheese and wondered why. It looked like it came from a generic box and once I tasted it I learned why. Oddly enough the dish tasted like it had vinegar in it!! My fiancé tasted it and said the same thing. We even let Chandler know when we were leaving."

Reservations for 10 were easy as we called first thing today. They save a great table for us. Very nice touch.   We started with a few apps that was great. The chips and dip was perfect. Everyone loved the main courses and the plates were cleared.   We ate inside but went outside after to listen to the singer for a few songs. We love live music and it is so great to have it back.   Great night with family."

                "description": "SUCH A FUN DATE NIGHT! Loved the vibe at Alamo drafthouse - we went to see the new Spider-Man and had a wonderful time. We were STUFFED by the end of the movie, but we couldn't help but try as much as we could.  I love that they have tables with the seats - so much nicer if you're actually having dinner. We started with popcorn (actually some of the BEST movie theater popcorn I've ever had) and chips and queso. The queso was AMAZING!! Similar to Torchy's cult classic queso. Then we got some soda and beer, a pepperoni pizza (excellent) and a burger.  We were so full that we didn't get to try the shakes, but we will next time.  The movie theatre itself was great, staff was helpful, place was clean and wait staff had their masks on so I felt very safe, and the movie itself was awesome. Can't say enough good things about this place!"

                "description": "I know that the Alamo Drafthouse is super popular, even iconic in Austin. I just don't really find that the seating is particularly comfortable. In addition, the reach to get to my food is awkward.  And not being a super foodie, I prefer a slightly simpler menu. I just stick with unbuttered popcorn.   I apologize for being a Debbie Downer. But new options are opening up for an evening at the movies and I'm shifting more toward those."

                "description": "One of the primary reasons I chose to move to Barton Springs was to be close to this Alamo. I go once-a-week. Great vibes to see a movie. I'm not a fan of the food and service (The servers literally interrupt you during the climax of the movie to say \"last call\"!).   I wish they shook up the menu and did more creative things. As I mentioned, I go frequently, and it's just the same stuff and it's honestly not that great.   I wish they had the the truffle parmesan popcorn or churro popcorn on the menu like the Alamo in SF.  This location is always dead. I'm so used to seeing Alamo bustling and energetic. You walk in...and nothing is happening.  Highball is always closed.   The Shining photo op set-up is getting quite old and wish they did more fun stuff with the space."

                "description": "Such a cool concept! This is how movies should be done! A great movie theater taken to the next level with gourmet food and drink that is brought to you while you enjoy your movie. It's everything that you would want!   They have burgers, pizza, salads, chicken fingers, great appetizers including cauliflower wings, mozzarella sticks, great popcorn and much more. My personal recommendation is to try the milkshakes (adult versions too) makes for a perfect combo while you watch your film.   The staff and service is incredible. They are prompt, kind and super friendly.   This is a great venue and makes for a great overall atmosphere for your movie day or night!"

                "description": "I visited from out of town, and some friends told me this theater experience was not to be missed. I purchased online in advance (they sell out), picked my seats and showed up early for the previews. We watched the new Wes Anderson movie set in France, so all of the previews were in French and of old French films. Quirky. Our waiter was friendly and attentive, and the popcorn was good. The only things I didn't like were that the volume was really loud in the theater (a plus for some!), and the seats were fairly uncomfortable. Although it seems like a fun place to take a date, it probably isn't. They have a strict no talking policy  and promised to kick out anyone talking during the film."

                "description": "If you have food allergies - beware! The menu looks friendly, but the kitchen and staff are not.   I wrote down my order for a gluten-free pizza - cauliflower crust - and the server took it. Well, she vanished. The second server said he would followup on it. When the pizza arrived, we had our doubts so we asked the runner whether it was gluten-free.   The runner swore that the kitchen confirmed it was gluten-free. Well, here I am throwing up my guts because of my allergy - so, no, it was not gluten-free.   The first server was nowhere to be found. The second server tried to convince me I never mentioned gluten-free - well thank goodness I had my order in writing. I can't believe he tried to put their mistakes on me. Especially when I was the one suffering from the allergic reaction.   The manager said we should have received a square plate for a gluten-free pizza, not round. And basically, that there's nothing he can do about it.   Places that don't try to cater to food allergies - I get it. They're ignorant and need educating.   It's much worse when a place pretends it knows what it's doing but screws it up and has no system to fix it.   Here's a first step -- train the employees on food allergies? And please, if you make a mistake, apologize. Don't call your customer a liar? And don't just make it catering to vegan or gluten-free a \"marketing gimmick\" -- follow through in action."

They truly take silence seriously so it's always enjoyable to watch a movie here.  The parking garage is a bit tight to navigate, so it helps to drive slowly especially around turns. It's free though so that's great. I wish they had more plant-based menu options but it seems they're slowly starting to add some which is greatly appreciated.  Special events are starting to happen again, too! I can't wait for Master Pancake and movie parties to return! So much fun."

I was able to curate my own video dance party and because of the Drafthouse, this event was everything I was hoping it would be.  From the staff being so helpful and accommodating (for ex. every time someone bought me a shot, if I wasn't at my seat, they made their way to find me and deliver it :p), to the help from the event manager David with all the fine details. The Studio 54 themed party I had envisioned came to full fruition that evening and the incredible people at the Alamo Drafthouse really made the night so special.   All my friends and family were just in awe of how well put together the party was and again, I have the Drafthouse to thank for that.  I could go on and on because I'm still on such a high due to the full success of the party.  10/10 would recommend. THE BEST THEATER CHAIN THERE IS. PERIOD."

                "description": "The Alamo Drafthouse Cinema is one unique movie theater. I came here last week for its \"terror Tuesday\" event with some friends and since I'm not from Austin, was quite surprised with the movie theater. Upon entering you are welcomed by a giant carpet and screen from the shining and can even take a picture in the tricycle (which is very, very cool). The theater itself is well decorated and gives you the feeling of a real old school cinema that takes movies very seriously. Upon entering the theater you are handed some water which is quite possibly the most thoughtful thing a movie theater can do instead of forcing you to pay $6 for a pop of bottled water. The theater itself is pretty standard minus the ledge in front of the seat. The seats themselves are by no means nice or comfortable, think old school stadium style seats but for what this theater is going for I actually get it.   If you are lucky enough to live near a movie theater that does all these special movie nights and plays old movies, you absolutely need to come and check it out. I really enjoyed seeing \"Let the right one in\" on the big screen and hope everyone keeps enjoying terror Tuesday's!"

Unique movies and events alongside first-run hits.  Coke, popcorn with REAL BUTTER, and a few hours of entertainment.  What more could you ask for?  Oh, yeah, that south Austin vibe!  I live north and often find myself at Village or Lakeline.  It's like being in a different city, though, as the eclectic and \"Austin flair\" mixes well with the everyday folks coming to the movies.  We just don't get that at much up north and it's good to remember how pleasantly diverse this city is in taste and style from restaurants to neighborhoods to people.  Will I be back?

                "description": "Native Experience did a great job planning and executing our two day, custom tour. Michael is incredibly knowledgeable about Austin and the surrounding area. He has a lot of options that will work for any occasion. For our group we had a certain set of things we wanted to accomplish and Michael put together a custom experience for us that 100% delivered.   Michael is fun, knowledgeable and professional. He was prepared with anything we could have asked for and when we asked for an audible he was able to accommodate with zero problems.   I think it's also worth mentioning that his bus is immaculate, new and comfortable. That's a big deal when you spend a couple days traipsing around TX.   Highly recommend Michael and Native Experience for your Austin adventures."

Michael - a history buff - was born in Austin and is highly knowledgeable of all things about the area. If you are in town, do yourself a favor and book a tour.

                "description": "Such a great experience!  We were with a large group that hired Native Experience for a full day wine tour.  Michael picked us up at our airbnb in Austin and drove us out to Fredericksburg for the day.  This was such a great alternative to staying a night in Fredericksburg because we didn't need to drive.  We went to a couple of really unique spots and had a couple of hours to explore Main Street in downtown.  It was a fully custom tour based on what our group wanted to do.  Michael really made the experience - he was a super entertaining driver and had a ton of local knowledge about the area.  I would highly recommend a tour with Native Experience and would definitely do it again."

SHOT SPECIALS: Tuesdays (3 for 1) and Wednesdays (2 for 1)  JELLO/GUMMIES SPECIAL: Thursdays (50% off packages).  I got at least one of each for the jello/gummies. They offered watermelon, cherry, ocean breeze, and green apple for the Jell-O shots and for the gummies - peach rings, gummy worms, gummy bears, and sour gummies. I really enjoyed all the Jell-O shot flavors and the peach ring gummies. The other gummies had either a weird texture from absorbing the alcohol or wasn't my preference."

The daiquiris are good. One thing however, most of the staff are brutal. I don't think they should be in customer service. One time the lady at the till was wearing her hoodie with the hood pulled tight the whole time. It's like buying beer from depressed teenagers. Basically get ignored until you make the payment. Not a big deal, but learning to enjoy the job might help and give your customers a better experience. Just my opinion"

The only problem with this place is the frozen drinks take too long to drink. They're frozen so they don't go thru the straw as fast as I'd like. The prices are also only alright. If you go on triple shot Tuesday or double shot Wednesday it's a good deal but you could definitely get your moneys worth drinking something else. It's definitely an interesting concept but it's just a bunch of sugary slushees. This place is great if you want a slushy but if you're a real drinker you know what's up."

                "description": "This place is a hidden gem for craft beer lovers in Northeast Austin. They have a wall of eight rotating taps that is as well-curated as anywhere in town. They almost always have something unusual and delicious that's hard to find on tap, like a seasonal Martin House or Lakewood Temptress variation. The prices on the draft beers are great, and there's something fun about taking a draft beer to go in a plastic pint with a straw, like a milkshake. I live within walking distance, so sometimes my wife and I will walk down there and walk back home with a beer (yes, it's legal to drink on the street in this part of town.)  They also have a really great selection of cans and bottles, ranging from IPAs to Belgians to stouts, mostly featuring Texas breweries. I've repeatedly found 6-packs there that I've never seen anywhere else.  I haven't actually tried the mixed-drink slushies, but I have bought some alcoholic gummies and jello shots when I was feeling ridiculous, and they were as good as you could expect. But really, the beer is where it's at here, IMO."

Walked in and a friendly, smiling face greeted me. I let her know it was my first time there and Jodee behind the counter gave me the whole scoop on all their flavors and the most popular ones. She sure knows her stuff! I went ahead and asked for a blue coconut  flavored one (sorry I don't remember the name). She went ahead and quickly filled my order and I was on my way. It was just perfect for a sunny Sunday after mowing my lawn. I really got to enjoy sipping on it while I sat on my hammock during quarantine minding my own. Will definitely be coming back. Prices are reasonable, size is perfect and flavor and amount of alcohol in it is just splendid. I'm looking forward to trying the rest of their flavors!"

I walked in and saw a line as I was not the only one to notice they finally opened. The gentleman taking orders was very nice and explained how the hole thing worked, considering these are alcoholic drinks to go. They have a huge variety of margarita flavors to choose from as well as some cold draft beer, a huge variety of beer in their cooler, jello shots, and gummy bear shots.

Now that that's out of the way, Jennie O. and I have been anxiously awaiting the opening of this place because it's conveniently located between where we live! Today just so happened to be that day!  The original plan was a pool party, but a friend's housewarming party was the reason (and the opening day, of course) for our initial visit. A brand new building, everything is shiny and clean and new! They have a solid beer selection (both on draft and in cans/bottles), including a tasty honey vanilla wheat beer that can't be found anywhere else in Austin, currently!  Oh, yeah. Frozen daiquiris. Served in cups in plastic bags for traveling. I tried the Berry Bomb (strawberry and raspberry) and I shouldn't have been surprised at the sweetness, but I felt the need to brush my teeth right away. Jennie had the PPD (strawberry, pina, and mai tai) and it was just as sweet, but had more actual/distinct flavor than mine did. They also have a variety of Jell-O shots and boozy gummy bears (all served in plastic bags, again, for traveling).  The staff is friendly and helpful. There are also a couple tables (they could maybe fit a couple more) in case you want to have your beverages in house. I think.  Long story short, Jennie and I were not disappointed. I definitely see this being a regular place for us."

The cashier let us know that the drinks were 117% alcohol before adding any extra shots. I didn't add any extra because I was concerned that the alcohol taste would be to strong. Turns out the alcohol taste wasn't overpowering but the drink was strong enough! It got be pretty tipsy. :-) Not only were the drinks delicious but the atmosphere was pretty lively as well (thanks to the background music).   They have two tables set up to sit. The place is really small but hopefully they can add another table or two in the future. When I visited I sat at one of the tables and enjoyed my drink. The only thing I felt was missing was a few snacks. Maybe they can add some in the future. Overall it was a great experience and I'm ready to go back!"

                "description": "We visited here. with friends last Friday. It was our first time since moving to the area. The venue was packed but the spacious outdoor seating still made everything feel comfortable.  Our server was kind and put up with my wife's and mine poor ordering habits. My wife got the croque monsieur, and I got the pressed Cuban burger. Both were very good. We also got the chips with Gruyère cheese sauce. Also delicious.  Their drinks were okay, nothing to write home about. I'd stick to beers here.  Overall we had a good experience and would come back either just for dinner for us, or with friends."

                "description": "While this place holds the unique position of THE #1 Austin establishment in which you are most likely to find yourself surrounded by belligerent, toxic cis dudes (I mean a specific brand of Panhellenic acolytes who casually and *very audibly* rank women as they walk past), I still on occasion like to come here if I am nearby and a friend suggests we swing by for a quick happy hour bevvie. Their happy hour is pretty great. Still, I never stay longer than an hour, because as I mentioned, it is _toxic_ bro city up in this bar, unfortunately.  As for their food, their poutine is delicious. As is their Wisconsin Wurst, and honestly most of their sandwiches are up to par. The bar staff are always kind and helpful.  I only wish the environs were a bit less nauseating."

                "description": "On the whole I was sadly a bit disappointed in the quality of food and experience at Haymaker.  On the experience, their mobile web UI is very dated and not fully functional: we ordered online for in-restaurant pickup, and never received a confirmation via phone or email that our order had been placed. After waiting some time, I went inside to check on our order status, and they indicated it had not been received. Slightly inconvenienced, I placed the same order again in person. A few minutes later, the server let me know that the web order had, in fact, come through, and that they were producing one order and a separate, duplicate order. I asked them to cancel the original order placed through their mobile website, but their system does not allow for reversal of web orders. I had the in-person order reversed, having encountered friction while attempting to simply place an order at several steps along the way.  On the food, their grilled chicken sandwich was substandard quality at best. The meat was rubbery, and the secondary ingredients (lettuce, tomato, pickles, bun) were of pretty transparently low quality. I'm open to giving it another shot, but the first-time experience was, all things considered, an unfortunate one."

                "description": "Been here a couple of times pre covid and once fairly recently. Their outdoor space is a great spot to hang out and watch a game with plenty of tvs and well spaced out tables. They have reopened for indoor dining but when I went in to use the bathroom the space between fairly crowded tables was definitely too close for comfort.   In terms of food they have a pretty nice variety of out there sandwich/burger options along with typical bar fare. While I appreciate the variety I've found most of the food I've tried to be okay at best. Most recently I've tried the wings and Italian hoagie. The wings were super bready and the sauces weren't very flavorful. The roast beef and sausage on the hoagie were also both fairly bland.   They have some pretty solid drink specials (when I last went on a Tuesday all Texas beers were 3$) and compared to similar spots they have a really wide selection of options.   Overall, I think the vibe here is great and the drink deals are hard to beat. But between the less than stellar food and questionable crowd control I can't say I'd recommend coming by in the near future."

The problem is they don't know how to communicate or remove people from the reserved area without being assholes about it. The sad thing is that our business with 70+ employees is located just down the street at The Station and now we will be going to Love Supreme or Oddwood or Batch or The Vortex for any happy hours."

                "description": "Horrible service. I'm staying at Hilton and wanted to try this place since it's inside the hotel. A couple of days ago, I wanted to place a to go order for breakfast. I called countless times for over two hours (no joke) and was either placed on hold or sent to voicemail but no one ever assisted in placing my order. So that day was shot and I went elsewhere.   I tried placing another to go order this morning and called over 40 times, literally! But once again no luck. So I decided to stop by in person on my way to work. (If you're wondering why i kept trying it's bc the hotel offered food credit to be used at the restaurant.) I advised the male host that I attempted to call and even showed him the call history on my phone and that no one ever answered the phone. He claimed he just arrived at work and couldn't explain why there was no answer. He was not sympathetic one bit. I proceeded to place an a order for the açaí bowl to which he responded that they couldn't serve it since it was no longer breakfast time. Mind you, I had attempted to place my order by calling before breakfast ended and I wanted to show him my call history before 11:00 am but he could have cared less. So I proceeded to ask for the manager. (My apologizes for acting like a \"Karen\" here but I felt justified.)   While waiting for the manager, I dialed the restaurant again to test if they would answer since the restaurant was not busy. The phone is next to the host's stand where I was standing and I noticed that the calls were not being answered. The ringer was off but the phone would light up. The phone also reported 117 missed calls! Wth?! That's a lot of business they're losing from potential customers that want to place food orders.   Richard, the manager, just added fuel to the fire. I waited nearly ten minutes for him. When he finally surfaced from the back I explained the situation. He was very cold, not apologetic and just asked me if the açaí bowl was all I wanted. When I answered in the affirmative he said \"ok\" and walked off. Never said it'll be right out and never apologized. So rude and unprofessional and so disappointing coming from management.   I eventually received my order but not an apology.  The food prices are also excessive. Can get much better tacos at much lower prices elsewhere with much better customer service."

                "description": "SXSW beware.   I came yesterday for lunch. Carne asada tacos were great and the salsa was also great. The server was a middle aged white guy who was beyond nice.   So my punishment for coming back today is mediocre food, visibly smaller portions, and rude service from a young woman with braids uptwisted.   I asked for a sample of queso. They aren't even close to capacity. Walk up seating. The response was \"No.\". Not, I'm sorry we aren't allowed to sample. Just NO.   I kept looking at her with a blank stare and she said \"I'm serious. I would have to charge you to get anything from the kitchen!\"   Since I never asked for a FREE sample, I just looked at her and placed my order.   Chips and salsa. Overpriced at $14. And confit pig tacos $12.   Here's the thing. I came yesterday and got my salsa in white bowls served on the white plate.   Today someone decided since I was by myself I would get a half portion.   This is so fcuking ghetto. You're getting the same $14 it doesn't matter how many people are at the table.   At this point I'm pretty done. However the icing on the cake. I've been sitting here for 45 minutes. I finished my food. And this waitress hasn't once stopped to see if I need anything. AGAIN. The restaurant is at 50% capacity as to what it was yesterday when I got better service and better food.   I won't be back."

I was working in the area and pressed for time so I thought I'd give it a try.  Having said that, their Confit Pig tacos were fine (great flavor and sauce) although the pork was a little tough and at $12 for 2 these are the cheapest tacos on the menu.  $19 Carne Asada Burrito? You must be joking. I probably won't be back.   They've got nothing on Torchy's, Tacodeli, Veracruz, or any of the multitude of great, inexpensive, and authentic taco trucks in town. The ubiquitous hipster logo says it all. Don't be a tourist!"

                "description": "Admittedly I came here on New Years Eve for some late night munchies before the countdown, not knowing this joint was part of the Hilton Hotel. That explains why the prices were slightly high when tacos are ubiquitous in Texas.   The fish taco was actually really good. I think they might have been a close tie for tacos I've had on my Texas trip. However the old school tacos were kind of boring and a little difficult to eat because they were getting soggy.  Our drinks were really good...but really sugary. It would be hard for a drink to taste bad with that much sugar. I would commend a bartender that can make a drink taste good/sophisticated without resorting to all that syrup. I felt like I was drinking candy syrup. This missed the mark for me in creativity or sophistication.  Would I recommend this place again? I'm unsure. If I stumbled upon here, I would definitely eat here again but I'm not sure I would go out of my way to eat here"

                "description": "Really enjoyed the food and drinks here on my recent trip to Austin. I haven't been to Austin in over 12 years so it was nice to get back downtown and see what's changed and what's not.  On a quiet Thursday night, stopped in to a relatively empty house.  Guessing given it was a weekday, on a rather chilly night for Austin, and with 6th street so close by - that's why it was so quiet.    To our benefit though, as we got great service.  My prickly pear margarita was perfectly balanced, great drink to end my night on.  For food, started with the guacamole, fried brussel sprouts, and for my main I got the al pastor tacos.  Let me tell you, those brussel sprouts are were it's at! They were perfect, the flavor was outstanding.  The soy glaze that's on top is delicious.  While the guacamole itself was great, the chips were a total let down.  For a taco joint, you'd think they'd fry up some fresh chips - these were sadly not - but good enough to get that guac to the mouth.  My al pastor tacos were pretty good, but I would have loved a little more char on the pork.  The pineapple was a refreshing topping, just enough not to be overwhelming.  Again, service was great, not too intrusive and at a good pace.  Def. look forward to coming back here when I return in March!"

                "description": "While the food didn't blow me away, it's great that they're open late. They have a trendy, colorful decor and very nice staff that were friendly and attentive.   A friend and I split a bunch of things off their bar snack menu. The deviled eggs with pickled mustard seeds and bacon were fine, but the mustard seed was a weird addition that managed to completely mask the bacon. The carnitas tacos were bland, couldn't taste the salsa verde. The Chimichurri tacos were better, the steak was nice, but again the flavor was mellow at best.   The tots absolutely stole the show though, this is what you should order. Tater tots covered in fried cheese curds, poblano gravy, and a sunny side up egg. This was hard to finish because of its density but is so good you'll put yourself through the pain to try!"

Bad thing is they don't open till 4pm, good thing is they are open till midnight or later depending on the night.   Decent size full bar located in the back of the restaurant. Great selection of local craft beers and some that are local!  Then there are the tacos, they come out really really fast after you order them, bad thing is they come really fast after you order them .  They are lukewarm at best.  And rather tasteless, no seasoning or lack of.   Came here multiple times during a week stay at the Hilton, service at the bar was never an issue."

                "description": "When our first choice for dinner didn't pull through we were desperate to find a quick (we had less than an hour!) and tasty place to find dinner. It also needed to seat 7 of us... oh and it was a Saturday night.   That's a lot of requests, right?   Well lucky for us, Yelp found us Austin Taco Project. You would never know that this was inside the Hyatt hotel, but it is! And it's pretty darn cute.   It's divided into two sections - the bar and seated. Both of which will get you a waiter. We opted for the bar area and were super comfortable. Our waiter was amazing and everything you'd want in a waiter. Unfortunately his name escapes me, but he was pretty darn fabulous. Quick, efficient, even taking off a drink that never arrived (totally not his fault) yet still giving the drink to our friend in the end.   The tacos at this place were all over the map - and I like it like that! A little different, a little strange, but still familiar. I ordered the Umami Taco which was both vegan and gluten free (not that it matters to me) but I do love anything mushroom. The waiter indicated it was salty and suggested I add avocado to cut the salt. He was so right! I do love me some salty things but the avocado was exactly what was needed - and some lime!   I also ordered the deviled eggs . Why? Because I always order deviled eggs. And they didn't disappoint! A great treat on a hot day!   Cocktails were splendid and on point. And everything on the menu was a delight.   Definitely look to this spot for a quick cocktail and bite with friends!"

                "description": "My friends and I came here for dinner on our first night in Austin and had a decent meal. I had made a reservation in advance, but it wasn't super necessary as the restaurant wasn't crowded around 8pm.  To start, we all split an order of Tots (fried cheese curd, poblano gravy, and a sunny side egg) and the Elote (charred corn, chipotle aioli, queso fresco, cilantro). Both were super delicious, and far surpassed the tacos I ordered for my main meal. I got an order of the Umami Tofu (mushroom mix, fennel salad, and candied ginger). Having candied ginger on a taco was a super interesting experience, and honestly I'm not mad about it. Overall the tacos were decent but a little cold and incredibly oily.   I appreciate what Austin Taco Project is trying to do with unique taco creations, even if they don't always work out, but honestly my biggest complaint is about the slow service. Despite the restaurant being relatively empty and our waiter standing 15 feet away from our table for the majority of the night, he visited our table very infrequently to check on us.   Overall it's not a bad spot, but the food quality and service could definitely use some improvements."

                "description": "Parents, hubby and I landed here after a particularly harrowing travel day. We were eager to get our grub on and this place sounded nice so we trekked 5 minutes on foot to get here.  I was a little turned off by the host taking leading (?) us to the table, leaving the menus on the table and walking off without pausing to see us to our seats. He continued walking off without saying another word or a backward glance at us. It was like he went for a stroll, slowed down to leave some menus on a random table and went on his merry way. Mind you, the place was mostly empty so he wasn't like, rushing back to seat more people.  Anyway, our server came by in short order and took our order. To start, we ordered the onion dip, the ribs, deviled eggs and the elote. I definitely recommend the elote which was delicious and quickly devoured, followed by possibly the onion dip. It did double duty as saucing for the tacos (more on that later).  My parents enjoyed the ribs. I abstained.   As for the deviled eggs...I'm willing to allow may be it was just this batch but we're fairly confident this gave me the runs all night and some of the morning, too. I ate 75% of the dish while hubby ate the rest. He had diarrhea once that night.  Parents were fine because they didn't have any. In any case, they tasted a-ok, maybe a bit on the tangy side.   For mains, we shared some carne asada tacos (x4), brisket tacos (x4), carnitas (x2) and Eisben (x2).  The two types of beef tacos were just ok in our book, both leaning towards the dry side. The carne asada was a bit extra dry, hence why I decided to throw some onion dip on top. In contrast, the carnitas were really great as was the Eisben, also a pork-based taco.  For drinks, I ordered the sea foam paloma which didn't do it for me. Can't say why...I think I would just preferred a salt rim, I think.  Anyway, our server was nice and professional...got us our requests in short order so that was a plus. However, I don't think I would make this a repeat."

Right level of heat, smoke, and sweetness  Teriyaki- Sweet and tasted exactly how teriyaki sauce should taste. Deep notes of ginger which was amazing  Lemon pepper- could have been a lot better. It was almost as if they just sprinkled a little bit of essence of the seasoning.  Honestly couldn't tell the difference between the lemon pepper and the following wings.  Taco- I could see the seasoning but they were basically naked wings. The only flavor I could sort of taste was cumin, which was kinda blah. I wouldn't call these Taco Flavor. A good idea to market these as taco flavor would be to market the as \"carnita wings\" fry them up until they are super crunchy like chicharrón crunchy then serve them with side of salsa. If you use this please credit me! Lol free wings with a year would be nice too lol ;)"

Their menu is definitely creative, they have a lot of amazing pizza combinations or you can always create your own.  You can also order a whole pizza or order by the slice which my wife loved since she usually doesn't eat too much.   We ordered the Orig Mama Gallo and it came with sliced meatballs and pepperoni. The combination of meats were great. The crust and dough were amazing and so soft. Their beer selection is quite extensive, I found a local beer from a small brewery I had never heard of before. I loved it so much that I ended up visiting the local brewery in Pflugerville.  Definitely give it a shot if you are a pizza lover like I am."

                "description": "I honestly do not know where to begin with this review......I get it, possibly short staffed, since I did see a sign out front, but management should adjust how many patrons are seated if that's the case. 1. We signed up for space available seating for six people, mind you, two were planning to order single slices. We get to the restaurant and the first thing that strikes four of us as odd is the fact that the \"greeter\" had the emotions of Wednesday Addams...zero expressions nor cordiality. Did not see a smile one from this person. She should reconsider her position, but I'd suggest she work BOH the way she appeared.  2. Our waiter/order taker person, whatever the pronoun is today was flat out.....Terrible! His name was AJ, AJ was not attentive, didn't write ANYTHING down, did not take our drink orders(he was reminded by the bar staff). After he \"mental\" took our order down l noticed the \"I got you look\", AJ did not have us. Nope, ordered sweet tea, got unsweetened, came back with an excuse, we brushed it off. Ten minutes later, came back and asked my wife and I what pizza we ordered(again, he wrote it down mentally), I asked him to guess...when I told him a number 12 he replied, \"I knew it, was just checking.\" I honestly could keep going on number two, as the service was just that....shit.  3. Nothing, I mean nothing arrived on time. My Brother received his pizza before ANY of the the reheat and serve slices came out. My wife and I got ours after he'd finished half of the pizza. After the complete shit show for service, as soon as our pizza came out we got a to-go box. I could expound on every one of these points, but I won't.   All in all the bill was $145, only one beer was ordered. I was \"fine\" with leaving a $20 tip for the service we received, but was talked into being generous. My old self would not have been so nice. Maybe folks are used to this service at this establishment, but for the money we paid I would have been happier with a PJ pizza and some good garlic butter sauce! Oh, I attached a pic of my pizza from last night...."

I was sawyer by the 4 star Yelp reviews, I had detour from my original plan to visit Pinthouse Pizza.   There's plenty of parking in fact there's an indoor covered parking lot on the same block around the corner. Upon entry the ambiance is well wonderful. There's enough tables and an ample amount of TV's to watch any of your heart's desire for sports.  I proceeded directly to the bar to order my pizza and beer to go.  When I sat down at the bar I ordered a pepperoni pizza and some water. After the pizza arrived after about 15 minutes or so I decided to sample a couple of ciders. I tried the Meridian Hive Cherry and the Meridian Hive Rhapsody. I ended up buying the Meridian Hive Cherry. It was on the sweeter side think like a wine.  When I finally tried the pizza it was pretty good. It was above average and I would try it again. The wings were really good. The sauce was flavorful and robust. The chicken was very good too. I definitely recommend Slap Box!"

During CoVid times, we ordered to-go and ate in the plaza next door since it was a lovely afternoon.   Be forewarned, if you get a slice... it is a BIG slice!  See the La Jolla slice picture. It's huge!  The kids loved their pizza. Not a surprise there since it was your typical pepperoni.   I had a GF, vegan pizza for the first time and it was pretty good. I'm so glad they had this option on the menu so I didn't have to order a salad.   They had lots of beer options on tap but we didn't partake this time. Next time, we will. Give them a try!"

One time we ordered it for delivery and were charged mega bucks by the delivery service, so we'll never do that again.  Another time I placed an order over the phone to go and had to wait outside for about 15-20 minutes past the pickup time because there were so many people in line."

HUGE slices! Lots of variety and interesting toppings. AND this is a pizza restaurant but do not overlook the wings. They are sooo good. I love the dry rub ranch and recently tried the bourbon glaze which was super tasty. They have a great variety of beers on tap and attentive service. Also, a great place for take away. Slapbox is a fantastic addition to downtown Round Rock."

Ordering online was easy, we reached there early before the specified time but still our order was done already. Garlic knots was not good, no flavors, it dint even feel fresh, could taste garlic but not even a hint of butter but the sauce it came with was so good. Pesto cheese pizza was awesome, pesto was so fresh and flavorful. crust, cheese, everything was just delicious. Will be back again soon for more pizza!"

                "description": "***PREFACE: IF YOU ARE PLUS-SIZED OR WELL-ENDOWED ON THE BACKSIDE, CONSIDER GOING TO ANOTHER LOCATION OR THEATRE***  I called a little while ago and spoke with the Manager on Shift named D about some feedback I had, but wanted to provide it in writing in the hopes that it will assist in improving your overall customer experience -   I'm a plus-sized woman and haven't been out to an Alamo Drafthouse since before the Pandemic began. I was extremely excited to see \"The Batman\" film and upon entering the theatre for our 2:30PM showing, was immediately concerned with the way the seating is now designed in the theatres at the Slaughter Lane (and possibly other) locations.   The seats are extremely cramped, the tables so close together that an individual that is either plus-sized like myself or well-endowed on their backside have trouble getting into, but more so, out of the seats. While I appreciate the change over to nice loungers with elevated leg-rests, but the spacing is incredibly tight. Once our movie was over, I had an extremely difficult time getting out of my seat and I hurt my back as a result. I don't know about you, but I don't exactly expect to go see a movie at a theatre with the expectation that if I'm bigger than other people, I'll be hurting myself in the process to get in and out.  Manager D told me that there've been several complaints about this from other people, but this is a concern for anyone larger like myself. Had I known that the the seating situation would be so difficult to get in and out of, I would have sought out another theatre to go to. While it is possible to select a seat from the handicap area to better accommodate my larger existence, if I went to see a film with a group of friends of my partner (both of which I did today), doing so would force me to be apart from my group and likely take away from the overall experience.  I know that it's no one's problem that I'm fat, but I know for a fact I'm not the first - nor last - fat, plus-sized individual who will enter your theatre. When it's time to remodel your location (or others), I hope that you will take into consideration that larger people deserve to be comfortable and enjoy their movie-going experience without risk of embarrassment or injury in trying to get out of their seats.  Please take people of all sizes into consideration when remodeling and arranging your seating - it's already difficult being larger if a person has medical issues that contribute to their weight-struggle, and it's even more difficult for some of us to find the courage to go out with people and not feel like you stand out like a sore thumb for your size and the space you take up. We plus-sized folks want to go see a movie sometimes, too - please remember us when making seating arrangement considerations in the future.  Thank you for your time, and I hope this isn't something that gets overlooked."

This isn't a dine-in theater, it's a restaurant that shows movies in a super comfortable environment. It was an awesome experience. Easy to buy tickets online and find seats, service was great, seats were comfy. We will definitely be back!!   I love dine-in theaters and was so disappointed when AMC lowered the quality of their food and seemed to stop showing certain types of movies, or too releases. So it was really refreshing to go to Alamo Drafthouse for the first time. Now I can't wait for the second time, and third time, and many more."

This particular theater has reclining seats and personal desk tables rather than the high bar table at other Alamo Drafthouses. I got the pizza with Brussels sprouts and goat cheese -- delicious! The fried pickles were good too. Don't expect the fried pickles to be chips, they're spear shaped... if that matters.   If there's one negative critique, it's how loud the speakers were. It seemed insanely loud. I consider myself more on the hard of hearing side... and I thought the sound level was ridiculous. It was a good thing I wasn't watching an action movie, I don't know if I would have been able to handle it the whole time.   All in all, a good experience and if in the area, I'd go again."

It was a Special Christmas Polar Express movie on the big screen, along with the price of the movie everyone received a train whistle, Santa hats, bell necklace, Golden ticket, and popper. 2 cast members came out before the feature with one dressed up as a train conductor and explained how to use the props. The kids food menu was perfect and let we grandparents order from it also. The food was warm good flavor and perfect size. The chocolate milk shakes with whipped cream topping was wonderful.  Service was great fast correct orders for all of us. I know Polar express is not new but we grandparents haven't seen and it was really good. The place has new seats and updated tables.

The disappointment is the food and sometimes the wait staff. I have tried an array of things on the menu and they are honestly the equivalent of a cheap diner lacking in flavor. And for that quality of food, way over priced.   The staff is not unfriendly, but about every order i have made, if i edited, it was ignored. Not sure why this is. More than anything else it is just annoying.   If anything, i will not come here hungry and just enjoy the films."

It was so hot in there I was sweating. And the service wasn't good. I asked for a refill 2x and waited nearly an hour to get it after the second time. The seats leave your get hanging and they fall down on their own, so we had to keep pushing the button to raising them up... They are narrow too... Food was good but 3 hours in the heat with an uncomfortable seat did not leave us feeling the love for Alamo Slaughter Lane...  I don't know what's going on but 2 stars instead of 1 because the guy that did our tickets was nice and took care of us.   Needless to say we won't be back.  Alamo pet peeve... Everyone location is different. You don't know what you're going to get. Recliners, old time theater seats, non recliners, only recline on the front row...Small tables, high tables, a long table...  It's an inconsistent experience."

He was very impressed with the options, and we were both impressed with the atmosphere. We really enjoyed the nostalgic movie posters and almost carnival like vibe. The staff was also very friendly and helpful, so this was a great way for us to spend our time while waiting for a flight."

There's a mix between high tops and low tables, plus a large U-shaped bar in the back. They also have a front and back patio with additional TVs.  This location is strictly drinks so we usually bring food in with us we pick up on the way. The vibe is fun on Sunday's and if you want to mix it up, they have ping pong and beer pong out on the patios free to play."

                "description": "Honestly, this place is such an underrated gem in South Austin. The layout and vibe of the bar is amazing with great indoor/outdoor flow for those days when the weather is not our friend. Their back patio is tucked away and offers some peach and quiet while still being able to enjoy the game. We have hosted a few UCLA Alumni events here and the manager, Casey, is always very helpful! They share a kitchen with the pizza joint next door. Though I can't recommend the pizza the wings are phenomenal."

                "description": "This place is horrible! They over charge you and then supplement the charges buy saying you order \"FREE NACHOS SALSA\" if you so happen to not want the free salsa and chips they and leave on the table unopened!!! Yup you guessed it they!! Wipe the table downs and recycle the chips and salsa! I wrote a review on this \"RACIST\" place on yelp for another HORRIBLE experience! But my buddy wanted to go yo local place and he duped me Into coming here on a fight night!   I wrote this review already and I think they got it removed because it was so damaging to what they call \"business motto\"!  I WILL MAKE THIS SIMPLE!  I went to this place to watch a fight with a buddy!  I am not a big drinker!! I ordered one drink!! JUST ONE! My buddy had two drinks I believe and he also happened to also not order free bag of chips and salsa! But they made they way from behind the bar to our table! SPLENDID!!!!! Fight is over and i want to pay my bill will honor and dignity!! NOPE NOT TODAY!!   The waitress brings the bills, my bill is over charged! So i asked her why am i being charged for chips and salsa! \"Hold on lemme get the manager!\"   This Sorry excuse of a manager walks to our table and requested the issue! As I explained to him that you are over charging customers, he states \"i do it to everyone and no one has a issue but you!\"   Ok, Manager today you will not over charge me and you will correctly charge me so i can be on my way!!   He violently yells at me and tells me to get out but then remembers he has to get rid of the evidence so he voids my transaction!  Charges My friend because he paid before me and DIDNT notice the over charge!   THIS PLACE IS RACIST!! THE way that Manager treated me as if we meet him before! I am a minority!! Why would he treat me as if i am hanging around this place! I was a patron and he treat me less then human after I discovered they COVID Gorging secret!! If allowed i will add pictures of receipt! Second bad experience i was in where i found myself being yelled at by a WOODROW employee while trying to pay!! I HAD TO WRITE ANOTHER REVIEW because they may have removed my other one!! I just want an explanation on why are you doing this to customers and why are you so aggressive with black customers! He was emotionally violent and it scared me so i walked away!  I just want clarity and a non aggressive place to have a beer or watch a fight in SOUTH AUSTIN while being BLACK!! Nothing much!"

                "description": "I like this location although the building could use a massive upgrade at this stage. The staff is attentive, the beer selection is dope, and having a traditional low key sports bar on the south side has been great. The food trucks that are adjacent never seem to be open when I come but the walk up Brooklyn Pie Co. is a game changer. All in all if you are a south sided looking for sports and cools beer with friendly service Little Woodrow's south is a safe bet. Just don't expect Bella and whistles. That's not what they do."

                "description": "This is a great place to get drinks and watch sports. However on a day when the temperature is 30 degrees, I wish they would close the door. We might as well be sitting outside. Looks like a ski lodge with everyone bundled up. Not to mention covid and cedar are both high right now. Furthermore if I was running this establishment I think people would be more inclined to drink more if they weren't freezing their asses off. Anyways it's a great place just seems like a no brainer to close the door on a below freezing day so your customers are more comfortable."

They have indoor and outdoor seating, a fire pit, TVs,  swings and bochee ball.   They are located right next to Brooklyn Pie Co. and they also have a Mexican food truck on site!   Dog friendly is always a plus!   21+ after 5pm."

My son and I decided to wind down at Little Woodrow's. Temp was in the 30s that night, but they have a really big and nice fire pit outside.    We arrived around midnight:30 on a Monday and the crowd was light and fairly quiet.We sat in a booth not far from the door (but also not far from the bar).  Only one bartender that night so the wait seemed a little long, but there was really no reason for them to staff two bartenders on a Monday evening.    Drinks were good, conversation was easy (no need to yell at each other because the crowd wasn't loud), and the place was nice and clean (restrooms too).  This was my first visit to Little Woodrow's, but I'd go back :-)"

I'll tell you which ONE, Woodrows Southpark Meadows because they are adding  club  soda  to  their whiskey so therefore they use the illusion of giving you a decent serving. It's just a serving of club and a 1/2 shot of whiskey. News flash that's not part of the recipe... It is essentially orange pill to wipe around the rim, whiskey Pour  over an ice ball/block, bitters and then it's not meant to be shaken it's meant to be stirred   Yuck!"

                "description": "Since I am the Yelp duchess of the UFC gym in Southpark meadows, I had to check out the UFC gym sponsored event at Little Woodrow's. As a side note, Cowboy Harley Davidson also co-sponsered the event. There was give aways and a chance to ride on a bike (it was stationary). I had a chance since I know the manager at UFC, to put my skills to the test and throw on some gloves and do some of my kick ass kickboxing moves. However, having been maybe drunk/heavily buzzed at the time this happened, I was more concerned of not falling on my ass and less concerned on my actual technique.   I honestly a little excited for this event because I really couldn't wait to see some of the UFC fights on the fight card. Plus I got a chance to check out Little Woodrow's since it is close to my house.   Overall Little Woodrow's is a dive bar. They don't serve food and it is strictly about the booze. You can order from the pizza place next door but if you read my review of that place I would recommend getting food else where.   Anyway, the bar also had a dusty dirty chiller machine with jager and whiskey fireball bottles chilled and ready for shots. I will say they need to clean that fan that keeps it cool before it catches on fire. haha This bar was great for watching the fights since they have multiple TVs and a huge big screen that comes down."

                "description": "I only started coming here, reluctantly, after the bar at the end of my street closed and this became the closest adult beverage dispensary. I've warmed up to it quite a bit. From what I can tell, it operates really well and you're gonna get consistency.  Things of note: - Large patio space with plenty of seating and TVs - I don't really care for sportsball, but they play all the big games, matches, etc. and a lot of people turn out to watch, and the community is just *fun* - Open mic standup on Mondays (it's not terrible usually!) - Attentive bartenders; have twice seen them taking care of too-inebriated patrons. - Good food truck, also have popcorn (from a local place) - Very regulated with last call and when you have to finish your drink by. They will be open at the posted hours. - Patrons can get a little crazy but they're almost always friendly.  A solid bar, by far the best in Southpark Meadows."

I will never come back and I urge you to spend your money elsewhere. The staff is as unprofessional and rude as they come. They ruined my night along with everyone I was with.

                "description": "I have been coming to this bar for the last year.  Unfortunately, on my visit tonight, i found myself a bit surprised by my bill.  Tuesday night is \"big beer night\", which means that 22 oz drafts are the same price as 16 oz drafts.  Cool.  I drank  3 22oz lone star drafts.  Pints of lone star are 3.00, so, i was a little surprised when my tab was over $13.  I asked about it, and was told that lone star was different.  This had me start doing Math.  Apparently, on normal nights, 16Ox is $3, while 22oz is 5.50.  Your paying almost $.07 more per ounce on a 22oz glass than on a pint.  Even with the minimal discount of \"big beer night\", you are STILL paying more per ounce on a 22oz beer than on a 16oz beer.  Way to screw your customers  LW.  You now have one less customer."

You are going to make the crowd bigger and then you will take my seat at the bar and this will just get awkward.  Just kidding...maybe.  I love that they offer several cider options and that they check on you often.  I never feel like I was forgotten about.    No cover for UFC and the regulars that come here are just as friendly.  I actually met a couple of people here and we now hang out together.  Thank you Little Woodrow's for helping me grow my social circle!  They usually have something fun going on as well.  Totally my go to spot on a Saturday night when there is a good fight on to watch."

                "description": "Coffee in the Time of COVID. There I was, deep in North West Austin. I really needed a cup of joe to soothe my nerves after the drive and the only place close by was a little boutique cafe innocuously named Coffee Shark. The out door seating area was populated by middle aged professionals, who I presumed were working on their screenplays while on lunch. The cafe was in an office place overlooked by Mac-mansions perched on the hills surrounding it.  I girded myself for the aromatic punch of patchouli and sandlewood mixed with the audible assault of world music and hemp-wearing hippies. I entered the cafe and was pleasantly surprised by the lack of the typical Austin vibe. The young lady at the counter took my order, a medium cappuccino, without a hint of pretentiousness. I perused the wares for sale, mugs and tshirts, local coffee beans, metal straws. Thinking I should prepare for disappointment I grabbed some sweetener.  The cappuccino arrived promptly, hot and inviting. To my delighted surprise it was rich, creamy and flavorful.  I skulked out of the cafe, my expectations of over-priced culture dashed on the rocks of pandemic panic-less normalcy. Great coffee and great service."

                "description": "Pretty nice for a hidden coffee shop in a large commercial complex. Would not notice it from the road or walking past unless you know what you're looking for, as it blends in with the rest of the modern building architecture. Not the warmest building from the exterior, but they've done a good job trying to make it welcoming indoors. A variety of seating with one high top table. Most of the seating is 6+ capacity tables, so if you don't like sharing, this is not the place for you to study/sit alone. There is bench window seating, but with two walls of windows I imagine those seats might get warm in the summer. Some outdoor seating as well, for those who prefer that.  I got the grilled cheese and apple sandwich. The flavor combination was well done, but I was a little disappointed by the ratio of filling to bread and felt the sandwich could have been fluffed out a little more in terms of filling. The chips were neither amazing nor terrible; pretty standard fare.   I also got two different hot chocolates. One regular with almond milk, one Mexican hot chocolate with oat milk. Of the two, I'd recommend the first one. Good flavor and nice quantity of whipped cream if you ask for it in a mug. The default seems to be to-go cups, so make sure you're clear if you want to sit and stay a while when ordering. My friend got the Mexican hot chocolate with regular milk and the spices smelled fantastic, but with oat milk they got overwhelmed and it was mostly an oaty flavor.   Welcoming and friendly staff. Would definitely visit again."

                "description": "I ran into Coffee Shark for a quick pick me up during my lunch break and was pleasantly surprised. First of all, the place is huge. I don't think anyone would ever have trouble finding a seat and it seems like a nice quiet place to work for an afternoon. I appreciated the fact that they had a lot of flavor options. I decided to get a Vanilla Rose Iced Oat Milk Latte and it was so good. The flavor was subtle and it was perfectly brewed. The only reason I knock it down to 4 stars is because it's definitely on the pricier side. I would expect to pay minimum $7 for a latte when you go in. While it may not be an everyday stop, I would still go back for sure.   COVID Precautions: Masks required for employees and customers."

We went to this place to try the steampunk coffee as other fellow yelpers have mentioned but I dint see option of steampunk coffee on their menu. There was only oNe person behind the counter for taking order and  making.  We ordered  blueberry scone, cranberry muffin, cappuccino  and house coffee. Muffin was huge, both muffin and scone wasn't  fresh at all, tasted like, when you leave them for couple of day on  top of the counter and take a bite. cappuccino  and coffee was good, service is ok, they  have ample seating. Recommend  cappuccino and cOffee not baked goods though."

It seemed so promising, but my friends and I ordered three different drinks, and each one was incredibly medicore. The chai latte was almost bland, vanilla latte tasted worse than an instant version I could buy at a grocery store, and even the normal latte lacked flavor."

                "description": "We've come here several times now so we must like it.   I have ordered a breakfast sandwich that's good. There's a pretty well endowed breakfast menu, not huge full breakfasts, like pancakes, but for a coffee shop there's a lot of offerings.  Our coffees are consistent.  It's definitely not my favorite, but it's always good. Consistency is hard, which is why I don't have a favorite coffee shop.   The outdoor area is great bc we always have my kids in tow and sometimes there's another kiddo out there for them to mingle with.   The details: It's an older, white, crowd. The industrial decor is neat, but the chairs are really loud when you move them.  There's plenty of parking. Staff is friendly.   It's always relatively quiet. *the reason i noticed the loud chairs *"

My family has food allergies (celiac disease) and everyone is so kind and informative. The coffee is so smooth and absolutely divine. I actually bought a shirt awhile back because coffee from coffee Shark brings me so much stinking joy! I don't feel this way about any other local coffee shop! So grateful you are a part of Austin and I wish this business ongoing abundant success!!!"

                "description": "Coffee is good. I have nothing negative to say about that--just the absolute worst customer service I have ever encountered in a coffee shop to date. The owner, or whoever he was, was so terrified of people I wasn't even sure if I was supposed to be there. Pictures look great, I'm sure the place can be a lot of fun if it weren't for COVID-paranoia. Seriously, I went all over Austin that day and NO ONE was halfway as petrified as this guy.  My brother tried to take a sip of his coffee but was soundly rebuked for exposing his nose and mouth for 10 seconds. I understand we need to be careful, and we were, but if you go to a coffee shop you should at least be permitted to make sure the thing is edible before you leave!! BTW, we wore a mask and were very careful the entire time being there.  Won't be back. There are many other decent coffee stops in Austin."

Good food, excellent desserts, and consistent coffee brewing skills exist here.  4 stars because while everything is good overall, the nitro cold brew coffee on the other-hand well to honest...sucks! Its just weak cold brewed coffee, it doesn't pack a punch of caffeine like other cafes that offer it on their menu. If you're gonna do something, do it right or do it better!  But great little place. Indoor and outdoor seating. Good lighting inside and fairly quiet environment if you're working out of the office.   The staff is friendly but not super helpful."

                "description": "Nice spot close by that had really flavorful drinks. We got a flat white and chai latte. I love coffee but I'd honestly would get the chai next time - it was absolutely delightful. We also sampled our fair share of pastries including a blueberry muffin, pumpkin bread, and croissant. The muffin and bread were really moist and delicious, but the croissant was very bready and not a flaky, buttery croissant I was looking forward to. I think they get their pastries from a local bakery so that was cool and I would definitely try out their other pastries. Will definitely be back!"

My husband followed it up with the classic Good, Bad and Ugly, a pepperoni, sausage, and pepper pizza that was elevated by higher quality ingredients. I tried the mushroom pizza, which was tasty as long as you're looking for something different. An umami bomb with a mushroom purée sauce, speck ham, and rosemary.  Two pizzas + the cauliflower = 2.5 meals for us, so plan for generous portions/leftovers."

Why 3 stars then? Unfortunately both times we visited our service outdoor was almost non existent. We waited a very long time before someone would make eye contact with us and come over to take our order. On both occasions it took over 2 hours before we actually received our food, due to waiting so long to finally be served. I know how important reviews are to businesses so I was reluctant to give a low rating, however I really think the service outside needs to be improved. We really want to love this place and hope management takes this review into consideration."

So we tried this place out in their dog-friendly  backyard covered patio and we were not disappointed!  - Fresh craft quality cocktails on draft  - Super fresh ingredients in the salad and pizza  It was still pretty early so we had the breakfast brunch pie and a light fennel salad and it hit the spot perfectly. When you visit, you can order straight from the bar and Emilio will happily take care of you."

                "description": "Sorellina is hands down the best pizza in the hill country. The pies are creative, well executed and feature ingredients from local farms. I don't care for the clam offering, but it's hard to choose a favorite among the others. I guess I'd have to give a slight nod to the 'Nduja Sausage though. Regardless of which pie you choose, the crust isn't just an obligatory substrate; it's got great flavor and texture.  The cocktails are outstanding, especially the prickly pear margarita. Sunday is Bloody Mary day, and you won't find a better one outside of the next one. The mix has got just the right amount of spice and it's filled with a skewer containing salami, pepperoni, an olive, a tomato, basil and mozzarella.  The owners and staff are great, and they recently remodeled an already great patio area to include a beer garden with 30 beers on tap."

Being earlier in the day, E 6th had not yet turned into Dirty 6th, rendering this bar a good place for a few drinks. I would expect a loud environment here, just like in any other bar down the block. Along with the drinks we were easily entertained by the hoops game, but if basketball is not your thing, you may find the claw game more interesting.   Either way the prices are reasonable, even for slightly watered-down drinks, and the atmosphere is manageable.  Cheers!"

My friend and I came here early-ish on a Friday night and each ordered a drink. Kairo (?), our bartender, was very nice and recommended we each get the same drink, in a larger size, for a dollar less. This would be intriguing, but I am a huge lightweight. Somehow, I acquiesced. The shocking thing is that, while a typical bar would make its larger, cheap drinks weak in order to turn over money and booze quickly, NOPE. These were very strong. I could not finish mine, let alone come close, but the lack of upsell and shiftiness already separates this place from its counterparts nearby TBH. Also, the bathrooms were shockingly well maintained."

                "description": "If I could give it a 0 star I would. My cousin and his colleagues came from out of town and wanted to experience 6th St. I, having been to 6th street many times, I found it extremely unsettling and sketchy that the bar charged an automatic 20% tip (for 1-infinity) patrons without disclaiming it before hand. This applies if you pay cash or card. Now, for context, what if I came to the bar with a $10 bill and drank exactly $10 worth of alcohol, then I receive the bill and it's $12.00. Then what? I only have $10 cash. Now had you told me that I would be charged 20% prior to drinking, I would have only drank $8 worth of alcohol that I could afford the tip.  Don't get me wrong, it's not the tip amount, in fact, had the 20% not been added, my personal tip would have exceeded that. However, since you took that choice away from me without prior consent, it pissed me and my friends off.  We spoke with management and they explained that it was some type of tourist tax (which is not a real thing in Austin). They had no written policy to show us or any credible explanation.  Needless to say, we will not be returning.  Oh and top it off, they stand in the front and advertise $5 pitchers of beer, when we got in they only had liquor  because the all beer on tap was out of order. Smh.  The drinks were sub par and it was dead. So  basically a waste of time.  In short, we believe it was not a tourist tax, but rather a black tax and mind you we are all well dressed professionals who just wanted to have a good time.  I will say that prior to the check being given, the bar tender was nice."

                "description": "A few weeks ago I went to Pour Choices with a large group of female friends celebrating a 21st birthday. The doormen called us in from the street advertising that ladies could come inside the bar for free (men would be required to pay a cover).  After allowing most of our party inside, the doorman stopped my two friends, a lesbian couple, before they entered. They were asked:  \"Do you holla at boys, or do you holla at girls?\" (asking about their sexual orientation).   After my friends responded that they are attracted to women. Then they were told they would be treated \"like guys\" and were asked to pay ten dollars each. The incident was very upsetting for my friends, as they were singled out for being a lesbian couple. None of the other women in our party were asked this question or asked to pay cover charge.   After the incident, I asked to speak to a manager. The original doorman we spoke to continuously cut into the conversation exclaiming that his sister is gay, and that he even asks her pay a cover charge before she visits Pour Choices. The manager made no attempt to correct the doorman's assertions. The manager simply said it was just the way things are- but that he could make an \"exception\" for my friends' 21st birthday just this once.   The fact that the doorman asserted even his own gay family members were not exempt from being charged a cover for their sexuality- implied that this practice of charging gay women had been occurring for some time. Furthermore, when the manager made no attempt to correct the doorman and offered to let my friends in as an \"exception\", it further substantiated that this was a common practice.  The ordeal left us all fairly distressed. My friends (the couple) had both turned 21 in the last week and were excited to explore sixth street for the first time. Instead they were met with discrimination and a horrible memory that will last a lifetime. We were expecting to enjoy ourselves, but instead left in tears. I hope Pour Choices puts forth a sincere effort to make this right.  NOTE: I am posting my review again because my original review was taken down. I received an email from Yelp saying my review was removed because it was \"motivated more by news coverage rather than one's own customer experience with the business\". My review in no way is motivated by any press coverage. Every detail of this review is based on my own firsthand experience."

                "description": "Everybody knows I'm no stranger to Dirty 6th. Every noteworthy memory I don't remember can be credited to the badassness that is the infamous 6th Street in Austin, TX. The value that Pour Choices added to the Austin nightlife when it opened up earlier this year has completely BLOWN MY MIND. Pour Choices has seriously upped the ante in making sure that they set THE standard on how a bar should look, and how it should run.   Any night of the week you can always count on them to make your night a great one. From the music, the accent lighting, the boujee drink selection, big ass TVs to sweat your favorite games, to the friendly (and good looking teehee) staff, it's just a place you wanna go to with your friends to shoot the shit, dance like there's no tomorrow, or just have a badass time people-watching.   Sure at times when it's busy, service can be a little slow, or it's so damn packed you can't move. This is part of the business and for them being 4 months in, I think they're doing a damn good job at rolling with the punches while trying to be the best bar they can be on 6th Street.   Kudos to the staff, to the owners of the bar for creating THE hangout spot that people want to flock to on a Tuesday night. Y'all are definitely a huge reason why Austin remains to be THE BEST CITY IN THE WORLD."

                "description": "Pour Choices looks like a recent remodel on 6th Street, it lacks the layer of dirt that most spots do which is why you come to Austin. So in that regard it felt a little sterile. But overall it's actually quite nice inside which was a welcomed change.  Live music at the front of the bar was a nice touch, it added some energy which we enjoy. A frozen marg and a beer was probably $10 which is a great deal. We were only in here for one drink while waiting for a table at dinner.   Nice 6th Street bar to stop in."

                "description": "I'm making this review particularly towards the lack of communication from this company.   I went to this bar on a Friday night. Yes, it was busy, yes I had a great time. Drinks are always good, and the music is pretty good. Skip to the end of the night and I left my phone behind.  So maybe, just maybe karma is in my favor and someone turned it in. So I call. I call the number listed on google around 3pm on Saturday, no answer. No voicemail set up to leave a message. Nothing. So I assume they'll call back or maybe I called at a bad time..... who knows. So I wait and try a little bit later, around 8pm... NOPE. NOTHING. I've emailed the company using their website, and have heard NOTHING. It is now Sunday, 3pm... and still again, NO ANSWER! I get that it was my fault for leaving my phone behind, but the very least they could do is call me and tell me they don't have it. I see that they might actually care about these reviews, so maybe this will be what it takes to get a call back."

                "description": "I wish I could give more stars, but as others have mentioned, the bathroom and overall upkeep of Halcyon dragged the rating down for me.   I've always had a pleasant experience with the staff and I enjoy their coffee. Also, sharing the s'mores with friends is a great way to wrap up the night.   I used to visit Halcyon years ago while going to UT and my recent visits shocked me. The paint and furniture could use a refresh and the bathroom is really bad. It really makes me question their cleanliness policies and it does not give me confidence that they take pride in their business. Halcyon has been a favorite in Austin so I hope they can make some changes."

                "description": "Halcyon is a go-to for me. I am a self-proclaimed coffee connoisseur so I really love that this is a late night option for me. The employees are all extremely friendly and make great drinks! My personal favorite coffee cocktails are the Chocolate Espresso Martini and the Insomniac.  Despite their great selection of drinks, this place could definitely use some work. As others have pointed out, the bathroom is seriously disgusting. I can't emphasize that enough. On my last visit, there was a #2 just sitting in the toilet with a used tampon sitting in the urinal beside it. No paper towels to use as a barrier for eliminating contact with the door, just a roll of toilet paper left haphazardly on the sink.   I don't know why this complaint isn't being taken seriously, considering the fact that there are quite old complaints concerning the bathroom nightmare on this page. A dirty restroom makes me skeptical of the cleanliness of the food and beverage preparation and makes me hesitant to come here again."

But most of the crowd are still as cool as back in the day when this was just a super cool coffee shop with a humidor!  I miss the the humidor...  But I'm always treated with great people.  And the placement is great at night.  Who doesn't need a coffee in the midst of club hopping! It's become a saving grace for me.  Great atmosphere. Great people. And great way to sober up to rally!!!!"

                "description": "Love the chill queer vibe here.  Right across the street from some gay bars, so has a nice spillover affect.  Good coffee and café food menu, but apparently they also have alcohol!  S'mores: This totally brought out the little kid in me.  Nothing bougie or artisanal.  Just Honey Maid graham crackers and Hershey chocolate, but still wrapped up in original packaging, alongside marshmallows.  The ratio is 6 marshmallows in the 2 person order and 12 marshmallows in the 4 person order.  Unless you're looking for just a taste, I'd actually recommend the 4 person for 2 people, so you can really indulge.  A nice strong flame in the center so you can practice your marshmallow roasting.  Açaí Bowl: Perhaps a tad healthier than s'mores.  A huge portion of cold thick açaí at the bottom.  Some fresh huge blueberries alongside banana slices.  With a little granola for crunch.  Perfect for breakfast or even a dessert-like meal anytime."

                "description": "I really love their cold brew coffee!  I typically get my cold brew with vanilla, hazelnut and oat milk. Service is typically efficient friendly.   Whats's really intriguing is the interior design, a lot of Austin art, with modern furniture that is great for relaxing.   I don't necessarily Cindy this a busy coffee shop, so if you want to to have a study/work space, it can definitely be a good go to spot. Also, they serve other beverages besides coffee if you're not a caffeine head like I am.   Enjoy your coffee inside, or take a walk at the park right across the street!"

                "description": "Halcyon Coffee is a great spot for coffee and drinks in Austin! The cafe has a very casual vibe, and it's exemplified in the folks that are drawn to it. I recently spent a few hours at Halcyon in an afternoon with some friends, and we had a great experience of being able to relax, chat, have a few drinks and catch up.  Their coffees are fantastic, and the alcoholic beverages are solid as well - I had a Mocha Latte that hit the spot perfectly (good taste and excellent temperature, what more can you ask for?). I will say the Iced Chai that I had was a smidge on the sweet side, had too much cinnamon, and was lighter than I'd expect, so maybe just skip that one.   The S'mores snack was fantastic and just a cute/ unique experience for a coffee shop/ lounge - I can't say I've ever seen something like that where you get a little campfire brought to your table and get to roast marshmallows indoors! Overall I'd definitely recommend Halcyon - great drinks, great service, and a solid experience!"

Hershey's chocolate of course lol. Definitely Recommend! The lattes with almond milk are excellent. I also love the chaggaccino! Happy they have milk alternatives and mushroom coffee!! Awesome!!

The cashier was very dismissive and didn't seem to want to be there or help us. Further, the bartender would leave when he was the only one there and not make drinks. When he returned I asked for my drink and he responded that he already made it and then accused my friends of taking it, so I should ask them. He finally said he would remake it and continued to stand there, read the book of recipes for drinks, make others drinks, take others orders and never made my drink. When I finally just asked for a refund from the cashier he said the manager has to approve it. The bartender who accused my friends and didn't want to make my drink WAS the manager.   I get it when it's busy, but other than the six friends I was with there were 3 other people at Halcyon. Again, this is NOT the typical service they have but I was so blown away so DO NOT go to halcyon during the week."

On top of all this, they have vegan breakfast tacos and yes they are extremely delicious. For someone like me who doesn't drink coffee (I know it's odd), really appreciate the delicious tea selection as well.   Thanks spokesman for being my go to office away from home!"

                "description": "In East Congress next to a Tesla dealership is an industrial part of town with tons of crafts breweries, a winery, distilleries and Spokesman Coffee. Walk inside and you're surrounded by an industrial space with high ceilings and murals on literally every wall. It's quirky and beautiful!   Walk up the the barista and order a coffee from a full coffee menu. They roast their beans and sell it across the country. Next to the coffee bar is an actual bar with beers on tap from ales to cider and even a fruit punch and pickle sour type drink.  I ordered a vanilla latte for over just $6, tapped into their wifi and found open seating in the back patio. Only 3-5 tables are near outlets inside, but the back patio has a few outlets. However, the wifi isn't as strong outside."

Parking is a bit tough as it's in a commercial lot, but there's additional parking across the street.   Wifi is very spotty, ended up needing to hotspot from my own phone to continue working. Wifi password is witty thought -  you'll see what I mean."

He enjoyed his cappuccino and I had a lovely time with a lime Roibos tea that was so relaxing and aromatic.

                "description": "Stopped here one Sunday mid morning and it was pretty calm and quiet. Parking was easy, and we were able to order our drinks quickly. The aesthetic in the place is really light and fun, and they have a lot of outdoor seating area. There were a lot of people doing work/homework of some kind, it is definitely a place where you can come and chill for a while. There was a large selection of drinks, including some seasonal options. I decided to get an iced Americano which I thought had a good flavor. Drinks were to us pretty quickly, and there was a water station four easy water access. The cream and sugar area also had almond milk, which I thought was a nice addition. Most places usually only have half and half, so a non-dairy alternative was nice to see. They sell beer, however I didn't look at the beer selection so I'm no help on that! Worth checking out, I plan to go back soon!"

This is an excellent example of a business making an effort to seamlessly live in its environment-- in other words, this coffee shop found a way to complement its outside surroundings near the Tesla factory, and almost gives off a steam punk vibe. I'm a pretty sunny person, but even I can't resist. Also, the drinks are actually good. Very glad that they were able to have an aesthetic look and comfy vibe without sacrificing the quality and taste of their drinks. I got the matcha latte with oat, vanilla, and turmeric !"

                "description": "Spokesman is everything I want and more. I worry to yell too loudly about how great they are because then everyone will know and make them busy all of the time. On the one hand that's great for business, on the other I want to keep them all for myself.   A lot of coffee shops can be snooty and pretentious, but this ain't that. Everyone there truly loves coffee and people. They just want everyone to be caffeinated and happy. What better a mission than that?  They roast their own beans which means you're getting a truly unique cup when you go there. All of their espresso pulls are doubles to start. That's why I love getting the 1:1 when I go to sit down. You get a single shot of espresso and a baby latte with the other single shot inside. You also get a glass of sparkling water and a Hershey kiss. Total perfection. This lets you explore and taste the espresso on its own and then see it in a drink with the milk. It's an awesome way to discover what you might like or not like about a particular roast.   Then on your way out if you liked it you can buy a bag of those beans to take home for your coffee there for the week. It's the best."

                "description": "Such a cool place, and so totally vibe-ing Austin. Major kudos to the Spokesman for embodying sustainability in a cafe setting. They've got compostable take away cups and utensils, which is so rare. Their tea comes loose leaf in a steal strainer, and all their food is severed on reusable plates and in mugs.  I got the Turkish tea, flavorful and now one of my favorites. I'm not sure if this is a house mix, but the tea tasted unique and strong. Unlimited hot water refills, just go up to the bar area and ask! With tea I got the tasty morning bun, kind of like a cinnamon roll but with different nuts and really big. Flakey croissant exterior with a goo-y interior, this was a really nice cafe treat!  I think tourists and locals both enjoy the distinctive graffiti art on the walls of this cafe. It's located in a shipping container area that has a nice outdoor seating place too."

                "description": "I landed in the Austin airport and wanted to find a local brewery with good food and character. I found Spokesman on yelp and was delighted by what I found. Granted, I thought the navigation was taking me somewhere very odd as Spokesman is a bit off the beaten path and was a bit harder to find in the dark. But it's worth it. I was greeted by a friendly staff and an interesting menu. The beer was fantastic and I got a cold brew coffee to go for the next morning.    For food, I'd suggest the chicken salad sandwich. It was delicious! However, the bread is toasted a bit too much--so crunchy it hurt my mouth a bit. But overall, crisp and fresh flavors that left me wanting more. I'd order it again, just asking that the bread not be so hard."

We sat at the front for the best view. Quiet electric barge, no spray. Could not hear commentary; boat may need Bluetooth speakers at the front. Good views of downtown buildings! We saw two groups of egrets settling in for the night. We saw some bats flying out of the Congress Ave bridge! Not many bats because this was in November.  We missed a few bats because the boat returned to the dock to drop off some people who needed to use the bathroom :( The tour guide could have stated that the boat had no bathrooms. It is obvious to the guide but not to the first-time visitor. Tip: go to the bathroom before you board the boat."

If you want the full bat experience that happens in July according to our boat captain."

The tour included city views with running commentary followed by the bats flying out from under the bridge for a very long time. Our questions were addressed and we saw many unusual birds and other sights. It was a real highlight for me. My only concern was that my GPS took me to the bus entrance and I was almost late trying to find my way to the parking garage and then through the hotel to the boat dock. The rest of my family got there in plenty of time but they were more familiar with the area. I got a great video of the bats so it was totally worth the hassle."

We've always had 6 folks, so it's a super economical outing and it's BYOB and snacks. They have a little thingie for you to plug your phone in for some tunes, too.  Very little interaction with staff beyond checking in, getting the quick lay of the land, errr, lake, and when they help you dock at the end, so super COVID safe, in that respect."

I'm glad I got there at the time I did because there was an even longer wait time for all the people who came after me. It was $18 total for us to rent a two-seater for up to an hour. Totally worth it. We saw Austin from a whole different perspective. Also, it was quite a workout - a nice one though."

They are open right now and a friend of mine and I rented stand up paddlebords recently for an hour on the lake. We went mid morning (they opened at 10am on a Tuesday) and it was glorious. Hardly anyone was on the lake. The staff is super friendly. They have a tent outside and a touch less payment system. Prices are reasonable and their equipment is good too. They have some outside cubbies for your stuff should you choose to leave anything at the dock. The pics are from the bat cruise in October 2019. Highly recommend!"

Lorrie our tour guide was knowledgeable and funny (and we had a bit of a weird situation with a passenger being disruptive which she and the other employees handled quickly and professionally). There was a neat boat tour of some major buildings before getting a good spot and seeing/learning about the bats. Will definitely go again when I have visitors in town."

Another person on the tour said she thought it'd last around a half hour, but we were on the boat for nearly 2 hours! Watching the bats was incredible. We went in early November, so we weren't sure how many bats would be left, and there were TONS! It's truly an experience I'll never forget. Thank you to the employees and captain!"

I like this place because the bathrooms are decent for a bar, they have live music, there is a ring/hook game, and they serve cider.  Upstairs the other night they were having a comedy show which we sadly had to miss due to having other plans that evening. I believe they are doing more events up there but haven't been since during reopening after covid."

                "description": "TLDR: Matt and Steve saved our Bachelor/Bachelorette party from complete ruin on Labor Day weekend. We owe them a great deal of gratitude for the UNFORGETTABLE, FIRST-CLASS EXPERIENCE in Austin!   I happened upon this bar when my friends and I were walking around downtown Austin for a combined Bachelor/Bachelorette party. From first glance, it seemed like a typical Austin bar. Later in the night, our party was moved from the roof top bar we booked at the Marriot Hotel to the crowded hotel lobby due to a severe thunder storm. Needless to say, our large party of 30+ was broken up between random groups of party goers, diminishing the original experience.   It was recon mode time! I called every available open bar in Austin to see if they were able to help our rowdy group. Denial after denial, only ONE bar was able to step up to the challenge: San Jac Saloon!! Matt was updating me prior to our arrival. He was friendly, respectful, and accommodating. When I first arrived at the bar, I was so excited to see the large space with a full bar and lounge area. I couldn't have asked for more! The party goers AND bride and groom were VERY impressed with everything San Jac Saloon provided in ways of atmosphere, drink variety, and ability to have a safe, fun celebration.  Steve was our outstanding bartender; he livened up the night with his humor and antics! It was such a wonderful experience that words cannot fully describe the sincere gratitude we owe to Matt and Steve!!   If you want to support an authentic, passionate, and all around AMAZING bar, please support San Jac Saloon. I'd like to think we got a nice, hearty slice of southern hospitality as guests and I would 100% go back again for more.   My sincerest Thank Yous to Matt and Steve! You two are superheroes."

The band this past weekend was by far the best they had yet. Super interactive with the crowd, the place was packed. Drinks are cheap compared to other bars in Austin. It's definitely a dive bar but a great one. They take song requests which we love!! You'll find both younger and older crowd here. Good mix."

San Jac Saloon was definitely our fav. The beers op tap were great too. This place was super crowded on a Thursday so I can just imagine how packed it can get on a weekend. There is a speakeasy type quiter spot on one of the higher floors if you dont want live music. Either ways a great spot to have fun in Austin. Must visit."

I've been sitting on these experiences for the last couple of months ago  and decided to write a review to prevent any other person from going though a experience like mine . Back in March I was uncomfortably sexualized by the bouncer Colton . When I explained to him that I felt uneasy with his remarks he decided to smack my ass in a \"playful\" way and laugh. I walked in grabbed my friends and left . Until this day it's really disturbing to me to think a individual like himself can still be employed in a high risk environment. Please stay safe"

However, they have this angry Irish bartender that was picking fights with several customers. Additionally, he sat at the end of the bar ignoring customers while he visited with friends. He complained when the customers gave him smaller tips and was rude the entire evening. You couldn't say anything without him yelling at or arguing with you. Not sure if this is the vibe the place is going for, but I will not be returning. I also spoke with a few of my local friends and family about my experience and they will be avoiding the place as well."

We met this amazing man with a beard (We think Brian?) he was so welcoming! He had us take a group photo AND he let us bring our puppy inside. I bought a couple shirts and we weren't planning on returning for the night since we had a reservation at FBBC at 6:00 PM. However unfortunately our two transgender friends had a bad time... It's a long story and we left a review on their page hopefully to fix the issue but we were so upset from the bad experience. So we told ourselves hey! Let's go back to San Jac they made us all feel so welcome and Jared and the other owner know how to run a bar. ID checks TOOK 2 SECONDS FOR EVERYONE We went back inside and the process was easy and we went back inside and walked upstairs. We spent 70 dollars on an Uber just to come back!! Brian was gone which made us sad because we wanted to tell him how absolutely incredible he is. But we met this very nice Irish man upstairs and he was incredible! He fist bumped one of us and we handed him a tip and man he was such a gem. The music in both areas was rockin and we felt so welcomed and at home at this bar. You see... we had some charity shirts for Jensen and Jared because I run an organization called Castiel's Angels and they needed updated t-shirts with their new television roles and charity organizations. We were told by Brian to bring them to brewery but after what happened we were like ... no let's bring it to San Jac. They took the shirts and we are confident Jared will get them without an issue. We will be back when we come back to Texas. We are originally from Nevada, Oklahoma, and California and this road trip was supposed to be special. San Jac made up for our trip and we were treated with such respect! Best bar ever!!!"

                "description": "I haven't been here since I lived in Irvine, but we were craving some Italian food after all the barbeque, so thought North Italia would be a safe choice. This location is very spacious compared to the Irvine location. I love the atmosphere and ambiance of the restaurant. It gives off a classy casual vibe. We came here for a late lunch around 3pm on Friday and there was no wait.   Margherita pizza - You can never go wrong with a margherita. We did feel like the proportion of the crust to the actual pizza slice was really off. The crust was super thick while the pizza was so thin and flimsy. Pretty hard to eat. The bottom of the pizza was also burnt. The pizza topping itself was really tasty though.   Spicy rigatoni vodka - The star of the show every single time! The dish is bursting with flavor and every bite is amazing. I wouldn't miss out on this. I've tried their other pasta dishes but this is always my go-to. It also does have a little spice kick.   Service was friendly and quick. We were a bit disappointed in the pizza but nonetheless, it was a great quick bite to fulfill our cravings."

                "description": "The food was DELICIOUS...that's where the positive stops. We were told 20-25 minute wait, ended up being 40 (no worries, estimating can be a challenge), ordered a $150 bottle of champagne which didn't see flutes (ever..) along with 3 cocktails. After waiting 20 minutes for glassware, we asked for wine glasses since \"there were no flutes..the wind keeps breaking them\" (or so we were told) still also didn't see our cocktails for 25 minutes (post order time) due to the glassware shortage. An hour and 15 minutes after placing our order until we asked about our entrees, 3 out of 5 arrived within 10 minutes of asking and we needed to wait another 10 minutes for ONE more and 4 minutes after that for the last (which happened to be the soon-to-be bride... go figure). We decided to skip table side dessert due to the time issue and asked for one coffee to go... saying it was lukewarm is generous... then the bill comes.   If you have endless time, don't want updates on what's going on, enjoy lukewarm coffee, and drinking champagne out of wine glasses THIS is the place for you!"

We came for an early dinner at 4:30 before catching a show later that night. Our food arrived sometime close to 6. We both ordered pasta dishes which usually tend to be the quickest.   We were very easy going and polite despite everything going on. People who sat down after us have already received there food and we're still waiting. After an hour the manager eventually comes over to us to let us know our food will be out...20 ish minutes later it comes AND MY PASTA IS COLD. It was so cold the sauce was already solidifying.  2. Portions are extremely small. I'm so glad that this place wasn't crazy expensive cause then I would be super upset. We were so hungry we decided to eat and leave to eat at the show lol.   Beautiful area. Lousy service.Don't do it"

We had Wagu dish + scallops entree. Both were excellent and menu was reasonable. There was no wait and they were half to three quarts full yet the two entrees took 45 minutes which was disappointing."

                "description": "I go to North at least once a month. It's one of my favorite places. Yes, it's a chain, and you can go in multiple cities across the US, but it never disappoints. This time I went I got the Charcuterie Board; you get a lot on it for being only $18. I also got the Italian Farm salad. I get this salad every time I go to North. I CRAVE this salad. It's my favorite thing. My boyfriend decided to try something new and got the spicy rigatoni pasta with Italian sausage. He loved it. It will now be one of his go-to's. Service was standard. I will continue going back over and over again because of the consistency, price, accessibility, and taste of food.  Pros: everything on the menu is good, well priced  Cons: need to have more specials"

I don't think you can go wrong with anything here! Service was a little slower than you'd probably get inside, but that's pretty usual with patio service.  I parked down the street at the library which was inexpensive and a quick walk to the restaurant."

                "description": "We had a wonderful lunch with the family at North Italia today.  The dishes were all well prepared and the pasta was freshly made. BTW...It is fun to watch them make the pasta in their kitchen. I had the Spaghetti and Meatballs with a large mixed greens salad ( see picture). The others had chicken pesto, Squid Ink Malfadine and shrimp over pasta and shrimp scampi over pasta. It was one of the few Italian restaurants that is open for lunch on Sunday. They also have a small Sunday Brunch menu ias well. I highly recommend North Italia at both locations. The food is always fresh. The wine was pretty pricey by the bottle but, that is to be expected."

                "description": "Always a huge fan of North Italia! White truffle garlic bread is always a hit. Soooooo warm and yummy and creamy. Love it always. We are vegetarian and got the spicy breakfast pizza special without the bacon... I can't explain how tasty it was!!! The sauce was spicy and tart and just to die for. The arugula on top was also so fresh!!!! We even asked for a side of the sauce to complement our strozzapretti pasta which we asked for without the meat. I had a glass of wine (usually don't like wine or alcohol while I'm eating ever) but the Riesling was actually mild and sweet and went well with the food. I will always recommend North Italia to whoever will listen"

I'm not sure if that's because it's SXSW and they're more busy and understaffed but we waited sooo long for our food and they didn't seem to be all that concerned that we had waited. Both the bolognese and the truffle garlic bread were great. The ricotta on the garlic bread was delicious and fresh."

It was all so good. Later that night I was lying in bed craving more of those dang meatballs. For me you know it's good when you want more and a day hasn't even passed. The white truffle garlic bread is also a must. So much flavor! Service was great. The only thing that's weird about this location is that there isn't really a place to sit while waiting for a table unless you want to stand outside... which is fine as long as it's not freezing outside. It's not enough to take away a star because the food and drinks were fabulous."

Some items are hit or miss but I typically order an app, pizza, and pasta to share between 3 and have enjoyed everything I've ordered after trial and error.   The Calamari is arguably the best appetizer they offer. It's cooked perfectly and sooo good with the lemon squeeze and arugula salad on top. Any pizza has always been delicious and my favorite pasta has probably been the Strozzapreti although it is super heavy and filling. I think the location at the Domain offers larger portions at the same price point so I would recommend that one over the Downtown location tbh.   Also, they do free birthday desserts! My friend ordered the butter cake and it was divine. We love their sangria as well and a pitcher is great for a table of 3 to share."

                "description": "Quickie Pickie is just an unassuming spot for a great experience - it's a combination of a small store, coffee shop, and mini-restaurant, and delivers on that combination in a great way. We initially stopped in after a nearby restaurant had a 1.5+ hour wait, and I'm really glad we did!  The staff at Quickie Pickie is super friendly, and quite helpful in making suggestions for coffees and tacos as well. The tacos are pretty decently sized, so I'd say 2-3 would be a good quantity for the average person. I personally got 3 and was stuffed by the end of them. There are a good amount of small tables inside and outside so it was fairly easy for us to nab a spot even at lunch on a weekend.  Overall, I'd definitely recommend checking out Quickie Pickie if you're in the area and looking for a bite to eat!"

The staff didn't seem to be too inviting, but they were quite busy stocking the shelves and tending to the store itself. The beers on tap were great and very affordable. The grocery items were all slightly expensive, but were quite diverse - tons of vegan and dairy free ice cream options if that's your thing. Can't wait to go back and try the tacos. I think this place is a great pre-game or before dinner drink option without any frills."

They have an incredible variety of national and international beers. I also appreciated the fact that they had a fridge where you could buy just a can. They also had a wide variety of red wines and non-alcoholic drinks. They provide free WiFi (password is winebeer) and have lots of seating inside and outside. This would be a great place to camp out with your computer and work offsite. There is a restaurant that serves hot food but you can also grab some quick refrigerated bites that are in a fridge on the right side of the place. I got the Waistline and it was pretty good, it was pretty dry. They serve their sandwiches with ruffle-style potato chips. I wouldn't come back for the sandwich but I do appreciate the beer variety!"

                "description": "I had a very poor experience at the quickie pickie this morning. After placing my order along with the orders of my 3 family members, we took a seat and patiently anticipated the arrival of our food. After about 30 minutes I walked up to the cashier and asked about the food, he said he would ask about it.. Moments later the long haired man with the attitude called me back to the counter and handed me a bag of cold bagals and tacos \" I called this order like 3 times he snapped.\" (This I knew was untrue because I had 4 pairs of ears intently watching and listening for every single order that was placed.) Why he was so hostile, I cannot say. When I unbagged the food I noticed we were short a bagal. I went back to the man and asked for the bagal they had forgotten. He found the receipt which had no 'classic bagal' on it. Of course this meant nothing to me other than another mistake on their part and inconvenience for me. To my surprise he actually rung up an order for a classic bagal. \"That will be 6.50$\" I looked at him half shocked by what I was hearing. \"I don't have any intention of paying for that\" I replied. \"Ok well just get out then.\" He sneered. I understand it I hard to find good labor these days. But never have I been so appalled by any establishments customer service."

It is such an Austin spot. The inside is kind of like a bodega, but they have a working kitchen and coffee bar. We arrived 5min til 2PM when they switch to their afternoon menu. The girl behind the register told us to make a quick decision because once they put the breakfast stuff up they do not pull it out again even if you were in line. I ordered a bacon, egg, and cheese taco. This is my go to order when getting breakfast tacos. I had considered getting two, but I'm glad I didn't. Those things are loaded! I took advantage of the three different salsas that you can put on your tacos as well.  Our group sat outside on the front porch. It was nice and seclusive. We forgot there there was traffic driving right by on the busy street."

Both hand sanitizer dispensers were empty, and there were none next to the register despite the fact that they make you sign a paper with a pen - even if you use ApplePay. Food was fine.

                "description": "This place is basically a hipster convenience store coffee shop. I felt like a kid in a candy store shopping through their aisles of ice cream, healthy frozen foods, health bars, different jerkies, wine, and kombucha! I was very tempted to blow a lot of money here, and I wouldn't have even felt bad because of how healthy everything is. The prices are pretty reasonable, so you can get quite a bit here. There was even lamb jerky in bar form and I'm now obsessed with Kosmic Kombucha, which is brewed right in Austin. Matcha Peachu is a cleverly named flavor and delicious! I was happily surprised to have found Bobo's bar since I found them on Instagram literally the night before.   The coffee was yummy and a lot of people seem to come here for brunch. The people here are incredibly sweet and represent Austin very positively. There's also a good amount of seating inside and outside, perfect for the absolutely beautiful day that it was."

This place has a cool variety of groceries to choose from or a menu while you sit and do work.  The environment is comfortable and casual.  The chairs inside, however, are stools with no backs which is super uncomfortable when you work for long periods of time on your computer.  The food was also not that great.  All in all, it is not a bad little spot to get some work done and have a beer."

                "description": "Tipster Tours is a must do if you are visiting Austin for the first time (they also offer a tour in San Antonio's downtown if you also visit during your trip since it is only 90 minutes away from Austin). There are 5 tours available to choose from (some require a minimum of a group of 6 though) and are free! This walking tour allows for you to give any tip that you want after it is done. You are under no obligation to tip anything, but it would be nice for the tour guide to get something from you.   During our visit, we only went to the downtown tour, where you meet outside of the state capitol. My husband wanted to check out another tour but during our visit, it was raining and I just didn't want to walk in light rain and mud (yeah I'm a sore sport). For most tours, you just show up at the location. There is no need to RSVP (you can see the dates and time available on the company's website).  For our tour (about 90 minutes), we had Laura as our tour guide. Because this tour is all outside, we brought our little girl dog (she told us this was her first time having a dog on her tour). For this tour, it leaves the capitol, heads to the small park across the street, then to the governor's mansion (where you will most likely see either the governor's golden retriever, Pancake or their newly adopted little puppy golden retriever), various murals, other historical places and ends at the Driskill Hotel.   We learned so many things on this tour, the 3 of us enjoyed it (I am sure my little girl was happy to mark her territory as we walked along) and would highly recommend this tour. The walking is pretty easy and so most should be able to be fine."

However, being \"Tip\"-ster, they are appreciative of tips and in the FAQ suggest $15-$25 per person per tour. Over a 2 day period, we took 3 tours...Music, Downtown and Eastside Arts. Each tour was 1 1/2 hours. Laura was very knowledgeable and was easily heard and understood. Questions were welcomed and answered. At the end of each tour, we were given information on what we could do next. Check the website before you go, as the time had changed from the week before when I planned. The time change was bolded, so easily found. Highly recommend these tours. Since we were on a \"stay\"-cation, we may do the others they offer soon!"

Newly unveiled in October, this company allows participants to \"pay\" for their tour once its completed by tipping their tour guide. This is a fantastic idea because it practically ensures you'll get a fun and informative tour.   Joey, our guide, was very friendly and knew his Austin history. He delivered his facts and info with wit and humor which kept everyone attentive and entertained. I highly recommend him if it's possible to request a guide.

Had a friend in town to visit a few weeks ago and we did the Downtown tour, then returned yesterday with my sister for the East Side Art tour. I have to be honest and say that I didn't anticipate enjoying the art tour (art isn't usually my thing), but it was super fun and informative. Both tours were great and completely worth the time and money. Love the idea that you pay what you can afford in order to bring tours to people who wouldn't otherwise be able to participate.

                "description": "We had such a great time on this tour!  We did the Austin Music Tour and had a nice time with our guide Laura!  She took us to some cool places and it was fun to learn what the venues once were and how they came to be what they are today.  My boyfriend wrote down some places and we visited them later that night.  Walking tours are such a great way to explore a new city and I love the idea of tipsters- pay at then end what you think the tour is worth.  I also feel that Laura took the time to create a great tour and was very passionate about her Austin music!"

The comedian they brought in tried to pass off self- loathing, sexually disgusting monolog as comedic humor. Someone please tell him he's not funny in the slightest. The staff are not at all personable. This place doesn't even rise to the dive bar level.  Pop a Natural Light at home and you'll have a better time."

We got to sample a silver rum, pecan street rum and whisky: all were delicious.   Not much to say about this place as we were only a guest of theirs for 30 minutes, didn't feel like a place we could spend a afternoon.  Worth checking out if in the area but wouldn't drive an hour to get there.   5 stars on the quality of the drinks and friendly staff, loosing one star for the man cave feel. We would go back if in the area."

                "description": "Spirit of Texas Distillery in Pflugerville, Tx My wife had a \"Bold Fashioned\" 2 star out of 5 It needs something creamy or sweet to bring it together. It completely burries the whiskey. However, the coffee flavor is out of nowhere and sticks out like a soar thumb.  I had the Spirit of Texas Pfluger Single Malt Whiskey  3 star out of 5 stars Had it neat, they don't serve it in a  Glencairn so if you're a noser, bring your own. It's a much better mixer whiskey than it is neat in my opinion. However, I did get about a 3oz pour so... Booya! (The picture is after I drank about 3/4's of it, lol)  Also tried their \"famous\" Pecan street rum, not a big fan of rum but this was actually decent. Given the choice I wouldn't buy it for myself but I would drink it if offered.  The distillery itself was tiny with not many places to sit. Even their tasting room was mostly a few couches with only a few tables. With that said, it was quite cute and had quazi sports bar vibe.   The staff was friendly and very happy to let us sample and make suggestions based on our tastes.   Overall, I'd come back."

                "description": "Honestly, I'm disappointed in this place. My hubs and I went for the first time here to see a comedy tour which the distillery hosted. The place itself is very small and decent enough- definitely no frills of any kind. They were hosting the comedy tour which was being held outside in their backyard space but they didn't have any of the tables and chairs set up for the patrons. Ppl were grabbing the picnic tables and moving them over to the stage...like shouldn't mngmt have done that ahead of time?? As far as their whiskey and rum, we did not care for it at all. After the reviews, I guess I just expected more. We kept trying it in different types of drinks and it just tasted like cheap stuff. Not to mention their prices! We had exactly 6 mixed drinks. Our tab was $70 before tip. That's $11.50 a drink! Y'all, this place is backwoods Pfluggerville not the dang Domain! I pay $11-$13 for my drinks at the Domain. So, $11.50 for this place was ridiculous. We will definitely not be back. And if you see an advertisement for the comedy tour- skip it. The first comedian was not very good (he had a whole table walk out and leave during his performance. Ouch.), the 2nd was decent but not in any way worth a $70 bar tab."

                "description": "Wanted to try something new yesterday and decided to give this place a shot. We drove up to a small manufactured building and the end of a street  with some questionable establishments nearby.  Just inside of the building is a simple bar and small seating area. The employees are friendly and offer us tastings. We try each of their three offerings: silver rum, Pecan Street Rum, and their whiskey. I can't say I have discerning taste when it comes to rum or whiskey but I enjoyed them.  We ordered three cocktails from their menu (drinks are $6 each or 3 for $15) and took them to their back seating area. It was very no frills and reminiscent of a garage or basement man cave, with old leather sofas and a dart board. The drinks were all really tasty and could definitely be dangerous. We saw that they included generous pours for the liquor yet we could barely taste the alcohol.  We only remained at the distillery for about a half hour because there wasn't much else to do there. No food and no outdoor seating.  Not a bad place to go if you want to grab a couple of drinks and patronize a local distillery but if they'd like to keep customers there longer, the owners will have to invest in helping create more of an experience."

When we were walking up the steps we noticed that there was an open sign lite up and when we walked in the bar tender said they have to close for an hour because he is the only one there and needs to help the band setup..... sounds like poor planning on the managements side. He said someone keeps changing their hours on Yelp but not sure about that hmm. Anyways he invited us back to see the show at 7 as they open back up for that, but was looking to have a drink and not be drowned out by a loud band. Maybe we will try your place again some time ....."

My wife's uncle dropped a bottle of single-malt whiskey on my counter and I decided to pour a neat glass after I poured 3 others for my guests. I really let this whiskey sit on the back of my tongue and savored the flavor. This is hands down the best whiskey I have ever had. I am more of a blended whiskey guy but the sweetness of this whiskey is absolutely perfect. I have my mixing whiskey, but this is definitely my sipping whiskey. There is definitely a strong vanilla taste going on with chocolate, but finishes hard with a good wood. Since having it, I am trying to find a way to get in there and pay my respects, but his review will have to do for now."

Let me offer a few reasons to stop in:  - whiskey tasting flights of 4 for only $11   - also offering other gin or vodka mixed drinks  - great tasting room with some cool, historical architectural elements   - wonderful deck under the shady oaks to enjoy the quiet Hill Country ambiance  - for beer or wine lovers, they also offer those (and snacks) in an adjacent  building  So this is simply a great stop off the beaten path if you are headed out to the Hill Country or just want something different that is just down 1826."

Nor did the Black Walnut Cocktail mixed by the affable and amiable Richard.  I figured to spend about an hour or so but instead closed the joint down! The bourbon is delicious and as a Magnificent Bastard it was a real trip to find my name on the Wall of Magnificence.  The grounds are lovely and well worth wandering. If you get the chance to stop in and sample the whiskey you will NOT be disappointed! If you are a Magnificent Bastard, it is so much fun to see where our favorite videos are shot.  Alas, I couldn't finagle my way into the Vault! ;)"

I had seen the videos on YouTube, and I had some time before my flight out of Austin, so I drove up on a Friday, had a cigar while I waited for the place to open (they have seating for cigar smoking on the porches!), and then sampled some of their wares.  It's excellent, and I really can't say more than that.  Try the whiskey neat, or in a drink - everything we tried was wonderful."

We visited when they first opened and were in awe of the stunning tasting room, lush green views, and one of my favorite parts is the tour to include a look inside their rickhouse. They are currently aging straight bourbon whiskey in 2020 with a projected release time of 2023. They are currently offering enticing cocktails made unaged new-make whiskey, along with craft gin, rum, and agave spirits distilled in-house.  Not only does this craft distillery provide a welcoming new space but they are also all about transparency and sustainability. Expect live music, events, exclusive events for members and more!"

                "description": "What a gem of a place! I go down the street to Meanwhile all the time, but had no idea this place even existed.  Fierce Whiskers excited me as a whiskey fan, but I do like that they have options with rum, agave, gin and other spirits.   There is definitely a lot of potential for this space, it is so cute, however they've only been open for 6 months, so they still have room to grow, they don't have much seating outside, and it would be nice to have some music, or yard games, or something to do as you're enjoying a craft cocktail. Hence the lack of star to only 4 stars.   I had the Gold Rush for my drink, a whiskey, honey, lemon concoction.   That being said, I was here for a happy hour with an organization I am in, and we had a great time. We spread out in the lawn area and everyone had a great time.   They also have a delicious food truck on site: Char ATX.  More on that in my next review where I'll be talking about the food I got there.   Definitely a cute date spot, catching up with friends, but wouldn't say it's great for families or a large group really. I hope that they continue to add on to the space and grow to utilize the space more. I'll be back for sure."

The drink selection needs a little improvement but they are willing to tweak it to your satisfaction which we loved.  The food truck was very tasty they had a Oyster truck as well we didn't taste that but saw many people enjoying.  The land is beautiful with ample space to go with friends or a date or by yourself it's a chill ambience just like a whiskey distillery should be.  Deff going back!"

They have a lot of seats inside and outside and have food trucks on site if you are hungry. I liked their expansive menu of different and fun cocktails, that are also really delicious. The only thing is that you pay for not a lot of drink...but that's ok. Enjoy your company!  I hope they get more staff and maybe some waiters, because their can be a log jam at the bar with a line waiting on the bartenders to make these tedious drinks and it can take a long time."

The large glass doors open up to a spacious outdoor seating area. The drink menu is fairly priced with cocktails that allow you to taste their very own whiskey, gin, and rum. If you prefer straight whiskey, they have flights/tasting samplers you can ask about.  I loved the food truck parked in their lawn (Char ATX) with delicious yakitori (Japanese meat on skewers).  They have tours of their facilities which sound really interesting. I think those tours are about $15/person (please verify with Fierce Whiskers for most up-to-date pricing).  Good-sized parking lot  This place is a hidden gem. Drive past Meanwhile and head straight to Fierce Whiskers. ;-)"

Fair warning their whiskey is new aged and won't be ready to be bottled for sale for another 2+ years. This made the tasting a littleeeee rough, but I learned a lot about whiskey so it was worth it. The tasting room is really nice and they have a great cocktail list - standard and seasonal. They host events regularly and there is a food truck on site."

An unplanned stop to provide a bathroom break before arriving at our destination was provided upon our request and was greatly appreciated. We ended up losing one of our group and our Driver allowed us to wait and look for them. Additionally, a phone was lost in the furniture and again our Driver provided concern, patience, and assistance in order to retrieve the seemingly stuck device. I have now ridden with this service three times and every time has been beyond excellent."

He was quick to provide a quote and answer any questions leading up to our trip, and was early to pick us up. 38 of us fit comfortably in the 40 person bus along with all of our belongings. The bus was clean, speakers were great, and Daniel truly went above and beyond for our group. We'll definitely be using ThunderDome for all of our future trips!"

I did not have a lot of information on the distilleries and Daniel was incredibly helpful when figuring out where we should go. We had 19 people on the bus and we had SO much fun. The bus was super clean, Daniel was great and we had the best time. We originally had the bus for 5 hours but Daniel was nice enough to let us add an additional hour to our trip for just a small charge. I would recommend ThunderDome Party Bus to anyone.   We definitely want to plan another trip in the summertime to go floating.  Thanks Daniel!!!"

The bus was on time, and even made accommodations to pick up a second group at a different stop. The bus itself was spacious and clean, and everyone had an awesome time!

The stereo system was bumping, and Daniel, our amazing driver, had no issue with us turning it up to 11.  Our group was most guys in their 30's and Daniel gave us good recommendations on spots to check out that were age appropriate.  In between spots, Daniel drove me to a gas station to help me restock on beer. He even came in and helped me carry and load beers into the coolers.  Great communicate from Daniel from beginning to end, and he someone found the perfect spot to pick us up on busy Rainey St at the end of the night.   Great value and great experience.  Highly recommend."

The cocktails at this place are great! The most popular is their frozen margarita, you have to try it. If you really just want to get a feel for what Sotol tastes like though, try ordering the flight first.   For food, there is a food truck on the premises. I think they switch it up but when I went it was a Mexican food truck with very good Birria tacos."

Very Instagramable location with the truck outside and the silo.   PARKING I went when it was pretty busy. I found parking but I did have to wait for like 5 minutes so cars could clear the road. It gets pretty tight once the parking spots are all full. It's all free. A lot of cars parked on the road. Just be careful crossing the road.   FOOD When I was here they only had one food truck. The options were limited. The prices were a bit too high for the food options available. I didn't try it out. My friends ordered a few things and they felt the food was just ok. I'm not sure on the current food status here.   AMBIANCE  They only had outdoor seating when I was here because of COVID. I sat on the covered outdoor seating which was great since it was around summertime. It was HOT! Really cute tables, friendly/helpful staff, and live music! I don't remember his name but there was a gentleman playing guitar and singing. He was fantastic!   DRINKS I ordered 3 drinks. The first two were the Comanchero and the third was The Copperhead. I'm glad I stopped there. They are strong!   I'm giving it four stars because I felt like the size of the drinks didn't coincide with their prices. I hope I get to stop by here again. It's a bit of a drive for me. It's a really beautiful drive though. Keep kicking butt y'all! I want to try everything!!"

                "description": "First time trying Sotol, and there wasn't a cocktail on the menu that wasn't incredibly delicious. We sat outside in the lovely fall weather, enjoyed some acoustic tunes by a talented duo with a female vocalist, and tried several cocktails -- all of which we enjoyed. My friend tried the frozen Bartender's Choice which was like a frozen apple cinnamon cocktail, and I tried the Comanchero, the Yipping Coyote, and the Rugged Flower. Each were so smooth and well-balanced. This place not only makes a flavorful Sotol with a smooth, clean finish but transforms it into mouth-watering mixology masterpieces!   Aside from the bus loads of out-of-town tourists who looked like they were part of an Instagram filter for an \"Ashley/Ashleigh\" compilation (complete with brimmed hat, scarf, and boots), this place is a must-visit if you're in Austin. Couple it with a trip to nearby Fredericksburg and you've got yourself an amazing day!"

                "description": "Finally decided to take a day trip down to dripping springs and had to finally stop at Desert Door. To start, this place is designed so beautifully. I wish I could steal the décor and put it into my own home. Both the inside and out were so inviting, I don't know how someone could go and not spend hours enjoying the ambiance, food, and drinks. What I thought was so cool about Desert Door was that they educated you on what you were drinking and the history of Sotol. What I did not know, is that they are actually the only Sotol distillery in the US.  We started off with the Sotol flight, and two drinks. Although we did enjoy tasting the Sotol by itself, it was a lot to start the afternoon off with! We also ordered the The Copperhead (my personal favorite of the day), the River Rita, and the Sotol'd Fashioned. I loved each drink but the copperhead was definitely the star of the day, which was a Sotol version of an espresso martini. They also have a food truck on site serving out very unique food. We ordered the tacos and vegan \"queso\" and both really surprised us by how unique and amazing it was. We loved this trip out to Desert Door, and will definitely be back."

                "description": "I'm generally not a huge fan of tasting rooms and find them gimmicky and far from truly experiencing the spirit of the spirit. See what I did there.   But every rule has its exception, or exceptional. Desert Door is a destination in itself. Beautiful southwestern interiors and stylish furniture. The space is cozy but didn't feel crowded, though every table was full. They do have a large patio for outdoor seating and bigger groups.   Now, the sotol. I had never heard of it and didn't know what to expect. The best way I can describe it is an agave spirit, clear, between a vodka and a tequila in its thickness/smoothness. In plain English, it's delicious.   We did the tasting flight, which was a great way to get introduced to a new spirit, followed by a round of cocktails. The cocktails were excellent and reasonably priced.   They also had a lovely food truck on site but we didn't have enough time to try it."

Great patio vibes: chill, mist fans going , and live music about to start. Inside is nice too, super clean and cute/trendy.   The sotol is great and their cocktails are delicious, as well as unique. Had a difficult time deciding which one to get but our attentive and extremely friendly waitress, Nicole strayed me the right way with the Comanchero.

And they sure know how to do a cocktail, too! I got the River Rita and it legit blew my mind.   Sit and stay awhile, listen to the live music on the patio and if you need to cool down, the interior is a WHOLE mood.   Be sure to visit their gift shop to buy an adorable handmade clay shotglass (SO CUTE) and a bottle of their famous Sotol.   The staff was also astoundingly friendly and the kind of people you want to hang out with."

                "description": "Meridian Hive is expanding and growing up!  It's great to see quality local businesses thrive. The experience at Meridian Hive has changed.  There is now a wide selection of meads to taste, and you have to pay for a tasting.  There are different tasting flights you can select from on the menu, or you can try it all for $15.  The place is no longer quiet and sleepy, it is busy and buzzing.  They need to re-organize themselves to be able to better handle the traffic.  They need a separate line for those just coming in to fill growlers, and those enjoying a tasting experience and interested in learning about the different meads and the process.  The two staff members were friendly, but were rushed to serve others.    The mead is still as delicious as always, and they are planning to even start canning some of it! They are also re-branding and their growlers now have their new modern logo.  I just hope they keep the awesome art on their bottles.  I love the genius artistic bottle labels.  For the first time they also had a meat and cheese plate that you could order. Something new they were trying out.  It was tasty!  They should definitely keep it.   They also now have a loyalty program that earns you discounts. Also, be sure to check out the board as they have reoccurring monthly events like Friday board game night!!"

It isn't a very big layout so there isn't much to see but overall a really nice laid back place to hang out. The mead is pretty cool...kind of tasted like a cross between a wine and a cider with more of a craft beer audience. The honeys they offered to taste were lovely."

                "description": "They lied to us about being dog-friendly. NOT DOG-FRIENDLY!   My husband and I were in town from Austin with our 2 pups. I called and asked if they were dog-friendly, they said yes. When we got there, I walked in and asked if they were dog-friendly, they said yes. My husband and our 2 pups walked in, grabbed a flight, and played a game. After an hour, I ordered another drink while he took the pups out for a bathroom break. He texts me \"They won't let me back in.\"  Apparently they weren't actually dog-friendly, and the bartender lied, or at best had mis-information. They offered us their outdoor picnic table, but there was broken glass everywhere. They comped the drink I had just ordered, but really should have comped everything. We wouldn't have gone if we would have known that we weren't welcome.   That said, this isn't a terrible place to spend a rainy afternoon if you're from Austin. They have games and flights. Their draft meads all kind of taste the same, but the recent elderflower LTO was pretty good. We're from Dallas, and I won't waste an afternoon here again."

                "description": "Meridian Hive Meadery is pretty cool! I hadn't tried mead until this year when I tried some of Meridian Hive's stuff at the Mueller Farmer's Market. We bought a growler from them and we were always determined to fill it back up, but we always seemed to go to the farmer's market when they weren't there. Darn.   No more worrying about that, though, because now they have a building for all your mead needs! I always seem to gravitate toward the Rhapsody, because it has blackberries in it, and I love anything and everything blackberry. Meridian Hive will let you try anything for free, which is great. Some day, I'm going to branch out and try all of their stuff instead of just getting the Rhapsody.   They also have several different kinds of honey for you to sample, which was really cool. You can purchase various things here, like growlers, glasses, and metal signs, if you're into those sorts of things. They sell their mead by the growler or by the bottle, depending on what you order and have much you want. There isn't a ton of seating, as they seem to be a newer operation, but I didn't find that to be a problem. They also have some board games out for anyone to play, which I thought was a nice touch. Unfortunately, they don't have any food here yet. I don't know if they allow you to bring food in, but it wouldn't hurt to ask if that's something you are dying to know. The ladies who were working the day I visited were very sweet and super willing to answer any and all questions.   Funny story: this place is basically right down the street from my old office. I bet a mead buzz would have made work more enjoyable, but now I never have to find out. No complaints here!"

I sampled a few different meads and ended up ordering one that was a blackberry flavor, it was absolutely delicious , not too sweet which had been my worry when it came to mead. All of the other flavors I tasted were yummy as well. The atmosphere is a open warehouse. They provide some board games to keep you entertained which made me and my friends quite happy .

Once we finally found the place, we were greeted quite quickly and taken back for sampling. Immediately we were treated to generous samples of *everything.* Samples just kept coming until we had tasted the entire lineup.   Evan ran us through everything with great explanations and loads of information. As any good teacher, he snuck in repeats of information in different ways to help cement it.   He took us on the grand tour. It doesn't look like much since it's small, but there's a lot of information and a lot to learn. Evan was great at tailoring his tour to our level of expertise: two of us with Mead and home brewing experience and two n00bs.   Apparently they distribute from San Antonio to DFW and they've only really been on the market for a year and a half! Their prices reflect their quickly growing popularity, but it's well worth it. They have a Mead for everyone and even honey to sample.  The staff was able to tell us about a lot of events as well. The Texas Mead Festival isn't too far away from Austin and it's in September. The world festival is in Longmont, Colorado. They also make appearances at local farmers markets as well."

When you visit the old fashioned and margherita is a must to start.   It's bring your own food or snacks and according to Scott the owner food trucks and live music are coming soon.   C'mon by and have a beautifully hand crafted cocktail."

We will definitely be back!!!"

                "description": "Decided to try this place out because it was a local distillery. we will be back time and time again. We wanted to buy a bottle for the upcoming 4th of July weekend. and we got to try 4 of their selections. The texagave, gin, triple session and whiskey. I was happy with all of them.  Texagave is their \"tequila\". I thought it had a great taste and would make a great margarita. My wife, who is a tequila drinker, wasnt too fond of it, but I loved it and it would make a great add to any bar.  Gin. It tasted twice as good as Tanqueray but with half the bite/harshness. we bought 2 bottles. Will be back for all the Gin needs.  Whiskey. If youre a fan of Gentleman Jack youll love this! super smooth and mellow. I thought it was good (im a bourbon drinker), just not the Super Oaky flavor that Im used to. too mellow for my taste.  Triple Session. This was by far the most impressive and different spirit I tried. Think of a triple sec (orange and sweet flavor) but with actual alcohol in it. I think it is 41% and it tastes fantastic over ice, not to harsh, not to sweet (by triple sec standards) but just right. Cant beat if for less than 15 bucks a bottle at total wine.  I cant wait till I try the rest of their spirits. Go in and try them, you will not be disappointed!"

Scott (the founder) was very welcoming and showed us the different spirits that they had to offer.   The TexAgave is perfect for people that like tequila, the 17 Whiskey is great for the bourbon drinker, and Whit's Gin is really tasty too.  I didn't have a chance to try all of them but I'm sure the others not mentioned are great.   Some of us ordered the Bill Pickett Bulldog which was made with their JavaGave Coffee Liqueur and it was like Kahlua and Milk but way better. Highly recommend that drink!  Most of their drinks are $4!"

                "description": "My wife and I stumbled across this place on a Sunday.  The owner,  Scott,  happened to be inside,  noticed us reading the stuff on the door and unlocked the door,  invited us in for a tour and taste of all their products.   We've been serious fans ever since.   I've had everything they make and all of their products are GREAT. My current favorite is 17, a bourbon,  but that is a limited run.    For Christmas, I got several people to go in for me and buy some 17 to give out as gifts.  I also bought their products available at participating liquor stores as gifts.  I distributed them to about 8 people total.  It was a mix of 17, Leanderthal Vodka, TexAgave, Triple Secession and Javagave.  Some recipients were serious liquor connisuer's,  others just liked a cocktail now and then.  All thoroughly enjoyed what they got and added it to their regular liquor rotations.  Leanderthal has since opened a tasting room where you can get cocktails made with all their products,  and are free to bring in outside food to munch on,  as they don't necessarily have food on site.  Although Scott has a creative work around with that by having a food truck occasionally.   They also give samples of all their products as well.   Their craft cocktails are GREAT!  And they are very affordable for top shelf cocktails.    If you like any type of liquor, Scott has a great version of it.  Everyone there are super friendly too.    Great place to go and hang out.   Only downside is you can only buy 2 bottles per adult every 30 days.   Awesome place!!"

Friends and I tried most of the menu between the four of us and every drink was great. Their liquors are unique and delicious. I love any drink that uses whole, natural ingredients- no mixers in this place, and who can beat $4-5 drinks that taste this good?!  Making it BYOFood is so great, I'm only worried that this spot will get so popular that it will outgrow its space. Can't wait to go back"

Great drinks, great staff, and tons of games to play with friends:) just wish they had paper straws. We loved Ashley the bartender on staff. Super friendly and made sure we loved our drink choices (all the drinks here are great).  Special note: They also rescued a baby cow named Moonshine who is like a little puppy- she loves some pets and will lick your hands a few chickens running around too.   Drink suggestions: great bloody Mary's! I also really like their passion fruit vodka!  Food: mmmk they have the best Mac and cheese! This is a must here. It's super smokey I loved it. They have lots of meat options too.  They have fans blowing water/misting you in the heat and twinkle lights everywhere.  Kid friendly? Yup, although I didn't see any when I went they gave a big play structure behind the car!  Parking on site"

We are visitors to Austin and Planet Rock was recommended by a local family last night at dinner, so wanting to experience local places rather than tourist spots, we decided to give it a try. It did not disappoint! I have to say that we enjoyed the BEST Bloody Mary we've ever had! Planet Rock's vodka is so smooth and with the added Bloody Mary mix combination and a piece of brisket, heaven! Service was excellent and the live music by Sharon Bourbonnais was very enjoyable also. I'm thinking we'll be back before heading home!"

We got there for lunch time and to try a cocktail and eat BBQ as it's really near the local RV park. The vodka is delicious. They offer samples and have a broad selection of flavor profiles. We tried a good number of cocktails each of which was fantastic and flavorful. Jackie the bartender was wonderful to talk to and kept my wife ms drink full, my kids happy with mock tails and unsold me on a bottle of vodka, and a cinnamon vodka ( I hate cinnamon). Catfish, the master distiller came by the bar and had some awesome stories and insights into how Planet Rock became a thing.   If that's not enough to get you there for a taste, the BBQ truck does great food. Get the Texas Twinkie. The ribs were great as was the quesadilla and the stuffed potato but trust me, get yourself a Twinkie.   If you are anywhere nearby try this place. It's pet, child, and adult friendly. And they have live music. How can you go wrong?"

The demon vodka is a terrible mistress that can weaken your soul, lead you astray and give you many hangovers. The prices of vice, in its many forms.  But I ask, are we to avoid the rich experience of human vice, or is this pursuing human vice that gives us meaning?  Good vodka enables the philosopher that resides in each of us.  Many adventures await us as the consequences of our choices.  Vodka is a choice. Choose wisely."

I had found them via some post on Instagram.  I am very happy we were able to spend time with them.  Anthony gave us the tour but Logan was there as well.  They give you a taste of both of their products while explaining their history and their process.  They have grand ideas on how to move forward as well.  Both men have full time day jobs.  They have done everything for this company.  Including building the building you are standing in.  Extremely interesting.  We have gone to a few distilleries and the tours can be a tad repetitive but this one was very enjoyable.  We are grateful they took the time to give us a tour.  Every minute they are with you they are not working on their business.  I wish them nothing but success. Worth your time if you are in the area and can get an appointment."

We ordered a large pepperoni and a medium veggie pizza last night and it was delicious. The bread/dough, everything from the sauce to the toppings. Everything was fresh and clean. Which is our #1 priority next to taste!   We will definitely be back. We ordered it to go but next time we'll dine in and try their drinks!"

It's clean, spacious enough and offers indoor/outdoor dining (see the pics). The pizza was fresh and the crust was better than something you'd get from takeout pizza.  I didn't get any drinks so I can't comment on those but I'm sure we will order from them again!"

                "description": "Love the concept of this place -- a distillery and pizza restaurant located in a warehouse district off the freeway between Pflugerville and Hutto. Grab an inside picnic table and enjoy the fresh air coming in through the open garage-style door. There is a oversized Connect Four game and cornhole for the kids to play. Plenty of fans mean the inside stays cool.   We tried the watermelon cucumber vodka drink, which was tasty. We also tried a classic cheese pizza and a pesto-sausage-olive pizza. Both were good, but could have used a little kick of flavor -- spice? Seasoning? Next time I would love to try the deep dish. Leave 30-45 mins for bake time."

They said that the dough is a family recipe.... wherever it came from I am glad. You gotta try it.

                "description": "A great little distillery for those looking to escape the hordes at Jester King.   The service here is top notch, if it's your first time they'll present you with a complimentary mini-flight so you can sample their entire range. Right now that consists of gin and various liqueurs. I wasn't a fan of the liqueurs, but the gin is an absolute steal at $35/bottle (not available for purchase on Sundays!)   They used to have a few BBQ offerings, but sadly that's gone now. While the space is dog friendly, the outdoor seating is relatively small. We were planning on bringing our pups, but I'm glad we didn't...both the parties out there with us brought their dogs and it would have been 6 pups in a relatively small area.  Drinks range from $8-10, and they regularly rotate out flavored slushes, absolutely perfect for Summer. If you go on a busy Saturday afternoon like we did, you're better off going inside and ordering from the bar."

The tasting was free, while the cocktails were in the $8-10 range. The gin, coffee liqueur and pecan liqueur were amazing! However, because it was Sunday, we couldnt buy bottles, which was very disappointing. The cocktails were a bit of a let down that didnt let the spirits shine. The best was the gingery take on a White Russian. The service was very friendly and attentive, yet again, we were the only customers. I definitely recommend picking up a bottle of their gin and liqueurs if you can find them!"

When we answered no they immediately brought over for a tasting - no charge.  We enjoyed most of the different offerings.  Then we picked out some cocktails to enjoy - both with their gin.  Daughters was with grapefruit and mine with cucumber.  We also purchased a cheese plate which we were told was made up for them from the local grocery store.  Nonetheless, we enjoyed our cocktails out on the picnic tables and had quite a lovely time.    Not being from Texas we were unaware of the law prohibiting liquor sales on Sundays.  We certainly would have bought a bottle if  we could have."

The area is pretty small, so it's not ideal for big groups, but don't let that deter you. After our tasting, they offered us a free cocktail. If you're a fan of coffee, you must try their cafecito or chocolate cafecito spirit. My favorite was their gin. If you like mezcal, try to their gin reserve in mezcal barrel. Definitely a must when you're in the area"

                "description": "While we were sipping our ciders at Argus pondering about where we should go next, Revolution Spirits popped up on Yelp and so we of course headed there without any second thought!  This place is really amazing!! There was quite a bit of crowd as it was saturday but we were still given a great deal of attention during our tasting! My favorite was the cafecito coffee liquer and the chocolate cafecito. They're so good, that I could probably drink an entire bottle all by myself!  The best part of this place is the amazing people who own/work here and they didn't even charge us for the tastings and also gave us a free cocktail made with their gin!! So as appreciation from our end for all that they did and shared with us, we gave a nice tip :)!! Definitely, going to look for Revolution on my next trip to Spec's!"

                "description": "Avoid the crowds, get the good stuff.   This place is small, but the selection is pretty solid--everything from fruit liquors to their flagship gin and several mixers. Best of all there was no need to pay $$ upfront for a tour--just walk in and start tasting and talking.   The gin was the standout here, but all the stuff we tried was excellent except for their own cherry-limeade mixer--that was kind of a letdown, but the alcohol itself was great.   Can easily walk from here to Last Stand Brewing and Argus Cidery. There was a food truck outside as well."

                "description": "Everything was done right - great customer service, clean flow for visitors, and the quality and uniqueness of the distilled liquor itself was great. To elaborate, samples were provided for the different options of their distilled liquor while an explanation of the flavors was provided, which was particularly beneficial for the 100 proof gin such has notes of grapefruit, lavender, and juniper. They also have a coffee liquour which is 50 proof, so a bit stronger than the traditional but still very sweet and flavorful. Even after the tasting, it was a nice place to hang out and was well ventilated and shaded."

My favorite alcohols were the gin and cafecito; also, the tonic they use (Springwood) which I had in a GandT I ordered after the tasting is also locally produced and top-notch.  The cherry on top is that the distillers are extremely friendly and knowledgeable.  Will be visiting again soon."

It'll be a great space to spend an afternoon once the pandemic ends.  Call ahead if you want to pick up some of their fabulous Texas Holiday Nog, but remember, only 2 bottles per person per month.  Careful though and drink responsibly. This is not your father's Oldsmobile eggnog. It will sneak up on you and kicks you in the noggin like a freakin' mule."

                "description": "The place has great potential. Very cute and good drinks.  But they have a long way to go when it comes to customer service.  The bar tender seemed to be really put out that we were even there.  Didn't welcome us, when we asked if we needed to go to the register part of the bar to order,  he looked at his phone and rudely said, I'll be with you in a min. Then continued to be annoyed that he had to take our order. The place was empty only 1 pinter group of 4 so wasn't like he was super busy.  They even said he didn't really seem to want to be there and definitely didn't want to be taking our orders.  The AC was also very lacking we were all fanning ourselves with the menu which seemed to be the best use of the menu since he didn't want to serve us. The sink in the women's bathroom barley had water coming out if it and they were out of toliet paper but we dare not ask the 1 bar tender as that would have really put him over the top. I wouldn't recommend this place and if I was the owner I'd want to know how bad my employee is. No wonder there was no one inside."

The two female bartenders we have had in the past were amazing.   However I think they missed the mark on this expansion.  Sadly this is NOT the same place.  Total different vibe.

                "description": "We passed by this place heading to the Drip yesterday and since I'd never heard of it, I immediately yelped it.  A new distillary only about 10 minutes from my Casa?  Hell yes, I'm curious.  And I'll admit I became even more curiouser after reading Arian's review....I intended to ask them about this \"one of the best after-hours swingers hangouts in Austin!!!\" sitch.    The tasting room was a little hard to find as it's around the back of this little warehouse strip but it's open and spacious and we were only the 2nd couple there on a Friday evening.  We were warmly greeted and bellied up to the bar.  Our bartender (and all the staff I think) are in the Stinson family.  She was very friendly and gave us all the history of the place and explained each tasting in length.  They are currently offering a tasting of 4 of their liquors for $7 (these served quaintly in communion cups) and have cocktails they can serve as well.  We sampled everything (of course), the vodka, the white rum and dark rum, the elderflower liquor (think St Germaine) and the Holiday Nog.  She also threw in a sampling of their Bailey's style coffee liquor that's not quite \"ready\" yet.  I immediately fell in love with the Holiday Nog, which doesn't actually have any egg in it (thank goodness) and is made more with rum than whiskey (again, thank goodness).  This will go great with holiday gatherings.  I will keep an eye on their FB page for release of that coffee liquor!  All of their bottles run in the $25 range.  Hubby and I each had a cocktail, him the mojito and me the Citrus Fizz, and both were made well and were tasty.  We also bought several of their cocktail glasses as they are sturdy heavy glass, perfect for Bourbon.  Which, btw, they are still perfecting their whiskey recipe and will offer that in the future as well.    We really enjoyed talking to everyone and after getting a little liquid courage, I did ask about the swinger's parties.  She laughed and said that was just a friend making jokes....I wonder......"

I messaged Jodie in April to see what her pricing and availability was for Memorial Day weekend and she responded quickly. Paid deposit through venmo and paid the other half day of our tasting. We did one winery, one distillery and one brewery. She gave us a small history of each of the places we went too. Her cheese board setup was amazing! Very sweet and easy going. I highly recommend."

We were staying in the adorable town of Wimberley so I researched tours in the area.  Jodie's Taste of the Hills Tour got great reviews and went to wineries close to the Wimberley area. The day of the tour ended up being chilly and rainy. As soon as Jodie pulled up with her spectacular shuttle-like van she was out like a flash with pretty umbrellas for us! We went to 3 different wineries which we thoroughly enjoyed! After the first one, we returned to Jodie's vehicle and she had a gorgeous tray for us of cheese,  sausage,  crackers,  grapes,  olives, dips.....simply divine!!! The tour was also just the 2 of us and we loved that Jodie still did ALL of this for a tour that I believe takes up to 12 people! The next time we plan a trip to the Hill Country we are going to do one of Jodie's Beer tours!! We had such great conversations with Jodie too! Thank you sooooo much for the GREAT time! Sooooo much fun!"

                "description": "Amazing tour!!! My wife and I came into Wimberley during Spring Break to relax from teaching and this was the perfect trip to do so! Jodie made us all feel like we were old friends, even though we had never met anyone else on the bus.  She was very detailed with the stories of each winery, and explained all the different varietals, answering our every question along the way. The bus was very comfortable and clean, and she stored each bottle we purchased until the trip was over, but we could have had the bottles on the bus had we chosen to.  The wineries all seemed to know her, so they were expecting us and were incredibly friendly. We were not rushed anywhere, and still managed to make it back into town to enjoy shopping on the square.  My wife and I were pretty hungry by the time we had lunch, since we didn't have breakfast, but the tapas style lunch was perfect for the glass of wine we purchased to have with it. The lunch was delicious and filling.  Overall this was an amazing experience and I will be recommending this tour to everyone I know."

We were fortunate enough to have great people touring with us, and it made the tour all the more fun.  She prepared the best picnic lunch I've ever had.  Sugar Shack cake balls, meats, cheeses, crackers, hummus, a goat cheese something served on crackers (that I LOVED, and I hate goat cheese), spinach feta rolls, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something.  She was fully prepared for everything.  Boxes for the wine we bought, umbrellas in case in rained (it didn't), plenty of water...this wine tour couldn't have been more perfect if she tried.

She provided an excellent variety of foods including a hot portion and gluten-free (just in time `cause I was lit after the 1st vineyard). The three vineyards for that day were selected based on the wine preferences of the tourists that day (A+ perk). We never felt pushed or obligated to buy wines, but we all did because they were very good (!), and Jodie kept our purchases organized and stored for us. She also gave a good background on each vineyard and on the Wimberley area in general. We learned a lot about Wimberley and wine and were able to get tipsy knowing Jodie was an excellent driver of her comfy bus. And have you been to Wimberley? That hilly countryside is beautiful!"

Our tour was originally scheduled for 10:30a, but got pushed back to 1:15p due to shuttle trouble (we had the option to receive our money back, but actually liked the later time).  We stopped at three wineries, including Driftwood Estate and Duchman Family Winery.  The views at all of the wineries varied, but each were unique to their locations.  Jodie provided an amazing picnic-style lunch, including a charcuterie (meat and cheese) board, chicken salad, nuts, walnut and feta salad, grapes, chocolate cake balls, bottled water, etc. At the second stop, Jodie was kind enough to call in people's orders to Salt Lick BBQ and had it all ready to take home by the third stop.

She gave us a lot of background information on the wineries as well as the town of Wimberley. She had a delicious assortment of snacks for us to munch on while we rode to and from each winery. She helped package our wine purchases and brought us umbrellas as it started to rain. She even went the extra mile, literally, and drove us back to our hotel since it was raining as we had walked to our meeting spot earlier in the day. We had another couple on the tour with us which was really nice since we had people to mingle with. It was a very personal experience and I felt as though we were all just great friends spending an afternoon together. Who needs Napa, everything is better in Texas!!! We will definitely be repeat customers."

It's the bizness.  Interestingly, the vodka is made with yellow corn, rather than potatoes or wheat (or milk whey, in Vermont). The facility is the State of Texas' first legal distillery, they have gown quite a bit and crank out 500 cases an hour and dominate the US vodka market with 7.1% share.  May I suggest a TitoRita? 1.5 ounces Tito's Vodka, 0.5 ounces orange liqueur, 1.5 ounces fresh lime juice, 1.5 ounces fresh lemon juice and 0.5 ounces of simple syrup. Put it all into a shaker with ice, mix it up and pour into a martini glass.  That's probably too many carbs for me. My drink is called a \"Skinny Bitch\" and it's Tito's with club soda and a slice of lime. Delicious and cool.  [Review 13302 overall, 620 of 2020.]"

                "description": "Clint was a total professional and a wonderful driver.  At our first stop he ordered a different vehicle so everyone felt more comfortable.  What a surprise when he told us!  Didn't see that coming.  Three great tastings with good friends.  Discovered some very nice 2015 Texas wines.  The grapes have matured immensely since 2008 and glad to finally enjoy some good Texas wines.   Can't recommend this company any lower than *****!  Thank you Discovery Wine Tours for a memorable afternoon."

                "description": "Used Discover Texas Wine Tours for a 30th birthday. John, our driver, was wonderful. He called me a couple of days before to introduce himself and to confirm the pickup details. He also called me the day of and was on time. He made sure we were settled at each location and made it a great experience. Felt very safe - John wore a mask the whole time. Also, Kathie helped plan the itinerary. She's familiar with the wineries and distilleries in the area, and was very friendly. Couldn't recommend them more!"

                "description": "I was so impressed with this tour the first time we booked that I had to book it for another party! Well, this time it wasn't as impressive. I don't know if the business has just gotten bigger than the owners can handle but communication was subpar. It took several calls and emails to get answers sometimes.   At our first tour, Kathie took tons of photos and would pose us at the wineries. This tour, we had to prompt her. It was a cloudy day so not the best for outdoor pics but I was disappointed we took most of them ourselves or had to ask her to take the pictures.   Our tour was April 11, it is now almost 2 mths later I haven't received the few pictures we took. I emailed twice and have finally heard back that the SD is apparently not working. I'm not sure why I had to email to find this out, seems like this info should have been divulged as soon as the problem presented itself.   I hate to downgrade the star review but my second time with this company just wasn't as epic as the initial tour I took with them. The wineries all seem to love this company though."

                "description": "We had a small group of three, but did it right with a Discover Texas Wine Tour limousine. DTWT was very accommodating, scheduled the wineries we wanted to see, ordered the lunches, and then confirmed our selections a couple of days prior to our tour. At the last minute after visiting with a couple in our third stop, we changed our fourth stop to a different winery. Jason (our driver) was happy to accomodate us. My only regret is that we didn't choose a few wineries a little further out of town, so we could spend more time in the limo listening to our Willie Nelson songs. Jason was awesome, and I highly recommend this tour."

                "description": "We started researching half-day wine tours for my BFF's bachelorette party several months in advance and chose this company because of its good reviews and cancellation policy (full refund up to 7 days in advance).   First, the bad news. The booking process is way more arduous than it should be. My initial discussion about the tour plans happened over the phone, so I asked for a written, e-mail confirmation of what we had discussed - specifically how the deposit and refund policies work. It took me more than three weeks to get that first e-mail confirmation of our booking and deposit payment. I then went back and forth, back and forth, back and forth with the company, hammering out the details, like setting a pickup location and our choices for the winery stops. Many times, three weeks would pass and I'd have to make multiple attempts before I would get a response to my e-mails. Sometimes, the responses would be incomplete and we'd repeat the process of trying to get information confirmed. Seriously a pain for an experience that costs $129 per person.   Now, the good news. The online payment portal for each attendee was a breeze to use and eliminated the need to handle money all through one person. As for the actual tour itself, we couldn't have asked for a better experience. Our driver, Bobby, was on time and wonderful on the day of the tour. He was funny and polite and had good knowledge of the area. Also, very importantly, he was a good and safe driver! The Mercedes bus we took was very clean and spacious, and they provided water, cups and napkins. They also allowed us to bring our own food onto the bus. The three wineries we visited, Driftwood Estate, Duchman and Fall Creek, were all accommodating and fun. The views were lovely and we never felt rushed and made it back on time. It was raining when we got back to our car, and Bobby was so nice and helped us get our stuff back into our car in the pouring rain.   All in all, despite a wonderful wine tour, I'm not sure I would recommend this company, only because I spent way too much time hounding them throughout the booking process. While the wine was excellent, I NEEDED to drink after dealing with their horrible communication. Discover Texas Wines should strongly consider re-evaluating their communication practices and hire more people to keep up with the demand for their service. It's the only way they will stay competitive in the long-run!"

He picked us up on time, was incredibly friendly, and funny even though we were a bachelorette party and knowing the possibility of it getting crazy with 7 girls. Seriously, request Roy. He made the trip a blast. There was cold water for us in the bus. Oh did I mention it's a Mercedes bus? Super nice! An AUX cable was available to play our own music too. The selection of wineries was amazing, perfect mixture between red and whites/dry and sweet, so every one of us could have something tasty. The drive was beautiful and not too far out of Austin. Overall, I am very impressed with this tour and the wonderful employees. Would definitely go again."

                "description": "Absolutely do not recommend using this company. I made the reservation back in January, gave my card for deposit and was told I'd be emailed a link for everyone to pay. Over the next two months I called and emailed asking about the link so my friends could pay their part and I was repeatedly told they were having issues. Okay fine, no big deal- I also emailed again saying we can just pay the day of if the link wasnt working and never received a response. The day before our tour, as I was driving from Dallas to Fredericksburg I get a call from Some guy at the company and he seemed very annoyed with me saying no one had paid yet. Um.. I'm sorry I didn't realize you finally sent it after months of my asking. (He had sent it the day before calling me to tell me no one had paid) The vehicle I requested was not the one that showed up. The driver Julia was late bc she did not write the address down correctly. We also had 3 girls cancel last minute, so we were down to 5 instead of 8. Considering there minimum is 5 I wasn't expecting that to be a problem but Julia felt the need to bring it up multiple Times as if it caused some inconvenience for her. Rude people, horrible communication."

Organizing a full day wine tour for 50 people in the Texas Hill Country may not sound like an easy task, but Noel at Discover Texas Wine Tours made it smooth and most importantly, unforgettable. His main goal is to make sure everyone is comfortable and has a good time! Most companies were not able to host a group this size, but Noel made it happen. He made sure our bus was the best he could find, worked to have a lunch catered for us at one of the stops, set up private tastings with many of the wineries to accommodate a group our size, even stopped to let one of the guys who didn't drink wine buy some beer. I can't say enough good things about Noel and how hard he worked for our group. I highly recommend him and look forward to another tour with him soon!!"

                "description": "I must say that Hy Rum has arrived.....and in a really BIG way. How so? Well, let me tell you. 1.) Their new set up on Frog Pond Lane just of Hwy 290 is not only convenient to the ATX visit, but it will become a frequent destination. 2.) Indoor seating - both at the Tiki bar, but the innumerable comfy seating areas look nice - and I can't wait to try them all! They are all in on the Tiki motif, as they really transformed this former pool supply facility into something special. Outdoor seating: Lots. Seating with a view of the Hill Country, under the twinkling lights, in the yard - or even around a game of corn hole. They have something for everybody, including your well-behaved dog. 3.) Drinks: Hmmm...where to start. Their seasonal drink menu when we visited in January 2022 was fantastic. The first thing you notice if you sit at the bar is that the bartenders are mixing and muddling with the using freshest, usually made-in-house, all natural ingredients whenever possible. The Hot Buttered Rum drink is amazing. It will have you googling 'recipes' before you get home. Warm, spicy, buttery, and with a whipped topping topped with a hint of rum flavor (yes, they whip rum into their topping). It was our favorite on this sunny, but blustery day. Another winner was their 'Knotty Hot Chocolate' with Mexican chocolate and cinnamon. On their 'regular' menu, I tried their Old Fashioned (in which you can choose Dark or Spiced Rum) and I can tell you it was spot on. 4.) People. We were promptly greeted and seated by Master Distiller James Davidson who also told us their story and even took time to visit with us a couple of more times. He was super friendly and funny. 5.) The Booze. We tasted several with our favorite being the Spiced, but their rum family offers Dark, White, Spiced, and several flavors: Coconut, Orange, Pineapple, Extra Rich and Spicy ('the Chupacabra' which has espresso, chocolate and cinnamon infused) and even a Scottish style gin (aka Jinn) 6.) Speaking of special, check this out: Hye Rum now has a weekly event calendar with something for everybody: Brunch and Learn, Family Night, Suppler Club, Cocktail classes, and even Mardi Gras. In addition, you can book a facility tour that includes a tasting flight for only $20, which we will definitely be doing next. Soon, they will add an 'Event Room' as well just to cover all their bases. All that said, Hye Rum is making all the right moves and seems to have hit the big time. All I ask is to save us 2 seats because this place may be hard to get into - and we will be back!"

Love their tiki themed tasting room and cocktails - it made me feel like I was on a tropical vacation.   I'm a big fan of coconut rum so I ordered the Cocojito and it was so good. My husband loved their piña colada and our friend had a rum flight and ended up buying two bottles their dark rum.  James, their master distiller and cofounder, was there on a Saturday and took care of us the entire time. It was so nice to see how passionate he is about his craft and the distillery, and making sure that all their patrons feel welcomed.   Looking forward to making this one of my regular spots!"

They worked with me on the wineries and Distillery the group chose to ensure that the time worked within our tour, so everyone could enjoy the tasting and lunch without feeling rushed. Austin Wine Tours also provided us with a great driver. I have to say our driver Charlie was awesome, he called before arriving, he was prompt and ensured we had everything before leaving the pickup spot. Charlie made our tour very comfortable, the ride to and from the wineries and Distillery was amazing. Charlie ensured that we were taken care of.  We will definitely be booking another tour with you folks and requesting Charlie.   Thank you again,  Laurie"

                "description": "10/10 would recommend Austin Wine Tours! First off, booking and choosing our agenda was super easy and they even let me adjust the headcount when that changed. On the day of, I got a heads-up call to confirm the time and pickup location. We had a larger, rowdy group of gals on a bachelorette trip and our driver Song took SUCH good care of us! She immediately asked us what music we wanted to crank and encouraged all the \"wooing\" from the back of the van. She also offered to take pictures of us, scouted out the best locations for group photos and even took TONS of candid pics of us while we enjoyed the winery and distillery we went to. She helped with all of the logistics of checking in at each stop and making sure we were taken care of. She also let us make a pee stop on the way home...and overall she was just SUPER nice and was basically hyping us up the entire day, making sure the bride felt special and making sure we all had fun. By the end of the day we all felt like she was part of the crew. Thank you again Song!!"

The wineries were beautiful and we were able to schedule a stop at the salt lick for our private tour. Kyle was the best tour guide ever!! He was very personable, took numerous pictures for us at each winery and made sure we were having fun! I would def. recommend if you are looking at different companies to pick Austin Wine Tours (ZWay Tours) since I called 5 others and they were the most accommodating with what we wanted for a private tour and their price beat most of the other ones too!  Would def. book them again and request Kyle!"

                "description": "The review that I left in regards to the services booked through Austin Wine Tours was in no way false. I will stand firm by what was written.   I even received a call back in May while on a business trip from the shuttle service company asking if we would pay the overtime for Hugo because AWT had not paid them yet. We even tipped Hugo an additional amount for his extra time spent with us.   The response just posted (almost 4 months later) is also extremely unprofessional and misleading. We were promised a great time for a bachelorette party and were let down. Plain and simple. Those employed by AWT that we spoke with were rude as well. Secondly, I never said that AWT hosted prom events/transportation. I was told that the company that is usually utilized was completely full (by Brad) and that prom happened to be a priority and the school bus that was sent was all they could get us even though we were promised a party bus.   At the end of the day we were completely dissatisfied with the services offered by AWT. Calling a client a bridezilla (who in fact actually never spoke to any AWT employee), claiming your company has gotten PTSD from our group and falsely accusing our group to be racist by saying we told \"blackie to leave\" is unprofessional and disrespectful amongst other things said in response to our reviews. All of those involved would be happy to discuss this event again in a professional manner since you mentioned that we were offered a full refund when that in fact was not true. We were offered maybe $350 (I could be wrong on this amount since we haven't heard/spoken to anyone from AWT for several months) in return if we removed our reviews.  As a company you should take responsibility instead of blaming others for your mistakes that way you can fix the problem and do better for future patrons. Especially since there has been no money refunded at this point."

I initially booked online and didn't know what venues to go to at first but they recommended the ones that we ended up going to even though it was completely up to us where we wanted to go which I liked. We decided after to tastings to go eat at Salt Lick BBQ and the food was amazing and hit the spot in between tastings. After that we went to our final tasting at Fall Creek which was right across the street and the service there was great. It made our bachelorette party very fun and we didn't have to worry about anything other than having a good time which I liked."

They sent an incorrect party bus for a bachelorette party, contracted out at last minute to another company (who were amazing), sent us to Deep eddys where we were turned away!!! Brad would NOT let me speak and kept interrupting me. The professionalism of this company was simply awful. And they still have not refunded anything from this trip!!!

                "description": "Booking our wine excursion was stress free the moment Sara answered the phone! Sara was very informative and laid everything out, giving us a doable timeline for the afternoon we wanted. The itinerary we received gave us a good idea of how long to spend at each venue. There were only 4 people in our group, so we were able to do a very flexible hourly option, with appointments at the wineries.  Since we had less than 5 passengers, our tastings weren't included (informed that going in) however, that did not deter our experience... it was awesome! Buying a bottle of wine at each venue was very affordable when we split the cost among us.  George, our driver, was professional and friendly; and the limo experience was awesome! You might want to bring snacks just in case someone gets a bit tipsy, but most wineries offer food of some kind. Thanks Austin Wine Tours, for making me look like a champ with my high maintenance friends... I'll be back!"

He was quick to respond and helped me schedule a party bus big enough for all of us. David, our driver, showed up early and made sure we had everything we needed for the trip. He had a giant cooler with ice and waters that we were able to load up with seltzers. I booked our wineries ahead of time which made getting into the tastings a breeze. David made sure we got to each winery on time and went in ahead to ensure each winery was ready for us when we arrived. He even coordinated to have the band at one of the wineries sing Happy Birthday! David was absolutely fantastic, and we had a great time with him. We will definitely be booking with them again for our next trip. I highly recommend Open Range Tours to anyone visiting Fredericksburg!"

He picked us up from San Antonio, drove us up to Hill Country and around to 3 wineries.  As this was my first Texas wine tour, he did an AMAZING job of helping us select which wineries would be a good fit for the group.  As we had a decent amount of guys with us- he suggest Garrison Brother's Distillery which ended up being a HUGE hit!  He was extremely professional, courteous and just an absolute delight to spend the day with!  He also has a wicked funny sense of humor.  He was also very accommodating and ordered and picked up lunch for us so we could continue to enjoy beautiful Hill Country.  I would use him again in heartbeat and highly, highly recommend him to anyone wanting to enjoy Texas Hill Country!  Thanks David!"

A 15 passenger VAN showed up with a dent in the side and ripped seats. We were told we could bring coolers. We were only able to fit 8 adults in the van with our two coolers- no way we could've had another person in the van. None of the wineries had been scheduled yet and the ONE we had specifically requested was not available. We had to scramble ourselves to find wineries, in which we were promised everything would be done ahead of time. The meat and cheese tray that was promised was a small tray that was bought during the tour at a convenient store to feed 2 people. Our driver was great, however the owner did not deliver what was promised and we were highly disappointed. There are plenty of companies to choose from, and I would NOT recommend Open Range."

                "description": "I arranged a Girls' Getaway to Fredericksburg, so naturally I wanted to do a wine tour. I contacted several tour companies. D'Ann was extremely responsive and gave me several suggestions of where to go. Since I'm a wine club member at quite a few wineries in the Hill Country, I opted to do a custom tour and made my own reservations. Greg, the owner (and D'Ann's husband) arrived on time and drove us to 3 wineries where we were able to enjoy a nice, relaxing afternoon. Greg was so friendly, helpful and accommodating. I would highly recommend Open Range Tours...thanks, D'Ann and Greg!!!"

There were some general issues with scheduling and logistics that were my fault, but she very kindly fixed everything!  Our driver David was on time, helpful, and a lot of fun.  They know a lot about the wineries and have personal relationships with the owners/managers/tasting staff.  David also went above and beyond by making an extra stop for shopping/pie-indulging and by dropping us off at our dinner restaurant so we didn't have to walk from the visitor center where he picked us up.  Highly recommend!!!"

                "description": "We went to Fredericksburg for a girls trip and wanted to spend a day at the distilleries and breweries. David was fantastic to work with planning everything out. I wouldn't have changed any of that part. But, once the day rolled around we were met with a hiccup. The driver, not David like I was anticipating after multiple conversations, arrived in a mustang for 5 of us. Obviously that wasn't going to work so I was offered by the driver only to cancel or reschedule. Our trip was planned around spending our day out and about so cancelling wasn't an option for us. After a phone call to David, we were assured our day wasn't ruined just a bit delayed. The driver left and showed back up with an SUV and away we went. The driver wasn't interactive and she didn't seem to even be having a good day... It happens I get it but come on. Anyway, we made the best of our day and enjoyed ourselves. When we were dropped off, I tried to pay but she said to get with David. No problem but I did have a problem with her then saying that she'd go ahead and take the gratuity and that the standard is 20%. I didn't even know what our total cost was to figure 20% but asking for the gratuity before I even paid for the day was in poor taste. We did go ahead and tip, and well mind you, because that's the kind of people we are. I ended up calling David and finishing out the transaction and once again, he was a pleasure to deal with. Overall, we'll use them again because I appreciated David that much. But, I'll definitely make sure we don't have the same driver. 5 stars for David but 4 stars overall for the above mentioned."

He picked us up from our Airbnb and drove us 45 mins out and back, while we blasted some rachet songs to sing haha. He would check in on us during the winery to see if we needed anything or have any questions, and he would offer to help us take multiple pictures. He also got one of the wineries to allow us to explore their cellars!   On our last day in Austin, he drove by our airbnb to pick up someone else and honked at us as we waited for our uber. We were all so happy to see him again, as we all enjoyed our experience with him.   I recommend Texas Tipsy Tours with Arlen ;)"

Arlen was our diver and was so knowledgeable and friendly. He picked us up right at the hotel in Austin. I felt the price for the experience is definitely worth it. If you were considering this experience, I highly recommend this company. They care and that is important."

They do all the heavy lifting with the friendliest spirit and let you and your group have the time of your life!  We had the BEST time on our tour and absolutely adore Arlen, our driver! He was the kindest, most considerate, thoughtful, responsible driver ever! He was so fun but also let us have our time to just be girls and we didn't have to open a single door, make a decision, or carry a single bag (if we didn't want to) the whole time we were with Arlen!  Also, the management team was incredible. Wei booked last minute and they were so accommodating and listened to our unique needs/wants for the tour! And we're so detailed in instructions. I have had bad experiences with wine/bus tours with other companies and I was SO impressed with the whole experience at Texas tipsy!"

From the minute I called to book to the minute I said goodbye to our driver the day of the tour they were fantastic.   So when I called there actually weren't any times available. They worked with me to make sure they had a tour time and sprinter available for our group of 6. I had a million questions; they were patient and kind.   Our group was 6 but one of my friends asked if we could add an additional person. Reached out to TTT and they said sure no problem. Literally 3 HOURS LATER I got a call that another girl tested positive with covid and wouldn't be able to come with us obviously- they were so nice and made the switch back to 6. Very grateful for their exceptional customer service.   Day of our driver Bryant was early which was great! Got on the bus and let us have free range of the radio, answered any wine questions we had or any questions about Fredericksburg. He was a fantastic host. Always texted 15 minutes till our time at the winery was up and took as many pictures as we wanted. He was so sweet! He also made sure we were never thirsty or hungry. Which for a group of girls is very important- smart man! Haha   I've heard things about other companies having hidden fees and people getting charges after leaving Fredericksburg and we had none of that. Texas Tipsy Tours was very transparent with all of their pricing and they had no hidden fees.   Thank you TTT for making our trip perfect. You won't regret booking with them."

                "description": "My experience with Texas Tipsy tours was nothing short of perfect!!! From pickup to drop-off, Courtney (the owner) made our experience amazing! When I initially started inquiring about a tour a few months ago, many of the companies only offered private tours for a minimum of 4 people. However, Texas Tipsy Tours offers small group private tours (i.e. 2-3 people). This was perfect for me. She also made planning our trip so easy, and she promptly answered all of the questions I had.   On the day of the tour, she picked us up from our hotel in Austin in an Infiniti SUV (it was very clean too)! She even made a pit stop for me at a CVS on the way to our first winery. Throughout the 6 hour tour, she made sure we stayed on schedule. She even let us change a stop last minute because we wanted to check out a brewery!  One thing that was amazing was the comfort she provided! She allowed us to pick the music, provided phone chargers, and let us control the AC! She even opened our doors for us AND dropped us off/picked us up right in front of each place we went!  Overall, I highly recommend Texas Tipsy Tours, and I will definitely be back!"

It was as easy as getting on the phone, explaining what I wanted, and Courtney took care of literally everything else. We picked the breweries we wanted and even included a food stop. She coordinated the bus pick up, drop offs, schedule, and even reserved tables for us at each stop. I love that we had our own bus (very nice one, by the way!), and had the flexibility to create our own tour based on beers and food my husband liked. It was the perfect Saturday in Austin! Payment was very easy as well - they sent me an invoice to my email and I was able to pay directly online for everything. Highly recommend, and thank you Texas Tipsy Tours!"

I have taken quite a few van tours around the hill country and Texas Tipsy Tours sets themselves apart by not just being drivers but they truly host you the entire day. I will ALWAYS use this company going forward. We did a private charter from Driftwood to Austin, TX and back and Keaton our driver was a delight. He made sure we were picked up on time and each of our stops were easy and flexible. We did a mixed tour around Driftwood and Dripping springs the next day and our guide Eric executed the BEST DAY for us. He even picked up on what we were liking and recommended a change to our final stop to Vista Brewing and we were SO glad he did. At each stop he made sure we had plenty of water, snacks and chairs to enjoy the gorgeous venues. This is totally above and beyond what we would have expected from a driver. Courtney was so easy to work with and she helped make recommendations for our group ultimately making our weekend get away FLAWLESS. I promise if you don't use this company, you're wrong."

                "description": "This was my first, and sad to say, my last time doing this festival. A friend who had been a few times before highly recommended it and when I balked at the $40 (plus a $3.50 processing fee) \"pre-event discount price\" with the at the door price being $50, he assured me it was well worth it because there were so many great food and wine vendors, you get your money's worth.  This was absolutely NOT the case! Firstly, this whole thing just seemed disorganized at best and I am sorry, but for $50 ($40) they could have gotten a much nicer location than a dusty, stiflingly hot cattle stockyard!   As for what you get for $40, 6 drink tickets and 10 food tickets when drinks and food run you anywhere from 1 ticket for a meager barely 1oz pour for most of the wines to several tickets for very small portions of the food, you barely get $10 worth of food and drink! You can purchase ticket for $1 a piece, which is most definitely not worth the portions or pours you receive.   As for the vendors/vintners at the festival, there were not nearly as many as you would expect for the price point and the layout was just haphazard. Also, there were several vendors that were out of food by the time we got there just after 2pm...the \"festival\" was supposed to go until 6pm...so how the heck were vendors running out of things w/4hrs left!?!   The only highlight, for me at least, was the grape stomp, but even then, they ran out of tshirts to \"stamp\" with your grape-soaked footprints.   In any case, my $43.50 would have been better spent and enjoyed at an actual local restaurant where I could have gotten multiple full pours of wine and actual food instead of leaving this joke of a festival hungry, overheated, more sober than when I arrived, and feeling like I had just been scammed somehow. Lesson. Learned.   I am honestly shocked this \"festival\" has lasted 10yrs let alone one!"

                "description": "I had a lovely time as the guest of a coworker. However, I felt like the overall value wasn't quite there for this event. Drink and food tickets went way too fast when some places asked for multiple tickets for less than an ounce of wine or a small sample of food. The actual value was about $1 per ticket. There were also some vendors that were somewhat rude or rushing. The whole point is to get business by having people try your product, right? Well there's some wineries I'd think twice about giving my money to after their lack of friendliness.   The options for food was more limited than I expected and many ran out of food even though we got there just an hour after the event started. There are lots of raffles going on and free koozies and pens galore. The arena was stuffy inside and though fresh near the doors you ran the risk of also eating dirt.   The music was good but there needed to be more sitting areas to relax and open a bottle of wine. I will definitely go back next year, but I do hope to see more offerings."

                "description": "This was by far the most awful \"festival\" I have ever had the misfortune of wasting money on.   First of all, in 2012 it was held at the Texas Hill Country Olive Company. So all advertisements this year were of a gorgeous event at this lovely vineyard - The photos were of a classy event, surrounded by olive trees and rolling hills, adorable art booths scattered about the lovely property, smiling faces holding wine glasses. I was so excited based on what I was reading of the Olive Company event that I had my mother travel up 3 hours on the morning of Saturday the 14th to accompany me. Then I convinced another girlfriend of mine to join. We had our tickets in advance, $40.00 online purchase, and my girlfriend paid at the door - $50.00.   Now, regardless of where the ACTUAL event for 2013 was advertised as being held - between the advertisements on Yelp, on Facebook and scattered about Dripping Springs, it was VERY unclear to anyone coming from outside of town where the hell this event actually was.   So we arrived at the Texas Hill Country Olive Company to find no tents, no events, no nothing but a beautiful building surrounded by beautiful land. Inside there were very few customers. But we were greeted warmly, given amazing samples (DO go there and DO try their olive oils and balsamic vinegars and DO check out their $55.00 romantic date night packages).   Making the best of what was already frustrating, we had a few samples and they sent us on to the Dripping Springs Park Ranch - or something like that, up Ranch Road Twelve.   We were still optimistic until we saw the HUGE metal pavilion looming ahead, situated in the midst of probably two square miles of plowed up red dirt which will eventually be a parking lot. As we navigated in, driving through dirt among hundreds of cars, we noticed piles of dirt, bull dozers, caution tape... this entire venue was a.) an agricultural fair pavilion and b.) UTTERLY UNFINISHED.   I was mortified. I brought guests, I paid money, and we were supposed to be in the midst of lush, rolling hill country sipping wine and sampling cheese. Not walking through 300 yards of dirt to get to an unfinished metal building. This was already so embarrassing and already not worth the money.   We had to enter at the back of this enormous, godawful construction, walk through the art vendors, then across MORE dirt on the rodeo floor (where the paying guests tables were and the music) where we were given six drink tickets and ten food tickets. When we reached the one interior part of the building, we were encountered by swarms of casually dressed, generally rude, pushy guests who were buzzing around a square room with no proper traffic flow. There we found out that each drink ticket gave us ONE OUNCE of wine, which was poured by rude and distracted vendors. We also found that each food ticket did not entitle us to a sample - samples cost anywhere from 2 to 5 tickets. One ticket got you the likes of ONE chip with a dollop of something on it.   I was blocked and almost run over by a RUDE and completely OBLIVIOUS staff member who was blocking the only entrance to the tasting room. Other guests were hogging the only FIVE standing tables in the are, they'd put their purses up there and stand around and send other guests to get them samples, so there was no where to set down your things and you had to juggle a glass of wine, your tickets, your purse, and a plate of food and in order to eat it, back through the ONE door you went, down the stairs to the dirt on the rodeo arena floor.   We left without even using the tickets we had - not worth the paltry return for what we'd spent and what we had to endure to get there.   I will never return to this event. I want my money back from this event. The Dripping Springs Chamber of Commerce should be ashamed of the overall mess and disappointment this fiasco was - they don't deserve a dime of the money they raised from it.   TERRIBLE."

                "description": "This is probably more of a 3.5 than a 4, but the low ratings to date are unjustified so I'm bumping it up.  I enjoyed the wide variety of beer, wine, and liquor to choose from, but I wish there were a few more food options. What made it worth the price of admission was the sommelier talk at 3:30 where there was no-ticket-required wine comparison tasting, and I learned a few things. Take advantage of those demos if you go next year. Also there were a few food stands with free samples no tickets required (pecans were a favorite, olive oil, chips and salsa, etc). I wish I had hit the liquor area sooner, they seemed to have generous pours. I may hit this event again next year, or I may not, but I definitely had a good time."

I've been to many similar food/wine tastings, but this one was very low value- you received drink and food coupons instead of the usual unlimited tastings most events provide. Also, expect to experience long lines in a hot event center. I'd recommend treating yourself to a nice dinner with wine over coming here."

                "description": "I thought this was an awesome event!  Yes you had to pay $40 for entrance into the event.  For that money you receive a twin Iiquors reusable bag, some goodies inside the bag including a wine glass, 10 food tickets and 6 wine tickets.  Each wine ticket was good for a 1oz pour.  And the food tickets could be used at more than 10 food vendors for various amounts.  It is called Dripping with Taste because it is supposed to be a \"taste\" not a full glass or full meal.  I will tell you that I had plenty of food for my 10 tickets!  And got to try 6 different wines!    I will say that a previous post about volunteers having to work 2 hours and then getting unlimited food and drinks is absolutely false.  Volunteers had to work a minimum of 3 hour shifts but most worked many, many more hours not only the day of the event but also prior to the event and they got the same 10 food tickets and 6 alcohol tickets.  I learned a lot about local wineries, breweries, and distilleries and tasted some awesome food from some local restaurants that I had not yet eaten at."

                "description": "If you choose to attend this festival, DO NOT PAY. You get 6 drink tickets and 10 food tickets for $40. 1 oz pours. That's about 1/6 of a glass of wine. So you pay $40 for a single glass of wine. HEB gave away 2 chips with salsa for 1 ticket, empanadas were 5 tickets. I was denied BUYING a bottle of water, so that the volunteers could have them.   This brings me to the point, if you want to go to dripping with taste, volunteer. They treat the volunteers far better than paying guests. They do their jobs for 2 hours then get to enjoy UNLIMITED drinks and food and get cool shirts that aren't available to buy to us regulars.   I was very unimpressed Dripping Springs."

Get there and see that almost every vendor is charging 2-5 tickets for food tasting and the wine tastings are  only 1 oz pours. What??! What did my $40 pay for?? A couple sample size appetizers and a few gargle-worth 's wine samples! Furthermore, it was inside and stifling!! I'd much rather pay a little more and get unlimited tastings, at least I'd feel like I got my money's worth. Sorry Dripping, won't be back. Huge disappointment."

                "description": "They did a good job this year except for signage. There was a huge lack thereof at the back entrance where they were having everyone park when I arrived.  Everyone parking had no idea where to go. Other than that, the new Ranch/event center is nice. There were lots of vendors and lots to choose from. The tickets were more than enough to try things and the staff were friendly. Dripping Springs is a gorgeous city that should be visited by all."

                "description": "A piss poor event.   It was raining when we arrived, I know that no one can help that, but we were one of the first to arrive and we directed to park at the back end of a mud field. Instead of filling up the lot nearest the event, we had to walk though a water logged muddy field.   Then the signing up volunteers, one of the online register volunteers, was the rudest person I have met in a long time. She reminded me of one of the Orks from Lord of the Rings.   So you get 10 food tickets and 6 drink tickets. What you fail to learn until you have paid ($50) is that 10 food tickets doesn't mean 10 small samples, all of the samples were multiple tickets. Essentially, your $50 gets you two tacos and the six drink tickets equal about one glass of wine.   A truly crap festival."

                "description": "After reading the other reviews I felt that I had to write one myself. Just how many wine festivals have these people attended?!  I have attended literally dozens of wine festivals, mostly in California. Believe me that the Dripping with Taste Festival is, by far, the best value on the market. Spending $40 for the initial tickets is next to nothing compared to the analogous events in California. AND purchasing additional tickets for a buck each is very cheap compared to other such events.   I have attended the last two Dripping with Taste festivals and plan to continue to attend every year. I look forward to this event based on the quality of the event and the very, very low cost. Both years I have come away with the feeling that I got more than my money's worth and found several Texas wines to add to my wine cellar!"

                "description": "Went to this event for my birthday and...gee...what a rip.  Like the other person said its located at a huge agricultural pavilion for horse and gun shows.  I live in Drippings and saw this massive structure being erected.  Its quite the eye sore.  That'd be fine if it wasn't so expensive.  Worse, it is actually held in a tiny closed off indoor part of the complex that's maybe a 1/8th the size of the whole place.  Needless to say, it was over crowded, people packed in like sardines.  My family wanted to leave rather quickly because it just flat out sucked.  Some the vendors were generous some were stingy and acted like it was a chore to deal with you.  Stay away from this event."

                "description": "The last time I went to this event was several years ago and I was very disappointed with the venue and the offerings and had not gone back. I decided to try it again this year since it sounded like a great venue but I was very disappointed here as well. The place was nice and large but very hot and had a messy, red dirt floor. Really, I spent $40 on a cattle pen?  The wineries were nice but there were not enough food vendors and most were over-priced. My legs and feet were disgustingly dirty by the time we left. It also made me wonder how much of that dirt ended up on the food.  That's two out of two disappointments with that event and I will not be going back until a better location is used. If it happens a third time, well it will be third time and your out. There are plenty of nicer wine events around Texas that don't charge that much for entry and are much more fun."

Mother Nature decided that we needed some rain, and she was right! Though we were a little soggy when we arrived, that didn't dampen our spirits. We sampled food from most of the vendors, the quality was outstanding and we found everyone to be warm, friendly and knowledgable. As always, great wines, loved the beer garden, and glad to see the addition of spirits. The music added a nice ambience. We enjoyed our beer, wine and food sitting comfortably watching the shows. We had a wonderful day, we're looking forward to next year's Dripping With Taste. The Chamber should be very proud of this years event."

Sam, the owner and driver, was unbelievable. Very accommodating, great driver, and super chill.   We planned to hit up the Salt Lick on the party bus and then venture around to some breweries afterwards. Sam made sure that the group got where we needed to be on time, had great suggestions for breweries, and made sure we were having as much fun as possible.  The bus is great. Fit everyone comfortably with enough room for a cooler in between all of us. Sam had her playlist turned up or she would hand over the AUX cord and we could play our tracks as loud as we wanted. The whole experience was incredibly laid back and worry free. I would absolutely recommend Cool bus ATX to anyone that wants to have a great time with a big group in Austin.   On a side note, if it is Sunday, make sure that you buy beer on Saturday because they don't sell it on Sunday before noon.   Thanks again, Sam!"

The van was so comfy and roomy with great AC and sound system. Throughout the tour they chatted with us and made us laugh, and y'all, they are so prepared before the trip. The snacks and beverages were tasty and helpful between venues. Definitely will be booking another tour next month. Highly recommended!"

My driver clearly had everything under control, so I was able to relax with my friends and start the party as soon as we got on the bus!  Our kids were so jealous when they saw the cool bus their moms' were leaving them in!  Honestly, the bus could have driven us anywhere and we would have had a good time, but Santos' attention to picking great vineyards and James' attnetion to keeping us on schedule made everything perfect!  Our group was different than most -- in that we wanted to take it slow and just relax and were not too concerned about whether we made it to all three destinations.  We also had some nursing moms and wanted to be sure everyone was accomodated.  James was very accomodating and once I conveyed that we were more relaxed he made sure we had all the time we needed.  I also felt like the driving was very safe and overall the attention to safety was as it should be.  The price was reasonable, as well.  All in All, Keep Austin Wet made our vineyard tour perfect!"

Santos was so enthusiastic about hosting our party, which was a welcome relief as that is not always the response you get from tour companies when you tell them you're a bachelorette party--no matter how well-behaved you may be! Our driver, James, was wonderful and so helpful the entire day, especially at the end when we elected to add another hour and an extra stop; he catered his recommendation to our needs (gluten intolerant guests + casual interest in beer and liquor) and we had an amazing experience. You can't beat the pricing, but for what we paid our experience definitely exceeded every expectation. Thank you so much for everything, and we look forward to using you again in the future!"

Throwing a surprise weekend is stressful enough but Woody was SUPER accommodating especially for being so last minute.  There were many tours that I could've chosen to stick with but Woody was so authentic about his services and was a person of integrity when it came to what he offered.  He personally picked us up from our little hotel we were staying at and drove us to all three of our tours. His tour bus was super clean and we all had a blast! He even offered to pick up some cheese and snacks at the HEB close by to have on the bus if we wanted! I really appreciated Woody taking the time to answer my numerous phone calls with questions I had as this is my first Bachelorette party I threw.  I HIGHLY recommend using Woody if anyone wants to have a great time and looking for someone to trust. I will be booking with you again Woody, thank you so much for everything!"

If you come across Fredericksburg Uncorked Wine Tours, stop your search and make the booking.   Organizing a wine tour for 18 girls as part of a bachelorette party was a breeze with Woody, the owner/operator of Uncorked. He gave great advice, offered competitive pricing (especially for the expectant mothers/non-drinkers in our group), and was easy to communicate with. Woody was incredibly patient during the lead up to our tour, and then was a funny, gracious, and attentive guide during our wine tasting experience.   Our tour was fantastic from start to finish, and I can't recommend Woody and the rest of the Fredericksburg Uncorked team highly enough. All (18) of us had the greatest time!"

I honestly called three or 4 more tours throughout the week and left messages and he is the only one that called me back. Not only did woody come through, he came through at the last minute when I thought We weren't going to make a tour.  He was funny , knowledgeable and overall a great guide. He even recommended a few things that weren't apart of the tour (Alamo Springs Cafe) which we ended up going to and was delicious.  Lunch was not included but the place we went to was pretty great for a sandwich . I'd hang out and grab a beer with woody any night !  Thank you for making my boyfriends birthday a good one !!"

I was upset and apparently he was too so he threw customer service out the window. I never agreed to Woody keeping my credit card information on file after he charged the wine tour for 11 girls (almost $1,300).   The driver Tommy was nice but he did nothing special and didn't know the basics of Woody's business. Had he known even a little bit about Uncorked Tours, there wouldn't have been confusion about lunch.   As far as the wine tour: William Chris and Lost Draw were my favorite wineries. Hye Market pretended we weren't there half of the time. Pontotoc was greedy with their pours.   Woody was very unprofessional and difficult to work with at the end. I would not recommend him. Book early to get the highest rated wine tours (2-3 months prior)!"

The bus was top of the line, he was a lot of fun, and we would definitely do it again!"

                "description": "So first....let me say that our group totally dropped the ball on planning.  We reached out to Carla 3-4 weeks before but did not confirm until the week of the wine tour.   By the grace of the \"wine\" Gods, Carla could fit us in her schedule!  She is completely open to letting you choose your places or you can follow her lead!   She picked us up at our accommodations which were several miles outside of Fredricksburg.  We did introductions and she laid out the things that were already scheduled for the day.  On our way to the first winery, we decided to \"reroute\" the tour to hit some lesser known spots.  TBH, we were excited for Carla's recommendations.    Our first stop was Six Shooter because of their variety of dry wines, sweet wines and meads.  You have to try the Jalapeno shooter!!!  SO GOOD!   Second, we made our tour time at Real Ale and did a beer tasting. Third, she realized the majority of our groups like Whiskey, so we stopped at Andalusia Whiskey in Blanco!  This place met the needs of our entire group (even the non-whiskey drinker) and was by far the most unique stop of their day!  If you go here, try the Cherry Cola cocktail!   We stopped for lunch at Pecan Street Brewing in Johnson City, where we drank lots of water and had really great food.   Our last stop of the tour was Zero815 Winery which had a cool mix of wines and friendly staff.   At the end of the day, Carla made sure that we made it back to our accommodations safe and sound.  We had the very best time and she knows some of the coolest places that you might miss without her expertise.  She was extremely professional and very down to earth.  She was always around to help with recommendations or just to snap photos of the group!     We highly recommend doing a tour with Carla and Texas Wine and Spirit Tours!   You won't be disappointed!   We'll be booking with her again the next time we are in the area!"

Some girl friends and I came to Fredericksburg for a long weekend and did two back-to-back tours with her. The first tour on Friday was with another group and they had already decided to do wine so we were able to join in with them and had a blast touring the local wineries. She also took us to a local watering hole afterwards when we decided we all wanted to stay out for a bit longer. She was amazingly accommodating and super fun!! On Saturday we wanted to tour some distilleries and breweries and she helped us decide which ones were more along the atmosphere we were looking for. Carla is amazing and I can't recommend her enough!!"

                "description": "My best friend and sister planned a weekend bachelorette party for me complete with a wine and art tour. The weather was pretty bad that morning, so we started a little late, but the van that they have is really, really nice, clean, and spacious. She even has a little stool in case you need help getting into the van, and she helps everyone get in and get out. We went to three places around the Johnson City area. The first one was a quick tasting, the second one we learned A LOT about wine and got a lesson in how to properly drink wine, and at the third winery we got the most interesting history lesson about President Johnson and Lady Bird Johnson from the winemaker himself. Leslee personally knows the places and owners and was just the best tour guide. One of the places on the tour where we were supposed to also eat dinner at cancelled due to the weather, but Leslee was quick to find a different place for us to go to. She took us to a cute cafe in downtown Johnson City where we ate a ridiculously good dinner. We even went to Leslee and her husband's bar at the end of the day for one last drink and got a chance to meet her sweet daughter as well. I thoroughly enjoyed the tour with Leslee and highly recommend D'Vine Tours!"

                "description": "Looking to experience great Hill Country wines and barbecue - we had both taking Winding Road Wine Tours Salt Lick Sunday Wine Tour.  The tour picked us up in Gruene in a new luxury bus at 10:30. We were greeted by the tour owner Billy Martin.  The bus was very comfortable with a u shaped seating arrangement and a table in the aisle.  Should seat around 12 people comfortably. The bus has a great sound system that is Bluetooth enabled - Billy played whatever we wanted from sources such as Pandora and Napster music service. First stop was Driftwood Estate Winery. Driftwood has perhaps the best winery views in the Hill Country.  I really enjoyed the reds and came away with a bottle of Longhorn Red to enjoy at our next stop Salt Lick Barbecue. Yes, Salt Lick is byob. It was beginning to rain and Billy dropped us off near the check in stand. He's thought of his customer's needs providing us large golf umbrellas. It was busy with people waiting to be seated. However, he got us seated right away. Our final two wineries were Fall Creek right across the street from Salt Lick and then Wimberley Valley Winery. Fall Creek has solid wines and the service for our group was outstanding. Wimberley Valley Winery was an unexpected pleasure. Their tasting room is roomy and comfortable with plenty room at the tasting bars and a comfortable seating area facing a large stone fireplace. They have a variety of wines bottled on site along with other wines from around the world. The grounds were spectacular with numerous large shaded decks to enjoy a glass or bottle as you wrap up your tour.  What a great Sunday drinking Texas wines, eating Texas barbecue and meeting new friends!"

                "description": "I rented a party bus through this company a couple weeks ago. In the beginning, Robert was extremely accommodating and friendly. And our driver, Terrell, was great. We got dropped off at COTA for a show and had a great time!  But where it turned south was at the end of the night. I texted our driver 30 minutes before we needed to be picked up (like he requested) and he said no problem. Then we left the concert and were walking to the pickup spot where I gave him a call. He said he got in an accident but would only be 20 minutes and I said that's fine. 20 minutes roll by and I gave him a call again, no answer, but texted and said it would be another 20 minutes. We ended up waiting in the cold for almost an hour and well after most people had left COTA. Multiple people in our party ended up just taking ubers because they didn't want to wait. The whole point of a bus is so you don't have to wait.  The next day, I texted Robert saying we would like a refund for the extra hour we paid for waiting that we wouldn't have used if we had been picked up on time. He said he would call to discuss but never did. I've now sent him multiple emails - mind you, being incredibly nice about it. All I asked for was an hour refunded back - not the whole thing, not even half. But still no response.  The customer service level of this company is terrible should anything go wrong. So hire them at your own risk."

                "description": "Apologies for this review being so incredibly late but Austin Nites was the best! We had rented a party bus on pretty short notice to take a Bachelor Party to and from Lake Travis and Robert and team were amazing.   It was also Prom weekend so the schedule was packed for them but they still took care of us and worked with our schedule.   Our boat ended up staying out on the water longer than scheduled which through our plans all over the place and Robert was there waiting on time. Given his packed schedule, the driver did have to leave without us but Robert made sure to get me in contact with another service and they sent a bus over right away.   All in all, it was an incredible experience!"

Missing panels inside of bus missing or duct tape together.  Another party bus parked next to the one we had and it was so obvious how terrible looking our bus looked.   Can't believe owners would let this bus represent their company. Hope they use our $700 toward getting it fixed.   Driver was pleasant."

But how is that supposed to work when you have a huge group? I called austin nites party rentals for a few reasons 1. I love puns and 2. I'm am austinite and 3. My group was over ten people and we wanted to go out and have nothing to worry about. Great party bus, great personable driver, great experience definitely reccomend these guys!! DONT DRINK AND DRIVE!! Call someone you can trust call Austin Nites!!"

                "description": "I'm incredibly frustrated with this business.  We had spoken a couple times in the months before I decided to book and I initially felt great about potentially booking with these friendly people.  When it came time to book I called them and was told, once again, that our requested date was open and we talked out an agreement.  The owner tells me we're good to go, and that all he needed me to do now was to send him my information so that he could get a contract sent that same day.  I'd explained to him that I was booking this bus ride to and from a party boat, and that I would be booking with them that day as well.   SO, I get off the phone and send my info.  I call my party boat folks to let them know I've just confirmed my bus, and I'm ready for a boat.  I book with them based on my discussion with these guys and put down $400 to hold our reservation.  It's been two weeks since I last spoke with this company and they have ignored my calls, texts, voicemails trying to figure out why the contract hasn't come through.  Our event is next month, and at this point I've been researching new solutions, and unfortunately the new solution means I can't use the same boat company, and therefore I've lost my $400 deposit.  I did not have this money to lose, but after being ghosted by this company I guess I have to take the loss and move on.  They seem like nice people, and it takes A LOT to get on here and write a negative review, but this has caused me a lot of stress and I want to prevent this from happening to anyone else.  I hope at some point I find out a reasonable explanation and can revise this review, but not counting on it.  We'll see I guess."

                "description": "BOOK WITH THIS COMPANY!  Robert did a solid job taking me and a bunch of my friends to Lake Travis and back on July 4th. His price was WAY lower than other companies I called, being the ONLY one that actually sticked to his regular prices during this busy day. He arrived early and was 100% responsive to my emails and phone calls. He arrive early to pick us up and was extremely friendly and professional. He helped us carry our coolers and accommodate everything on the bus.  The bus itself is amazing. Seats are stacked in two rows facing each other, which is great for dancing and socializing, since you are actually facing half of the crowd. The sound system is also very good. I almost feel that the bus trip was even more fun that the boat.   In summary, Austin Nites Ent. is the best on price/quality, Robert and his wife are responsive, professional and friendly, and the whole experience I had with them is positive. Would highly recommend anyone to use it, and will definitely consider using them again if I ever need to.  Thank you guys!!!!!"

                "description": "We rented a party bus from Robert for my brother's 30th birthday. They were one of the only companies I found that didn't increase their rates because of prom season. I called about 10 other companies looking for fun and safe travels with almost all of them being ridiculously overpriced to take advantage of the prom goers. Robert was very accommodating, professional, and had awesome rates. He called two days before the scheduled time of arrival to check in and verify everything was still good to go. He asked if there were any changes in the amount of people and offered a bigger bus just in case. Our drivers, Patrick and Joe were awesome! Patrick called me early the day of to verify everything and let me know he'd be there at 8 and then called again when they were almost to our pickup location. They arrived right on time with an awesome bus just for us. He had coolers with ice, a flat screen tv, music system, AC and even a bathroom in the back. What more could you ask for? Part of the evening was spent at Graham's Central Station in Pville. We didn't realize prior that Graham's doesn't serve food anymore and had to order pizza to the bus. Patrick gladly retrieved our pizza and brought it to us when it arrived. We all had a blast, felt safe and were taken care of. Highly recommend Austin NItes and shout out to Patty PartyWagon, if you had a Yelp page, I'd write a review for you too."

There was a total of 8 girls on the tour with a couple that was paired with us and we were the perfect group.  Linda was the best tour guide anyone can ask for.  Our group had a blast and the lunch was an added bonus on the tour!  She kept us informed along the way and gave us the best details of each winery/distillery that we visited.  Linda was very personable and every location we visited had its own special charm!  Thanks for an amazing tour Slowpokes Wine Tours."

                "description": "We enjoyed a wonderful day set up by Linda at Slowpokes.  After talking with her she designed a day that was diverse and showed us a number of new things in the Dripping Springs area.  Our day included several of the high country wineries, one brewery and a visit to the quaint town of Wimberly. We highly recommend this group over  other Austin wine tour groups as they create a very personalized day and made sure everyone enjoyed the stops.   Our day started with lunch at Homespuns in Dripping Springs - excellent start to a beautiful day!  The Bloody Marys are highly recommended."

                "description": "We recently completed a bachelorette party tour with Lindsey as our tour guide and it was the BEST! Lindsey chose our wineries very wisely; we started with lunch at Crowson (whose owner will drop incredible knowledge on you), enjoyed a rainstorm and a glass of red at the beautiful Ron Yates, and ended with cheese and BOOOOM wine at Hye Meadow Winery. It was lovely day of booze, conversation, and sisterhood. And, yes, we loved Lindsey so much she became a part of our wolfpack. Lindsey was fun, energetic, and knowledgeable about the area. I would definitely do this tour again!"

                "description": "I decided to surprise my mom with a wine tasting tour for her 60th birthday. Linda went above and beyond to make this tour special. She made a wine bottle with me and my moms photo on it with a sweet birthday message and quote.  She took so many photos of us, and really made us feel special. We were able to choose our wineries and she even picked us up and dropped us off at our BNB. She had the most amazing tapas tray, with cheese, mixed nuts, her special dip, crackers, breads and meats. She had this prepared and sat out for us at Wimberly winery,  halfway through the tour. At the end of this stop, she even had cupcakes for my moms birthday. I had actually called around different wine tours in the area and Slow Poke Wine tours offered the best value and I can tell you now, the best service. We wouldn't hesitate to do it again. This trip with my mom was priceless and so special. I thank you Linda for making an amazing memory for my mom and I."

We went to a beautiful winery to begin and enjoyed a lunch spread while there; then we went to a distillery with AMAZING frozen mint juleps, outdoor games and great scenic views; finally we ended at the olive oil and balsamic producer for more snacks and great wine. Linda was very attentive to us and did a great job of keeping us on schedule without rushing us, she picked us up around 10:30AM and we returned around 4:30PM. Hope to enjoy this tour again in the future, a very diverse experience that I think even the guys would enjoy!"

While a small group, Linda and Dave do an outstanding job of making everyone feel comfortable, no matter what the group size.  This time we went to 3 different venues and what a great experience.

                "description": "I used Slowpokes Winery Tours to go on a Hill Country wine tour on the day I got engaged, and I could not have asked for a better experience.  My now fiancée and I rode in the Model T Ford, which was all-original except for the brakes. I contacted Linda with any questions, concerns, and booking, and Linda picked up my fiancée in a Mercedes van.  We went to a great breakfast, and then David drove us around in the Model T Ford. The route was scenic, breathe taking, and beautiful.  The wineries we stopped at were great, and, the customer service from Linda and David was unbeatable.  They have a unique business that is more than just a van or limo driving you around to distilleries, breweries, or wineries (although they also have a Mercedes van option).  I am now going on another tour with them for a bachelor party, and they could not have provided more prompt replies to my requests for information related to travel, pick up at different locations, types of tours they offer, and pricing.  What a great business run by some truly nice and professional people who offer very reasonable pricing.  I plan to use their services again in the future."

I wasn't sure what to expect, but it didn't take long to realize that not only is Dale a great tour guide, he's also a very personable and knowledgable man who makes you feel like an old friend.   The points of interest were superb and the last stop we made provided one of the best meals I've had in my life and most likely the best ribeye ever.   The day lasted longer than expected, but it was a wonderful day and ended up being just perfect. We are planning to use his rental venue for a retreat in the coming months and looking forward to it.

                "description": "First I would like to start with the facts.  1. We booked this tour months ago but unfortunately had to reschedule to a later date. (due to Covid19) This was not an issue for anyone attending the tour and the company got all $2800 paid for in full. 2. Yes $2800. We had 28 people in our group, It required two buses that were at their max capacity.  3. I would give a HUGE ZERO if I could.   The buses arrived at the pick up location 25 minutes early and expected us (all 28) to load up. Not all 28 people were even there yet. The male driver already seemed annoyed at this point.  We ended up pulling out at the agreed on time. When trying to leave the 2nd winery we couldn't. The drivers HAD LEFT and weren't there to pick us up. We waited outside in the sun outside for 30 minutes before they even got back.  But that unfortunately is not why I am writing this review   As we were loading the bus to go home the male driver said that would be charging us for a cleaning fee ($300) because someone spilt something on the floorboard. Pretty steep for a small spill that could be wiped up with a Clorox wipe but she agreed to pay it she sat down. Comments started to be exchanged about the steep fee and how the day had been complete chaos up until this point. The man began to get pretty heated and slammed the door. When he opened the door to his seat he said \"who the f**k spilt something in my seat.\" Nobody had spilled something on his seat. Upon looking at the \"spill\" it appeared to be sweat from Him. He continued to cuss and yell and eventually told us to \"get off his bus.\" We all piled off and the other bus also unloaded.  Now it is important to note the other driver said we didn't do anything wrong and that she didn't agree with how he was handling things. He told her he was in charge and that he would make the call. She became quiet after that. They ultimately left us there to find our own rides.  The male driver was rude and didn't speak unless spoken to the entire day. A beautiful day with amazing company was RUINED by this company and I will not recommend them to anyone!"

                "description": "I booked a birthday trip for 6 people, hoping to add 2 more. Dale told me I could book the trip for 6 and then add the 2. When I called to add the 2 he told me he would have to see if that was even possible. I didn't understand why after he assured me it would be fine and a sprinter van hold more than that. He had given the sprinter van to a larger crowd and downgraded us to an SUV without asking me (same price). I asked him when I would hear back and he said whenever he located another vehicle. I made some calls and found a better business who really wanted to host me and our guests. I called again to cancel with Dale and was told I am not the type of customer he would want. I guess a customer who wants to pay more money to add more people isn't good... very strange. Talking to a woman like that is not ok. I hope that he was having a bad few days and that he doesn't always behave like this, but I was really shocked how rude and unprofessional he was. Pros: I got my money back."

                "description": "One of the WORST experiences I have ever had with a \"wine tour\" company. I have been on many wine tours in my days, across different parts of Texas, and their unprofessionalism and lack of customer service and just blatant disrespect was appalling.   This \"wine tour\" had a total of two buses and a party consisting of 28 people. A group of people that I have known for years that have the utmost of respect and common courtesy for any company that they hire or work with.   From the start of our experience, both drivers were incredibly rude and unfriendly. The bus lacked any amenities one would think this \"Premier Hill Country Wine Tasting Experience\" would consist of.  The first winery.  * We arrived at the first winery at 10:48am to learn that the winery doesn't even open until 11:00am and that they WEREN'T expecting us at all... * Not the wineries fault. They were fantastic.  The second winery.  * Again, wasn't expecting us, causing us to have to sit at a tent down a road from the winery. Again, not the wineries fault, they handled it incredibly.  * When trying to leave the second winery, we couldn't. The drivers HAD LEFT and weren't there to pick us up. We waited outside in the sun outside for 30 minutes before they even got back.  The third winery.  * As we were loading the bus to go home, the male driver said that they would be charging us for a cleaning fee ($300) because someone spilled something on the floorboard. Pretty steep for a small spill that could be wiped up with a Clorox wipe, but she agreed to pay it. (*To clarify, open containers were allowed as stated on their website: \"Consumption of alcohol on the bus is allowed unless there are minors present.\") Minor spills like this are inevitable when providing a service as they do. Comments started to be exchanged about the steep fee and how the day had been complete chaos up until this point. The man began to get pretty heated and slammed the door. When he opened the door to his seat he said \"who the f**k spilt something in my seat.\" Nobody had spilled something on his seat. Upon looking at the \"spill\" it appeared to be sweat from him. He continued to cuss and yell and eventually told us to \"get off his bus.\" We all piled off, and the other bus also unloaded.  I know these times are hard, especially for small and locally owned businesses, and by no means and am I trying to make it harder for them; in fact, I am going above and beyond to support them. After yesterday, I do think that they need to take a step back and re-evaluate their actions and really think long and hard about what they do and why they do it. In the end, when providing a service, the client always comes first."

To be honest, the cost seemed a bit high at first but having never been on a wine tour before and I really had no idea. Afterward I realize it was worth every bit of it. Dale picked us up at our BnB along with everyone else on the tour that day and we were off to the first tasting.  He seem to know everyone along the tour and at each place they were very welcoming and grateful to have our group. It really was a fun time and we had the chance to try many different wines that we would not have normally picked.  Lucky for us it was a beautiful day and everything was just perfect. I would definitely recommend this tour to anyone interested in checking out some Texas wines, for a nice weekend getaway, or just to try something different.  It definitely helped that we had a good group of people who were also on the tour that day as well. It was a blast...I just wish we had taken more pictures."

First off, Dale is a pretentious, \"underpaid monkey\" as he likes to be called. He is rude, unprofessional, and has the audacity to 'hate mail' potential clients and I know I'm not the first one because I've seen the reviews! I don't have much else to say but be careful and do your research before spending any money on this place! The owner seems to not have a care in the world if it's not benefitting him. Also, be ready for rude phone calls and emails from Dale if he doesn't get his way. He was hard to get ahold of from the jump, not to mention I live out of town and couldn't wait for days in between responses. After not being able to make it to my appointment because he had failed to get back to me promptly, I proceeded on with my day. The next morning I wake up to the most rude, despicable email I've ever received. Just be careful and read reviews because from what I've read, if you want a beautiful wedding with NICE, FRIENDLY people, this isn't the place. I'll attach one of many emails. STAY AWAY FROM THE HEART OF TEXAS RANCH ALL TOGETHER!!!"

Picked us up at our hotel in Fredericksburg, went to pick up lunch, and then on to first of 4 wineries. She took care of everything. Even loaded up our bottles/goodies in the back of the bus and kept the AC on to keep it all cool.  Christy went above and beyond to keep everything organized, she set up our lunch, picked up our trash, offered to take us anywhere we wanted to go, and she kept us on time to all of our tastings. We bought a bottle of wine at the 3rd winery and drank in the bus on the way to the 4th. Lunch was a boxed lunch bought at local deli (very good). Everything was included. Everything was professional. The bus was large and comfy. Highly recommend this tour company!"

He was also very accommodating as the number of girls going on the tour changed at the last minute. We went to Fat Ass, Six Shooter and Fiesta Vineyards which were a blast and everyone enjoyed the tastings. Our driver Rick was funny and a true gentleman. It was raining that day and he had an umbrella to escort everyone in and out of the tasting rooms so no one got soaked. One of the girls left their phone on the tour bus and Rick came back later that evening to return the phone even after we offered to meet him half way. We had a great time and would recommend this tour to anyone!"

                "description": "We paid nearly four hundred dollars and it was a joke. What was supposed to be a winery tour was a tour of places that sold wine. We went to a store in downtown marble falls, an art studio, a grocery store and at the very end an actual winery. This constituted our day.   This is NOT a day of going to wineries in the hill country. Everyone was disappointed on Valentine's day.   The guy who led the tour was nice but they clearly got kickbacks where we went.   When we went to lunch no one got their order and right when we were leaving this sandwich shop the tour guide asked, \"everyone went to the tasting room, right?\" We're talking about a sandwich place being a stop on the wine tour people.   Horribly disappointed. Considering tastings were at most $10 for each of the four \"wineries\" we went to, it was a rip off in value.  The company clearly avoided going to respectable wineries and instead went to dead end places where they could maximize their profit margin.   Avoid at all costs!!"

We visited four wineries and were treated like VIPs due to Dale's wonderful rapport with vineyard owners and staff.  Dale's knowledge of wine and  the specialities and uniqueness of each winery made the tour interesting and fun.  By the end of the day, I had not only made new memories, but new friends too!"

We did the \"red rose\" package, touring 3 wineries and had a few hours in Luckenbach.  John was friendly, fun and a great host. All we had to do is drink wine, visit with friends and enjoy the day! If you are looking for a fun experience, try Yellow Rose! We will be back next year to do it all over again!"

                "description": "Do not use this \"tour\"!! It is cheaper to pay the tasting fees and hire your own driver. The owner is greedy and a complete A. We originally had 5 ladies who were going on the tour with us and one backed out. We didn't ask for a private tour and John (who I'm guessing is the owner) didn't tell us until we were already at the first location that he would stop the tour until we paid for a fifth person that wasn't there. No wonder he kept pushing cash, it was a complete rip off. It was either go home after that tour paying $125 a person..Or have two more tours while paying for a person who wasn't there. PS it's about $15 for the wine tastings. ($15x3=$45) It was not worth it. On a positive note, Gary at Hanhe Estates winery was amazing. Highly recommend this guy and his wine."

We were picked up and then drove for 45 minutes without our driver, John, saying a word about where we were going or how long it would take to get there. He then picked up 3 other people when it was supposed to be a private tour. He took us to the wineries but never said a word about where to go or what to do. He followed us around at the wineries and sat with us. He was 30 minutes late then forgot what the schedule was supposed to be and tried to keep us at the 2nd winery until 30 minutes after we were supposed to be home. He told us we could pay with cash or card, but he only actually took cash or PayPal, which put some people in a real bind. He hounded us about payment the whole time. It was awful and we will never do it again."

The transportation (van) was very clean and well-taken care of. We had the van to ourselves on the couple's tour but it can easily fit a big party!  Booking a couple's wine tour on their website was super easy (and I'm sure it would be for big groups too)! The date availability, cost estimate, and customizability is spot-on. The moment you book, they send you a comprehensive list of wineries and distilleries (!!!) with rankings of the view + wine. They also have great options for add-ons, such as a charcuterie board or stopping by for lunch mid-wine tour. Love that.  There's no doubt I would choose and recommend 830 Elevated again for any future wine excursions in Hill Country. Thanks again, Brayden and Deb :)"

From start to finish everything was so easy and customizable to what we were looking for while planning our annual girls trip. Prices are incomparable with Five Star treatment on a PRIVATE tour. Right after booking we got an email with a list of the area wineries and restaurants that had notes and ratings so we could choose where we wanted to go. This is a private tour so Brayden picked us up right in front of our Airbnb and we were off. We toured four wineries and he kept us on schedule but never rushing us. After the tours we opted for the night service so he dropped us off on Main Street so we could grab dinner, sing some karaoke and when ready to be picked up to end the evening just had to shoot him a text and he was there. We just cannot say enough good things about this company. Do not second guess - book with Brayden and Deb"

I believe they were on the city website as a recommended tour, but also Google directed me to them. Either way, I am so glad it happened this way - our experience with 830 was indeed elevated!!! The customized tour that Deb set up with me over the phone was exactly what my husband and I wanted - a distillery, a brewery, and a winery that made you feel like you were in Napa. Without even knowing us, Deb helped picked the perfect places for us to enjoy. Communication up until the tour and the day of the tour was prompt and courteous, always with our best intentions in mind (example: Deb texted us and offered to pick us up even earlier than planned due to the heat at one of the outdoor locations). The drive in between locations was full of great conversation, and we were thankful they provided cold water for us. The van was immaculate and the drive was very comfortable - I didn't know the luxury that a private vs public tour would offer! Deb was so knowledgeable (she's a local, of course!) and so sweet with helping us newbies figure out what to do. Her service went above and beyond, and she made us feel like celebrities. It was an absolute pleasure to work with them - do yourself the best favor and book with them!!"

But the best we could find was a limo driver that would charge us almost what it would for 4 people. Then we found 830 Elevated. They're filling a niche most tour companies aren't by providing an affordable private tour option for couples. They were great. Small, young company. They don't have deep knowledge on wine like veteran companies but they are personable in that they also tour wineries themselves and can share their inputs."

                "description": "The worst experience. Here's my story-   I booked with this company over a month in advance prior to my trip to Fredericksburg for my fiancé and I's anniversary, as well as his birthday. After booking, the company was very communicative for the first few days. After the first few days, I did not hear a word from them until the week of our trip. I had told them a month in advance which places we wanted to go. The week of, they inform us that Augusta vin is not taking people for reservations. Which was fine, we went ahead with the other vineyard they had suggested. We had booked for a Saturday. That Friday at 3:00AM, they had informed us of a change of driver due to a family emergency which we completely understood, and now that our pickup time had changed to 11:30AM instead of 1:30PM. I wake up to that email Saturday still understanding, and we changed our plans to be at the pickup destination by 11:30AM. We are waiting there over 15 minutes for them to show, and no one does. We call, leave voicemails, and still hear from no one. 30 minutes passed, they send a TEXT MESSAGE informing us they aren't showing up for the entire time and that we are on our own for the entire day. LEAVING OUR PLANS FOR THE ENTIRE DAY RUINED. Incredibly horrid communication from this company. DO NOT BOOK WITH THIS COMPANY!!!! I seriously am understanding that situations happen in life, but they had guaranteed us a driver for the day regardless of what had happened. I was truly heartbroken to have not received a personal phone call from the company, instead they just send us a text that they are not coming. I have NEVER written a review for a company before, but this needed to be shared. We discussed the situation with multiple locals in the town, no one had ever heard of this company. Whatever you do, save your money and time."

                "description": "'ve been to places like this before (but for primarily beer rather than wine), and I love the setup - it's super fun. You get a card that's tied to your credit card to swipe or tap and then you have access to the wine you swiped for. Then you can get as much or as little as you want. It's a great way to try and explore new wines (and mead and some margarita inspired wines). Then you can load up on your favorite (what I did), or continue exploring. Really, two great options. Also, the guy working there was nice and very helpful. I've been telling people about how much I enjoyed coming here and recommending it.  Don't park in the paid parking next to Wanderlust if you can avoid it because it's stupidly expensive. Use that money on a Lyft or more wine."

Like, I was thee only soul inside the establishment from 5pm-7pm. As a patron and especially a first timer, you'd think they'd have a little leniency if you order a 8oz of wine and ask to exchange. I understand you can taste your pours, which I paid for at least 5 of them averaging $2-$3 for each TASTE. After my fourth taste, I wanted to trust that I was getting a good one because most of them were and I promise to god it was the worst taste to my palette that I've ever had. And Lissen Linda, I'm not a bougie wine person. But for this 8oglass to be $15 I couldn't even stomach it and asked if possible to exchange. I said, \"what's the policy if you get a wine that you absolutely can not stomach? Is that your own bad?\"  She said, \"yeah kinda. I'll call the manager but he's at another location\"   Okay cool. 15 minutes later I find her and I'm like, \"so can I exchange this wine or no? I don't need a refund\"   \"He said no\"  I work in the service industry as well and look out for people all the time. I just feel like she OR the manager could have made an accommodation but maybe operationally that's not the way they run things. That's my bad for not tasting the nasty ass wine. That particular 1 oz pour was like $4 so I assumed it was good to be so pricy.   ."

Wine on tap is such a great idea.   They give you a card that you use to get your wine. You get charged by the ounce. They do have happy hour. They have a good selection of wines. For those that don't like wine, they have a handful options (margarita, old fashioned)   The place is cute and they have a nice outdoor patio. They had a food truck the day we went.   Con:  - the wine comes out pretty fast, so you have to be careful as it can add up quick. If you want to taste first, be quick at closing it.  - there's no way to figure out how many ounces you are serving yourself."

You could tell they were glad we were new.  They truly have great enthusiasm for their jobs and this business.  A new product even arrived and we were informed we came at a terrific time!   It was so easy to tap my Wanderlust card and release the wine. There's a great variety of wines to choose from, including wines from France, Spain, some sangrias and hard lemonade. Warning: make sure all the taps are closed before you insert your card. I didn't see that one was turned a bit and wine started trickling and money ringing up on my card.  Because it's not very bright, I didn't see the wine flowing. Lesson learned!   There's an interesting room off the patio for private events.  I'm jealous I couldn't pop in!   Happy to see the food truck. Mmm: truffle fries and bruschetta!  You MUST come visit this location!"

Wanderlust charges by the ounce and although it adds up pretty quickly, if you're able to pace yourself, you can have a whole evening of fun. I got out of there spending well under $50 for two people, so we really didn't go all that crazy.  Try a million different wines and mixed drinks! they give you a card at the entrance and it just rings up your total, then they charge you on the way out. We had an issue with a bunch of cork settling into one of our glasses and they were able to remove that pour from our tab. The only thing is that it's hard to keep track of your favorite pours because there are so many options.  There is also a ton of space to sit. They have inside seating/lounge tables, there is outdoor seating and there's also an additional event space which you can sit in. We sat in the event space with a large group and it was so comfy.

When you walk in, they give you a separate card that you swipe before each one of your pours. I liked it because you could pour as much or as little as you wanted and it gave you the opportunity to try different wines without being committed to a full glass. Honestly, it reminded me of those self-serve frozen yogurt places. I also really liked the outdoor area - it was a great place to hang out with friends and we had a great time taking photos at the photo booth.  The only downside was that it was more expensive than I was expecting. They give you the price per ounce on the screen, but once you start pouring, it adds up VERY quickly. I could have spent the same amount of money on a way nicer and fuller glass of wine.  Overall, I enjoyed the concept and fun vibes. Would love to come back during their happy hour or something when things are half-priced!"

                "description": "What a cool little concept and space to drink wine in downtown Austin. Came here during happy hour last weekend with some friends and was overall impressed with the wine tasting here. There whole gimmick is you you can try any of the wines on the wall tap and your charged by the ounces you drink. I will warn you use a light touch on the taps as I learned the hard way the first try. Most of the wines were half off during happy hour which makes for a great deal and I also liked that there was a range of wines from across the globe and wasn't specific to one region. They also had patio seating an Italian food truck in case you get hungry. The only downside like most places downtown is the parking but I heard that's less of an issue at their east side location which I'm excited to try next!"

Red blends, dry white blends, bubbly, mead, etc. You name it, they have it!  When you arrive they swipe your card and give you another card, something like a hotel key card. You use this key card and swipe it before each self serve wine glass pour. The screen next to the tap will show you how many ounces you've filled up your glass and how much for the whole glass. The screen also shows how much each ounce of wine costs. Maybe I'm getting old and outdated but this was some cool technology! Probably the coolest, unique payment system I've ever seen!   There is a food truck on site with some seriously good pasta and appetizer types.   I can't speak to the parking situation since I walked from my location but I do believe there was a small parking lot."

                "description": "\"Froyo for wine\"; Fun idea, smooth process, nice spot, bit pricey.   It's a charge by oz place, like Froyo with all of the taps requiring an RFID card that you get by associating with a credit card at the front desk. Place the card on the reader and pour what you want into your glass. They have over 50 different styles, including mead, white, red, dry/sweet, and some wine-based cocktail style drinks.  They typically range from $1-3+ per oz so you'll probably come out with a $5-10 glass (4 oz) which is pretty comparable to most places.  There is both indoor and outdoor seating; interior is mostly couch seating and outdoor is patio/bench with faux grass. You can also bring dogs. The outdoor is a bit noisy, especially since it backs to another bar and is right under 35 so it was nicer indoors than out.  I don't usually drink wine because it gives me headaches and I certainly felt it the next day even after just 2 small glasses; possibly because of tasting so many different kind, so beware! Nice for trying something new but possible to get sick if you're mixing so much."

I appreciate the way the wines are labeled in clear groupings so it's easier to just walk up and find what I'm wanting more quickly. They also have an Italian food truck in the back patio area. The truffle Parmesan fries were great and the pasta dish was a good portion. Lots of cute photo ops and decent areas of seating. I will say this location is much smaller and literally off the busy highway but still the experience they offer is worth checking out."

My favorite was their Russian River Valley Pinot and they had a special white from the green valley sub appellation I LOVED.   The tasting room is down to earth and simple- and expect a drop in by the owner! Great wines, friendly crew- recommend for the wine lover."

                "description": "Been wanting to check this place out for awhile now. Very close to our house in town and needed a nice Texas bottle of wine for a charcuterie board night.  Made reservations for 2... Very specific time slots available. We were arriving a tad early so I called first to make sure that was indeed ok and I actually got a call service... they weren't on site and first told me that they take walk ins and it was cool.... then he stopped me before hanging up telling me no... reservations required... he couldn't figure it out and didn't have access to the winery to check... that was odd. Walked in and got right in to a different table then I reserved since we were early.  You will feel like you're walking into a house.... lots of pictures and decor everywhere.... they are not minimalists :) Sat down and Ami took excellent care of us with the wine tastings and a couple snacks. We ended up grabbing a bottle of our favorite to go.  We were there for an hour. Felt kind of rushed. The owner was walking around the whole time we were there with an ipad scanning the room and tables... it kind of ruined the chill experience...  loved the nice friendly folks that were there drinking with their dogs... music in the background was nice. The wines were tasty too and Ami was super knowledgeable about them all. She was the best part of our time there.  I prefer outdoor wineries. There are no windows and it's all indoors in a strip center. I am very sensitive to floral air fresheners and strong chemical cleaners and they definitely use both. A lady was walking around spraying windex after people left very close to us and it was so strong it retuned the wine tasting experience trying to navigate the smell and taste the wine....  Overall the wines were good and the people were nice...  Windex spraying, calling a hot line instead of winery and Ipad guy walking around the whole time wasn't for me...  I like laid back relax and stay as long as you choose atmospheres with no strong cleaning smells while drinking wine. The bathroom is also very strong.... extremely blue toilet water... and fragrances... Doesn't mix well with food and wine..  Loved all the dogs and pics of dogs!  Ami gets 10 stars!!!"

                "description": "Ok yes, this is in a \"warehouse\" \"strip mall\" kind of exterior... HOWEVER, Once you walk in, you forget! It's so very welcoming and cozy...and the WINE! I've been to plenty of wine tastings that I had to figure out one I liked. This dilemma was figuring out if there was one I didn't like. My friends all agreed, and we actually tried to figure out if we could get another time slot reservation because we enjoy ourselves that much. The staff were so welcoming and checked on us often enough but not too often. There were snack options, and apparently on the weekends they try to offer food specials if you come hungry. We really enjoyed ourselves and look forward to next time."

Amie poured various wines and gave a complete history of how they were grown along with what to expect when tasting them.  She also shared with us stories about how she went to college for making wine and growing grapes which was fascinating. An added benefit was that they serve a bowl of pulled pork stew that was to die for!  And the accompanying piece of cornbread was also excellent."

                "description": "Wow I was blown away by Bent Oak. It really does not look like much from the outside but my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try based on the reviews and we were not disappointed! We easily made a reservation on the website and came in at 2pm on a Saturday. They took out temperatures at the door and we were seated quickly.   We decided to go for the wine tasting first, 5 samples for $15 plus a stemless logo glass to take home! We really enjoyed trying the wines and enjoyed all of them. Our favorite was the Blanc du Bois because it was light and crisp but had a unique fragrant flavor from the floral notes and the apricot.   My only gripe was the reservation was only 45 minutes. I wish it could've been around an hour, we didn't get a chance to finish our wine or our charcuterie but it's not too big of a deal since we just took it back home. We also got another bottle of the Blanc du Bois to take home and they gave us a cute wine bag for the two bottles.   We will definitely be back again to try the rest of the wines!!"

                "description": "What a wonderful discovery on a lazy pre-Xmas Sat afternoon. Who would have thought you could find a boutique winery that rivals any that I've visited in Sonoma.   Do not despair as you pull into the generic industrial park hard off of Anderson Mill Road in the CP. Walk-in past the small lobby area and step into their beautifully decorated tasting room.  Since we were the only patrons we received VIP treatment from start to finish.   We opted for their premium tasting menu and selected all reds. I'm not a TX wine fan but Dylan, our sommelier, expertly guided us through our tasting and as we concluded our wonderful stay my mind was changed.   My favorite was the Alexandar Valley Cab will more than suffice if you enjoy a big traditional Cab with a strong finish.   Their Spanish Mourvedre version is deep and rich and has a surprisingly strong finish,   There are a number of \"light\" reds as well. We were not fans but appreciated the flavor and balance of these wines.   Bent Oak does offer cheese plates and other small plates to accompany your tasting. Check their social media as they have live music on certain days.   Wonderful wine, an intimate setting, and passionate knowledgeable folks equals a 5 star experience."

                "description": "This was a real treat.  We looked for winery that was open before 4pm. We were staying in San Antonio and wanted to visit Austin TX. We found this place by searching best wineries near Austin. When we 1st arrived, it looked like a little store front in a strip mall. When we entered it was a whole different story. We were greeted by Debbie and Bryan who both turned out to be extremely gracious hosts.  They have wines grown in TX and CA. The TX grapes are grown in the High Plaines near New Mexico where it is warm during the day and cooler at night. I decided to do a tasting with only the TX wines.   The TX wine menu had 5 wines for the tasting menu. Started with the Chenon Blanc (quite nice with a buttery smoothness), proceeded to the Blanc de Bois, then the Roussanne (my least favorite), then switching to the reds starting with the Sangiovese and finally to the tempranillo.  The Tempranillo was my absolute favorite.    What really made this experience so nice was the wine Ambassador Debbie. She is just the nicest person who took good care of us. She also has a very nice sense of humor. Bryan was also very nice. He helped me pick out a few stainless steel wine stoppers. Bryan gave us great restaurant suggestions for Austin and San Antonio.  Do not be fooled with the entrance on the outside. It is misleading in the size and the value you receive on the inside."

Took two of my really good friends here today both who require wheelchair accessibility and felt very comfortable in the atmosphere. The reservation made ahead time was set up easily and the communication was quick and efficient through email. They were able to recommend a table that was best suited for us all to feel comfortable. It is very rare to actually be able to talk to the owners/wine makers about their products but they were the ones serving us the tasting! It really was a special experience not only for me but for my friends that have not gone out socially since the pandemic. Thank y'all so much for the inclusive atmosphere and making it such a memorable experience, we had a blast!"

                "description": "What a hidden gem! We were sitting at home on a Friday night, trying to find something to do. After a quick yelp search, we saw there was a winery up the street and open late. We decided to take a trip and check it out.  Driving up, you start to question if you are going the right direction but just keep going.   You walk in to this office center and are welcomed to the most friendly staff and environment.  Rarely do you get to sit down at a winery and speak to the head wine maker.   What really makes this place different is the fact that they have California and Texas wines. I'm no expert, but I've been told Texas grapes just don't compare.    The prices are great, and the options are plenty.  This will definitely be the family visit spot in the future."

                "description": "Wine: Only tried one wine, the tempranillo. It was fine, not as bold as they usually are. I smelled some of the whites, and they smelled very sweet so I passed. Didn't even look at pricing because of what the snacks cost.  Snacks: wow, expensive. Tried a bunch of them with a group, overall not worth the price. Particularly the truffles. It was $27 for a teensy box of 9 pieces of terrible chocolate. Waxy texture, did not melt when you eat it, chalky, bad flavor. Dark chocolate is my fave, so that's not the issue. Who knew chocolate could actually be yucky? It came from next door, glad we didn't go there after.   Service: very good, sweet ladies.  Ambience: not good. Outside it just looks like a store front, inside is super dark, no windows, and looks like a Kirkland's from the 90s.... everything is red, has fringe, pretty cheesy. Not eclectic, just ugly and full of stuff."

                "description": "Living in Austin, this winery is located in our backyard. It's nice to be able to drive just 20 minutes and enjoy a good glass of wine, and meet the people who made it. I now have a place for out of town guests just spending the weekend to take a sip of Texas wine.  They focus on creating quality wines sourced from Texas and California grapes.  They do not blend grapes sourced from the two states together.  When you drink a bottle of Texas sourced wine, it is 100% Texas, and vice versa. Bent Oak has been around for about 3 1/2 years, and from what I have heard they are starting to find their stride.   When you enter the space, you will walk through the front gift shop to the back tasting room and production area.  They have gone to amazing strides to make a warehouse space homey. It feels like a Texas hill country family home.  We were warmly welcomed, and they even let us take our three well behaved dogs into the back area to sit and enjoy a tasting with us.  Everyone here was friendly and knowledgeable.    I was pleasantly surprised by the consistent quality of all their wines available to taste.  You can taste up to five wines from their menu.  The Blanc Du Bois was one of my stand out favorites.  There wasn't anything I didn't like on the menu.  I am not a fan of Chardonnay's but their California sourced Chardonnay was good.  Their reds were a bit young, but the Mourvedre from the Texas High plains was tasty and my favorite of the current options.  Medium bodied but with spicy fruity rich tones.  The Sangiovese was satiny smooth, but just needed some time.  I actually enjoyed their Texas wines more than the California options.    Clearly there is a reason why their wine club membership has a waitlist.  It's just a great group of people to hang out with.  It felt like being with family, and enjoying a great conversation over a nice glass of wine.  They are located next to Delysia chocolates towards the back of a warehouse area.  Wine and chocolate neighbors?  Yep, it's an amazing pairing."

                "description": "Viva El Gaucho!  This place is legit. I came here with a Porteno, someone from the capital city Buenos Aires. They attested to the legitimacy of the place- it even looks and smells like Mendoza they remarked...  We tried a flight of whites, a flight of reds, and a sampler plate with Morcilla, a blood sausage, some empanadas, and some proveletta, a gooey cheesy mixture, served with some pieces of hard bread. The food was all marvelous- where else can you find these more daring types of sausages, like a blood sausage! This is authentic stuff.  The wine was amazing- loved the Malbecs. They served up 2 malbecs- one high altitude, one low, and a cabernet that exemplified the region's wine. The whites were good, but Argentina is mostly known for its red wines due to the altitude and their fruity, herbaceous deep dark red wines.  The staff was great- they had a guitar player out beltin' out the jams on their picturesque patio with a great sweeping view of the hills that surround the place. They have a big fire pit in the middle of the outdoor area, which gives everything a smoky smell, that seems to blend well with the wines.  They have lots of outdoor seating under the trees, with comfortable seats, and even little teepees if you wanna do that.  I recommend everything here. It's a fun place with excellent wine and awesome food. I wanna come back for one of their outdoor all day grilling sessions that Argentina is so famous for!"

We have been there on several occasions and always left having appreciated their wine, food and service.   We don't always do the tasting, but will buy a bottle and share it at one of their tables, either inside or out; depending on the weather.   What's great about this winery is the owners! They go the extra mile to assure every guest has a great time!   We look forward to our next visit!"

                "description": "As a native Argentine and a veteran in the service industry I couldn't find a single fault in our visit to El Gaucho. This is going to be a long review because they deserve a long one. Let's begin with the service. We were 12. We asked a million questions before even arriving. Then we arrived and we drove our poor server crazy and she never lost her smile. Adrian and Mirta, the owners and chefs of El Gaucho (not the winery, the restaurant) were extremely friendly and had a smile on their face the whole time. Now the food, OMG the food!. We Argentines love meat, and we are extremely picky about the quality of the meat, and how it is cooked. Well, first of all, the meat is from Argentina so that's a good start. Secondly, Adrian cooks it to perfection. We tried almost everything. Sirloin steak, flank steak, sweetbreads, sausage, even blood sausage. I don't usually like blood sausage but he made his magic and I liked it. The empanadas were divine! I'm very picky about empanadas. I used to make empanadas and it is hard work. They make the dough and the fillings. We tried the cebolla y queso, espinaca y queso, carne; every single one of them, perfection. We were celebrating several birthdays so we asked them to prepare a cake. It was a traditional cake from Argentina called Postre Balcarce. I'm running out of words to describe how amazing the food was. I thought I wouldn't be able to eat anything else but that cake was heavenly. Finally the location. It is a long drive for some but it is worth it. Beautiful views, live music some days, an area for kids to play. The owner of the winery is very nice as well. He was walking around the tables asking everybody how we were doing. I can't say anything about the wines because I don't drink wine. Yes, I know, an Argentine that doesn't drink wine. Shocking isn't it? And I don't do the tango and I don't watch soccer (futbol people, futbol!!) except when Argentina is playing. Well there you go. I told you it was going to be a long review. I hope it will convince many people to visit this amazing place. NOTE: They also do delivery!!!"

They had a two ban band which was perfect for the setting! Great outside seating!!! We got their at 3 and stayed for a few hours because of how it was nested in the hills with plenty of trees and shade.   Great place for a date, family, kids, dogs or a glass of wine for the day. We will be coming back and hopefully have traditional Argentine bbq next time.   Suggestion: serve espresso and/or coffee"

The wines are tasty and the winery has some great indoor and outdoor seating with fantastic views, way up on a hill. Definitely go check them out!

                "description": "When we first arrived here, it was a bit confusing on where we were allowed to park as there were to signs indicating a designated place for cars - we ended up just driving all the way up the hill and parking alongside the roundabout next to the entrance of the winery cabin.   We had a reservation for right when they opened, and luckily so - it became extremely busy later on in our visit, so be mindful if you're planning on coming here that it's popular!   Staff is extremely friendly and attentive - they accommodated our group and let us even switch some tables around since we were the first there.   El Gaucho has a smaller wine list than other wineries I've been to, but they also had a food menu that was unique to others.   Provoleta ($12.50, +prosciutto $2.00): Comes out on a hot skillet plate with some slices of bread on the side. Really flavorful in provolone, obviously, but the chimichurri gives a nice addition to the dish. Felt like the addition of prosciutto wasn't worth, however.   Empanadas (2pc - $12.50): They have an option between beef empanadas, or a black bean and plantain empanada. I tried both and they were delicious in their own ways. Some people may stray away from the non-meat option, but I quite liked it! I believe they served this with the same chimichurri that was on top of the Provoleta.   Light Flight  1. Chardonnay: Their description is 100% correct, if you don't prefer Chardonnay, you might change your mind after trying this! Super light and refreshing, really easy finish. 2. Chardonnay Reserve: Huge jump from the Chardonnay - seemed to taste more full.  3. Malbec Rose: Really great end to tie the first two together, the sweetness is subtle but still noticeable.  They have a lovely outdoor courtyard/backyard patio where more seating is available, but unfortunately the day we went, it had just rained meaning most chairs were wet. I would highly recommend trying to come on a sunny day as I think it'd be beautiful!"

Honestly, I wouldn't spend the money on it, nor ever come here  again. There was only one lady working and no one helped us out at all.  They were originally going to set up something \"special\" since it was our honeymoon and it was not special at all. They were charging us $175 for literally a bottle of cheap champagne and a bowl of crackers and cheese. For what we paid for and what we got I don't recommend it at all."

This is the type of place that a group could enjoy, a wine beginner wouldn't find intimidating, and a wine snob could also find something to please their pallet. Good selection of all types, but not intimidating.  THE STAFF ARE ALL SO FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL! I was given a few suggestions from the owner, and they were all so spot on, I loved every one I tried.   Love the clean but welcoming decor, and how everything feels approachable and interactive (Glasses for sale, books, etc) and there's even some outdoor seating for those feeling a fire pit (if memory serves correctly, but the night I was here, the rain kept everyone inside).   Bring some girls, a group, or just stop by on your way home for a friendly wine bar with the coziness that makes you want to curl up and order an entire bottle and chat with folks."

It is obvious that this area needs something like this.  As a woman owned business, I am happy to see it thrive.  Deep into Steiner Ranch, I am not sure people who live outside of the area would be seeking it out but worth the trip if you are into wine and want to check out the space.  Could be a good place for a celebration.  Steiner probably has enough people to support.  Rose, white, red, bubbles and brews.  Cheese plates.  You can buy bottles to take with you with various mustards, jams, etc in their pantry. Glad I got to experience this location and wish them all the luck moving forward."

I appreciate that the wine list is ever changing and that the employees all do an amazing job with recommendations and descriptions. There is also a pretty large price range so you're able to choose a glass based on how much you'd like to spend, which is great for their range of customers. Now about the decor/atmosphere: I'd like to have my home designed to look similar to S+P. It's fun and new and modern but elegant and sophisticated at the same time. I wouldn't change a thing!   My favorite time to go is on a chilly evening. I love to be curled up by the fire on the patio with blankets (provided by S+P) and a big glass of cab with live music playing in the background. Come on! That's heaven!   Do yourself a favor and follow them on Facebook. They host great events, my favorite being Sip In SWEATS. You will not be disappointed!"

They also have some snacking plates (cheese, charcuterie) and some other treats. If you're feeling indecisive, you can taste a wine before buying a glass (I find their descriptions to be spot on and helpful), and there's usually a few wine flight options on rotation."

Also, there was a kid camp going on and children threw water guns at our table while we dined as well as crawled around by our table. Not the experience we'd hoped for. Our server ghosted during our meal and left us waiting over 30 minutes to pay so we could leave. Wanted to love this place, as it is a beautiful property with so much potential. With a few tweaks, it could be so much more."

Everyone is exceptionally helpful, they have a very comfortable tasting room, but I felt the tasting was way overpriced, so I decided to just buy a bottle of the Fall Creek Vineyards Tempranillo to drink while the rest of the group had their tasting.   They have an impressive operation and make some wonderful wines, definitely worth the stop. Cheers!"

I love coming out here for a wine tasting and enjoying the outside patio and having the vineyard to explore. The landscape is gorgeous and the staff are so knowledgeable and friendly.  Most importantly, the wine is delicious.    Pro tip- for an additional $8 you can add on an extra tasting of the ExTerra Tempranillo (usually a $100 bottle). It's amazing and a must try."

The facility is clean and the grounds are well kept. The restrooms are also clean!!!

                "description": "TLDR: relaxing atmosphere with nice white wines. Good on the spectrum of Texas wines but not on the level of French or Napa wines.  This is a great spot right across the street from salt lick. Parking lot is gravel but there's plenty of parking available. Hostess was extremely friendly and great conversation.  The wines themselves are good- we especially loved the Chardonnay and reserve wines. Based on Texas wineries, I have to say this is hands down one of the better vineyards. That being said, I have a deep love for Russian river valley wines (especially green valley pinots and Chardonnay's) and Texas grapes just don't measure up. Is that an unfair comparison? Probably.  Overall highly recommend visiting and supporting local. You'll want this on your wine tasting list of stops for sure, and best of all it's fairly close to Austin."

                "description": "Fall Creek Vineyards totally exceeded our expectations! We have been super strict about staying home during COVID-19, but my #1 birthday wish was to get out ... in a safe way. With young children. My husband called Fall Creek ahead of time and was told that kids were allowed and that there was plenty of outdoor space.   We arrived around 2pm on a Wednesday afternoon and were greeted by a super friendly and knowledgeable gentleman. I wish I had grabbed his name, because he was seriously amazing. He let us know that a food purchase was required to be served on premise, which was not a problem at all because everything looked delicious (we chose a cheese platter), and gave us a wine menu as well.   We selected our own seats and were able to stay away from the party that came in after us. Our sommelier was so knowledgeable and provided everything in a COVID-19 safe way. He was also super sweet to our kids, even though our three year old was crushing crackers on the table (we cleaned up after him before we left but it was still so embarrassing).   All of the wines were delicious. We ended up leaving with their Tempranillo, their Sauvignon-blanc (vintners-selection) and two souvenir glasses.   We spent about an hour at Fall Creek, which ended up being the total highlight of my birthday, but could have spent more time there exploring their beautiful grounds  had we not had a dinner reservation."

Of course, there is wine tasting and a variety of bottles for sale.  Fall Creek makes wines in all price points. From the quite good inexpensive wines to award-winning bottles for people who really know their reds. I am a fan of their Tempranillo.  If you are in Austin, it's worth a visit!"

My mom's in town so I wanted to take her to a winery semi-close to Austin but not too far away. ENTER: Fall Creek. It's been recommended to me by several friends so figured I'd check it out for myself:  PROS: Seriously the nicest staff in the world. Thank you Daniel! Plenty of socially distanced tables and chairs in LOTS of different areas of the winery A bottle of their amazing Sauvignon Blanc - $22! Great snacks to accompany (I got Pimento cheese) They had live music on a Saturday with a full band. swoon! Across the street from Salt Lick if you want foods  CONS: Seriously none. Couldn't have asked for a more perfect day. Can't wait to visit again!   Pro tip: go to Desert Door nearby for more fun. :)"

As a personal recommendation, if you're trying to social distance, I would suggest visiting here only during the weekdays when it's less busy, otherwise it may seem too crowded since the place is on the smaller side.  The food menu mainly consists of cheese and snacks that go well with wine but it's a little overpriced. The staff was nice but they were just there for the most part, nothing more to enhance our experience.   3/5 staff/service 4/5 nicely decorated interior and exterior 5/5 with the right company"

We opted for two full glasses of their most standout wines and although it was much more expensive wine than I'm used to, we did get a generous pour. The backyard terrace is peaceful and has many seating options. I would've loved to see an option where you could do a wine tasting outdoors, perhaps the same way you order a beer flight. I saw this because wine tastings are only offered inside."

Our 2nd stop was Falls Creek....it was so pretty with perfect sunny weather and enough seating inside and out. Covid is still among us so they offer hand santizers but you bring your own mask. Most patrons didn't have on of course once they had their wine in hand.   We opted to sit outdoors. Tables are 3-4 ft apart in some spots so choose within your comfort zone for social distancing. We grabbed a quick glass of wine and made our way to the next stop.   Looking forward to returning with the hubby this summer."

                "description": "Went to Fall Creek for a wine tasting prior to dinner at Salt Lick.  We were seated in the indoor patio which was extremely warm.  No water was offered.  We requested the tasting - 5 wines that are pre-selected, you aren't able to choose.  After the second (extremely small) pour, we had to request water.  Decided to order a couple of apps for the group..we were brought store made hummus and pimento cheese - still in the plastic container, propped on a plate with a wrapped package of crackers.  Had to request small plates, which seemed to surprise our server.  By the end of the tasting we were all sweating as the sun was beating down on us and there seemed to be no AC. The wines were okay, but the experience and service could have been much better.  I wouldn't return."

                "description": "Wine tasting was $20 for 5 small pours.  Can't select wines to try, only had 5 bottles open and only one was what I would have wanted.  Food prices were also high.  Place was fairly full but I don't know why.  Wines we tasted were fair at best.  Too many good one in the area to waste your time here."

                "description": "This vineyard was a delightful second stop on our day drinking in the Driftwood area. The wine picked by my group was light , refreshing and the perfect compliment to have after we had made a lunch stop at a brisket place. We had been feeling stuffed but this wine was so light and enjoyable to help digest our food while we enjoyed their peaceful tranquil outdoor seating area near a cute little pond. We also took advantage of their photo opportunity landscapes."

                "description": "I've had my fair share of vineyards from local like Grape Creek in Fredericksburg then to Castello di Amorosa in Napa Valley. I was embarrassed after taking my family to experience the wine tasting here. Although, some of the wine were fairly tasty, but the serving was small compared to the vineyards I mentioned in the beginning. I had never been to a wine tasting with a pour stopper that was new to me. Mind you they charge $20 per person for wine tasting. We were observing a table near us that was getting extra pour from the pour stopper technique. We decided to order 2 cheese plates ($25/plate) that came in this container after we finished it, which was a small portion by the way. We noticed that the container said \"Best By: 2/12\" we visited 2/13. So we alerted our server she politely checked with the back she was told that it meant Arrived By, which to me was odd. If it was \"Arrived By\" I think that's what they would've put on the container but I guess just to shut us up.  As to COVID capacity the patio was full we couldn't wait to leave. This is my family and I's experience I wish it could've been better."

He was very unwelcoming. We had to ask him questions he just didn't give us any information about the winery at all or the wine club. Must have been a bad friday for him.   I passed on getting a flight b/c of the wine guy. I got a glass of a red blend to go so I could shop around the square. The wine was fantastic. I was going to buy a bottle but found another place on the other side of the square."

                "description": "Barons Creek was our first stop on a planned wine tasting adventure around the square. We were greeted by our sommelier Tom, seated, and the tasting process explained. Tom provided a charming mixture of highbrow wine knowledge and light humor as he took us through our tasting journey of 5 red wines. The wife liked all of the wines, and I liked all but one (a tempranillo). Never fear! Tom is here! Tom saved the day (and the Tres Primos reputation) by pouring us an extra taste, but instructing us to first chew a chocolate-covered coffee bean before pouring the wine across that bean in our mouths. This somehow transformed the flavour into something amazingly pleasing for us both!  We also ordered chicken empanadas, which were surprisingly delicious! For some reason we did not expect such flavor and complexity from a wine bar's kitchen. The empanada crust was crispy and flaky, with a filling of chopped chicken, onions and seasonings that burst into the mouth with each bite. This was no Tex-Mex kitchen empanada. Hats off Barons! Hats off!"

They said they were open but neglected to tell us that their services were limited without reservations because of it being Valentine's weekend. We are new wine club members and felt like we were treated very rudely when we arrived. We loved our experience at Barons in Fredericksburg but would not recommend the Georgetown location. Our plan was to buy a case of the Boots wine but after they way were treated, we left our Boots behind."

Barons had more of an uppity vibe to it, so maybe I wasn't picking up what they were putting down from the jump as I tend gravitate toward a more casual atmosphere... especially when it comes to wine tasting.   They were nice and helpful here and poured us a cup of Tempranillo and Crazy Train on our way out, to drink while we walked around the square. Both good wines but did not justify the price tag for us."

The staff are extremely friendly and personable. The ambiance is cozy and welcomes conversation. This would be a great place for groups, a date, or a solo excursion. My favorite part of the entire experience was the food truck, Out of Nowhere ATX. We all ordered the Texan burger and it was the BEST BURGER WE'VE ever had!

They have a very big selection of wines and you can choose your pour by slipping in your tab card and pushing a button. Maybe I'm just old but I had a hard time figuring out where the pour was coming from and lots spilled out each time. Think they could do a better job at explaining/labeling!  Other than that, it's a fun space for a group hang or to go with a couple friends or a date.   We went on a Thursday which is their all night happy hour day and it was loud bc there was also karaoke. Again, maybe I'm too old, but it was LOUD!  The food truck in the back was open and the burger and fries I ordered were ok. Nothing to call home about but heck, it's food. Wish they had a better option to pair with the wine.  Overall, Worth checking out but personally, not my vibe."

                "description": "This is such a cool way to taste wines!   They've got over 60 wine taps and you get a little card to use at each tap. Each one is priced by the ounce so you can pour as little or as much as you like and try them all! They had a good range of lower priced to higher priced wines from all over the world.   Some of the taps were out of order when we eat but they still had a bunch to choose from.   They also have a bar if you don't want to use the wine taps. The tap room wasn't air conditioned when we went but it's a nice open space to have events or hang out when it's not too hot. It was their soft opening so I believe they plan to have AC in this room it just wasn't working at the time.   The main room has a ton of seating as well and fun games you can play or you can just sit and chat and look at all the amazing local murals on the walls as well as all the fun thrifted Knick knacks and furniture.

                "description": "I have been to this location back when it was Infinite Monkey Winery. I was sad they closed due to the 'Rona. Anyway, I am glad it is up back and running as Wanderlust.   Upon entering you can grab a glass of mead from the bar area or head into the winery to pay by the pour with your card. They have tons of wines to choose from to include sangrias. There are picnic tables inside and a small courtyard near the food trucks if you want to hang out outdoors.  They have a few food trucks on-site that will be opening soon. One of them was kind enough to pass out bread samples. I am gluten-free but my husband indulged in some delicious bread which he said was AMAZING.  Overall this is a cool little area with more to come to include a coffee place, brewery, and restaurant. I will be back for sure because the location is chill and the wine was good."

                "description": "Location #2 for wanderlust wine did not disappoint!!    The two locations are wildly different it makes you do a double take - is this the same company?? But yes - they can do all the vibes with all the great wines.   This location has a huge barn area for massive parties and events, a cozy interior, and another even cozier private room. The bathrooms are beautiful and the place, although huge, is still absolutely comfortable due to the layout."

                "description": "I live right next door to the new Wanderlust and was too excited when I learned that they were doing their soft opening. My boyfriend and I came in after dinner one night to see the new location and grab a few drinks and I can definitely say that we'll be back. The wine isn't on tap just yet since they're still finishing up construction but there's still plenty of options and the staff is eager to help. We spoke to Ashley at the bar and she was amazing, she told us all about the building, the wines, events, and what was to come with the space. Not only was the wine great but the atmosphere is just unmatched. The building is decorated floor to ceiling with murals and graffiti art from local Austin artists. I can't wait to come back when the whole package is together!   COVID Precautions: Masks are encouraged and hand sanitizer was provided."

                "description": "Love the art deco! Variety of areas to seat, including a room with artificial grass. Large room has many picnic tables with transistor radios and manual typewriters adorning them.   Excellent selection of wine and sangria. Provides a great opportunity to try a variety of regions of wines that you would be unable to do in a restaurant setting. However, it is expensive.  I had less than a glass and a half and spent over $20.   There are 3 food trucks, but they were closed when we were there (Sunday).  This would be a great place for a group event or just a large group attendance (that happy hour people forget to RSVP for--this is the place to accommodate them!). It is so spacious in the main room.   Parking is an issue.  It's only available on the street: so carpool or rideshare."

                "description": "Came here on a Tuesday, where it was extremely dead (maybe 15 people tops) and despite an awkward ambiance we had a good time! First off, the space is fantastic - huge lofted ceilings, seamless indoor/outdoor (perfect for COVID), visually interesting seating and art. The indoor portion comes loaded with comfy couches and armchairs which I can appreciate! A fantastic venue that I'm sure would've been much more vibrant during peak hours.  The service is great, really enthusiastic and knowledgeable sommeliers accompany with a great playlist. The wine selection here is decent, definitely a more robust and diverse selection than the downtown location.   Great location for large groups or a birthday party. Would totally come again (albeit on a busier night)!"

                "description": "This spot is like the original Wanderlust (put a credit card on file, and you get card to swipe for different wines on what is essentially as a pay per ounce buffet). With this buffet, you're paying more for the nice items, per ounce, though.  This location is larger, though, and more artistic both in the decor and the fact that they have performers there. Additionally, they have a larger selection at this location vs. the original location. That said, while it's a larger selection, there's less variety. At least when I went there they didn't have margarita-inspired wines or mead. If you loooove wine, then, this is the place for you (or if you're looking for a more creative atmosphere), but if not I'd recommend the other location."

                "description": "We finally made it to the Wanderlust location on a Tuesday, ahead of leaving for a vacation, as were looking to spend a day just relaxing near home and day drinking. There are tons of choices of wine, and even more places to sit and relax! The staff explains the process to you, but after our first visit, we definitely realized there could have a little better thorough explanation, and notation made about the happy hour each day. My husband and I each received our own card for pours, even though we were on the same tab, so it's VERY easy to lose track of how much you are spending collectively, because your card only shows what YOU have spent so far. The choice to have small, medium and large pours is nice, because even though each wine has a description, you just don't know until you try it! There are several food truck options, but they don't open until later in the day. There are also some mead wines, and some non alcoholic options inside, as well as games to play! There are also dog-friendly areas and water bowls, which are always a plus for us!  Our only complaint was the staff; we arrived just after their posted opening time, but the door was locked. We walked around back, called out to anyone, and got no response. We left for a bit and came back and it was finally opened. We inquired about it with the long staff member after she finally appeared, after about 15 minutes of waiting, and she seemed to think we didn't know what we were talking about. And as I mentioned, the explanation was not very thorough, and we had to wait another 10 minutes to cash out because she kept disappearing. We chalked it up to an one-off thing, and let it go, but it was still quite strange. I would think busier times might be better!"

                "description": "The inside of wanderlust is so creative! This location decor has a graffiti, gritty feel? They also play a lot of hip hop/ rap which is not only refreshing but gives this place an authentic feel! There is only street parking at the Shady ln location so keep that in mind! Once you arrive you receive a Pour card that you can use to access each tap. They have white wine (Chardonnay, resiling,etc) and red wine varieties. They don't have food but there are separately operated food trucks! Overall I think the wine is a bit over priced but love this space for studying, exploring a creative outlet or chilling with a few friends. It's a VERY quiet space. There's outdoor and indoor seating. I will be back sometime I hope they host comedy or spoken word here... seems like an appropriate venue!"

                "description": "It's a little complicated pouring the tap in the beginning. But once you get the hang of it, you're in! I like the added perk of having a taco truck outback. The interior space is luxurious, and the outside sitting space is reminds me of a barn. You get the best of both worlds. I come here for the sangria, usually on tap #61 and #63, but by the time you're reading this, they may have changed the drinks. This could seem a bit pricey unless you go during a happy hour. When it's not 50% off happy hour on certain days of the week, then an average day will have 30% off from 3pm to 6pm."

We were seated directly under the sun and I requested to be switched to shaded area its was 95 degrees out, I was asked to go downstairs and ask to switch table and was told I have to go back in line by Ashley. We waited for an hour to get our table.   The white people seated in the same spot and they just switched tables right away, with no trouble. We stayed where we are seated by the way. This place is a big joke. Food were also just ok and overpriced.   Thanks to Thomas our server, the only good thing that happened with our visit.

I wanted to experience the nature side of Austin.   The Oasis on Lake Travis was the place for us to venture out too. My brother said he had not been to it before, but wanted to try it.   To my surprise it was something grand. Absolutely gorgeous views of the lake and the more upscale houses Austin has to offer.   My brother and my parents had had a bite to eat prior to coming here, but I had not. I went shopping a the Domain and they had gone eating. From what I have heard, The Oasis is good for drinking, but not so good for eating. Their food is honestly sub par at best.   We ordered some drinks and chips and guac for the table. But I wanted something a little more in my stomach. I got the grilled shrimp tacos. They were good. But I have definitely had better. The only thing was that they were super spicy. I was not expecting them to be that spicy. All of a sudden my tongue was sweating and I was uncomfortable with that.   This is a must stop for the views. The views are outstanding. But the food was not the best. The mojito I had was strong. It was like one sip and I was already feeling it."

It has always been amazing, and they have expanded it considerably since the fire. The outdoor decks are sprawling, so many places to take in that view. And y'all, it had the absolute most stunning view of Lake Travis.   I just lost my father and was in need of an escape and some fresh air. Today I brought my dad's convertible mustang out (I MAY have gone kinda fast) to have lunch on this perfect blue bird day. I definitely felt his presence out here with me.   My server was so friendly and had the best customer service. I really enjoyed her serving me. I ordered a swirl margarita and chips and queso which were delivered quickly. For lunch I had a mixed fajita with steak and shrimp, refried beans and the fixings. Food was delicious.   I love the art they have installed around the restaurant. Really gorgeous bronze sculptures and we'll appointed gardens.   Thank you for a perfect experience."

The area has changed so much since I was here 20 years ago, it's almost like a little city around the restaurant of stores and even what looked like a little hotel and parking garage.    Anyways the view was of course amazing, known as the sunset capital of Texas, it def lives up to that, we even were able to see a plane land in the water to watch the sunset which was really cool!  As for the drink! I had the tropical depression which was sweet and fruity and perfect for the atmosphere! We both ordered the fajitas and I'm going to say they were some of the best fajitas I've had in years, quality meat like actually real skirt steak in nice sized strips with great quality thick chicken breast strips! Queso was great! Salsa was great! Chips were great! I really couldn't have asked for anything to be better.   Don't always go by the reviews is what my moral of the story was because you might be surprised!"

The restaurant is surrounded by shops like coffee, ice cream, clothes , candies, photo hub and a lot more. BUT the most magnetizing place here is the view of the lake and the sunset.   Food: The food was not that special but became one because of the view and people/person you are with. Honestly if only the food we rating here, I'll give 3 not bad but not good as well.   Also expect long wait/line for the restaurant. While waiting we roamed around so we didn't really got bored. There's lot of shops and artist that offer their services like, caricature drawing."

                "description": "The Oasis is great for outdoor dining and has an amazing view of Lake Travis, especially during a sunset.  A couple of weeks ago, I visited Austin for a quick weekend getaway.  A small group of us came out for lunch and we didn't have to wait long because it was an early lunch and the weather was a bit cold.    PROS:  Even though the water level was a bit low, the view of Lake Travis was AMAZING!  Make sure to sit outside to be able to enjoy the view.  During the summer, it's worth it to make reservations during the sunset to get the most out of your experience.  The wait staff are super friendly and are attentive to all your needs.  CONS:  I will echo some of the other reviews on here and say the food is mediocre Tex-Mex at best.  We ordered the shrimp tacos, fish tacos and beef fajitas.  The tacos are decently seasoned, but the rice and beans are a bit bland and the dish overall was a bit cold.  The fajitas did come out nice and hot and the meat was seasoned well.  I will definitely be ordering the fajitas for the next time.  The drinks and desserts we ordered:  an Irish coffee, the Fantasy Chocolate Cake (which is a flourless chocolate) and the flan.  The Chocolate cake was surprisingly delicious while the flan was a bit too thick for my liking, but the flavor is really good.  The area surrounding the restaurant also has eclectic artwork to look at as well as small retail shops to explore.  Due to Covid each store has limited hours so you may want to call ahead to see if they're open.  Overall, it's a great area to sight see in Austin.  Especially if it's your first time."

                "description": "The Oasis on Lake Travis is one of those tricky places where you have to average out the good with the bad to get a good idea of the place.  The good:  No question about it, the sunset is second to none, awesome views, awesome picturesque scene, and just about all of the outdoor seating has a great view of the scene. An additional positive, is the parking.  Easy to get to, plenty of free parking for the complex they are in, and even has valet parking if you prefer not to walk the 100 yards to the restaurant.  The not so good: I don't want to say the food was necessarily bad, it was just mediocre Mexican cuisine with a relatively small selection compared to your normal Mexican place.  To go along with the mediocre food is a price of about 1.5-2x what you would typically pay, but again you are here for the view not the food. The service also was not bad, but I think \"nonchalant\" would be the best way to describe it.  So the real question, would I recommend it? Yes I would but just go into it with the right mindset that you are going for the view, you are paying for the view and you will not be disappointed!  I would probably not go back if I am in Austin, but I am glad we went once."

Food is pretty basic so just know you're paying for the view. The drinks might be another selling point, but I didn't have any.    In short if you have out of town visitors and want to Wow them take them here for the view. That's about it."

But you gotta deal with the hoard of madness and the service is VERY VERY slow. 90min for a table and 60mins waiting for the food to come out of the kitchen.

                "description": "Came here on a Sunday morning when they opened at noon, and there was no wait time. Sat upstairs with a nice view of the lake, however b/c it was a square 4 top, only 2 people had the optimal view. I wish they had those half moon booths, so everyone could have a good view.   Ordered the salsa, queso, and fajitas (chicken and beef) for 2, which was plenty for 4. The food came out very quickly, but there were times we struggled to flag our server down for other requests. The salsa was very runny, and the chips were broken up. I wish there would have been more whole intact chips. The queso was tasty. The meat was a bit dry. Beans were good, but rice was a bit too \"cafeteria\" in terms of flavor and texture. The grilled veggies and guacamole that accompanied were good though.   Overall, you come here for the super touristy experience. I've heard the sunset views are unbeatable!"

We weren't hungry so we decided to just get some chips  and salsa and a couple of drinks- which we were able to enjoy on the deck as the sun was starting to set. It cost about $50 for our two drinks and chips, but we were sat quickly and had drinks quickly after ordering- it's a beautiful place to grabs drinks and watch the sunset and enjoy the beautiful view."

Having said that, the food quality is pretty good and the service has always been good for me (though we are admittedly only there for weekend lunch service since we always have kids).   My shrimp tacos were well flavored and a good (yet not overflowing) portion. Menu wise they could definitely work on their beer selection - need more craft beers and some varied selection of beer styles."

                "description": "Very pleasant addition to the downtown scene!  This is a perfect place to house an expanding personal collection of wine.  First and foremost a wine storage facility grown into a tasting lounge and concierge service.  Vine Vault staffs a fantastic sommelier, Nicole, who is hands on with personal service and planned events.  Even more interesting is that it happens to be located in the old vault of the Bank of America building.  Inside the facility is the actual bank vault and the exterior vault door is a key piece of the decor as you enter from the garage.  Think of a cigar lounge atmosphere (sans smoke) for wine drinkers....leather club chairs, cozy atmosphere, glassware and some snacking options.  Perfect spot to participate in one of their wine dinners, host a client social hour or simply enjoy a nice bottle before dinner downtown."

                "description": "Under no circumstance should you trust this company with anything more than a $20 bottle of wine.  One of my wineries in Napa shipped a case of very expensive Cabs to me via Vine Vault.  It was shipped from Napa on 11/5/18 and received by Vine Vault in Austin on 11/6/18.  Vine Vault then proceeded to sit on the wine until I went searching for it. It was finally shipped to me via FedEx on 12/4/18, almost ONE MONTH later!  NO RESPONSE from company or managing partner, one Elton Potts. I have no guarantee that the wine was properly stored, as temperatures in Austin in November were frequently in the mid to upper 70's and into the 80's on a couple of days.  I intend to return the wine to the winery and will STRONGLY suggest that they cease using this poorly run company."

                "description": "You know how back in the day folks had a milkman? Well, I wanted a piece of that nostalgia but don't drink milk. What I do consume a decent amount of, though, is olive oil, so I went about getting myself a mOOn (yes, I did just combine man and olive oil and no, I'm not ashamed of it).   Really, I was low on olive oil and missed my window for my grocery delivery so took the opportunity to support local and explore Texas Hill Country Olive Co.'s offerings.  The website is super easy to navigate and they have a wide variety of olive oil and vinegars, along with bundles of multiple if you don't know where to start. I received my order within a two-day window during the week from Xmas to NYE, without opting for any expedited shipment, so that was a lovely surprise.  I am a fan of anything chili or jalapeno, so I opted for their jalapeno-infused OO, along with two standard olive oils just to have on hand. The 100ml bottles run $12 each, not including shipping (my 250ml that I usually get from Imperfect Produce is $4.79), so a pretty stark contrast in price. I used the jalapeno on popcorn the other night, as well as toasted bread, and it didn't really have any kick to it, which was disappointing. I was hoping that for the price, it would be a boombastic flavor ball, so I could justify its purchase and continue to patronize from my mOOn.   I am so happy I could support local, and maybe if I visited the estate, I would have a better appreciation for the product, but as a stand alone, I most likely won't be ordering again."

Doest seem like the olive tree orchard is producing enough olives for more than a few martinis! We were greeted kindly at the door but there is really nothing to see here. We were expecting an opportunity to sample some of the products before purchasing but no tastings were offered or on display. So we are back to the fact that you drove here to enter a gift shop. Hmmm  p.s. I see after reading reviews thst perhaps large trees died last winter which is sad. It also appears that tastings are offered here but the kind lady who greeted us did not mention them sonperhaps they are scheduled or have been stopped for covid so check before you come so you aren't dissapointed like we were."

Supposedly the owner picks the grapes and they have a few types of wine that gets made somewhere else. Can't tell you how it is since I didn't feel like purchasing a glass or bottle. They don't do wine tastings anymore although there is a sign out front.   Their olive oil and balsamic vinegar was tasty on fresh bread. The flat bread was just that... flat. To a crisp. The margarita flavor meant some cheese and basil but not really any tomato flavor. Wouldn't recommend the flatbreads. It was a good idea but poorly executed."

                "description": "The place is really not worth visiting unless you're coming out for the tours. It's a gift shop where you can already buy mostly everything online to begin with. The restaurant menu is terribly overpriced for what you're getting on the plate. Think margherita pizza but at the size of a standard flour tortilla.  My recommendation is to save your money, go straight to the olive oil section in the store, buy in bulk, go home and create your own tray of olive oils and eat it however way you want to enjoy it.   The olive oils are exceptional by the way. Infused garlic, rosemary and sola stella were my favorite. If you're into balsamic, the strawberry infusion was a surprise crowd-pleaser in our house.   3/5 stars for the giftshop/restaurant location. If this was a review specifically for the olive oil, I would rate it much higher."

                "description": "In planning for our day trip, I thought about checking out an olive orchard. Years ago, I had read about Sandy Oaks olive orchard but never quite made it out to visit. On my search online, I found Texas Hill Country Olive Company in Dripping Springs. The timing might not have been the best since the arctic freeze affected the olive trees. We did see both mission and arbequina a year and a half old olive trees. Under the shade of the oak tree and a breeze, we sat to listen to Cara (one of the owners) share the history of how their family business started. With a brief visit with the resident chickens we headed indoors for the abridged version of the mill tour. Finally understood how extra virgin olive oil is made and not to ever buy light olive oil!  After the olive orchard and mill tour, we joined the tasting tour ($10). There were so many varieties of olive oil and balsamic vinegar and flavor profiles similar to wine tasting. I loved getting to combine the balsamic vinegar with the olive oil and tasting with the bread and apple.  It was fun shopping at the store. Goodness with making choices though! I knew I definitely wanted their olive-based products.  Next time we'll have to stay and enjoy some lunch."

The staff was friendly and informative. We even walked into the olive grove to see the baby trees up close. The Sicialian olives with garlic are amazing. We also bough feta cheese olives. The caramel sauce we bought went great with Frederick peaches we bought on the way home. We also had some delicious Gelato which was cold enough to take to go."

                "description": "This was our first visit to Texas Hill Country Olive company. The employees were very friendly and explained the ordering process. We were able to snag a couple rocking chairs on their front patio and enjoy the beautiful weather. The Salumi plate was one of the more interesting charcuterie boards I've ever tried. The cheeses were on point, some sharp and others soft with herbs and spices. It could have used a bit more jam and crackers overall. The view off the porch was worth the stop itself. Would definitely recommend trying when in the area and I'm sure a tour would be fun when the trees are in season. I was disappointed they didn't have olive oil tastings going on due to Covid, but I also understand."

                "description": "This place is heavenly!  You feel like you have been transported to Tuscany, the scenery, the smell of the food and olive oil when you enter the place is divine.  I am in LOVE with this spot.  I went last week for my Birthday with Brother and Sister-in-law.  It was wonderful.  The olive oil is probably the best I have ever had, I ended up buying a bunch of olive oil after lunch.  We sat for two plus hours, eating, drinking and just enjoying the scenery.  We were so incredibly lucky because the weather was amazing, and there was a beautiful breeze so it was cool and comfortable.  We had a variety of different sandwiches and anti-pasta...everything was to die for!  I can't wait to go back.  What an incredible GEM."

All of the oils and vinegars sounds amazing, but decided to try the blackberry balsamic vinegar. All I can say is wow!!! The blackberry flavor is strong, sweet, and so natural. I can't believe how amazing it tastes. I can't wait to go back and get the basil infused olive oil and the strawberry balsamic vinegar next!"

                "description": "Touring the olive orchards was so much fun and an unexpected stop on our visit to the area. We've always wanted to do olive oil tastings and orchard tours in Italy, so were happy to find this until then. Unfortunately, due to the pandemic they aren't doing tastings at the moment. You can buy all the oils, as well as many other foodie items in their store. They also have a bistro with a nice menu, we came after eating lunch so didn't get to try anything. We tasted a few wines and thought they were okay, a little too acidic for our palates. The highlight was walking through the orchard and seeing the olive trees. I'd like to come back before the olives are harvested."

                "description": "This was such a great outing for a Saturday morning! We did the orchard tour which was ~45min of walking around the olive trees and learning more about the process of growing and processing olive oil, as well as the different varieties. Our tour guide was great - very friendly and knowledgeable!  The tastings are cancelled due to the CORONA restrictions but we had a lovely lunch in their shaded outdoor patio. Highly recommend the olive oil and olives platter.  Speaking of COVID, great to see everyone wearing masks and the business itself enforcing the regulations. Felt very safe walking around and eating there.  And, of course, we couldn't leave without purchasing some of the delicious extra virgin olive oil and balsamic (which is not made there but commissioned from the special region in Italy).  Would highly recommend, especially if you have friends or family visiting in town. It's a short 40-50min drive from Austin."

You have to be a member of their club to be enjoy that.   However, despite this, you won't be disappointed you made the trip. The suburbs are approaching but there is enough open area on the drive there to make it relaxing. They greeted us as new visitors with a tasting of their Cuddles Cuvée, light and refreshing. We decided to get a couple of glasses of wine and sit outside. They have cheese plates available too. Their Chardonnay and Red Blend were very good."

                "description": "Be aware that these people do not do anything without a reservation. They were nice enough to seat us but it was obvious there would be minimal service. The staff present were quite nice, just busy. We were allowed to buy wine to self serve on the back porch and were welcomed to be inside the tasting room or outside which was near the vineyard - very nice out there.  Their vineyard was planted in 1999. That may be a little unusual for the immediate Austin area. The vines and the grounds are very well maintained.   As far as the place, it is beautiful. It has the feeling of Napa but with Austin-area live oak trees.  The property borders Lake Travis though it is barely visible from the tasting room area. There's an exclusive members only area that is on the lake.  We purchased the Claros Reserve which is a Norton grape (hybrid) and is the grape grown on the estate. The wine was surprisingly excellent and cost $35.   I think that, with a reservation, this would've been a superior experience."

The property is absolutely gorgeous - I mean you can truly just sit and relax for hours while you take in the stunning view. I had made reservations but we arrived a tad bit early and Liz was happy to accommodate us sooner. I'd like to take a moment to offer my sincerest appreciation for Liz as she made this experience so memorable for us. It was our first proper wine tasting and she truly took the time to explain every single wine to us - notes/scents to look for, best food pairings, explaining the difference in textures, where the grapes are from - I mean the whole nine yards. She even showed us the safer, beginner way to swirl the wine to really delight your senses before tasting. I had added a cheese board to our reservation which we thoroughly enjoyed! Liz was patient with all of our questions on the wine (and cheese), had a wonderful sense of humor, and just a lovely personality to deliver a phenomenal package of customer service. Every single wine we tried was delicious! We took home a bottle of Claros but we seriously wanted to take home one of each. If we weren't relocating soon, we would 100% have signed up for their membership. If we get to visit the area again, we will definitely stop in. I highly recommend visiting!"

We were staying at Horseshoe Bay Resort and were deciding between several vineyards to try in the area. I'm really glad we ended up trying Stone House. We decided to sit on the patio for our tasting. I tried the classic tasting and my dad tried the reserve tasting. The wines were mostly from Australia. They had one of their house wines on my menu. I thought the quality of wines was very average. We also got a cheese board which was really good.  The area was picturesque and we were allowed to go down to an area for wine club members. They had an enclosed outdoor area for members only with a view of the lake.  Overall, if you want to go to a vineyard with great views, this is the place to go."

She welcomed us and gave us a nice toast of something bubbly and told us about the vineyard and its owner, Angela. The wine of the month was Angela's Wish. I was having a particularly emotional time with it at this point because my beloved grandmother, Angela, passed away recently and had wanted to visit this area. I, of course, had to get the wine of the month so I could keep that bottle. I told Jaramy of my grandmother and the significance of the name of the bottle and she listened with an open heart. My group also got a nice charcuterie board and sat outside. Though it was pouring down rain, we still had a lovely time conversing with others and enjoying the view."

When I visited Fredericksburg, I went to multiple wineries and this was BY FAR the worst. The employees have no manners, and don't treat you well regardless of your membership status. My friends and I felt uncomfortable and judged the entire time we were there. Overall, there are much better wineries in the area with much nicer staff and better wine. Don't waste your time or money when there are other amazing options less than a mile away"

Jennie's ability to know exactly what we wanted before we did was truly enjoyable and her knowledge of wine and friendly professionalism made for a great Saturday outing.  Have been to both the Grape Creek Vineyards near Fredericksburg and to the Georgetown tasting room.  Each are excellent, but the Georgetown location with its wonderful staff are the reason we keep our coming back."

                "description": "Conveniently located on the Georgetown Square, Grape Creek Vineyards tasting room is a welcoming oasis of great wines and friendly \"tasting ambassadors\". You know Grape Creek's wine is good: they earned almost 2 dozen medals, including three Double Golds, this year at the prestigious San Francisco Wine Competition. And their wins encompass all styles, with Double Gold wins for red, white and Port. My Tasting Ambassador, Sandy, was exceptional! As we talked, she discerned my tastes and made a couple of recommendations that turned out to be spot on. She was knowledgeable and responsive, and a delight to talk with. Having been to many tasting rooms and wineries in the Texas Hill Country as well as from the California wine regions to the New York Finger Lakes, my experience at Grape Creek exceeded my expectations. Highly recommended!"

My friend is a wine club member and invited us to accompany her and her significant other to a tasting. We ended up enjoying a bottle! It was delicious. We sat in the reserved section on the second floor and finished the bottle and relaxed. Grape Creek has a nice selection of local wines to choose. Although the facility is small, the atmosphere is friendly and quaint."

                "description": "These guys are extremely rude. We all purchased memberships and wanted to enjoy our wine on the patio which was mostly empty. Since they made us split up our party of six we got two tables that were close together. Apparently management had a problem with my girlfriend and I orienting our chairs towards our friends table so we could all talk to each other and came and got in our faces to tell us we have to turn our chairs around and face forward. What is this kindergarten? The wine was alright, but definitely not good enough to justify the $40 per bottle price tag. I've found better bottles at HEB for under $20. Don't waste your time or money. There are plenty of other wineries in the area of the same quality that are more affordable and less rude"

                "description": "Grape Creek is my official go to for Georgetown vino. After signing up in Fredericksburg, I've quickly come to LOVE their red wines...particularly Bellisimo. It is absolutely delish and my go to red for my collection and for gifting to friends.   While the main building itself is somewhat small and doesnt offer the option to sit downstairs (GC....this is overdue), there is a members only room available upstaird with views of the Gtown Square.  The patio however is the reason people gravitate towards this winery. There is live music, nice fans to keep you cool in summer and heaters for the winter.  My only dislike is the changes hours...it closes at 6:30. Far too early and down the street are alternatives that stay open til 9 or later."

                "description": "Could not love this winery more. Although... standing in line when you first walk-in did seem a bit off, it was merely just a way to help usher traffic through more efficiently. Luckily, the line went quickly or this would probably be a different type of review, as someone * wink wink* who doesn't do well with lines for absolutely anything, except that one Prince concert 30 years ago.   Needless to say, we came, we tasted, we joined the wine club and now we are big fans. Especially of their Rose of Malbec. That deliciously tasting watermelon jolly rancher (without the sugar) wine has changed wine drinking for me and completely justifies the $30 price tag."

I decided to join the wine club because of her level of service. However, it's hard to get a hold of someone on the phone. I have a simple question to ask but no one will ever pick up the phone. When select the button to speak to the tasting room, their automated service starts all over again. Yes, I can email, but for a simple question, picking up the phone should be an easy option as well.  Also, the times on yelp versus their times on the phone are inconsistent. That needs to be updated.  Bottomline, they lack communication.  It's really annoying and frustrating. I plan on canceling my wine club membership and going elsewhere due to the experience that I've had."

                "description": "This winery is smack downtown Georgetown and has a really great feel. It has a great assortment of wine that is reasonably priced. I really like this winery, with the exclusive access to seating upstairs. I love the live entertainment outside lounge area. I really like this winery! I also like how EVERY time you come to the winery, you get a complimentary glass of wine! Of course, you need a membership.  I don't live in the area so I have a trek to make to receive my complimentary glass of wine for me and a guest. However, when I am in the area you better believe I am here. I just started my membership last visit but failed to write a review after a couple of bottles. My apologies. I was informed that my three bottles qill be mailed to my residence in Harker Heights, Texas. I will be sure to post how that goes. You can cancel the membership at anytime. More to follow after I really get a chance to experience this establishment."

She started jerking things away from the table while we were still sitting there. We had previously been sitting there calmly, not being loud or offensive in any way - it felt very abrupt and extremely rude. We realized after we were booted out that closing was at 5 and this intrusion happened at 5:10, it wasn't like they were waiting on us for an hour. Even though my friend is a member we won't be coming back."

My sorority sisters came to Georgetown for Austin's ACL Fest and added on extra days to sightsee.   Grape Creek was a wonderful respite.  You stand in line, describe your likes to the salesperson, and taste. Then, you get wine by the glass (I think it was 10$/glass) to enjoy on their relaxing patio, and bottles to go.   My BF is a frequent member and has a card to get 2 free glasses of wine a month.   A very nice spot to relax and enjoy good wine and good conversation.   Thank you Grape Creek Vineyards!"

All my friends are getting Ethyl Ambrosia for Christmas, and those who have already received theirs are clamoring for more! Their tasty, vegan, alcoholic shots are a hit in 4 flavors (I'm partial to the rosé).   Give these a try and you'll be sold!  They're perfect for events or just kicking back at home. And their patent-pending twist cup makes shots classy."

                "description": "Our group scheduled the Real Austin Tour. Our guide, Nick, was great. He was at the meeting spot early, he was friendly, and did a good job getting us around the city. The tour was mostly driving with him pointing out different sights and areas of interest. I think the best way to describe it is getting an overview of the major hangout spots/areas, being familiar with where they are and what they offer.  He had some good recommendations for food and music venues, which we appreciated. I'm not sure we would have missed any of the areas explored on the tour (6th street, east Austin, Rainey, south Congress). It's still nice to be able to focus on taking it all in and looking for interesting places while someone else is driving though. There are details and trivia that he provided that would be missed as well, had we gone on our own."

Our experience with Jax, Ruben and Evan was great. They all know so much (interesting things) about Austin and their enthusiasm left me wanting to stay longer to learn more about this great \"weird\" city that I've grown to love. We rode around for two hours with 2 other couples in a van and it was perfect. The time flew by. I didn't want it to end. I would've loved hanging out with Jax, Ruben and Evan all day. Jax even treated us to gelato at one of her favorite food trucks in Barton Springs. How sweet was that!! We definitely will return someday to Austin to enjoy all there is to enjoy. Thank you, Jax, Ruben and Evan. It was a great pleasure meeting you all...truly!!!"

If others are saying good things about them, then it's probably worth trying. I signed up  the Real Austin Tour the night before and got an immediate confirmation. Their website says \"a city overview in just 2 hours\" which was perfect, but with a little mishap and trouble with parking, it ended up being around 2.5 hours. The van was roomy and clean, and a nice component of the tour, well, because less walking. I can imagine during the hot summer, the van with a/c would be the preferred way to tour around the city.   The tour took us through many neighborhoods and major sights around Austin. Enough that, I went back to many of the stops to explore further. There were many interesting facts pointed out and of course, the scary stories and legends make it all very fun and a bit silly. Stopped off at one of the cupcakes food trucks for a tasty treat, all included with the tour. If you're in Austin, this is a great little tour to see many sites in a short span of time."

Jason loves what he does and he is a real people person. A trip down South Congress finished out our day with all the fun facts from our personable guide. We had the best day ever!!!

                "description": "The drive is as peaceful as the landscape is serene. Like everything in and around Austin, there's a sense of \"for now...\"   And that's why Vista Brewery is a smart play. It may be a drive out of the way now but soon it'll be right in the middle of everything.   Hopefully not too soon...  On a cold, sunny day, the grounds are a welcomed sight for adults and kids alike. The two buildings are new and impressive but not imposing on the landscape.  Now, the beer. The stouts were quite impressive. They were smooth and strong with a distinct personality. I tasted three of their stouts, loved all three for different reasons. My wife had a couple ales and was equally impressed.  The food was acceptable but not something to write home about. I feel like they could take it to the next level if they brought on 1-2 food trucks but I get that may not be in the cards for now.  All said, it offers something for everyone and you're bound to leave happier than you came in."

                "description": "Really like the venue and that they've completely opened back up. Looks like a great spot for a group event or private party.   Dog friendly. Plenty of parking. Seating inside and out. Small menu with plenty of Biergarten faves.   Just wasn't digging the beer this time. We did a couple of flights and sampled 8 different brews. The Blonde Ale was okay. Hubby and I both liked the Destination IPA. He likes the Dark Skies. Overall, the beer was a little off. Maybe next time."

                "description": "Wonderfully off the beaten path.  I absolutely loved the modern space inside but also the very rural outdoor space. Wonderful areas for kids to play and adults to chill. Lots of great beer options for everyone no matter what your taste is. I tried the Everything is Aussome - an Aussie sparkling ale. It tasted a lot like an IPA to me. I may have expected it to be a bit lighter in taste but still a great bold flavor. Great for groups, family picnics, or just a fun day out to relax. Definitely worth the stop in the area."

Food offerings were always a bit comically small before the pandemic, but delicious, now they're just overpriced and not very good.  I miss the friendly staff, seems like they cycle through staff pretty regularly now.  It's a long drive and probably not worth it  these days.  This place used to be the absolute best.  The beer was epic.  Such a shame."

                "description": "This brewery should be on everyone's stop if your going to Salt Lick just down the road. Stopped here on Friday night and caught the tail end of their acoustic live music set which they happen to do every Friday night. They stage by far is the best set up I've seen In the area under a natural oak tree with twinkling lights scattered above. Could easily see this place being a great wedding venue. They also had a nice little hiking trail where there's additional seating and a kids playground located further down. Now let's talk about the beer and the brewery. The brewery is huge and has a nice modern approach with a little Texas flare. As far as beers I ended up trying a flight and by far definitely grab a Barton creek gold on a hot summer day. If your looking more of a full bodied beer destination ipa would be my choice. Can't wait to come back here once the weather starts to cool down."

                "description": "I haven't found another brewery on the level of Jester King, but Vista brewing got the job done. It has a great location right by Deep Eddys and Salt Lick BBQ, which allows you to make a nice day trip out of it.  Starting with the service, my party and I were seated immediately and were served. For drinks, we ordered  1. Adair 2. Zwickled  All the beers were excellent, especially the Adair.  For food, we ordered  1. Pretzel  2. Brisket Sandwich   The food was also great and a lot better tasting than other breweries, for sure. I did think it was interesting to have brisket pastrami cold, but it was still solid.   Overall, I will definitely come back to the spot because they have great food and even better beer."

We were looking for a tap room, since Texas doesn't let you buy beer beer before noon on a Sunday.  Vista has a huge outdoor seating area and they have a real good beer menu. I got two IPAs. They had snacks you can buy as well and I got a beanie and they had stickers if you ask.  Very nice people at the bar and lots of COVID appropriations were in place. Their free was was super good as well!  A really great place to try!"

                "description": "Came here on a Saturday evening, was pretty easy to get a reservation and their patio had tons of open space. They did a great job of enforcing masks when people aren't seated at their table and made it easy for us to keep distance while in line.   Their beer selection is very diverse, so I opted for a flight in my first round. I was pleasantly surprised they allowed you to include their more expensive barrel series in the flight which made the 4 4oz pours for $12 a great deal. While those were tasty my favorite was the dark Pilsner, for such a dark beer it had a more mellow, malty flavor than you would expect.   Food wise it was fairly typical brewery fare, but the $1 hunks of watermelon really hit the spot on a hot August evening.   If you're looking for a brewery a little outside of Austin to escape the city for an evening I'd definitely recommend checking them out!"

There is something there for everyone including the wine lover, most of these breweries only cater to brewing beer but Vista also has a good selection for wine. They always have cool food trucks with tasty items to round out A wonderful visit that you won't forget anytime soon. It also has a wonderful playground for kids and a band that's just the right amount for a venue like this. Bring your friends your family you're out of town cousins because this place is all that and a bag of chips."

                "description": "Vista Brewing is one of the Breweries exempt from the new closed bar order (during Covid19) because of their food to alcohol  sales ratio.  We were excited to make a reservation for a special occasion and were assured (by way of Facebook messenger) that their \"kitchen was open and ready for business\".   We arrived, ready for some good beer and food.  First disappointment:  Their reservation check in system.  A chalkboard sign indicated a table for to-go order pick ups and simply an arrow for reservations.  No employee to greet, direct or be helpful.  2 employees filling to go orders as we stood in what we estimated to be the 'reservation' line.  Several people were behind us when 2 young women cut in front of us and said loudly \"Will you take walk ins\" and to our astonishment they got an employee's attention who completely ignored us and helped them get a table.   Very rude!  Once we were checked in we found a table in the shade and went to get our  beers and food.   Disappointment #2:   No food.  Only popcorn and a cheese plate.  That was it.  We told them we had been assured over messenger that their kitchen was open and they shrugged and said  \"Don't know what to tell you.  It's being renovated.\"     I can't understand how they are allowed to stay open with beer and POPCORN sales as food, under the Governor's new restriction.   At this point we already had our beer so we went back to the table to make the best of it.  Disappointment #3:   the amount of flies and mosquitoes. We go out to another \"farm style brewery\" frequently and have never had an issue with flies or mosquitoes like we did here.   Maybe it's one brewery using a spray service vs. not?  Maybe it's dog poop from being a dog friendly brewery (although, so is the other farm Brewery we go to...)  We had 4 mosquito bites while sitting there and this was at 5:00.  Flies were insane.  It was a disappointment all the way around as we had really been looking forward to several hours of relaxation, beer and food out under the trees.  Added on 7/11:  I have not changed a word of my original review, however I am adding a Star based upon the great communication I have had with one of the owners, Kent, who wrote to me after my original review.  He seemed genuinely interested in my feedback and responded in a very thorough manner."

We love sitting indoors and outdoors depending on the weather and like that we have that option. They have live music on weekends and the beer/wine selection is good.

I didn't realize the current menu is because of covid. The sandwiches were all cold. The pimento cheese dip was good but hard because it's also cold. Literally everything came out of the fridge as they handed it to us.   It was a terrible first impression. I understand it's covid, but I think they could've at least heated the sandwiches or tried to make some better food that can be packaged.   Great venue. Not sure I'll come back."

Plenty of seating in and out.  lots of room for the kids to run about and having a great staff about was wonderful.   only ding was the coordination / distribution of food.  Basically they ran out for our guests, and well, there is nothing you can do about it.   Events are hard to plan for, especially with family and kids, so we will work with them next time to better handle the food service / serving.   The beer was good, the wine selection was pretty good.   What i liked the most was the atmosphere. on a cool evening, with the stars out, it was a great place to be to unwind and chill with friends / family.    Plenty of parking..   Finding the place...well, thats tricky.  See punch in the address in Google Maps, you will be ok, just know that when you get close, slow down, and know the entrance is on top of a hill ... so you can miss it if you are not paying attention.   will I go back: of course, and I would recommend you go and visit."

                "description": "First time ever at Vista! Also first draft beer (not Crowley/growler) since beginning of lockdown. Such a great spot.   COVID: Vista has a GREAT outdoor area with plenty of tables distanced from one another. The ordering process specifies 6 ft of distance in line. Hand sanitizer is everywhere. Beers are delivered in single use cups. They have also started their live music Fridays again where you can venmo the artist tips. Masks are required everywhere but at your table.  You can make a reservation on Open Table for their outdoor area. Currently, they are open until 8PM.  We brought our own chairs and a blanket to use as a tablecloth. We also brought our own glasses to pour the beers into. I love beer out of a glass so this was a need for me.   Overall: This brewery has a ton of good stuff going for it. It's a little out of the way for Austinites (40 minutes), so you've got to make a night out of it. We're generally bigger IPA fans, so there are a few breweries we would check out ahead of this one. BUT they still have a ton of great beers on tap, and it is so worth checking out."

I came across it while searching on Reddit and made the best deduction of having dinner there for my 28th birthday!  Our waitress was the NICEST person I've ever met. Super kind, didn't rush, had great recommendations and allowed my boyfriend to surprise me with two little cakes.   Everything on their menu hits the spot but I got the fettuccine dish and my boyfriend got the penne vodka (which he claims is the best he's ever had). The drive is a bit long from ATX but 100000% worth it.  I will be visiting back when the weather is nicer to also enjoy the vineyard next door"

                "description": "Ordered to-go. Person answering the phone was delightful and friendly. I ordered the Daily Special Mahi Lupo. The vegetables, broccolini, tomatoes, and artichoke had a very nice flavor. However, the brocollini was served without trimming the huge stalks which were too thick to eat so you really didn't get much brocollini. The bread was stale. The oil for dipping was great. The mahi was disgustingly undercooked and slimy. The fish didn't flake, it slithered. If they fire grilled it, it jumped out of the fire real quick and was almost alive. I tried to nuke it for a minute but it just didn't work. I spent close to 50.00 for a meal I mostly couldn't eat. I love the setting, the villa feel of the place but I can't spend that kind of money for a bad meal. To-go orders are even more important to get right than in-house since there is no chance to replace it or remedy anything. I am a sushi fan and can eat raw fish, but this was like nothing I've ever seen. I prefer my fish dead before I eat it. Come on guys I pay you guys to catch the fish AND cook it for me!   Sorry, my picture are too big for Yelp and I am too tired and disappointed to try to fix that."

                "description": "This place is really great for date night and a good glass of wine. I came here on a Saturday around 5pm which was extremely busy with kids everywhere. I had the Brussels sprouts as an appetizer and they were way too salty. The main was the risotto which was so interesting with the garlic probably wouldn't order it again but it was flavorful. The service was so slow but he was extremely friendly so we appreciated the service. I would dine here again in the summer for a glass of wine in their outdoor area."

                "description": "Had a great dinner with my partner the other night at Trattoria Lisina. We didn't have an appointment but were able to grab a table right away.  The driveway was hard to see coming off the road but I suppose this is due to the \"dark sky\" community. Albeit, Some extra signage would be nice.   We ordered meatballs as an appetizer and these were delicious! The garlic toast that comes with this dish is soooo tasty!   Focaccia and oil is complimentary, wish the bread was softer and less greasy but it was free..   We split the taglierini portofino. It was the right amount! The scallops in the dish was perfectly cooked, the shrimp may have been over seasoned but the lemon butter slightly cuts the seasoning.   Over all, We spent about $80 for our meal and 3 drinks.  We were pretty satisfied! Thanks for the great service and delicious Italian!"

                "description": "We brought food from here to a table outside the winery nextdoor.. with wine from the winery. I think this is your best bet if you're looking to eat and be away from crowds (for COVID).  I have to say all the food was good. The linguini was my favorite, followed closely by the mashed potatoes. The breads (focaccia and garlic) were each tasty, i could eat that focaccia all dayyy.  The lasagna was good, a bit heavy for me, though.. but what do you expect with lasagna!  I'd probably skip the Caesar salad next time..  While not my favorite Italian food ever, the grounds are beautiful, and it's a great place to bring a date or some friends and have a picnic style meal with some wine ;)"

                "description": "This place is a visual feast--a beautiful building of European flavor with a substantial Vinyard nearby, surrounded by beautiful oak trees, and beautifully maintained gardens.  While it is not easy to get to, it is the only gourmet restaurant I know of that accommodates helicopters.  (We arrived by car.)  We have met Austin friends here several times and the food has always been excellent, but we all agreed that it is now even better than we had remembered it from pre-covid days.  Warm bread came early with a plate of olive oil and herbs for dipping.  The antipasto plate and the fried calamari were both excellent, with a spicy dipping sauce.  Our friend loved the pasta dish with sautéed scallops, and the 8 ounce filet that my wife and I shared  was the best of our eight decade lifetime.  We will be back again and again."

                "description": "Driving to Trattoria Lisina from Austin is always a fun field trip out into a totally different part of Texas. No traffic, windy two lane roads and there you are, in a vineyard in the middle of nowhere. I'd have never guessed a place the size and class of Trattoria Lisina would be nestled in hill country like this.  The inside felt distinctly Houston/Dallas vibes: much more corporate and big scale than a little mom-and-pop, but in a good way. Nice and air conditioned with plenty of space too. Now for the food:  The focaccia they serve with garlic/herb olive oil is OUTSTANDING. I could have eaten it all night, so so good. Like fools we ALSO ordered garlic bread. The garlic bread was toasted baguette slices that were burnt and dried. No bueno. Also: how is one bread item the best thing on the menu and the other maybe the worst? Strange, but anyway, don't get the garlic bread when you have garlic oil and bread in your lap, overflowing. The calamari was ok but the entrees were amazing. The osso buco was SO TENDER and so full of flavor. It came with a little marrow spoon and was a huge portion. My husband got the crispy duck with polenta cakes and cranberry salsa and he was a big fan too.   The service was so nice and sweet and the setting was beyond stunning. I really liked my time here and would definitely take guests when they visit too!"

                "description": "First ever dining experience at Trattoria Lisina.  We we did for a special occasion, a \"mile stone birthday.\"  We drove 1-1/2 hours to get there!  Let's start with negatives (which I don't normally do!).  The most expensive menu item, aside from the bottle of wine, was a pistachio encrusted red snapper filet.  The fish was 2x over cooked, and was tough as leather.  The main problem was it's a filet, skin on, blood line still intact.  As a seasoned Gulf fisherman and chef, I know you need the blood line cut out of the filet, even the fishing guys on YouTube get that.  Great piece of fish, tough to cut even with the knife provided.  It's not all about presentation.  Issue raised with waiter (Joseph S), and \"he could have the manager come over to discuss.\"  As a waiter, when the dish is bad, take it away and redo!  The craft cocktails were OK, not worth the $14-$15 price tag.  The star of the evening was the calamari fritti, which was great!  Fresh, hot, tartar and marinara sauces were on point, terrific.  The veal osso buco, the best in TX, by far!  There's something about fresh bone marrow!  Dessert was the tiramisu, which was awesome, until James S added to the bill.  Overall, Trattoria Lisina is a \"destination\" restaurant, but for the $$, it's not worth the hype.  Enjoy one of the Mandola locations in ATX, the food is better and the price tag is 80% less ..."

We were able to taste several different wines before we decided what we wanted to make. We spent about 1-1.5 hours there. We look forward to designing our own wine bottle labels and returning in 6-8 weeks to bottle the wine."

You can customize your wine label and they print it for you to put on the bottles.   You can bring your own snacks and get a bottle to enjoy.   I would highly recommend everyone to try making a batch of wine at water to wine. They make great Xmas gifts too."

What a fun tradition we want to continue!  The staff here is outstanding, they have great thought, and make you feel comfortable.  We had some neighbors at a different table order food in and  thought that was hilariously brilliant!  You are definitely recommended to buy a bottle as all winery's usually do, but this spot doesn't make you feel pushed to - which makes me want to buy another bottle.  I love that this is tucked away in the city and you don't have to go to the city limits to do a wine tasting.  I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this to any and all of you!"

We were sad when the Round Rock location closed down, but found this place to be a million times better. The decor is cute and thematic, with tons of inviting spots for seating, whether you're looking for a romantic spot for two, or some couches for a larger gathering. The best part is the staff - super friendly and helpful while we try to make the tough decision of what to drink or take home. The free samples help too!   Making our own batch of wine is a yearly tradition for us. We get together with friends to start the wine (which of course involves a good time trying the different wines first), design our own labels (or get help from W2W), throw a gathering to bottle the wine, then have bottles to hand out as wedding favors, Christmas gifts, or generic gifts.   We are club members, so we stop by at least monthly for a couple glasses of wine and to pick up our bottles to enjoy at home. Whether you're joining wine club, making a batch, or just stopping in for a glass or two, Water 2 Wine is a fantastic neighborhood gem. I only wish they were in my neighborhood!"

I spent two afternoons sampling bunches of them and all the staff were generous and enthusiastic in helping me find which wine I wanted.  Then, you make an appt for conception.  It's fairly simple  and pleasurable.  Again, you can grab a glass of wine as you work, mixing the juice and water and yeast in a giant white bucket (Carboy), churning away for about 10 minutes and then your part is done for about 6 weeks!  The rest of the staff will ensure that your baby gestates comfortably and appropriately, testing its ph and sugars until its ready to be born.  Then the magic happens.  As the parent, you'll have full creativity in naming your baby.  In which case, you can pick any 3 images you like, decide the wording and color scheme and font of the label, email all that to Jenny and she'll print out the most perfect labels.  You can then invite a bunch of friends to witness and help in the birthing.  You can bring in all kinds of snack ems and the fine ladies at Water 2 Wine will immediately ply your guests with tastings of their wine and you can buy bottles (and bottles) to facilitate in the birthing process.  Everyone in your party can try their hand at filling bottles, corking bottles, melting the lid foils, and sticking on labels.  In the end, you'll have about 30 bottles of fantastic wine ( I recommend the Gruner!) to share and take home.    They make for fantastic house warming, business, wedding, new baby, Christmas, Hanukkah, etc gifts.  In fact, if you decide last minute you'd like to adopt a wine baby for Christmas, they keep a bunch already made and ready to label for your Christmas party or gifts.    Best thing was, our friends had so much fun and it was such a new experience for all of us that we WIN again as the hostess with the mostest.  And, even though I had grand plans of using this wine at our housewarming party, I doubt it'll last another 8-10 months so we may indeed make another baby next year.    Jenny and the rest of the staff really made this so much fun and interesting with all their cool contraptions and accomodated me with the music I wanted (got to have appropriate Edith Piaf wine birthing music!) and never left a wine glass dry in my group.    So grab your partner, in life, in business, in crime, and get to makin that baby! They're the best kind of babies, they don't puke or shit or cry and instead of causing you stress, they relieve it.  And in the end you'll have the coolest collectible bottles."

You can also bring your own appetizers to come sit and enjoy while tasting some delicious wines."

                "description": "Water 2 Wine has taken your normal wine drinking experience and given it a unique spin by providing you the keys to the winery and letting you become the vintner. You make your own batch of wine, create custom labels, bottle it, and best of all, taste the fruits of your labor. By having you do this work on site they are able circumvent certain regulations resulting in less sulfites and other chemicals than store bought wines.  I have been visiting Water 2 Wine for about five years and actually created a batch with my wife and we gave the custom bottles of wine away as gifts at our wedding. The gifts were a hit.   Water 2 Wine imports their grapes and juices from other vineyards. This is not uncommon for vineyards in Texas as most don't grow enough grapes, if any, to meet their own demand. When you decide to make a batch this is where you will start. You will mix the juice, and depending on the type of wine you are making will add flavors like oak.  After you make the wine it will go in the back room for fermentation where the staff will guide the wine along over the next six to eight weeks changing containers around six times.  About two months later you will come back and bottle your wine. You add your label, fill the bottle, cork it and shrink wrap foil around the top. Like a good chef test tasting food a lot of quality assurance goes on during this process. This is a perfect event to bring along a group of friends. Hopefully you end up bottling more wine than you drink.   You don't have to make wine. Water 2 Wine is also a spacious wine bar, with a large selection of wine, where you can stop in just to drink some wine. All of the wine is made on site by the employees. They don't sell food but you are welcome to bring in food to eat with your wine. There are plenty of tasting options or you can buy by the glass or bottle. The staff is very friendly and have been one of my favorite aspects of every visit."

Whether it's a glass of vino after work, a place to gather on weekends with friends or a fun place to work remote during the week W2W has it all.   I always thought you could only make wine here and was surprised to learn it's also a wine bar and retail destination.   Stop by and challenge the team to find you the perfect glass- they won't disappoint."

The wines do not have the chemicals that I don't think should be added. A wine should stand on its own!  \"Custom wine without the chemicals\"  Supremely good! I'm a wine snob as I was raised with it and also living and working around the world I was able to have some of the best wines in the world. No, I am not rich . Wines that are sent to the states are really jacked up in price and I was able to get what I wanted and bring it back. One thing I did learn is that you don't drink an expensive wine as a part of the meals but enjoy it on its own. I bought 2 bottles of Barolo to have with an Italian meal. It was a great fit. This little place has fulfilled the perfect fit! The lady who owns the place and makes the wine is quite nice and understand all of the above. I will be back!"

                "description": "I'm not a drinker.  I have a low tolerance for alcohol, and wine hits me particularly hard.  But I attended a group wine tasting here with a friend yesterday, and thus our tale begins...  I got there as the second serving of a six-wine tasting was progressing, and I was immediately struck by the smoothness of the wine that was being served at the moment, a Gewurtraminer.  Shortly after sipping that wine, I mentioned that I had almost no tolerance for alcohol.  Steve, the master of ceremonies for the tasting, told the group that Austin Custom Wineries did not add sulphites, the major cause of wine intolerance, into their wine as most wineries do for preservative purposes.  As a result, though the wines should be drunk within five years, the wines are eminently drinkable for even the lightest of weight drinkers like me.  Seriously, I can't even finish a bottle of beer (Shiner).  So I was able to partake in the tasting!  I didn't drink all of each of the wines, but I had more than I normally would have felt comfortable with (to avoid headaches), and I suffered absolutely zero ill effects.  It was amazing.    Also amazing: ACW's selection of dessert wines--ports and ice wines.  Maybe I'm just not a fancy wine connoisseur, but those dessert wines are drinkable and tasty.  And since they have no added sulphites, all I have to worry about is the alcohol content!"

While the recipes might have changed over the years, they never cease to bring a great selection out every year. The port wines have been some of our favorites, raspberry chocolate port in particular. My husband has always been a fan of their blackberry merlot. We moved north of Austin, but when ever we take a trip to south Austin area, this spot is a must stop! Don't forget to ask about their wine club too; it is a great way to sample the variety of flavors they bring out!"

We tasted 6 wines for a $10 fee.  The grape juice is purchased and then the wine maker takes it from there to make several different wines.  The server gave generous pours to ensure we tasted the wines fully.  He used 6 separate wine glasses to ensure we tasted the different wines which I thought was nice.  Most wine places used the same wine glass to sample the wines.  We enjoyed visiting with the owner.  A very pleasant gentleman.  I really recommend visiting this winery with your friends.  If you don't know anything about wine, not to worry because the owner will make sure your wine tasting experience is a positive one."

                "description": "This was the cutest hidden gem. They had cider on tap, and in bottles to enjoy there or take home. It was reasonably priced. Highly recommend the gold rush cider, we took a bottle home we loved it so much. They offer live music and trivia. You were able to walk around the premises where we thought we heard peacocks. We say a bee box on the premises not sure if they harvest their own honey for their boards but I wouldn't doubt it. I will definitely Be returning!"

                "description": "Wonderful place! We went on a recommendation while we visited family. The ciders were great, as was the food. The only issue we ran into was that we ordered hummus, and the person taking our order didn't let us know that it didn't come with bread or anything else to eat it with. Considering we had just had a conversation with her about it being our first time there, we're about to present she didn't let us know that important bit of info. Not a big deal, and the person who brought us our food outside asked if we had ordered anything to eat it with and quickly brought us an order of a baguette.  Aside from the establishment itself, the vendors selling goods were all friendly and talented, and the other patrons of the establishment were friendly as well. We struck up several conversations with passers-by.  I would definitely go back!"

                "description": "Super cute space- so much potential. The guy who was pouring our flights was super nice, we were excited at first to have finally checked this place off the bucket list. However, the ciders weren't that great unfortunately...we would've kept on drinking anyway, just probably ordering the other cider/wine/beer that they stock, not make. We were there on a very dead weeknight- only 3 other people were there, so you'd think they'd welcome more business- but we had to leave because we were told that we couldn't eat the tacos we got from a nearby food truck...if they sold food, I'd understand, and we would've ordered dinner there...but all they sell is super overpriced make it yourself charcuterie items (a whole block of cheese, a whole baguette, etc). The way we were told that we couldn't eat our tacos rubbed me the wrong way and the vibe was just sadly killed, so yeah, we won't be back :/"

                "description": "Very unimpressed with this place. This place has such potential! The set up is super cool and the place has a great vibe. It is a little hard to find and the road is a little rough in their lot. The place was completely empty when we were there. The ciders were all just okay and some were super sour and not great at all. The bartender was the best part of the experience. He was super knowledgeable and so friendly. Probably the biggest downfall and what would definitely bump them to at least a 4 star is their lack of food. There are no food trucks on site, they only sell outrageously priced charcuterie boards, and we found out the hard way, don't allow outside food. We were told after we got food brought to us that it was not allowed. We would have stayed and continue buying product had they allowed us to eat. Rather we sat in their parking lot and ate on our talegates. This place is so out in the middle of nowhere you would think that they would have better food options. They also were not very nice when delivering the news. Needless to say we won't be back."

                "description": "How have I not reviewed the kind people at this wonderful establishment yet?  I so enjoy the the solace of their old farmhouse venue. And the great ciders they serve up certainly do not hurt the wallet or the ambience.  It's so relaxing sitting at the picnic tables out among the oaks listening to your favorite band. Strategically placed fans hidden among the trees aid in making the glade that doubles as a stage tolerable even on 90º days.  In these seemingly never-ending days of the pandemic, it's also refreshing to see the servers masking up indoors and out. I tend not to venture out too much for exactly that reason, but felt totally safe here even when ordering inside the tap room.  Maybe I should keep it a secret, but it's also one of those places you want to share exactly because it is so very special."

                "description": "We love Texas Keeper Cider! Their tasting room is out a ways from Austin, but is on the most lovely grounds. They often have wonderful live music and their drinks are absolutely perfect for a Texas summer. They are so refreshing. We got one of the picnic baskets and it was full of yummy cheese, sliced meats and bread. Highly recommend!  It is worth noting, they do not have a full lunch/dinner menu. They basically have an assortment of DIY charcuterie boards, which we really enjoyed. However, if you go expecting a full dinner you may be disappointed."

                "description": "My new favorite place in Austin. Love everything about it.  It's basically the only Place I ever want to be. If you haven't been yet- get on the ball!  The cider is so delicious - nothing is overly sweet and they have a good assortment of dry and well-balanced choices. Their sampler is 9$ for 5 generous pours and is a great way to find the cider you like most. For us it's the rose, but the original is a close second. Your best bet is to purchase a bottle and drink affordably. You even get a discount when you purchase bottles to go (although I'm not sure if that's just at the end of the night - we've closed this place down a few times).   We are also big fans of the food. The carrots in a blanket are so yummy and very unique! A must-have. The curried egg salad is a go-to as well. It's made with eggs from their own chickens! They also add pickled veggies on the side which is always a win for me.   The location is so spacious and beautiful. Plenary of tables inside and out. Even a great view from one side where you can watch the sunset over the trees. I've enjoyed live music there and loved the tunes they were playing inside."

                "description": "The ciders are essentially tribute to the apple gods, extremely generously priced, and the cidery is tucked away--makes for a great escape from the city of Austin!  Came on a rainy day with some girlfriends after dinner, and we LOVED it. It reminded me of Jester King Brewery because of the fact that it felt very off-road and secluded. If you're driving at night and a little too fast you might miss the entrance, so slow down as your GPS tells you you're near. The stone cobble walkway is so organic and lovely, that it felt like we were entering into a storytale cottage. Upon entering, everything screams wood and warm pinterest vibes. The three of us sat down at their tall barstool table, and started on our flight! What prices! Normally they do 5 for $9, but they tapped out of one of the selections so we did 4 for $7! Such a great price for the variety of ciders. I loved their hefeweizen + cider combo, and the first cider on their flight list (a name I forgot). Everything was so juicy and tasty, would highly recommend coming back.   The staff is very knowledgeable, and the lady doing the taptending that night was so sweet and helpful. She trusted that we knew which selection we were on during our flight. She also told us that there are five cideries in all of Austin! So for my cider lovers--let's hit all of them up."

                "description": "I have been a long time fan of Texas Keeper Cider. I love the Tap Room, the grounds, the staff and especially the cider. The cider is dry and they make a wide variety of ciders to appeal to many palates.  They have successfully reopened the Tap Room and I decided to have my belated retirement party there. I was able to reserve a space for my large group and the staff was very attentive. If I had one criticism, it would be their food choices.  It's now a make your own picnic, and you choose cheeses, meats, and sides. It's not really a charcuterie tray, as they don't prep the plate.  The cheeses,  meats and bread all need to be sliced.  This made eating difficult with a large group. Most of my guests had to leave early so they could go eat somewhere else.  I know this new menu makes it easier for the staff, and they are a cidery, not a restaurant, but I miss their old menu.  I will still go to Texas Keeper Cider, but may not hang out as long.  (Or make sure I eat beforehand!) Overall, it's a beautiful South Austin gem."

                "description": "I don't know why it took me so long to get here but now that I've been, I'll be telling everyone about it and making return trips! If you're a fan of Argus Cidery, you'll like this place. I do think Texas Cider Keeper is making cleaner ciders than Argus (nothing was infected or had off-flavors).   It's easy to miss the entrance, but it's right next to the cemetery! The outdoor space is very quaint but all Texas and has tons of picnic tables. The tasting room is beautiful with butcher block tables and plenty of seating.   We opted for the tasting flight menu which is five 2 oz. pours for $9. Their mainstay Texas Keeper Cider No.1 is dry, refreshing and well balanced. I'm not a fan of sweet ciders, so this was perfect.  I also really liked their Grafter Rose -- which is made with Rome apples and some grapes, which gives it the beautiful rose hue. It's also on the drier side, which is nice.   Our least fave of the five had to be the Cider Weizen, which had a bit too much coriander (and this is coming from a girl who LOVES coriander and hefeweizen beers).   The bartenders were all knowledgeable and really try to give you an explanation of each cider they're pouring (a la a wine tasting).   They also have a tempranillo wine on tap because in Texas it all falls under a \"fruit fermentation\" permit. Apples, wines, it's all the same permit.   I'll be making it a point to come here more often, and I would if traffic getting through downtown and south Austin traffic weren't so bad."

                "description": "One year later I returned for their 1st Anniversary Party and release of The Grafter Blanc.  For $9.50 (w/fees) your ticket included your admission and 10 oz tulip glass (not the standard 12 oz tulip most breweries sell for $5-6). There were no drink tickets included; all cider and other offerings were for purchase only.  Certainly not the best deal in town....a town full of breweries with taproom festivities.  The Grafter Blanc is definitely my favorite of their ciders, with the perfect balance of acidity, tartness and dryness."

                "description": "Wow! So before coming here I always assumed ciders as overly sweet and flavored froo-froo drinks for those who don't like beer. I have never felt so mislead before! Cider is made from apples (no matter what the flavor), and real, legit cider is found here! It isn't overly sweet and there are many different kinds! Some reminded me of wine and a not-so-Sweet cider mixed together.  At Texas Keep there is room to bring a large group, or even the dogs or kids to run around. There is a small indoor area with games and a huge outdoor area with room to move about and enjoy the Texas sun (or stars).  The people here really enjoy and are PROUD of what they do. They are excited to tell you the story behind the names of the ciders and what they entail. They have seasonals and guest bottles and taps. Normally I would feel gross trying something out of a bottle opposed to tap, but the whole experience was so eye-opening, I didn't care. They told me their 1 bottle of (maybe a 750ml cider) has about 10mg of sugar in it as opposed to he \"cider\" I knew such as Angry Orchard that has upwards of 50mg PER BOTTLE! Yowza- no wonder they were too sweet!  I was definitely iffy about coming here since they didn't serve \"regular beer\", but I'm definitely glad I stepped out of my comfort zone- and you should, too!  Only reason it's not 5 stars- the food \"truck\" setup (not a truck just a station) was out of food by 6:30p on a Saturday night. We had ordered 1 of the 4 items on the menu for our group to try. When we went back to order our favorites, they claimed they were out of everything and turned around and took 1 more order. Annoying. So we ordered a pizza and left early to meet the delivery man at home. Maybe have more food or more options and we would've stayed until the 9p close."

We brought our dog too but he could not go inside which was challenging even for ordering. Our favorite cider is the No. 1! There was an event going on that sounded fun so we will definitely check out those options. We did not order food, just did a shared tasting. No one came outside to check on us or offer to pour and tell us about the cider which is common when visiting wineries with our dog and friends. It's a cute little spot for a weekend drive."

I ordered a red wine that was local as it is made from grapes they grow themselves. They do flights, glasses, or bottles. I split a bottle with friends and they re-corked it so we could enjoy later at home. There are also nearby breweries so you can make a day out of heading here."

                "description": "We stopped here on a beautiful Sunday afternoon and it was a lovely treat. Apparently not many tasting rooms are open on Sundays, but this one was.   They have a lot of space to spread out and it was perfect for an easygoing afternoon.    We tried two bottles based on the recommendation of the owners. It turns out she was from Houston and went to my old high school. (Go Waltrip Rams!). They also have a tasting room in Houston.   We'll be back again.  The owner mentioned that you can volunteer to help with grape smashing so that might be fun to try.   Cheers and enjoy!"

The tastings are done by reservation to limit the # of people, but the lady was accommodating and let us walk in for a tasting since the couple that booked for that time hadn't shown up yet.  Nice variety of wines. Enjoyed their sparkling and the Tempranillo the best. Very pretty property with a lot of shaded seating outside for you to easily drink a glass and enjoy a summer Texas day."

                "description": "Nice atmosphere and view, despite the lack of any healthy grape vines.   Service sucks. We sat down with a group of 9 girls when it was not whatsoever busy and were (eventually) greeted with \"hey so we can't do tastings because this is a large group without a reservation.\" We were happy to purchase by the glass or bottle, so this wasn't an issue but we were all taken aback by this greeting and found it pretty rude and uninviting. We barely heard from our waitress/hostess the whole time we were there.   The wine was just disgusting and overpriced. Of the bottles we purchased, the pinot grigio was the only decent one, which wasn't even made by this winery.   There are MANY better options, who actually enjoy and appreciate your patronage...keep driving!"

                "description": "Nice little place but nothing to really write home about. We arrived on a Saturday afternoon and unfortunately there were at least 2 bridal parties there.  It was very loud in the tasting area and it appeared they had only 2-3 people working.  They mentioned they had not expected such a large influx of people.  They did their best, but it was very hard to hear and they were bouncing back and forth between a lot of people trying to pay and split checks and do pours, etc.  Yes, the pours were very small and it was $15 each which is kind of pricey for that size and the wines that to me were very light.  I like bold flavors, not fruity and these were not bad, but not worth the price for me.  If there had not been so many people and it be so loud it might have been a little better, but we will not go back- crowded or not."

                "description": "Terrible wine. We had to buy a bottle because they used the Covid excuse when mind you down the road wineries we can do tastings or by the glass. We love big bold reds so we were guided to their 2015 Cab. Worst ever. The boxed $4.99 from CVS is much better. Wow, super disappointed to be conned into buying a $45 bottle of wine plus having to buy their \"charcuterie\" which was literally some cheese packets and nuts in a white paper bag handed to us for a total of $70. Rip off. Safe yourself the money and taste buds, and hit up Fall Creek or even Bell Springs."

                "description": "I infrequently write reviews but I feel that this deserves one. Dishonest and shady practice. went there for a tasting with some friends recently. It was our first time there. Tasting was $20 per person. Seems like the price has gone up from recent years based on the prior reviews. Not a big deal. At the end of the tasting, I bought 3 bottles. The staff came over with an iPad, charged me the three bottles plus the tasting, told me to sign on an iPad and asked for my email. She said that she would email me the receipt. I never got the receipt. Saw the charge on my cc bill which did not seem to make sense. I emailed them and then called them requesting a receipt to be sent to my email. Apparently, when they charged me, a 20% tip was automatically added by default to the TOTAL (including the wine bottles that I purchased) . Not just to the tasting. I called and spoke to them Bc I felt that this was not appropriate. I don't mind tipping on the service but on the wine bottles that I am purchasing to take home?? I was pretty much told by the staff tough luck. I have been to many tastings in the past and this was definitely new for me. It's not the end of the world but it's the principles..you know. Definitely will not be back and would not recommend to anyone."

The woman, Lauren, who walked us through our tasting was equally as sweet, friendly, and knowledgable of all their wines- which were delicious. Very light reds, European style. So if you're into more California/west coast style wines, it'll be a bit different for you. If you're looking to do a large party I'd recommend giving them a call in advance to help set up for your group to give you the best experience possible. Large space, beautiful building, yet feels very cozy. Definitely a great spot to hit on your day trip through wine country in the Hill Country. (Their Sangiovese and Cab 2015 were incredible.)"

                "description": "Was out in the hill country this weekend with a friend just meandering around during our staycation. We stopped at Jester King before this and just looked for cool places nearby when Solaro Estate popped up on the map. Wine, closeby? Sold.   Since we'd never been there before, we each decided to do a tasting so we could try their 6 best wines. Their whites were crisp and refreshing, but I didn't fancy any of the reds. I usually love pretty much all reds and favor them much more than whites, so there's a good chance my tastebuds were just all out of whack this weekend.  When we finished our tastings, it was raining cats and dogs out, so we decided to have a full glass of white and sit outside to watch and listen to the rain fall on their tin roof patio. It was glorious, even when the rain got so intense that literally everyone else who was outside went inside to hide from the aggressive mist. Since my friend and I are classy AF, we were in workout clothing and makeup-less, so we didn't mind the rain one bit. It was extremely peaceful, and seeing the gorgeous rows of grape vines behind the veil of rain was a memory I won't soon forget.   I'll be back for sure!"

                "description": "I just recently moved from Switzerland, and was surrounded by fantastic wine tasting experiences.  I was nervous about trying Texan wine, but started my Texan wine experience at Solaro after having read many different experiences about the local vineyards around the Dripping Springs area.   The tasting room is located in the vineyard, which is great. I love that this is a small production place, with a family oriented feeling, and the staff are knowledgeable about the wine and production.  I guess the owners can often be found in the tasting room, but just happened to be away the Saturday we went.  They often have events, and we were enjoying one of their Saturday live music events from 2-4pm.  They have a great indoor and outdoor seating area full of charm.    For $10 per person you can enjoy a tasting of their varietals.  There was nothing that was bad, but from the tasting list, I enjoyed the Miscela Bianco the best. After enjoying all their selections, I signed up for their annual wine club, which was a great deal, and then was able to taste some of their higher quality more expensive wines, which were great.  I look forward to going back and touring the vineyard, as a benefit of being a member.  We also signed up for the grape stomping that will be taking place in the next couple of weeks as they need a bunch of people.  What a great opportunity to be part of a grape harvest!  I could have spent several hours just hanging out here. I only wish they had some food to enjoy with the wine and music.  Next time I will remember to bring my own picnic.    I am very happy to have been proven wrong regarding my concerns about Texan wine! Thank you Solaro!"

We were a bit skeptical because of its limited reviews on yelp but I'm so glad we went and tried it out. Their wine is great, their flights are customized to your individual pallet, and their charcuterie board is to die for. If you go during the summer be sure to try their peach/apricot wine. I thought it would be way too sweet for my liking but it was a great refreshing summer drink! They are located in a small development that also has a few shops, a bakery, and Nate's coffee and cocktails right next to it... and we can't forget, this place is only two blocks from Louies barbecue"

The place wasn't too crowded but they just opened in November and I think people are going to be learning about this place and packing it out very soon!   They grow grapes on the property but all the wine I had was outsourced since their weren't ready yet. They had three wines to try (white, rose and red) but will be having six very soon as their home grown grapes are about ready. I enjoy dry, less sweet wines and these were perfect. Highly encourage you to put this spot on your wine tours of Wimberly! They also have some snacks/small bites if you are hungry."

They now have 4 wines and all of them were delicious. I'm not a sweet wine drinker and gratefully none of them were sweet. One crisp white, 2 rosés and a red. We left with a bottle of the red and one of the rosés too. The property and views are beautiful. They have two decks with tables and umbrellas to relax and enjoy the wine, the views, the weather and a fabulous charcuterie platter. It is a bit tricky getting there BUT it is well worth it. Don't miss this delightful vineyard!"

The women working at the counter were all smiles and had great recommendations. They have kitschy gift shop gifts, local goods, and some snacks you can purchase. There are a few café tables inside and some chairs outside to enjoy your purchase. The wine was just fine, more light and very sweet, but the experience and service at this laid back tasting made it a worthy stop.   A must stop when experiencing the square to enhance your time!"

My friend and I were greeted promptly and given an overview of the wines for our flight-sampler. We scored a small table. This was a huge win as there are limited seats, I believe up to 25 seats. The staff checked in on us as we tasted our way thru the wines. When we finished tasting, we bought a glass of our fave wine and continued to walk through market days on the square.  Anywho, if your walking the Georgetown Square, stop in for a tasting and or a glass or 2. Cheers."

                "description": "The wife and I visited Georgetown Winery for our second tasting of the day on the square. After a more upscale experience in a different tasting room on the square, it was pleasant to ease into this more relaxed space. We were promptly greeted by the hostess, who became our server, and perused the menu of wines. $10 each for a sampling of 4 wines. Nice price, and fitting to the setting which would have been appropriate for beer as well. Neither of us remembers which wines we ordered, except for my two port samplings, but neither of us was overly impressed either. My ports were good, if extremely sweet and fruity, and the wife liked 2 of hers. She was disappointed in her first choice, which was the most expensive wine on the menu as priced by the bottle.  We didn't buy a bottle, nor would we return if we ever visit Georgetown again, but the ambience and carefree environment did add to an overall relaxing day on the square."

                "description": "Georgetown Winery is an adorable little handout in the heart of Georgetown. This is a great spot for a date night, girls night, or just an afternoon with a small group of friends or family. The actual vineyard is located in Rockdale Texas- this is just a small tasting room right on the Georgetown Square.   For $10, you can taste 4 wines. My spouse also got 4 tasting, so in total- I got to sample 8 wines. My favorite was the Big Tex which is aged for 9 months in oak. A full bottle will set you back only $24. Create price for the quality.  I also love their Viognier, I love white wines- and this was so light. I would casually sip this on any warm summer day. One thing I didn't love their fruity wines. The Blueberry and Blackberry wines tasted like they used artificial flavoring. The couple next to use was absolutely loving the blackberry, so maybe it just wasn't for me. Totally fair.   They also have cheese and crackers available. I feel like any wine tasting isn't complete without a good cheese plate. Unfortunately, we had dinner plans right after, so I enjoyed my wine cheese-free.   I absolutely plan on coming back here soon for some wine + cheese."

My friends and I have only been members of this winery for about a year, but this is honestly one of our favorite locations to consistently come and visit when we're all together.

There is table seating inside where you can sit for hours and catch up. Laurie and Heather in particular are so sweet with their service and their recommendations.

Any day of the week. And I know from experience.   I don't bother doing the tastings here - I know exactly what I like. Their unoaked chardonnay is butter and smooth. After that I move over to their pinot noir - which isn't too sweet but not so dry that I need to carry in my own water bottle. I do not drink fruit wines but my sweet lil granny does and she swears by the pomegranate and blueberry.   You can buy gifts and chochskies here. I always like to pick up a few bottles of wine before I had home to visit family. Their wine club is probably the best you can be apart of in terms of benefits.   I would really like if they would provide bread so that we can try the olive oils. Probably smart that they don't do that or else all of us winos would use that as food. :)"

                "description": "My friends and I went on a wine tour for our friend's birthday party the first weekend in August and it was great!   From the beginning stages of planning, Francesca, (the owner, planner, driver, etc.) worked her hardest to make sure the event was personalized for our group. Fran was also very quick with correspondence and letting me know important information and what she needed from me.   We decided that the Wimberly/Dripping Springs tour was the best route for us since a lot of people had already been to Fredericksburg wineries. Fran picked us up at 9am in Round Rock (she'll work with you on your pick up/drop off site) and she drove us around in an air conditioned mini tour bus! Did I mention that the bus is BYOB?! We brought on our own ice chests and bags for snacks which was great for the 45 minute trip we had! Fran also has a DVD/CD player on the bus but we brought our own speakers for our iPod. She also had tips on wine tasting and a map of the wine country for us to take a look at on the road.   We went to three wineries and an olive oil orchard. It was so hot outside for the olive oil orchard that our group decided to leave early but the rest of the wineries were all inside and all of the staff at the wineries were so nice and informative. One of our friends even bought a case of wine from one of them! Remember to bring money with you in case you fall in love with one or more of the delicious Texas wines that you have to buy a bottle or two!   Fran also arranged for our group to have Saltlick bbq plates for us at one of the wineries! Our group pre-ordered either turkey, chopped beef, sliced beef, etc. We had our sandwich with potato salad, coleslaw, beans (the best beans I've had in awhile), extra delicious seasame seed bread, extra bbq sauce, Tiff's Treats cookies, Sweet Leaf Tea, water, etc. etc.! It was a lovely lunch outside at the winery. We were all so full! But all of that came in the price of the tour! Fran even got us a deal with a cake-maker and we had a birthday cake waiting for our friend along with candles to surprise her!  Fran and her business associate, Melinda, were with us during every tour and let us know when we needed to move on to the next winery. They really made sure we that were ok and having a great time. They even had patience to take pictures of us with our multiple cameras.   We all headed back around 4pm and returned safe and sound (and still pumped up from the awesome day) around 5pm. All in all, it was a great day! Fran really has a great business and will personalize tours for all types of groups. She's very professional and you can tell she takes pride in what she does and will go the extra mile to make you feel your group is top priority! We'll definitely be going back to try more tours with L'Avventura Dolce, especially when the weather cools down! Great job!"

The experience was everything I would want in a day trip - fun, relaxing and informative. Francesca is the outfit's owner, and is also the engaging tour guide. Her commitment to customer service is stellar. She also donated a portion of the day's proceeds to Love-A-Bull, which made the trip extra special. The experience was so positive, I wrote a review about it here: https://chantellewallace.com/2014/02/12/hill-country-wine-tours-with-lavventura-dolce"

                "description": "I'm torn writing this review.  We booked their bus for a winery tour for my bachelorette party, and they unfortunately ruined it (really by no fault of theirs...but still).  We were scheduled for pick up at 1.  At 12:30, they called to say that their bus broke down and that they would be an hour and a half late.  At 2:30, they finally showed up in an old, dirty van.  My group and I were squished together with all our things, and what's worse is that we couldn't really see or talk to one another.  The speaker system rattled and was distracting.  Also, since the wineries close at 6, our tour was cut drastically short, and we had to rush.  We also had someone who had to leave early, so in turn, had to miss the entire tour.    The only redeeming quality was the excellent customer service of the company.  Both the driver and the owner were truly wonderful and apologetic.  I know that these things happen, but I do think that having an acceptable backup vehicle is important."

Our host guided us on a tour of the Christmas lights in Wimberley, TX (at the EmilyAnn Theatre which was 9 acres of amazing holidays lights - one of the best light displays I've ever seen in my life) and in Johnson City, TX.  My friends and I had an amazing time, as did the rest of the bus based on the jovial environment (laughter, singer, and a showing of \"The Christmas Story\") created by our host and bus driver.  L'Avventura Dolce's Christmas Light tour will definitely be one of my new Christmas traditions.  Hopefully, other special events are in store for the future.   Cheers!"

Our tour guide, Ray, went above and beyond to make sure we had the best experience possible.  We stopped at both the birthplace and childhood homes of LBJ before visiting the Ranch, where we toured the home he and Lady Bird resided, we then spent a couple hours in the quaint German town of Fredericksburg where we enjoyed lunch and a little shopping.  Then a quick stop at Luckenbach Texas, where they were having a food truck festival and live music.  We were impressed with this tour and encourage others to give it a try.  Thank you again Ray for making it a great day!"

We only had Wednesday available and made that very clear. My husband was unable to get a confirmation we would be credited or not charged.

However, I'm giving this a one star because on the shuttle while performing karaoke the staff allowed a white passenger to say various racial slurs on the mic without immediately removing the woman away from the microphone, they didn't even attend to condemn or stop her. At the very least they could have stoped karaoke or stopped playing songs that allowed people to say those slurs so loudly and confidently. As the only black person on the bus it was extremely uncomfortable and dealt with inappropriately. Don't plan on ever using their services again."

We ended up being forced to wait until 5 PM before departing and missed a good portion of the concert we were being shuttled to.  Additionally, we were separated from the rest of our group who had boarded the 3:30 shuttle seconds earlier. The concert began at 5 PM. It was clear that passengers who had booked later ticket times were given our seats on the 3:30 PM shuttle instead of us.   Upon departure from the concert, the bus location changed several times which caused a ton of confusion amongst the passengers.   To top it off, repeated attempts to reach out to Tour Austin to remedy the situation have failed.  They have continued to ignore my emails regarding the issues but seem to be able to still send me emails asking for a Yelp rating, so here it is...  Update: owner has reached out and refunded tickets"

They were very patient and answered all of our questions, did not rush us and gave us time at the various murals to talk about what was the story behind the mural as well as some local gossip! They were easy to engage in discussions about Texas, history, places to go, etc... we were looking for a street Art tour but we actually got so much more... the tour traversed the city so we got the flavor of how different each neighborhood is. They were very knowledgeable about music venues, restaurants and bars ... well worth taking this tour. Marty and Bette, NY, NY"

He was amicable, friendly and engaging and entertained us by playing music of the artist we were about to see, Beck.  On the return trip he once again played music, this time it was classic rock tunes that we all sang along with. Thank you Ken and thank you Tour Austin, we will use you again."

I'm not too familiar with wine, so Nancy made a fabulous suggestion. The sparkling wine Naveran hit the spot!   The ambiance is chill, so you want to stay awhile. She has beautiful local art decorating the indoors and plenty of outdoor seating. There is also lovely music playing in the background, and just a friendly place! Will definitely make it a must visit spot on trips to Wimberley!"

It turned out to be the best decision; there was a huge event (and beautiful weather) so the heart of Wimberley was PACKED. This place is a bit outside of the main part of town and had plenty of parking, and the best part was it was not crowded. :) They've got minimal seating inside, but plenty of outdoor seating. They also have a nice selection of both beer and wine, plus some yummy snacks (like edamame and hummus!). My friend and I both opted for the wine flight: 4 tasters of wine ranging from red to white to bubbly, all great, and the staff was attentive and ready with the next pour in order to keep the cold ones cold. We had a lovely experience. I definitely recommend if you're near the area!"

This little house is full of rooms and nooks that give it a very intimate feel where you and your friends and family can congregate and feel at home. The bar is loaded full of wines and the staff here isn't shy in regards to providing you with samples and information on each of them.  I don't know very much about wine, but was able to follow along and still get an enjoyable experience out of what they had to offer here. We came on a Sunday afternoon so you know I had to try the mimosa out. Crisp, clean, and refreshing!  Be prepared to shell out some $$ as this place isn't the cheapest option, but you do get a high quality and a large amount of variety which is hard to find in Texas.  Support this local business and lets keep their doors open! Spots like this are hard to come by."

Today I did wine tasting for six dollars a for several wine tastings plus you get a cute small wine glass for free. Delightful place to take your spouse or date.  The host is very smart about the wines they sell here and enjoyed the smooth wines tastings I received. It located downtown Wimberly so you can't miss it. I certainly will visit again soon. It does cost a few dollars more but worth the fun you have visiting such a cute cosy wine store. So stop in and see what I mean .....happy wine hunting!!!"

                "description": "My wife and I went to Bella Vista Ranch for a 4th of July tour with lunch, and we found it to be terrific value for the money. There was a nice lunch from a food truck (the name of which eludes me, unfortunately) followed by an interesting talk about the history of olive oil and the origins of the Italian family farm dating back to the second century BCE. The owner explained how he established Bella Vista on the ancient Roman model and described the modifications he has made to make olives grow in Texas. Then we toured the olive orchard and learned about the different varieties of grapes grown on the property. We saw the processing room containing the \"frantoio\" or olive press as well as the vats where this year's wines are aging. We then tasted several oils as well as four glasses of wine per person. All this for $25 (the regular tour without lunch is only $15).  Oils, vinegars, wines and soaps are available for sale. These are pretty expensive (e.g. $18+ for 250ml of their basic Texas Blend oil), but I don't mind paying those prices for high-quality locally produced specialty goods. This is a fascinating day out, which I recommend wholeheartedly.  Pro tip: If you're coming from San Antonio, take I-35 instead of US 281 and the back roads. We were expecting a relaxing drive in the country, but construction and traffic made it a stressful trip. Coming back on 35 was a joy by comparison!"

                "description": "So, so rude. The olive oil and vinegar are excellent, but the experience was ruined by the lady--the one everyone complains of here. The hours on Sunday are until 4. I get there at 3:25, and she walks past me with her whiny, demanding voice telling me that they close at 3:30. Uh, wanna put that on your website as your updated hours?  I went in anyway. The gentleman doing the oil tasting was knowledgeable and helpful. He told the lady to close the gate.  You know, what a non-stupid person would do should they slothfully decide to close early since they dont work for a living.  My mother was incredibly upset by this lady's rudeness. When you run a service like this, you stay open until you no longer have a good flow of customers. Closing is at 4? Hi, if a bunch of people are coming in at 3:30 thru 4:00, you keep working. Lazy Texas people who inherited their property and think they work hard by paying others to harvest their crop and bottle it. Meritocracy, right? They are the class of people who make this state an impoverished mess.    Don't run a customer service business dependent upon people stopping by on a lark like a fascist regime. You don't get to do that. Then again, when you dont have a legitimate concern about how you pay your bills, i guess you can just work until you get bored with the whole work thing.   Go sell wholesale if you hate customers. Working for yourself does not mean you get any more freedom. You have are dependent on good will. And you don't have mine.  The lady tried to make up for her garbage attitude when i made my purchase. You know what? Have a blessed day, lady. A.BLESSED.DAY.  Tl;dr. There are other puveyors of Texas olive oil, particularly in south Texas. Do not waste your wine tasting trip here. If you want to support local, consider others who are hard-working enough to sell their products in Central Market."

                "description": "We took the tour here three years ago and had a decent experience. Customer service was nothing special but not bad. The olive oil was excellent. Went back last weekend just to buy a few bottles and there was a group tasting inside. The lady who met us was terse and short with us, and the oil lacked the punch we're accustomed to from fresh oil. It was ironic to listen to the speaker discussing the peppery flavor of the oil when it was completely absent this year. Maybe it's an off year. But one thing was the same: it's not a welcoming place at all. They seem to be put out by visitors. They really don't seem to want kids there at all, even when they are standing still and quietly listening.   We've had far better experiences, and far better olive oil, in Dripping Springs at Texas Hill Country Olive Oil. Night and day difference."

The tour and history of olives was really interesting. Definitely try the balsamic and infused oils. The wine tasting was pretty brief compared to the olive portion but great none the less. The wines are dryer, not sweet. I thought they were great. A lot of the other local wineries wines are very sweet, but I really enjoyed these! You should absolutely plan to visit if in the area."

Before I could even ask a question about the wine or olives, an employee firmly told me as she was finishing up with another set of customers that \"I don't have time to answer your questions.\"  She then proceeded to hard sell our group to pay $10 for the \"last minute\" tour. And, to add insult to injury, as 2 of the 4 of us completed their purchases, both employees proceeded to exit the store and watch us walk to our vehicle and  drive off. I will never spend a dollar at your business.  Good luck to you."

                "description": "We went here twice. The first time we went we had a group of 6 and showed up about 15 minutes before they closed. The guy there suggested we go to another place. He just didn't want to serve us so we left.   The second time we went there were 4 of us and it was in the middle of the day. While the wine is fine, the server was the single most rude person I've ever encountered at a winery. Just astounding how she could be that rude for the duration of the wine tasting. I will never go back and suggest no one ever go there. You cant drink the wine fast enough to over come they workers rudeness."

                "description": "We liked the olive oil a lot.  However... I think the \"thorn\" of this place is the owner.  He seems rather joyless in making something that could ideally fulfill the soul.  His 1 1/2 hour (yes, it's long) \"tour\" is mostly comprised of the history of the Olive, snarky political opinions, braggary of his past career in Silicone Valley, and a hatred for Texas AandM.   Not a place to take a kid. Seriously.  We sat and listened to him for well over an hour then briefly stood under two olive trees, looked at another one that was hurt in a storm, looked at the press machinery, and then did a \"tasting.\" Like I said, the oil was good. I got the impression that the lady helping in the gift shop/tasting room didn't want to be there either. Basically I was confused why this man (and his 5th wife...no lie) were running this business and opening it to the public.  I walked away a little sad that something so wonderful like successfully growing beautiful trees to make a solid product could be reduced to something so joyless."

                "description": "We were warned at great length that we could not even look at our cell phones during the tour which seemed odd when people might have a kid or babysitter or be waiting on something important from work to come through--I mean we are all adults...but I soon found out why.  Far less than an entertaining traditional tour, you sit and listen to someone talk more like a college class lecture, but with way too many rabbit trails of information that eventually make you tune out.  Like what a certain blizzard is called in different parts of the world, how accounting dates back to the Romans, etc.  I am passionate about olive oils and wine but learned too much about history and every other subject to even focus on what I wanted to know about olive oil. Or feel entertained.  The group I was with concurred.   There are 3 types of learners: auditory, visual, and tactile and the class is entirely sit and listen to one man talk for half of it then stand and listen by a tree then a press for the other half. So only appealing to auditory learners. And no audience engagement during the lecture.  At the end you actually get to see and touch. But they had no bread for us so we had to drink an olive oil and talk about it for 30 more minutes so I left before I tasted the other flavored oils as it had already been a full day of just listening to way too much info to retain.  In a very strict manner rather than entertaining with audience engagement.  And strict rules.  Obviously people tune out and begin looking at their cell phones so that's why they don't allow them.  Rather than making the tour entertaining so you dont' want to--It was in the hot sun as well so it was pretty miserable.  The olive oil was good but I've had better, it was a bit weak to me, we did the wine tasting as well and those were not acceptable to me.  I actually would recommend skipping the tour and talking to the staff as you taste the olive oil because they knew all of the information given on the tour without the lengthy side notes of things that should be shaved off for entertainment value.  And that's really the best part.    I don't think they like people very much though to be honest."

I regret not reading the reviews before coming here because everyone is saying the same thing. We did a wine tasting (which was $10) and were barely served anything. My husband and I both left this place wondering how they are still in business. The wine was super expensive (not good at all), and they have horrible customer service.

                "description": "I can't believe only 5 people have reviewed this ranch. I have been back four times now and each time come away with a little more understanding of the narrative that is offered. While I purchased my typical bottles of olive oil - some for myself, some for holiday gifts - I did also indulge in some olive oil based soaps.   The olives and oil are fabulous. I am not as great a fan of their wines. They are not awful, just not with the properties I care for, typically. The in-laws found a favorite to take home, though.  The tour is still $10 and includes the wine tasting, which is a good deal.  Bottles of oil range from $16-$27 each, depending on size.  Soap is $6.99 a bar.  They also feature balsamic vinegars (not made there) and jars of olives, which are delightful as well."

                "description": "Do not judge a book by its cover. Take one look at Jack and the humble grounds here at Bella Vista, and you'd never guess that he has olive friends he emails with back in Italy or that he can tell you all you'd ever want to know about the science and technique behind growing and processing olives.  I would highly recommend the tour - while there isn't much walking involved in this tour, my husband and I found it to be highly informative. And with Jack's red-blooded Texan sense of humor, it was a very entertaining education. Be sure to note the times of the tour (Sat @ 10am and 1pm, and Sun @ noon) since it's a group setup.   After the tour comes a tasting of several types of olive oil produced on site along with some of their balsamic vinegar offerings. While they also have wine offered, I'd recommend sticking with the olive oil - clearly what they specialize in. If you're only interested in tasting the oils/wines (not the tour), it's probably good to avoid arriving at the tasting room about an hour after each tour start since the tasting room isn't overly large and tends to fill up easily with the folks coming off the tour."

Their products are not made by them in Wimberley and when asked about that they became extremely defensive.  Beautiful place that has a lot of potential if they were friendly and cared about the experience people want from that kind of place... but the vibe is anything but friendly and welcoming.   When they started to bash a particular presidential candidate it killed it for us. Keep your opinions out of your business. Don't bother would be my recommendation."

                "description": "A hidden mecca of olives.  In central Texas.  The Bella Vista Ranch was designed as a traditional Italian family farm and features the first commercially grown olives in Texas.  And the olives I sampled are Texas size and Texas good.  Apparently the crowd favorite is the bleu cheese stuffed olive.  We sampled a garlic stuffed olive that was really good.  The ranch also offers delicious balsamic vinegars and olive oils which go for around $17 a bottle.  My lips slurped the Fig Vanilla Balsamic over and over again.  I am sure I was sample cheating but that stuff is incredible.     This is also a working winery that produces several red and white varieties plus a Natural Blackberry Wine!  Yum.  Wine tastings are $5/per person.  I think the owner has a great thing going for him and a beauty of a property. Tours of the orchard happen on the weekend and include a wine tasting for $10/per person."

                "description": "While I thought it was pretty interesting to learn about and taste boutique olive oil (as I'd never been to an olive ranch before) $15 per person does seem a little high when the actual tour is quite short and obviously the intention is that you're going to buy some stuff at the end, and all that stuff is small batch and quite pricey (understandably so.)  So it ends up  being more like $100 for two people when you include the olive oil you will want to buy plus the wine you might want to buy (some people seem to think it sucks, we liked some of it.)  But you will leave with a buzz on and some delicious olive oils!  The owners were away so their daughter gave the tour; I thought she was pretty funny and personable but there were some questions she couldn't answer but it was really no big deal (and she wasn't super long winded like the owner seems to be  but of course some people like that and some people don't.) It's also probably better when there are olives on the trees but it was still overall pretty interesting to see the different trees different olives grow up and hear some history and facts about olive oil production.  I liked hearing about the process and seeing the machinery. And of course I liked tasting the fresh olive oil, which was indeed super tasty and surprisingly spicy. Most of their oils are made from all different olives smushed together but they have one variety that's just made with one kind of olive which we got to try. They also had a blood orange infused oil that I'm now obsessed with; we bought some and later made some asparagus on the grill that had been rubbed with the oil, it was the most delicious asparagus ever! We also enjoyed the wine; we are not wine snobs in any way but we enjoyed what we had and bought a bottle just  because it's the polite thing to do. We sat out on the bench in front of the tasting room and enjoyed our wines and just had a lovely afternoon.   I will say that it gets a little hectic in the tasting room when people come in just for a tasting after a tour- I would say if you want just a tasting, don't come between 1:30-2:30 because it's going to get confusing!"

She was delighted to hear that we moved out here from San Francisco (that's where she grew up but couldn't  stand the fog). The husband is an old curmudgeon, but delightfully so. He worked in high-tech in Silicon Valley and moved out his last company to Austin in the early 90s, eventually leaving to grow olives and make wine.   it's not always the case that you visit a winery and the owners pour for you, so that was a treat. They are a very small production and a bit off the beaten path, so it was pretty quiet there too. A small group arrived just as we were leaving, but it was nothing like the bustling tasting rooms at nearby Driftwood Cellars.  The blackberry wine is actually good--you wouldn't necessarily guess that it's made of blackberry not grapes. And the other three reds we tasted were also nice."

                "description": "The olives!  This place is a fun foodie shop right on the beautiful Wimberley Square. It looks like it might have been a gas station or something at some time, but you can tell that they've spent a lot of time and effort to making it an appealing place to learn about new flavors. When I went, they were celebrating National Paella Day, and had lots of little Spanish flags everywhere. (I would've appreciated a Catalonian flag in there, but let's not get political with the paella.) The clerk patiently explained to the visitors what paella was, and seemed attentive and on the ball. The store also sells paella kits, with a dish, pimenton, bomba rice, some saffron- everything you need for a paella party!  My favorite thing about this place is all the pickled, canned stuff they have- crazy olives with wild stuffings in them from all over Texas, and some from abroad. They also have hot sauces and fun things to take home to show how we do it in Texas.  There's also a wine desk, where they'll pour you a glass of something good. They focus heavily on Texas wines, and if you ask me, the reds are where it's at. Really, the Texas red varietals of wine go quite well with Spanish food- they're similar grapes, I believe.  We skipped out on having lunch here, but really enjoyed the merchandise they had and the vibe of the place. It seems that part of it is still under construction, and they aim to expand.  Be sure to check out the real live olive tree out front!"

We walked in around 1pm hoping for a simple lunch- we only ordered one sandwich and two sides. An hour later, we finally had all of our items :( she packed it to go for us since I told her we'd been waiting so long and my fiancé had to get back to work. If they had told us about the crazy wait time before we ordered, we would've appreciated the heads up so much. It was confusing to us since it didn't seem busy at all- she told us they were understaffed. I guess that might also explain why it took so long for anyone to acknowledge us when we stood at the counter- we had already ordered but had to go back for water, napkins etc (no one came and checked on us or anything). The girl at the counter just went about her business and seemed to be ignoring us...  After all that, if the food had been amazing, that could've been a saving grace but, unfortunately, it was ...just ok? What a bizarre experience. Maybe we came at a bad time - I hope they get properly staffed soon!"

Three employees behind the counter and not one had a greeting or smile to offer.  Just blank faces.  There were four customers at one table so it wasn't like the restaurant was busy.  After asking about how ordering works, we ordered two entrees.   After about 20 minutes, one entree arrived.  We split it in half and after finishing it, another employee came and asked if he could clear our plates.  We said we were still waiting for the second entree.  No reaction.  My boyfriend said, \" could you please go check? If it hasn't been started, don't start it now.\" The employee said, okay.  Five minutes later and no update.  We decided to cut our losses.  Head up to pay at the counter. Three employees standing there again.  We tell them we are done and please take the second entree off the bill. One employee says alright and the scowliest female, who never spoke or assisted previously, says, \" it's ready now so you have to pay.\" Nope. We will not be returning. Every recent review is similar to this one and that tells me that no one cares."

It has been taken over my new owners and it had a name change, but most of what the former owners carried is still available, though some things are not; however, the new owners do offer some new things. They do offer some beers and wines, but my biggest interest is the hot sauces, salsa's, and pickles. They do offer some free samples and if you're not a chili head like me, be careful as the ghost pepper and the scorpion salsa's offer a very quick and very hot bite that will get your attention !!!!"

Recently he waited hours for me at the airport while my flight was cancelled and I barely got on a standby flight landing at 2 am. George was there to pick me up when I was completely exhausted. I am so grateful! Thank you George."

A true tour guide and storyteller. Let's add friend to the list now.  Denis was able to get us in and out of Circuit of the America's in minutes on Sunday. Whereas, on Saturday, the random Lyft drivers took 30+ minutes navigating through the thickest traffic. There is much less traffic on Saturday versus Sunday. Hats off to George and Denis of Watson Limosine. Great job gentlemen."

Understanding how chaotic it can be parking and then leaving when the event is over, we decided to hire a car service. We secured a nice Suburban with Watson Limousines of Austin. I briefly mentioned to George what we were celebrating. When he showed up to pick us up he rolled up in the Party Bus with flowers and sparkling cider along with champagne glasses for my daughter, with Imagine Dragons playing and lights going. It was so Awesome. It made my daughter's 13th Birthday something she will never forget. For anyone that has ever been to COTA, it is extremely chaotic getting to the stage and especially leaving. Normally, walking very long distances. George took all of that away for us. He dropped us off and picked us up at places that most services are unable to which put are walking to a minimum. He made our whole experience PERFECT!!! Thank you so much to George and Watson Limousines of Austin."

Two outta three of their pourers really knew their stuff and gave us background on the wines.  They provided a \"score sheet\" for notes and I ended up buying 5 bottles, all in the $15 range.  My only complaint about the tasting was there were no palate cleansers offered.  No crackers, chocolates, no nothing and after about half they all start to run together.  So we ordered a cheese plate and took a break.  For $12, not too impressed with the cheese plate.  Four smallish chunks and a few bread slices.  Meh.  But we really enjoyed killing a coupla rainy day hours here.  Get on their email list so you won't miss the next one!"

We met Marty and Tray at the visitor center and instantly felt welcomed for our BBQ and wine tasting tour!  Our group was small and Marty was very accommodating with getting us back to downtown to catch our flight home.  On the drive, Marty shared stories and knowledge of the bats under Congress bridge and the history of Salt Lick.  After our delicious meal at Salt Lick, Marty was able to get us access to the pit for photos.  Our 2 wine tasting stops were awesome.  We had enough time to enjoy each sip and take pictures of the establishments.  Next time I'm in Austin, I'll book another tour!  Thanks for the memories!"

He explained the BBQ process for various Austin BBQ establishments, which was very interesting, and also explained the wine making process. He gave recommendations for some of his favorites at each venue we visited and also ensured we got pictures. From the moment we met Marty, he was enthusiastic and had a ton of energy, so we knew we were in good hands. After the tour, he took the time to mark events in a local paper which were of interest to us during our remaining time in Austin. Marty and Austin Detours helped start our trip off on the right foot. We highly recommend this company!"

It was actually Rose's first solo tour and she was amazing at including everyone, keeping it interactive, and maintaining interest even though it was freezing. Most tours in other places just kind of lecture you but she was definitely more of an inviting conversationalist :) with Chris i was actually the only person that signed up for the tour so I got a more personalized view of Austin street art haha. His passion is obvious when he explains the stories behind the art and i learned soo much. I definitely recommend both tours because not only was it super fun but a car is the best way to see all of the random spots throughout Austin. Thanks Rose and Chris!"

                "description": "Steven was an amazing tour guide.  We took the tour on a Sunday morning and got to see the Capitol building without crowds and got around to many areas of the city with the ease of someone who knows the city inside and out.  Steven knows his stuff so well and adds his own professional level of humor to make the tour even more fun.  We found out about lots of places we will go on our next trip to Austin.  We took his recommendation for where to hear live music and enjoyed the afternoon at Saxon Pub.  After riding through various areas and get the lay of the land I was more comfortable driving around the city which was a big help for us.  I would recommend this tour to anyone traveling to Austin.  Take it early in your stay in Austin if possible.  Wonderful and worthwhile 2 hours."

I was surprised to learn new things about Austin - I thought I knew it all.  Enjoyed seeing the sights and learning the history.  We love Austin but now I realize how cool Austin is. Thanks to Bobby - he has a great sense of humor and made it very entertaining.  Even our picky teenager loved it.  We'll be checking out the other tours to see what's available.  Go, you won't regret it."

                "description": "I wonder if it's a new winery. The parking lot isn't as big as others but the space is very nice, benches and tables under trees. The inside is small because it's in a cottage so there's a sign saying one group at a time. The wines are from California. You can do a flight for $15 or a glass. We all chose a glass (8oz pour) whereas a tasting is 6 oz. loved our reds. There's a sculpture garden to stroll. Lovely place for convo. Also we tried the fat boy cheese spread w ritz crackers and it's so good!"

However perhaps I will be a bit biased coming from California and having tried some of the best wines, the wine here is not something for a refined wine pallet. It's a cute little spot to check out and try out but not something that would leave you wanting more. Sauvignon Blanc was the best choice of the flight and the others did not leave me too excited."

                "description": "I keep meaning to post a review for this winery. My husband and I visited them a few weeks ago to celebrate a recent job interview. They have only recently opened up, so we had never heard of them before and were excited to try them out. They had a very cute tasting room with nice stone that also felt very homey. The tasting was $20 and you get to try 6 wines. $20 still feels a bit hefty for a tasting in Central Texas for me, but their pours were pretty generous and you're not being served by someone who looks like a teenager who couldn't care less about your experience (like what Becker has become). All of these wines are from Sonoma. Overall, we didn't love the tastings except for the Zinfandel and the Cabernet which were absolutely outstanding, but I don't typically love lighter-bodied red wines or most reds from Sonoma. The quality is great, but a few of the prices were just slightly higher than what we can personally justify - I absolutely loved the Cab but it was $60. The Zinfandel was more affordable at $39. Their Wine Club gives you 20% off purchases which is nice, but it is a 6-bottle quarterly shipment. The winemakers are the Parmesons themselves and we had the pleasure of getting to chat with them while we did our tasting. They are a wonderful couple who were very welcoming and lovely to chat with. We loved hearing their story of how they got into winemaking. I would highly recommend checking this place out!"

We even purchased their wines for our wedding (white and red blend)!!! Highly recommend going out to do a tasting and hang out. Plus, there are tons of other places to check out for food, beer, and more wine nearby to make a day of it. Adam, the owner, has created a chill place to relax nestled in the back of the property surrounded by trees. Parking is super easy!"

                "description": "We added this place to the itinerary last minute and I am glad we did.   This location is not a vineyard itself. It's basically an outpost of the parent company in California. Based in Paso Robles, Graveyard Vineyards is a small producer. The wines offered are all grown and made in California.   We opted for the tasting. They offered 6 wines for $15. We enjoyed generous pours of 2 whites, 1 rose, 2 reds, and a dessert wine. All of them were very good! You can tell their not Texas wines (in a good way!).   The staff was incredibly helpful. They offered tastings outside and were very attentive! I would absolutely recommend stopping by if you're in the area.   If you can grab a Malbec, do it!"

                "description": "Our family was in town from CA and we decided we would go wine tasting locally and try some Texas wines. The wineries prior, all staff wore masks which was nice since we had a couple high risk individuals in our group. When we arrived at Graveyard, the outside was not impressive, not exactly the winery ambience. Once we got inside, the male was not wearing a mask (ok... fine... mask mandate lifted.... ) but he then told me I could take off my mask standing about a foot away, and I told him no I can't, we have high risk individuals. He then said to go outside for the tasting which we did. But honestly, who tells people to take off their masks or suggest they take off their masks during a pandemic? He has noooo idea of our health conditions, concerns or even has the right to even suggest on the matter. I was definitely taken back.  Once we went outside the table was just covered in pollen and debris and leaves. We were all so itchy from all the leaves under the table. Just no grooming or landscaping or care given to the on-site property. It was not a relaxing atmosphere whatsoever, as mentioned prior, a parking lot view/feeling.  The female local staff member had superb customer service, but again, in our faces pouring wine with no mask on. Out of the wineries we went to that day, this is the ONLY place where they were mask free. Although the mask mandate was lifted, we're still in the midst of a major pandemic and felt other establishments honored that respectfully. We felt very safe at all the wineries prior.   Grapes not from Texas.   Pros: Wine was good."

                "description": "Graveyard is a brand new addition to the winery community in Drip, having opened in late January. They are an offshoot of a parent winery in Paso Robles, CA. The wines they sell are all produced, bottled and shipped here from that operation. They do yet carry the entire CA inventory but do plan to increase the Texas offerings.   The wines available include a couple of Graveyard's more affordable blends - Paso Tombstone White and the red blend from that line. Both are pleasant, sippable blends at a very reasonable price point. The red was light slightly complex mix of common reds produced at the parent vineyard. They also stock Ascender, a credible Brut. Their estate Cab is actually very good- a lighter Cab with a nice effect on the palate.   The lounge itself is pleasant and airy without being pretentious. The staff, especially manager Adam, are all personable and informative."

                "description": "This review is meant as an FYI to those people who are thinking about joining the Graveyard vineyards wine club.  Graveyard expects you to take three shipments and are unwilling to cancel your membership before you pay for, and receive three shipments.  I have received two shipments and did not want any more Graveyard wine.  When I reached out to the wine club, the response was \"you are asked to received three shipments; you've had two.  Your third one is coming up.\"  I am going to be candid here.  I just don't care for the wines.  I know others like them very much.  My sister, who lives near the tasting room in Dripping Springs, loves the wine.  There is nothing wrong with the wine; I just don't care for it and I think two shipments is enough to make up my mind.  I conveyed my feelings to the wine club manager and her solution was to downgrade me from a 12-bottle shipment to a 6-bottle shipment.  I really don't mean to knock Graveyard.  But my suggestion is to buy a case of wine and try it before you join the club.  I want to emphasize that there is nothing wrong with the wine; it just does not align with my tastes."

It was a relaxing time playing checkers and sipping wine under the trees, though. Our server was wonderful and covid-safe. Unfortunately, one staff wasn't wearing a mask, even inside, but we didn't have to deal with him much. We really enjoyed the wines. I know they are based out of Cali, but it was still nice to get a decent sparkling wine at a Texas vineyard. They were all good, but that was a nice surprise."

But I assure you that the majority of the participants were there to have fun and Texas Winos absolutely delivered above and beyond.  The ride was super smooth (enough to accommodate dancing ;), the interaction and entertainment was perfect. We had a glitch with the sound system, but Anthony was prompt to solve getting a speaker from the other bus!!  The food was very tasty, I think maybe presentation was a bit relaxed (it was served as take out i.e in aluminum foil containers)  but the flavor compensated for it. One of my guests had almost a 5 hr drive back after the event, so Anthony gently reminded everyone to be conscious of the time.  So as I said, top choice for our bus audience and dynamics. And on top of that,  he's a great dancer!!!"

At every winery we tried over 5 wines (all kinds)!!! The bus ride was smooth and fun. Checking in before getting on the bus was great. They were on time for everything. Everything was well organized! So looking forward to another wine tour with Texas Winos!!"

He made sure everyone was present and accounted for before we left each winery. You could tell he enjoys his job! Our bus driver Tanagay was amazing the way she maneuvered that bus into the tiniest of spaces!  The wineries we visited.. Mendelbaums,Tejas, FatAss and Vinovium were just so beautiful, fun and so so friendly! Each winery had a rep that made us feel so welcomed when we arrived. The fresh Italian meal was amazing and so delicious! I will definitely book again in the near future!"

                "description": "I've been on two Texas Wino Tours so far with very different experiences!   2018: First tour I went on was a couple years ago, we had a great time from beginning to end! Bus ride smooth and seamless. Tour guide was awesome and energetic. I left this first tour thinking \"I'll definitely come back!\"  2021: This second tour was ROUGH. We went for my Bachelorette party for a wine tour out to Fredericksburg with a timeline of 11:30 - 6:30. Within the tour we were supposed to to visit 3 wineries, and Luckenbach.   Sadly, the bus driver ruined the experience by getting lost almost the entire day. Not only was she directionally challenged, but she drove like a NASCAR driver trying to make up for lost time; causing many people to become motion sick.   She somehow took a wrong turn in the morning, then we hit traffic from a wreck up ahead (I understand second part not her fault) we did not arrive at the first winery until 1:30pm. Stayed for about 40 minutes, then onto the next.   Second winery was great, had a BBQ lunch, atmosphere awesome and laid back. Stayed for about 1hr 15 minutes.  Third stop was to Luckenbach, we visited for about 35 minutes, then it was back on the bus at 5:15pm.   This is were it got a little crazy. Bus driver took a wrong turn and started going South, somehow ended 10 minutes North of San Antonio, then we were lost out in the middle of nowhere with no cell service.   It started to buzz around the bus that we were lost, and it took an 1 hr and 15 minutes before our tour guide even said anything over the intercom about us being lost!! Everyone was so annoyed because the tour guide proceed to say we could make it to the third winery even though the winery was about to close. (We would only be able to stay for 10 minutes) At this point it was 6:45pm already well past when we were supposed to be back in Austin.   Get ahold of this, we did not reach our drop off location in Austin until 7:50pm. At that point we were on the bus for 2 hrs a 15 minutes just riding around Texas.   Out of 8 hrs with them only 2.5 were spent outside.  It was sad to spend my whole Bachelorette party (especially on a beautiful day) on a Bus with terrible old music on replay, travelers in a bad mood, and everyone wanting to go home. :("

The road trip there was very beautiful however finding the parking lot SUCKED!! Our truck 4WD barely made it down, I do not recommend going any further if you have a small vehicle because the lot is NOT paved.   The wait wasn't too bad. If you get stuck at the end of the line I recommend taking umbrellas!! There is limited seating on the bottom, so if you get stuck sitting at the top it's better to be safe.   The burgers grilled were delicious, the staff was friendly and funny and the music was pretty good.   Overall a very fun experience.   Ps. One toilet per boat and it's tall and nasty"

                "description": "On October 27, 2019, I went on a Boat Bash tour with some of my Yelp Elite Crew, \"The Plus Ones\" (an event created by us not associated with Yelp in any way). We spent the last warm October day on a two-story party barge out on Lake Travis. On this tour we were able to sit back and soak in the sun.  This tour is BYOB so there was no shortage of beverages that my crew and I enjoyed. The vast majority of this boat tour, we were docked, which I did not expect.   Boat Facts:  This is a 4 hour boat excursion.  This boat offered a slide at the top of the boat for those who wished to slip and slide into the waters of Lake Austin. Float Noodles are afforded. The boat is Bluetooth compatible so you can bring your own music to be played on the boat speaker system. Burgers are made on the boat (albeit greasy ones).  At the end of the tour, you and your crew are given Texas Winos Schwag.   Synopsis:  My crew and I had a good time but I would not recommend this tour if you are looking to go around Lake Travis as the tour is fairly stationary. In addition, if you have an aversion to greasy or heavy foods (like the burgers prepared on the boat), bring your own eats like I did. Total spent for this outing (not including tip) $29.00. This tour is what YOU make it."

They grill up some food for you and you're on the boat having fun for 4hrs. You can bring your own drinks and cooler with whatever you want to bring in but try not to bring glass. Richard is very thorough with his planning and provides you with all and any info you may need to make sure you have nothing to worry and have everything you need.   This is not the first time I have been to one of his events. I have been to a wine tour that I loved and those that joined me as well. Ive also been to a wino fest which was held at the sterling event venue and that offered so many wineries to taste from along with what you can pair them with. They have so many different events and tours that you cant go wrong with any of them. It depends on what you're looking for and what vibe you want plus you always get some kind of swag/souvenirs.   I definitely recommend you try one of his events. You'll enjoy it all."

However, I went on Groupon to purchase their discounted tour for $200. That comes out to $50/person. When I went to checkout, they REQUIRED additional tasting room fees that came out to $140. (On Groupon, they write: \"Wine tastings not included but available for an additional fee\", so this is misleading.) In total, that comes out to about $85/person, which is MORE than they are currently charging per person on their website ($73 during their \"summer sale\"). Let me save you some time!"

The big charter bus picked us up downtown Austin and we headed to the wineries. I am not much of a wine person but after this tour, found out what wine I actually enjoy. Our tour guide was great and interactive with everyone on the tour and made sure we all enjoyed ourselves. Our bus driver was a pro driving those roads and I felt safe having him as my sober driver LOL. The BBQ lunch was pretty tasty and everything overall was great. I would definitely do it again."

He then refused to take us home from the second winery which was an hour and a half away from where we live?? He said we were drunk even though 1. We hadn't even had 2 regular sized glasses of wine total and 2. Isn't that why you hire a driver?? So you don't drink and drive? He put his finger in my mom's face so close it was basically touching her nose. When my brother tried to calmly speak to him, the driver dramatically told him to back up because he was \"dangerous\" and started filming. The video he took will clearly show that no one was threatening him. The other people at the winery came up to us after and could not believe how he acted and that he just left us in the middle of no where. He also called the cops on us and then drove away laughing. What if one of us had a medical condition and needed to get home to take medicine? We had to call all of our friends to see if one of our friends could pick us up since there were no ubers / Lyfts.

The driver was dismissive of us from the start, we needed help setting up the Bluetooth speakers but he was clearly trying to rush us from the moment we got in the bus. At what was supposed to be the halfway point of our trip, the driver came into the winery and told the owner we were 'running late' and they needed to rush us out. This company had over booked themselves and instead of calmly talking to us to resolve the situation, they decided that abandoning a group of people - an hour and a half away from our destination - was the best course of action. The driver had also called the police after escalating the situation himself which was both unprofessional and a waste of the officers time. To add insult to injury, the driver was laughing while he drove away without us. We were lucky enough to have friends drive out and get us, but it was a terrible end to what was supposed to a fun experience. I would not recommend this company if you expect transport to be completed both to and from your destination."

Our group rented the 18 passenger bus for 13 people so we'd have a little extra space. Bus was on time and communication before hand was clear. Bus was clean and they had water and ice available when we got on."

                "description": "We rented from these guys for a Bachelor Party and they were absolutely wonderful. It was a last-minute decision to book a bus so we ended up having two drivers, because they had to scheduled something at the last minute, and both were entirely friendly, professional and helpful. We wanted to find a bar with a mechanical bull and they helped us track one down. There communication was perfect, it was always easy to reach them and they were super flexible at the end of the night, allowing us to extend our trip for as many hours as we wanted for an hourly rate. In the end we only stayed out another hour, and they gave us the extra hour for free. Also, because it was a late booking, they offered us their 25 person bus for the 20 person bus rate.  The sound system was enough to give everyone permanent hearing loss and the dancing pole and hand holds proved to be incredibly robust and secure!  These guys are AWESOME, and I would DEFINITELY book from them again in a heartbeat."

When I started to ask general questions, the man on the phone (unfortunately I did not get his name), kept telling me to refer to the website. When i asked him if he could please tell me his thoughts on how long the bus was needed for, etc over the phone because it was easier for me to do as I could not look at my phone at the time, he very rudely said \"I just don't understand why you can't just look this up on our website.\"   I do not think it is too much to ask to provide basic information over the phone, and the snarky, rude comment was completely uncalled for and one of the more unprofessional customer service experiences I have had. Needless to say, I will not be using Austin Party Bus for my transportation."

                "description": "Booked a limo bus to take 23 people to float the Guadalupe River in New Braunfels, six hours round trip.    Bus: The rate was so much better than every other place I found that I worried the bus would be shabby.  Not so.  Bench-style limo seating, hardwood floors, good sound system, and a pole for dancing.  My birthday guests were all impressed.   Service: Our driver Mike quickly answered every question I had in the weeks leading up to the event (and I had a lot).  He gave us an excellent rate, arrived on time, and was very polite and accommodating.  We were a loud, rowdy birthday crew, but he never seemed to mind.  The first toob place we visited was sold out, so he called another and even got us a group rate!    Overall: Very happy, no complaints.  I plan a few different party buses every year, and I will be using Sixth Street Rides from now on."

                "description": "We purchased a MooLaLa deal for a 5hr wine tour from Sixth Street Rides for up to 15 people.  The deal was supposed to end before we were able to get the group together but Sixth Street Rides was very accommodating on extending our deal to March (2 months after the deal was supposed to expire).  Mike handled our requests including moving the date and giving us suggestions on where to go with complete respect and professionalism.  I received a confirmation the day before as well as our driver, Chris,  called us 20 mins before our pick up time.  We had a couple hiccups (including running late - as 15 girls tend to do - as well as running late at our last winery stop) but Chris handled it with the utmost patience and ease.    Honestly I couldn't have asked for a better company to use for our wine tour.  I highly recommend Chris and Matt over at Sixth Street Rides."

They all want party busses for their birthdays/graduation parties. My only complaint was the A/C did not work from the get go of the ride, my birthday was in May so it was pretty hot on that 22 person bus, but no one had a stroke so it was still a good time. Just make sure you get a bus with an A/C. Other than that, no complaints about this company. Driver was on time (11:00), and took us wherever we wanted to go. We had the bus for 4 hours which was more than enough time. Spent an hour or so on the bus, got dropped off down town for 2 hours, then rode it for the last hour and dropped people off back in west campus. It was perfect!\""

Very reasonable tasting price at$7 for 6 wines. You can order the dry red flight, the white flight or the sweet flight. Most all the wines from the Escondido Valley in west Texas. This is were most of the grapes are grown in Texas anyway although not widely publicized. Lost Draw Cellars and William-Chris are two of our favorites. Really enjoyed both the red and white flights. The sweet flight is VERY sweet and all about fruit. One exception is the Choco-wine. Sounds really awful- chocolate wine!? I am NOT a sweet eater and don't really like chocolate but this is a perfect combination similar to non-dairy Baileys.   So enjoyed the owner-host that helped navigate the wine. Super personable and great to talk to. We'll return here again!"

                "description": "This little shop offers tastings from various Texas and other wineries, organized by a preset menu of either whites, dry reds, or sweet wines. You pay $7 for an etched glass promoting Wimberley as a Little Taste of Heaven (well, why not?), and that includes the tasting of all the wines from the menu of your choice.  There's room for about 6 or 7 people at a time to belly up to the antique bar (standing room only), and the sommelier/host pours for each group separately, explaining each wine and its history as he/she goes.   The afternoon my friend and I were there, we both tried the dry reds, and our host was knowledgeable and entertaining. There was not a bad wine in the bunch, although we each had our separate favorites. A lot of these wines are served by the glass or bottle in the local and regional restaurants, and you can buy them here more reasonably (about $22-36/bottle for the reds we tried) without having to visit each winery. They also have an entire wall of wine-related gift items and cute bar accouterments.  Definitely a place to put on your list to stop by during an afternoon of shopping in Wimberley. Be aware that like most of the shops, they close up for the day at 5PM."

We wanted to order two bottles of wine for our Aunt and Uncle to help them celebrate their 55th wedding anniversary but we live in Tucson. We had stopped in the store during our last visit and found the shoppe to be welcoming and the owners charming. We told Jill want types of wine our relatives like.

They were all very fruit forward compared to the traditional tasting notes of the types they are serving. It's a cheap tasting at $7, and comes with a glass that is etched with \"taste of heaven\" and Wimberley on it.  Now, it's more of a shop, than a winery. So, don't expect to have a few glasses, sit down, or to use a restroom. The girl that was waiting on us was very young and knew very little about wine, and seemed to care very little. That's not the best wine experience! If I came back, it would be to show my boyfriend the bar. Overall, the wine was mediocre! So, it's kind of a one time thing!"

You can only choose from reds, whites or sweets. The tasting comes with a free glass. It's a cute souvenir. The lady serving us that day was very knowledgeable and even gave us a history of each wine and winery with each pour. The tasting room is small and can get crowded. There's no sitting, but it's not a bother. They do sell some cute wine associated items. I ended up leaving with wine and extras. I can see myself going back when in Wimberley."

William Chris is my go-to when stopping in. The Rodeo Red Malbec and Choco Noir are also hard to beat. Happy tasting!!!"

                "description": "I was not impressed at all by the wine tasting here. I would recommend this place for the wine merchandise over the wine tasting/ wines. (I purchased a candle). It is a very small place with a bar that has no seating. They hand you a menu with with 3 lists of wine (Red, White andSweet) and tell you to pick one and they go down the list and give you a sample of each one off the list you chose. There was only 1 gentleman working at the time we myself and 2 friends went and he was too busy to even acknowledge us. We waited while he finished up with other customers then started the tasting. The man told us what we were drinking, which we read from the list, but other than that, seemed to have no other wine knowledge. A few times he told us about the wine maker who was featured in a magazine, or gave us facts about the prizes a wine had won, but no true wine knowledge about what we were drinking. I had to even ask for water to rinse my glass between tastings. He was just pouring wine after wine in my friends' glasses, even a white after a red! This was the strangest wine tasting I have ever done and to be honest, not something I would ever pay for. We had a gift certificate for a free tasting.   Bottom line, if you know anything about wine, I don't recommend it. If not, and you're just looking for a casual experience with a little wine involved, go for it."

However, when the owner is there, she is rude, condescending, and cheap.  Pours a few drops in a tiny cup.  I won't buy anything from her. ...and if she continues with that poor service, I won't ever go back.    So, let's see???  Act friendly and let people actually taste the wine...you get business. You act rude and give people cheap service ---- no business.  It is shocking to me that people have such poor business sense - especially in this economy."

                "description": "We regularly go wine tasting here.  They only stock wines from Texas wineries that make batches too small to distribute to stores, plus one red and one white wine from Italy for the Italian restaurant goers across the street.  It's like visiting half a dozen wineries in one stop.  The wine lists change minimally throughout the year, though, and sometimes they can't get a particular winery's top products (ex. Sistercreek won't sell them their best blends).  Wine tasting is $7 per wine list (red, white or sweet), and each list includes ~8 wines.  Purchase 3 bottles and the tasting is free.  Purchase 6 bottles and 1 tasting is free + 10% off.  My husband and I usually taste both the red and white lists and walk away with 3-4 bottles of wine.  Each bottle is only a few dollars more than if bought at the wineries.  If you want to taste more than 1-2 types of wine, please be respectful and purchase a wine tasting.  They get a lot of foot traffic and can't give all their wine away."

                "description": "Stopped by, last night.  The woman I was with asked for a sample of the Christmas Wine and was given a plastic goblet that held about an ounce, or more, of wine.  She ended up buying a bottle.  I asked about the blueberry wine and was asked if I'd like a sample.  I was given an ultra-mini, paper souffle cup to drink from.  I then asked for a sample of the mead.  Again, I got a mini-cup and, inexplicably, an extremely rude, \"That's the last sample I can give you\" from the owner.  Keep in mind that my friend got a sample, in a plastic goblet, that was five times the amount I received in the paper mini-cup.  She also bought a friggin' bottle of wine.  There was no excuse, ZERO, for the owner's rude way of treating me.  As I sipped the mead, groups of women came in and the owner was all over herself to serve them and strike up animated conversation.  I was amazed and angry.  Maybe there's more, here, than meets the eye, but that's not the point.  I should have been treated as well as the women customers.  I certainly wasn't.  I will never go back to this place.  You can count on that.  The reason I gave the two stars:  The owner was extremely knowledgeable about wines.  She did give me good information about sulfite content of the sweeter wines, comparing sulfite addition in wine to oatmeal addition in meatloaf.  Mitigating factor?: She did tell my friend that her store had been flooded by a broken refrigerator while she was visiting her husband in another state.  She struggled to reopen her store once she got back to town, just a day ago. Even so, her rude behavior cannot be excused.  FWIW, my friend told me that if this woman had responded to me, in the manner she did, before she, my friend, had purchased the bottle of Christmas Wine, she would not have completed the purchase."

                "description": "First, the Driftwood Bistro is on the grounds of Driftwood Estates winery, just off RR 12 south of Dripping Springs. There are several things to be said about that. First, be prepared for the rough, rocky driveway up the hill to the grounds. Once on top, though, the vista is splendid, especially as the sunset rolls across the hills beyond and the flats below. The grounds are lovely and spacious and pleasing. It is an exceedingly pleasing setting.  Beyond that, the Bistro is on one side of the hilltop and the wine house on the other. The Bistro doesn't have a liquor license, so you have to walk across the grounds to get a glass or bottle to go with your meal. An inconvenience. Their wines are middle of the road, and the selection of wines by the glass are very limited as far as whites go.  The Bistro has a pretty experimental and ambitious menu, with creative choices and options. We had the Caribbean Shrimp and Rice and the Open-faced Stuffed Avocado. The avocado dish was superb, with the featured avocado just the right level of ripeness, tender grilled chicken and a picante that was dynamite. The salsa Fresca and crema helped create a very satisfying entre. The flavors both blended and contrasted with each other. A very nice choice of a cool dish for a summer evening. The shrimp dish, on the other hand, was disappointing. It was tepid, to start with. And the shrimp had a very fishy flavor. The sautéed squash was credible, but overall it was disappointing.   Service was cordial. Lexi,our server, was very warm and welcoming and attentive. It was not her fault that the shrimp wasn't the proper temperature   The Bistro gets a 'maybe' on this visit, with hopes that they will improve on speed out of the kitchen and address that glitchy separation of wine bar and restaurant. The place has much going for it, and, if they can up their game, it will be a killer destination."

He gave me recommendations for the weekend and was very easy to deal with.   You have to move fast though, I waited to book my trip with him until it was too late, but he still helped me and found me a ride with one of his competitors! You really don't see service like that anymore. I'm very impressed by Alba's commitment to customer service. Would absolutely recommend!"

Our plans went south due to the weather and we unfortunately had to cancel our boat outing. He came quickly to our rescue, suggesting numerous additional options for the day. He drove us around to a vineyard and distillery without any additional fees. He was always checking in on us to make sure we were happy and having fun! I'd highly recommend him for his quick and efficient communication, flexibility, and attention to detail when it came to our needs. I'll 100% be booking his services again if I find myself with a large party in Austin again!"

He was super reasonable with pricing and sent along restaurant and sight-seeing options before our trip.   The day of, he was right on time and beyond courteous in helping us get all of our stuff to the van. He even stopped on the way for us to grab food and alcohol.   Since the weather was iffy, Alba made sure to let us know that he was standing by and flexible with timing so he could bring us back to town early if we wanted.   The van was clean and comfy. I'd absolutely recommend him to anyone going to Austin and hope to use his services again soon. :)"

He was incredibly kind, helpful, thorough and prompt. He showed up fifteen minutes early at our place and helped us load into the car. Alba then brought us to a grocery store on the way so we could get supplies for the boat. He packed two coolers which we were able to bring on the boat - another big plus. And he was prompt and helpful in bringing us back home afterward.  As a bonus, he's incredibly knowledgeable about the surrounding area and was able to offer up tons of great suggestions. Last but not least, he's a really nice guy! 10/10, would definitely recommend Alba to anyone."

He took us to Dripping Springs and Spicewood for my Bachelorette party and we had a blast. Several girls said it was the best bachelorette party they had been to!! You can eat and drink alcohol on the van. I shopped around, and his 14 passenger van was the most reasonably priced. We went to Treaty Oak, Spicewood Vineyards and Poodie's!! Definitely recommend this company."

We needed rides for our Fredericksburg winery tour and Lake Travis boat party, and Jerral pulled through with punctual transportation at the best prices I could find!   Jerral was easy to coordinate with and even when there was a small hiccup with our ride back from the lake, he was communicative and very professional. He also went above and beyond with helping one of our group members re-park their car after we had already departed for the lake! The vehicles we rode in were also nice and clean.   Overall, our weekend wouldn't have been a success without 360 Transportation and I'll definitely be contacting them for any party bus/transportation needs in the future!!"

I had only scheduled two places to go but the owner recognized that we'd be very close to one of the best wineries in dripping springs and suggested we also go there as well. It was definitely the highlight of the evening and I'm so glad he recommended it. The driver was on time and courteous, he had no problem stopping for bathroom breaks to and from our destination. I'll be definitely using them for a upcoming business happy hour I have planned in two months. If you are looking for transportation at an excellent price they are a must in the Austin area."

My brother and I needed to get some alcohol for my parents before their arrival here tomorrow evening.   This store was very spread out and easy to find exactly what you are looking for. The staff is helpful too and they know where things are in the store too.   I have missed total wine as it is hard to come by when in AL due to liquidity laws. But we do have ABC stores.   I must say that they do card if you appear to be under 30. So myself, my brother and his girlfriend were all carded. But I am taking it as a compliment as yes I do look young.   I think my parent will be happy with what we got for them. :)   If you need an alcohol pick me up or a gift they have amazing gift sets too!   Wonderful experience here!"

No worries, McFarland, Soto, and even the majestic stellium Single Barrel are available. Sales aplenty. If you know exactly what you want, stay the course! Edit: if you sign up with them for a free membership the perks are excellent! Explore the website and look for deals such as auto add extra points; free delivery, etc. Also their \"Spirts Direct\" can put you in the driver's seat on some pretty good selections to consider unless you are looking for a very specific item. And when you are connected with the upper level you can get discounts and the ability to obtain really hard to find items."

                "description": "Thanks to Total Wine and More for being my go-to spirits supplier during the 'Rona.  I've only had need to use them for bottles of wine for special occasion during the pandemic. It's easy to shop online from their website to pickup curbside. Service is typically quick, accurate, and convenient. Curbside is free with a $35 order; otherwise a minimal service charge applies.  They were already my inside favorite based on the wonderful in-store atmosphere and experience. Being a solid citizen and not putting my health at risk to purchase adult beverages during the pandemic has won them a fan for life."

                "description": "DO NOT USE ONLINE ORDER DELIVERY.  I recently learned a lesson using Total Wine and More's very ill-partnered delivery service.  Someone brought a wrong order in decent time to my house.  We noticed the erroneous bag together at my doorstep and she proceeded to take the delivery back to the store and my order is subsequently cancelled as I am informed by E-mail.  I wait an entire week and receive a refund 13 dollars less than my original payment.  I have spoken to customer service two weeks ago and they initiated a pass of my complaint to higher authority.  On my end, I have seen the same result as taking no action at all.  I am at a point now where it makes no more sense to spend any more time on getting my 13 dollars back as this as a fraction of what I can make spending that time actually working.  Total Wine online orders get all the thumbs down!"

                "description": "5 stars for this Total Wine location where I felt like the manager Robert became my best friend lol.  Came in here during Coronavirus and had a few odd items I couldn't find. An employee directed me to another employee who turned out to be the manager, and he personally walked me around the store and gave me his own personal opinions on which bottles to get. Amazing. This guy was super knowledgeable and helpful. I already love Total Wine as a brand and this location is now my favorite. I just wish this was the closest Total Wine to me!"

                "description": "If you are like me my drink of choice changes with the seasons, moods I have, and sometimes based on what holiday(s) are coming up. Total Wine is THE best place to come if you are like me - curious, excited to try something new, looking for some advice on what else I can try, etc then you have come to the right spot for your libations.  Ask any employee, I dare you, on what they suggest after telling them what you like. They will point you to some solid suggestions and even walk you over to that area where it is located. Total Wine has some very knowledgeable employees who are willing to walk you through the entire store if you requested that.   The prices are the best in the area for all of it - liquor, beer, wine, mixers, etc.  It's a one stop shop where you just might end up finding a cooler-than-the-one-you-have-at-home cocktail shaker or wine stoppers too.   Also, if you are looking to put together a gift last minute come here.  They have it all - bags, gift sets, tape, cute decor for bars, and whatnot here. It's super easy to roll up, park, and strut in to get a really cool and curated gift if you ask for some help."

He was so helpful with picking out our first bottle I went and searched for him to help pick out the second bottle. He helped us pick out an islay whiskey and a flavored whiskey and I was surprised at how knowledgeable he was on them .   In short nice store and the service was friendly knowledgeable and descriptive. Thanks again to Andrew!!"

They have a wide selection of liquor, wine, and beer.  I even found some exotics like moonshine from the TV show 'Moonshiners'.  And carry many local Austin and Texas brands.   My trip included finding a nice bottle of Rosé, bourbon and a few mini single serving bottles to sample. The staff was very nice.  For Texas residents they have a rewards program and a phone app."

I like that they have so many choices for wines and also a huge inventory of distilled spirits... plus quality beers, craft and imports. They've kept up with the mezcal boom, to my joy.  And there's always excellent single-malt Scotch options.  All I'd like to see more of is Greek wines (Kourtaki retsina, please!) and Portuguese madeira.  I still have to go to Spec's for those.     A tip of the hat to excellent and helpful staff. I always look for Belle up front, she is a delight!  I hope she's appreciated, managers!"

                "description": "I use to check out Total Wine and More a lot when I lived in the DC metro area. I even attended a sweet Yelp wine and beer tasting event there in Fairfax, VA about two years ago.Total Wine sold me at that event and I was able to get some of my favorite beers. I love the fact I could do a mix and match 6 pack of anything I wanted.   Anyway, I wasn't feeling like Spec's on this particular day and wanted to see how Texas does Total Wine and more. Texas does it right. I was in awe and bewilderment as I toured the store. I ended up with of course more than I needed but no worries there.   I will note I found something there called a pocket shot. A pocket shot is made of plastic and looks like a Capri Sun container. It would of have been great to take to ACL the other weekend. So if you want to sneak or smuggle booze in I recommend buying those pocket shots."

HOLY COW! Not only did this young woman have a deep deep knowledge of every varietal and suggestions on labels in a variety of price ranges- but she help me select a case of assorted wines, but wouldn't let me leave without one of her favorite bottles of Syrah.   When I was checking out at the cashier, she asked \"Gracie helped you, didn't she? She has an encyclopedic knowledge of wines and impeccable taste.\"  Well, I just cracked open that bottle of Syrah and BLAMMO. I'm hooked."

                "description": "You know at some point I thought Specs was going to rule the world and run every other liquor store out of business. That of course was before Total Wine. Total Wine has the best booze selection in Austin and great prices!   I'm a huge fan of Mescal and the selection here is completely un-matched. They even carry a brand of Mezcalito, which is insanely hard to find outside of South America. The beer selection goes beyond amazing! It seems like they have every beer any distributor can possible get in Texas.    The only downside to Total Wine is that if you ask anyone for help they recommend off label store brand crap. I would suggest not ever buying anything that is labeled with a \"Spirits Direct\" sticker. No matter what the employees say its not as good as the brand you came looking for.I think that as long as you know what you're looking for and go in and don't ask for help and just get what you want and need you should be fine.   In closing I would say that If you need booze this is the place to go!"

The staff is always friendly and I've never been steered wrong with a wine recommendation. I love that they have lots of tastings on the weekends and most recently, I went to one of their formal tastings with Orin Swift wines. It was more than works the $20 ticket price and I added to my wine knowledge base (and tasted delicious wines)."
