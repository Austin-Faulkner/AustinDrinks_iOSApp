                "description": "This brewery is located in an industrial area in San Antonio, hidden. But my gosh it is a hidden treasure. There are amazing drinks choices, whiskey, beer, and mixed drinks. Delicious. All drinks are made in shop which makes it more special. You have a gift shop to buy bottles and fun stuff. BUT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE TOUR. You get two full side beers, and a pint glass to keep. Also a little whiskey at the end of the tour. Incredibly educational and interesting. Such a golden place. Book a tour and enjoy. Also nice seating areas inside and outside."

Draft Beers, glassware, whiskey samples and a guided tour for $10 with the option of a vip tasting for the price of a flight, you can't beat that. Highly recommend this \"brewdistillery \" .I like the .36 bourbon and love that these guys are in my back yard. Looking forward to what this distillery has planned for future releases."

                "description": "This place is fantastic.  It was a 12 min drive from downtown.  Lots of parking on a Saturday.   It was easy to make reservation online.   When we arrived we checked in.  10.00 for 90 minute tour. It included tasting of bourbon and two pints of beer with a souvenir glass.  My husband paid additional 45 for a VIP to be added for three of our adult kids and 12.00 for a flight.   The VIP was a great experience for them.  We brought bbq, and snacks.  We ate snacks while we did our tour.  I highly recommend to bring food.   They only have a cheese board.  Great value for a great experience.   Btw restrooms are clean!"

Tour was a little long- but I was DD so maybe it would've seemed to go by faster if I could've enjoyed a beer.  The rest of the family had a great time and enjoyed the tastings.   Definitely a hidden gem in SA."

I was lucky that I'm still part of their bi-weekly volunteering list for bottling and labeling, but I wasn't able to make it to the last few trips, until last week.   It was still a great experience and I enjoyed their expanded selection of beer and whiskey. And I even bought distillery-only bottles for my trip back.   Looking forward to next time!"

                "description": "I celebrated my military retirement here earlier this week, and wish to extend my appreciation to Dennis and the rest of the team and R.C. for their hospitality during the event.  We started with a tour of their brewing and distilling facility, which is very unassuming to people who are simply walking or driving by the building. The tour was just the right amount of time, and offered us a good look into how their production works. And then, samples! We tried three or four of the whiskies being sold regularly, and got a look at their upcoming seasonal/promotional products. Kudos to our tour guide!  The food was catered, with R.C. taking care of everything, from setup to cleanup.  The products these guys have available are all very good, so make a stop out the next time you're driving south on IH-35."

                "description": "I booked a virtual whiskey tasting here for our leadership team at work and boy was it worth every (very reasonably priced) penny.   Dennis - Helped me set everything up, was super helpful and tolerated my constant check-ins to make sure everything was going well.   The samples - All came on time, despite the freak weather in Texas. And the presentation of said samples was very impressive. Not just a few samples thrown in a cardboard box, but individually labeled bottles in a branded  wooden box with a tasting card, lovingly packaged to ensure no wasted whiskey.  Mike - Our host, was friendly, knowledgeable, and pretty dang funny. He was great at involving everyone in the tasting convo, even those who opted out of having whiskey.   Overall, great virtual tasting that I will 100% be doing again even outside of the covid times. 10/10 would recommend."

                "description": "Bottom Line: One of the better breweries I've been to around the US. First time at a distillery and definitely first brew-stillery I've been to. Very impressive and delicious assortment of beers and a great variety of spirits makes Ranger Creek one of my favorite places in Texas for sure. The $10 tour is the absolute best I've ever been to, learning about beer making and whiskey distilling! The Even bought a souvenir glass!  This place is an experience for their tour. You MUST do it! But you should sign up at least 3-4 days in advance if not a week ahead because the spots do sell out. For $10, you will get TWO beer tickets which you can drink during the tour. Then at the distilling part of the tour, we were given 3 .5 ounce tastings of three different whiskeys. That alone is like a $8 value on top of two beers. And when it says 45 minute tour, it's more like 1:30-2 hours long because Big Mike, our tour guide, is so damn passionate about what they do there. Expect to stay longer...you'll want to.   The beers on top are excellent. Lots of variety. Not the best spot if you're an IPA fan but they have lots of other options. My favorite was their Belgian White Ale and their Hefeveizen. They also have super cheap 6 packs to go, ranging from $5-8 or so. Totally worth it! You can do beer and whiskey flight tastings so you'll have to chance to try it all!   Amazing brewery and distillery. Totally recommend. Especially on nice sunny day where you can sit outside."

I have toured the facility a couple of times before because they do a great job and I like supporting local businesses.  I do wish Col. Mc had been there, but hopefully he will come back to lead tours again soon : ) The price is very affordable and you can even hang out at the bar and food truck with your new found friends from the tour."

Purchased 3 bottle of their bourbon and a flight, but just don't personally care for the rye and she threw such a fit when I asked if I could substitute it for anything else. Really a turn off when she then presented me with the bill expecting at least an 18% tip when she crammed 2 of the bottles into one bag even after I said they where gifts. Geez I really should have used the curbside. That guy at least is friendly. Where is the Colonel? He never treated us this way?"

There was plenty of hand sanitizer and they encouraged social distancing. Everyone was required to wear a mask, as well as the employees.  We did a tour and it came with two free beer tickets. The person leading the tour was funny and was very knowledgeable. Tour lasted for about an hour and we ended up getting a few more drinks in their back space behind the building.    I did feel a little unsafe in the back space, the tables are spread out but I didn't see anyone actively disinfecting the tables in between groups. They were actively serving cocktails, beer, beer flights, whiskey and whiskey flights."

Beer was a spicy with an earthy undertone... great with any taco, chalupa, or Gordita... also curious to cook with this beer.   The Michelada was spicy, tangy, and herbed with a smooth finish... would have been better dressed with tajin and chamoy...  The margarita was a very good, made with the chili beer and white whiskey... very tasty, earthy, and sweet with an exotic taste!   They held a raffle and I won a six pack of the hatch"

That may be the best Helles I've ever had - EVER - The Belgian quad was many things but a Belgian style quad it was not - grant it, the only Belgian style quads I've had were in Belgium - stouts we're hyper sweet, but that may be a market thing, but Irish or English stouts they were not. - IPAs - they were fine but everyone is doing IPAs - so if you are into IPAs - their triple is the jam!!!  - Tacos came in a bit cold the brisket was great but the pulled pork left a lot to be desired ...  Had I come in for brisket tacos (and had they been served hot), and a full pour of Helles, this place would have received a 6 out of five!"

Once again another brewery where I am eager to explore their other beer options. If they are as awe inspiring as Rise and Grind I will become a very, very avid fan. Not that I'm not heading in that direction right now."

                "description": "This review is mostly in regards to their Fiesta event. A clear effort was made by incorporating Fiesta elements such as food, delicious chicken on a stick, and paleteria and sanctioning off a dedicated area, but sadly it was not enough to distinguish it from any other day at Weathered Souls. However, I have faith if they decide to do so again next year, they will nail it."

I love that you can order little 5 oz pours and try out a bunch of different beers. Beers are reasonably priced starting at $5.50. Really loved their West Coast IPA. Lots of parking. Clean bathrooms.

                "description": "My wife and I were in San Antonio for a long weekend and we had just landed on a Wednesday and they opened at 3. We walked in at 3:01 and they had some food out for the team members, which I thought was pretty cool. They were brewing as well, since I could smell the hops boiling away!  I ordered an IPA, that was great and two pulled pork tacos.  The server behind the counter was super nice and she brought out the tacos. They were pretty large and the pulled pork was especially juicy and the toppings were perfect. These were so good. I tried 6 places for BBQ and this was number 3 by far, plus they make their own beer, score sone for the Gipper. There was true smokiness to the tacos and just delicious.  I got one more beer and I would highly recommend this place."

Several QUALITY beers to chose from depending on your taste and good food too.   Get a flight of beers to start off. The wait staff knows their stuff and can help guide selections.   Once you have had a sampling, hone in on one try enjoy and get your food order in. You'll be enjoying a top-notch beer and tasty food in no time!   No complaints here.

It was a Saturday evening and my party was waiting for another restaurant. Like I mentioned earlier, I didn't know this brewstillery served food and drink. So we decided to go for a couple of drinks before dinner. My wife and our two friends got the hard seltzer's and I went for the ginger bread stout. My wife's seltzer was really fruity and bubbly (I'm going to buy a case at a wine store later). I couldn't really taste the gingerbread in my stout, but it wasn't super hoppy, it was sweet, and it went down pretty smooth. I need to come back sometime soon to taste their bar food and try some other of their offerings."

This man knows how to make stouts and gets very creative with the flavors.   I ordered a burger and honestly felt the price was too high for what I received, but I understand the price is high because I'm helping to pay for the rent of this place. This establishment is big!

The ambience is relaxed, with a simplistic decor giving you the feeling to come as you are.   They have many different styles to choose from, and I personally recommend the fan favorites Material Girl, West Coast IPA, and Dale Shine!   They also serve food, complimentary of South BBQ, the Sweet Heat Brussels are beyond delish, lightly fried with a sweet and spicy peanut sauce.   They do not serve food on Mondays, but have a food truck on site!"

Check it out at https://blackisbeautiful.beer/  I had the pleasure of visiting the brewery back in December killing time before my flight! All the beers I tried were delicious! If you are a fan of dark beers this is the place for you! They offer a great variety of dark beers! Be sure to check out the menu because they have lighter beers also. It's not a very large brewery but a decent size and they have a few games you can play if your with a group! Definitely check out this brewery if you are in the area!  Also, be sure to check the COVID restrictions because I am not sure how they are handling that currently since I visited last year."

As we walk in you notice the place is very clean, has a nice décor and a relaxed vibe. As we walk up to the counter to order we are greeted by one of the servers who goes over the draft menu with us, provides a few samples then takes our order: one Prestidigitator Doppelbock and one Habitual Line Stepper Imperial Stout. I start of trying the Habitual Line Stepper and found it not too heavy with notes of coffee towards the end. It was smooth and had an overall pleasant taste. Next, I tried the Prestidigitator Doppelbock and really liked it. It had a light taste for a dark beer with strong hints of malt which I prefer over hops (not an IPA guy).  Overall, considering I only tried two of their offerings I'm be happy to come back and try the rest sometime soon. If you're in the neighborhood be sure to come by and try this local gem. Cheers!"

We got a flight of IPAs that were decent, but I know I would like them more now as I love IPAs in general more than I did then. I'm really glad to see that they're doing well and I would recommend coming here to anyone who loves craft beer and who likes to support their local breweries. We'll definitely be giving them another chance the next time we're in the area."

                "description": "Weathered Souls is one of those places where your soul always feels more rejuvenated contrary to their name. It is probably one of- if not my favorite- brewery in San Antonio.   I was introduced to this place by a friend, and my friends and I have been back many times ever since. With COVID aside, they have really cool events are have a great vibe. They have a small outdoor section and indoor area. Their quality/variety of beer, the incredible service, and just the wonderful family feel really makes this place great. They are constantly coming out with incredible flavors with my favorite being a Vietnamese French Press they had some time ago. They also do flights, which makes it fun to try different flavors. They recently reopened, and it is a place you should definitely check out.  Also something notable about this brewery is they dropped a beer called Black is Beautiful. This beer is to support the injustice a lot of African Americans have faced and to raise funds to combat police brutality. You can learn about it more here: https://blackisbeautiful.beer/. This beer is also incredible. This is just further evidence to show you the quality of people behind Weathered Souls.   Could not recommend this brewery anymore!"

I really liked the tangerine wheat and the IPA. Overall a great set of people running this place. Friendly and attentive! The interior is large with a few picnic tables for large groups and four person tables.   There's plenty of parking under the bridge. I've heard there's a food truck during the busier times.  There's also plans to expand in the future to have more outdoor seating as currently there's a few spots to sit outside.   Come check it out, definitely wortha try!"

                "description": "Gene Simmons of Kiss said of his father who was a salesman at the end of the day it is ultimately you who sells something. I wish businesses were more attuned to this. At the end of the day it is a place's owners and staff that makes us go back or keeps us away. I came to \"Man Overboard Brewing Co.\" for a soft opening. It is nearby an underpass that opens up with more parking. When I arrived staff were already outside greeting you. Although this doesn't cost a business a penny it is priceless.  The brewery is really, really small but big on charm. Inside there are picnic style benches for seating. There is finite seating for large and small groups. Once inside the owner greeted me and simply said, \"Welcome, thank you for coming here!\" As I have said before when a place is not bumping this is the most optimal time to make a connection to a patron. The tapmasters, who happened to be owners were absolutely friendly which transferred to all the their products. Basically you go to the counter and order. They serve beer, wine, seltzers and ciders. It is a very limited taplist right now but the owner assured me they are adding more items next week.   Soft openings are meant as an opportunity for a business to see what needs to tweaked. Lucky for me the place was functioning like a well-oiled machine. My only critique from me is for them to consider adding outdoor seating. Other than that I like that it is small but intimate. My understanding is that they are former veterans who decided to open a brewery. I can sense those experiences have lead them to this moment. They offered a flight so I went with that. I had their blonde, their coffee porter, tangerine wit and ipa. They all had really good flavors. I will say the ipa seemed more boozier than its 6.5% abv. As I was leaving I definitely felt like a man in fact overboard.    To me as I travel from both regional and local breweries it's not the beers that sell a place but rather the people. Product can and should develop over time but the staff is really who sells any business. Consistency in beers is one thing but consistency in service supersedes even that. At that capacity Man Overboard Brewing Co. will be here for awhile. The place and ambiance are charming. The beers are solid but the service is stellar.  If you happen to be in this area check it out.   ps. If your GPS is not working don't worry! Just look for the two dudes with the epic viking beards and you're good!"

                "description": "I ended up going two nights in a row.  The first time with my BF, then liked it enough to come again with colleagues the next night (my suggestion - everyone left happy). This will be a double review.   While sitting at the bar getting face-to-face service we were well taken care of and I was really impressed with the variety and quality of food coming out of the tiny end of the bar that counts as the \"kitchen\". Everyone was the perfect balance of down to earth and professional.   The next night, my group of 6 used the new ordering app and it worked really well.  It was incredibly efficient and our server was still regularly available and able to make modifications for us whenever we needed. Lastly and most importantly...all of the food and drinks we had were good! We each had a different meal and all of us were happy with our choices. I love that there's a wide selection of dark beers.  Between the two nights I had all of them (in flights) and liked them all, Granny's Fruit Cake was pretty tasty too.  If it isn't clear already, this was a great experience and I'd happily return next time I'm in San Antonio."

                "description": "I was looking for a brewery that I hadn't been to that also served food. Kunstler was one of the few breweries that fit that category so my friend and I made the drive over there-not super close to last call but late enough that I was worried about the kitchen being closed.  We were close but fortunately got there in time for everything. We decided to split the 'shareable' pretzel but after it arrived it was right on the border of large single serving and shareable. We're both pretty big eaters so it was a dance trying to make sure we weren't taking too much. What I'm saying is if you're in a group, order a few pretzels.  Fortunately, we got our own mains as well. Ok, well I did because I needed to eat more. I got the bratwurst, because if you're going to claim German heritage then your brat better come correct. The brat was good with a plenty of sauerkraut and a nice dollop of mustard. The potato salad was also a good accompaniment.   They have a pretty broad range of beers and while I was impressed to see a lot of depth on their bench but maybe honing in on a smaller portfolio of styles? The fruit gose was pretty good and the floral grisette was ok but the Sichuan was not to my liking."

                "description": "Wait? Künstler offers brunch?! ...yes, and it is FANTASTIC!  Künstler has always been my favorite brewery in San Antonio (you heard it right...favorite), and through these last couple of years they just keep getting better and better. My husband and I probably visit this brewery at least once a week for either growler refills and/or just to grab a beer. But last weekend we finally got to try their brunch menu and it was heaven! Everything on the menu sounded delicious but I asked one of the staff members what he recommended and point it out the brunch burger, and OH MY GOD! I am not a burger person, but THIS burger was what burger dream are made of (hilary duff reference for those who get it). Frankly, I've been thinking about this burger all week and can not wait to come back this Sunday and order it again. Besides the delicious food, the also offer a wide variety of wine and mimosas! Because what is brunch without mimosas?   PSA for all the parents with babies: Künstler has baby changing stations on both men and women bathrooms. This is probably one of the reasons why we feel so comfortable visiting Kunstler. Even though they are a brewery, I've always felt very welcomed with my baby. I want to thank the team at Kunstler for thinking about parents and having that."

                "description": "The patio and beer is amazing. The neighborhood is a construction zone and lacks parking. They no longer make the lobster roll seen on here. The pretzel charcuterie was a nice presentation and tasty.  The pastrami sandwich was super dry meat. Part was left on the plate as it was not edible. The bread was nice and soft. The shrimp roll was the closest substitute to the lobster roll and I was in the mood. There was a nice amount of shrimp loaded into a pretzel roll. It was really hard to eat. The pretzel roll has little give and the white sauce from the shrimp drizzled out everywhere. I'd not eat that again."

                "description": "Great beer and appetizers only.  A nice patio area and a tasteful interior. The pretzel charcuterie board was delicious. The pastrami sandwich was on a great rye bread, the pastrami had great taste but was desiccated, dry, and stiff. There was very little dressing to combat the dryness and very little cheese. I was too hungry to send it back and figured dipping it into the soup would be enough- it wasn't. If you've ever had a really good pastrami sandwich at someplace like Katz' deli you'd know how off the mark this sandwich was. The shrimp roll had old bay seasoning on top which distracted from the flavor along with the pretzel bun, a brioche bun would work much better. I don't mind spending top dollar for delicious food but the price and quality of this food doesn't make me ever want to return."

                "description": "Amazing experience at Kuenstler Brewing! The beer is great (but I think that goes without saying), and their pretzel was outstanding. Warm, buttery, salty and ordered it with some BOMB cheese sides such as the pimento and basil goat cheese.  Hospitality here is amazing too. They greet you when you walk in, you can view menu from both QR code and a physical menu, and the bartender came around multiple times to check on me for reorders and I could close out from my seat digitally! Love the whole atmosphere here. Great place to meet with friend or pour a cold one while working. Also their music selection is clutch!"

                "description": "I'm a big supporter of local business and decided to try Kunstler after seeing it featured on the local channel 4 \"Elder Eats\".   Positives up front: The service was excellent and zero wait time on seating.    The negative? The huge disappointment in their craft beer selection.  Mostly all of their featured beer were not on the current menu.  I had a flight of four and left with slight headache (I've been hydrating all day).   The food menu varies from day to day, and today's selection was just not for me.  If I would've known this ahead of time I would've selected a different day to try this place out.    Their appetizers were good though, we had their Pretzel charcuterie board and loved it.  I was a little surprised when I heard there was an up-charge to get fries with the meal, as apparently the standard offering  are patati chips.    Would I return? No. Would I recommend it to family and friends? No. I wouldn't discourage anyone from trying it for themselves though."

(Amazing BBQ)  My wife and I saddled up to the bar and I ordered an IPA. Delish. The most fun was talking to the couple next to us. We spent about 30 minutes introducing ourselves and talking about travel and the like.  The bartender was super nice and it was a great stop after an amazing BBQ meal.  I don't know how my wife finds all these cool places, but she does, and it is wonderful!"

                "description": "I first heard of Künstler when I ended up with a growler from them. I always told myself I'd go give it a try. I never got the chance to go until just the other day. This place is a lot bigger than expected. But not overly huge. Still a nice intimate setting and laid back as you would expect from a brewery. They have a patio out front and a separate room for games and watching sports. I really enjoyed that they were separated. It kept the room that we were in nice for some conversation and trying out the brews and food. This is a really nice brewery with some delicious takes on German food. I got the Sichuan beer, which was very tasty and unlike any beer I have had before. It also tasted super fresh since they brew it right there. My partner got their sangria which I also tried and it was very good! We opted for the charcuterie pretzel to share with our drinks. The pretzel was warm, soft and really tasty. The cheese that came with this board was amazing! We loved it. No idea what it was or anything but before we knew it the entire plate was gone. Absolutely wondeful experience. Will definitely be back with my growler and try some other items!"

                "description": "We came here on a Saturday afternoon and were so impressed! The building is beautiful and has multiple outdoor seating options. Our server was very friendly and helpful, she even gave us some souvenir stickers after hearing we were first time visitors from out of town.  We ordered the prickly pina, hop train, and an order of pretzel bites with pimento. The hop train was a standard hazy ipa, but the prickly pina really took it up a notch! I loved the little bit of heat that I've never tasted before in an ipa, I would absolutely recommend if you're a fan of this style. As good as the beer was, the pretzel bites and pimento were the stars of the show. These pretzel bites tasted as good as they looked, and the pimento was the best I've ever had. This is the perfect dish to pair with a couple of beers."

I ordered the pretzel charcuterie and it was good as well I recommend it if you are a fan of charcuterie. The pickled stuff that came with it was not as good as I was hoping though. It was a little pricey for the amount of food but the beer was priced very fairly so I would say it evened out for the most part. Definitely a pace I recommend if you're looking for a nice brewery in the area!   Overall: 4.4 stars"

I don't even know where to start... the beer is great, I started with a flight to see which one I preferred and then followed up with a couple of pints . We shared the pretzel  which we upgraded to the fancy version of a charcuterie board. The pickles, Brie and cured meats aren't to be missed. The pretzel and mustard are also excellent! I had the bratwurst  with sauerkraut and it checked all the right boxes! The staff was super friendly and would hang out and chat us up when they had time. Danny (I think) gave us a long history of the place and events that were in the works. Since then, we've been back 5 or 6 times with plenty of friends. The beer garden has picnic tables so you can get a nice sized group of people together. The schnitzel (which is only a special on certain nights) is not to be missed! They are also dog friendly!  Love this place!"

Styles range from the classic west coast IPA to a Czech-style pilsner.  It's the small details that separate a good brewery from a great one. Second Pitch recently introduced their Czech-style pilsner and could have served it in a standard pint glass out of a standard tap... but no! They deliver the crisp, clean, and ever so refreshing beverage out of a side pull tap into the classic pilsner glass. The creamy head holds strong and the beer goes down quick. Thank you for quenching my thirst. You bet I'll be back for another!"

Enjoyed, but the bartender let us try some local beers; including Second Pitch Beer.  Finding out it was right down the street, we decided to give it a try.  So glad to have found this gem of a brewery nearby!  Came into the place and the pourer behind the counter was nice in answering some questions.  Went with A Man and His Dog Irish Stout.  This was a quality beer.  They had a few games to play at the table, so we played a competitive game of Uno.  On the board, they had a number of Running and Mountain Biking clubs meet up and on Thursday's they have 3 growler fill ups for $30.  Hell of a deal!  I will be back to this place multiple times."

Even better though is the sense of community you feel sipping the suds at Second Pitch. Cozy ambiance that feels like Texas and the TV show cheers had a baby and it grew up to be SPB. Tables set up to capitalize on good weather. Lovely place to hang. Drink local!"

                "description": "Totally loving this brewery! There really isn't a beer they have that not solid - and there's pretty much one for every taste.     Sitting unassumingly in this business park off Starcrest,this small brewery has tons to offer. Service has always been fast and everyone working has been super cool. I'm just going to say it, it's the Künstler of the NE side! I don't think I've been this excited about a brewery and their beers since Künstler and Islla.  The inside is small but they've converted their parking lot into seating area-all tables socially distanced.  They have various nightly events (including movie night) and I can't wait for BYOV (bring your own vinyl) night!  I ABSOLUTELY love that you can bring your let's, it's a sure +!  As far as food goes, they'll have a rotating list of food trucks so you'll never go hungry.  My favorite beer right now is their Black is Beautiful variant which is made with HEB's Taste of San Antonio coffee. It's a must try before they run out!"

Your allowed to bring in your own snacks and even your dog! If your in the area definitely check this place out! Get a flight so you can try as many beers as possible. They have a great IPA which I loved and my husband liked the honey beer I forget what it was called but when you get there you'll see it on the board. Easy ordering, great menu, cool staff, and there's even a great Greek food truck outside!"

                "description": "Solid new brewery in SA! All the beers we tried were really good. I also tried their root beer which was delicious! I typically don't think lighter beers are anything to write about, but Second Pitch had a fantastic ale/light beer that is definitely worth trying (I think it was the Summer Lightning Ale). It's one of the better beers I've tried in awhile.  When we stopped by on a Saturday afternoon, they had a few picnic tables set up outside and a couple of tables inside. There isn't much shade, and while we were there they didn't have umbrellas over the tables, although they did set one up at the request of someone. I'd bring sunscreen. :)   While they don't serve food, there was a food truck on site. The service was friendly and attentive, at least inside where we were one of two tables. They also have beer to go if you want to take some home!"

                "description": "Always excited to see a new craft brewery open up in town. I went here a couple of weeks ago and am glad I did. It is in an industrial area which gives the place a cool vibe. They have a food truck outside from those that want a tasty morsel, I did not partake in the food this time but will next time. The staff is very welcoming and friendly. I spoke to a few of them including the brewmaster. Their beer knowledge is excellent as are their brews. I tried all they had to offer and they were all very good. One of them had an odd flavor and after speaking with the brewer he agreed and will make some tweaks. This is how you know a good beer man! I will be back anytime I get to that side of town. I encourage everyone who wants good beer, music and an overall great time to check them out."

                "description": "My husband stopped into this brewery because the traffic was bad downtown SA.  We had never heard of it before so he purchased a growler of beer.  It was an IPA,  he put it on ice to chill it before we tried it.  It was delicious,  you could taste the different flavor profiles as it warmed up in the glass.  We drank the whole growler that evening.  It tasted like a session IPA,  we will definitely be going back.  If you ever get caught in bad traffic in SA,  stop into some of the local establishments.  You will find some of the best kept secrets in the San Antonio Texas or anywhere in Texas.  We kind of keep to ourselves sometimes and everybody is family/familia in Texas."

It's so fun to try out the different beers and know that every time you stop by, there's something new to try!  And the best part--you choose how much you get! I'm sure we've all had moments where a drink seems intriguing but you don't want to commit to a full glass. This is a great place to expand your knowledge of beer and try stuff that maybe you normally wouldn't. I love that they showcase different Texas breweries.   The staff is always friendly, they have fun trivia nights and a selection of board games for you and the squad. I'd recommend The Dooryard to anyone and everyone!"

You open a tab at the register and are given a card to use at the tap.  There are 30 taps on the wall that are constantly rotating with both local and national craft beers.  You are charged by the ounce and each beer has a different price per ounce (generally ranging from $0.45 to $0.65 / ounce.  There are beer menu's posted that have a description of each beer.  The staff is super friendly and helpful.    They do have numerous events during the week with some pup-up food trucks.  My only issue is my own fault - it is amazing how quick the tab adds up!  In transparency, the screen displays the cost of the most recent pour and it also shows the total for your visit."

                "description": "Look, this is a great place to go and have a couple of drinks and enjoy the company of your friends and family.  If you are expecting to go for dinner and have a meal, go somewhere else that has a menu and a host or hostess to seat you.  That being said, the food we had for brunch was very good and the portions were good for the price.If you really just want to go and have the ability to sample a bunch of beer and have some light food to go along with your brew, then the Dooryard is definitely the place to be.  I walked in and obviously I was a newbie because they guided me through the process to get started, BUT they were very helpful and happy to assist.  The staff is wonderful and explained everything I needed to know from loading my card to pouring the beer and paying for food on a separate app.    The beer, oh the beer, I consider myself a beer snob and I love dark beers such as porters and stouts.  Believe it or not, they had a great selection of beer that made me happy and what was even better, I was able to try what I wanted and not feel any guilt or buyers remorse in getting  a pour that is disappointingly small.  Here, you get any size of what you want and as much as you want in any glass that you want it in (providing you know what glass you should pour it in).   Anyway, bottom line is, you will be excited to come back just as I am and what is even better, Jason (the owner) is there and very chill and approachable when you are visiting.  He thanked us as we were closing out our tab and I assured him that he would definitely get a great review from me.  Hurry up and get there so that you can enjoy your experience and be as excited as I am to go back."

You enter the establishment and are greeted by a worker. Show ID. Run your credit/debit card and you're given a Dooryard card. Grab your dooryard card and head over to the beers. Grab the glass of your choosing and a napkin. Once you've decided on your beer, put the card in the black slot, napkin on the nozzle, tilt your glass to 45 degrees and pour! You get charged by the oz so drink as little or as much as you like! DO NOT FORGET YOUR CARD! Or you may be buying beers for others haha   What I REALLY loved about this place is a lot of the beers on tap were Texas Breweries. A local business supporting local business! Love it!  I loved the open area. The guys I went with felt it looked too much like a Jamba Juice / froyo place. I guess they wanted a more \"masculine\" feel to it? Less orange and more...brown? Idk lol I came for the beers and succeeded!  As for the food - ehhhhh. I'd say eat before you come here and then you can snack on the food here. My friend ordered the rueben. The photo shows a pickle but I guess they ran out so they gave him sliced cucumber that tasted like they threw pickle juice over it haha we laughed about that for a little.   Come here for the brews and bring some company! I don't recommend coming alone unless you're gonna take a rideshare or taxi. You can EASILY go from drinking 1 beer to 12 lol not kidding.   Come check out Dooryard! So far it's my favorite beer establishment in SA!!"

                "description": "I recently read an article on NPR about the relatively new phenomenon of \"self serve taprooms.\" It argues that overhead caused by labor and an unpredictable market will inevitably force businesses to reconsider their strategies. Necessity is the mother of invention as they say and the pandemic is facilitating a \"think outside the box\" approach. The Dooryard, the city's first self serve taproom of its kind is hastening that notion. As I came here for a sneak preview a few questions did come to mind? Are patrons ready to forgo the experience of going to a taproom only to have to serve themselves? What about the interaction between customer and server? Will that be replaced by machines?  For every glass that I have a question for there is an empty one that needs to be filled; presumably with answers. Firstly it is everything you might be looking for in a taproom. It's sleek, simply decorated and spacious. There is patio seating with heating lamps. I'm wondering how it will look in the summer. So you probably want to know how this place works don't you? Well you go to the front counter where you start a tab. You are given an e-card that tracks everything you drink. You choose a clean glass from a rack of different styles: stout, pint, pilsner or a snifter. It's much like the soda dispensaries at a theater in theory but with craft beer instead. You use a paper cup to cover tap handles, thus limiting contact.  One thing that is really helpful is that they post their taplist via online. My suggestion is that you survey it beforehand. Selections are separated and displayed by number. You place your card on the slot and you pour to your liver's content. The owner, I presume was really friendly. He came around from the counter and graciously showed me how the process worked. This is where your skills as a tapmaster or lack thereof are going to shine through. I must reiterate you are charged by the ounce. As you serve yourself there is a display that tells you the dollar amount of each pour. It's like pumping gas but instead it's beer. In the NPR article it said the benefits of utilizing this method is the consistency of pours. This is to stave off waste. Therein lies the dilemma or the trade off.  If this is an alternative to saving taprooms/breweries will tapmasters be a thing of the past?  Everytime you go to get another round you must use a clean glass and a fresh handle cup. In that sense it is like the Golden Corral but with hops. Sitting and surveying the space I wondered how this concept will fare with patrons. Which did bring up scenarios. How will the process be explained to newcomers? Will people complain if pours have too much head? Are people going to try to haggle over a miscalculated pour? Again some beers are priced from 50 cents and up an ounce. Make sure to have a calculator handy. Before you know it you might leave with a healthy tab. I must add that I enjoyed my experience here. The owner was extremely friendly, helpful and explained the process in simplest terms.   The Dooryard is a concept that people  will either embrace or forgo. Isn't the point of going to a taproom to let someone serve you? It surely can't be waiting in a line for someone to decide on a beer! It must be somewhere in between. Whether we like it or not there is a new paradigm shift. Adapt or fade away. I say give this place a try. At least the machine won't ignore you when you got to have your ipa fix."

                "description": "Tried it for the first time recently for my birthday and I was not disappointed. Had a good steak grilled right outside on a pit. The main attraction is definitely the beer. Taps are activated by a proximity RFID card and sold by the ounce so you can try a few ounces before you commit to a pint. Decent selection of craft beer."

                "description": "I have been here three times since they open a couple of weeks ago. The concept is something completely new to San Antonio but I have been to a number of these over the years. I have to say that they are handling it better than any others I have seen. The way that their system ties into untappd makes things all the better for a beer connoisseur. I've spent a lot of time speaking with the owners about the concept and what their plans are and I have to tell you I am very excited about the future of this place. I consider myself a regular already even though I live on the other side of town. I will be sure to make this a weekly if not biweekly start from now on. Already since I've been there they have changed out more than Half a dozen beers to something new. That is key in any kind of good beer establishment.  I encourage anyone in the area who enjoys craft beer to come and have some at the door yard. The owner has already told me they're looking at possibly doing another one so let's make sure this one's a success."

                "description": "This is a great addition to the SA beer scene and I love that you can serve yourself!   I've been twice now, and they had some variation in the beer selection between visits. It leans pretty heavy in the IPA/pale ale direction, along with some sours, pilsners, and cider options. There's also a lot of local and Texas selections. The best part about serving yourself is you don't have to commit to a full pour...you can feel free to try as many as you want without a huge amount.   While the food options are limited, we were able to find some good snacks to eat while we were there! We got the pretzel, which is a given with beer...and delicious, as well as some of the other snack and sandwich options. The food isn't the best (the beer is def the focus), I still was pleasantly surprised at the options and quality.   When you enter, they are happy to explain the process fully so you won't feel like you don't know what's going on. Now we just need more of these places in SA!"

My wife and I asked another couple if they were interested in trying it and the instantly said yes.  We all liked the selection of beers and hard ciders, oh and they do have a small selection of wine behind the bar.  For my drinks I tried the Fiesty Redhead and the Big Spoon.  For food we ordered the Charcuterie plate, I had the Banh Mi sandwich and my wife ordered the Ruben sandwich.  For dessert I had one of the pretzels.  Everything was delicious and like most places you order on your phone.  All 4 of us really enjoyed the Dooryard and will be back"

                "description": "I've been anticipating the opening for about a month now and I finally got to try it today. I certainly love the concept and they had a very diverse food menu. To start, there's a bit of a learning curve with trying to figure out how to order food and getting the card for the drinks. Once you get the hang of it, then it's pretty easy!   For the food, I was excited to see so many different Asian options, and I was hopeful about how it would turn out. All the pieces were right, but somehow they didn't come together for me.   Banh Mi: the bread was super soft and fluffy, the pork belly was so tender and well marinated. THEY ADDED PATE! But I would say it's pretty pate heavy. It's not your traditional banh mi, but you could tell they tried.   Ribs: they were more soy than anything so don't worry if you're not a ginger fan. I wish it was a little sweeter, but the ribs were tasty.   Pork Buns: the buns were soft. It was a very fresh tasting bun, you could taste the mint and pickled onion. I would like a little more sauce on the pulled pork, maybe some hoisin?   For the beers, it was really fun getting to pour your own glass. The selection rotates often, so you'll always have something new to try. I would come back for the self serve drinks, and maybe bring some friends once this pandemic is over"

                "description": "I wish I had remembered to write a review immediately after my visit, but life got in the way.  The venue is enormous and really spacious. It definitely felt like the tables were fairly well spaced apart, which is nice. We did sit in a table near a strange air freshener which got really obnoxious after a while (it was one of those automatic ones that would go off every ten minutes or so and it was really strong). If I'm ever steered in that direction again, I'll object!  That didn't ruin my pizza and beer experience though. I tried the San Antonio Pale Ale and La Muerta Tattersall. Both were on point. We started with the house salads which were were full of fresh, crisp veggies and served with dressing on the side. We then went with the meat head pizza which was crispy and hot and definitely loaded with a whole lot of meat. It's great and if that's what you like, it's perfect! It was a bit much for me, but I'm not going to knock any stars because they give the people what they want!   10/10. I am looking forward to coming back!"

Service was great. Price point was awesome. Pizza was really good and surprised about the BBQ Brisket pizza which my guest and I thought was perfect.   Lot of beer options, stouts, ipas, session ipas, \"Berliners\", lagers, etc. only reason I gave Freetail 4 out of 5 stars was that out of the three beers I tried none of them were really, really good or anything to really write home about. Pretty basic flavor profiles and the berliner wasn't really a berliner. Wish the beers had a stronger flavor profile - if you say Mango but some mango it in so you can taste it, not just a hint of one. Other than that, it was a good experience."

For the most part she did her job but she wasn't very friendly or personable.  Idk if it's because I was a party of 1 or what.  I was there to watch USA vs. MEX Women's match.  She didn't know whether or not they could show it and it took 3 staff to find out after I told them what station.  I guess they don't know how to search cable lol.  When they found it, they choose the \"spanish channel\" lol. My favorite hostess wasn't there either.  However the \"Vader Saber\" was amaze-ballz as was the pizza.  I can't wait till I go back."

Just came for some beer and appetizers and they have a good draft beer selection. I ordered a cherry sour which was pretty good, I didn't get tired of it after a couple of drinks.  For the food we got the red pepper hummus and I would NOT recommend this. It was missing the \"hummus\" taste, can't explain it but it was a no for me. And last we ordered the brisket nachos for 75 ppl! Haha! Just kidding but this is a meal for 2 people, it was plenty!! The only thing I would say is the beans taste like from a can, I would have loved a little more Mexican tasting beans.  I wish I would have tried the pizza, next time!!!"

Not a huge beer person but I had a flight of 4 beers and LOVED them all, and their chicken bacon ranch pizza was so so good for food not being their primary attraction! Highly recommend! Service of course was great too!  Thanks Freetail!"

The tables, bathroom, floor, literally everything was dirty in here. The smell behind the kitchen and bar was the finishing touch. This wasn't the first time we've seen it like this lately. This has always been one of our favorite places the past six years or so but lately it looks like they've lost focus."

They have a great selection of beers, they're really quick(will give you your pour right as you're paying), there's lot of large tables for groups, and if you're hungry there's Project Pollo's food truck parked outside of it.  I'm an IPA drinker so I've dipped into every IPA they have on their beer list and they're all great. The table next to us had a chess match going. A great place for dog lovers, plenty of doggos here enjoying pets.  Have came here a handful of times and have always had a great experience. The staff is top notch, cheers!"

I finally got around to going with a friend and her BF.  He was into beer and she was okay with it as well.  The space was a nice converted storefront and staff was friendly even as it got busier. The beers I had were pretty good, I'm into sours and their one was good.   I appreciated that they had a food truck permanently attached to their space but it was a vegan chicken spot, which was not really what I'm looking for when I'm drinking a beer."

Beers are unlike California IPAs with a little more bitterness to it. Cute tanks! Like it's a home brew place. :) If you're tired of the riverwalk and chain beers take a scooter and come here. The riverwalk don't have taps from some of these smaller breweries."

Highlight of the stop was the excellent beer, with styles for everyone and everything I tasted was really well done. Setup is awesome, with a ton of space and great vibes. Both a brewery dog AND brewery cat lounging around and added to the chill, welcoming, community brew vibes. Just a great place to hang, would be really great for a group outing, or a date night. Lots to like at Roadmap! Anytime I am passing through I will make it a point to swing in. Drink local!"

Everyone who works there is very knowledgeable about beer. They are pet friendly and even have a resident cat who lives there. There are also dog treats by the cash register.  They don't have food inside but the food truck outside is delicious and you can bring your food inside.  They also have a really large space so distancing is not a problem. Also, try the popcorn from the Alamo City Popcorn Company by the register, I recommend the Spicy Buffalo."

I still can't decide and don't think I need to. Both are walking distance from each other! Sooo do yourself a favor and may a brew hopping day out of it followed by a walk on the riverwalk.

Our server was great with suggestions and we had multiple people check on us during our visit.  We had some beer and lots of food.  The Beer Twists were so good, we wished there were more (the picture is half of them already eaten, we were really hungry).  3 of us had pizza and 1 had wings.  All of the pizza were personal sized and perfectly proportioned.  The crust was brushed with some amazing goodness, that even my daughter ate hers.  Our server made sure to keep the left over beer cheese on the table to dip our extra crust in and YUMMY!  My son had the wings and said they were really good.  We will definitely be back.  The crew at Back Unturned definitely made us feel welcome and at home!"

                "description": "First off let me give credit where credit is due, back unturned has phenomenal pizza and beer, seriously some of the best pizza I've had in awhile, the restaurant is a cool hangout spot near downtown, but they're not without their problems.  First time I came here I was beyond disappointed; I set up for a weekend date with my wife to try this spot out before catching a movie. Parking was a pain, we had to pay a meter or pay for the parking they offered in their lot. Unfortunately, they were hosting an event in the back lot with a $25 dollar cover charge! We just wanted to grab some pizza and  beer in which their normal dining room wasn't available, only the special event! If you want to have special events fine, but don't  strong arm all your customer who go out of their way just to grab a bite! So we payed for parking and had to spend our money elsewhere.  I gave them another shot this past week and my overall experience had highs and lows.  First of the negatives, they're pricing is high, probably not worth it for one person tab, you can't get out of here without paying $25-30bucks for a pizza, and a couple beers. Two people would be a better value but still they don't have hot and ready prices if that's what you're expecting. The wait staff wasn't very attentive and didn't check on us much, kinda just had a \"MEH\" attitude.   Despite all this, their pizza and beer it's pretty freaking awesome. Their crust is perfect, crispy and thin with just the perfect amount of pull when you bite into it. Their toppings are all above average soooooo good, probably reflecting the higher than average prices. The spicy Hawaiian had the typical controversial pineapple but more I've a sweet and tangy sauce with loads of bacon and jalapeño, really an awesome reinvention of the sweet and salty play on pizza!  I do wish their pizzas we're a bit larger, even if the amount of toppings stay the same just give us more of that beautiful crust, sauce and cheese!  Also I will say they were a little light on sauce fore me personally.   Their wings were not my favorite, I'm not big on baked wings, they were lest crispy and more chewy. Baked or grilled can be just as good as fried but think they needed longer or turn the temp up to get those crispy edges!  Their beer gets an A plus, you can't go bad with any options especially when paired with a good pizza."

                "description": "Decided it was time to try the brunch menu today.  At first I decided to order off the small sides just to try a few plates. However, the honeyed goat cheese toast was on the menu but no longer offered :(   So I went with blueberry French toast and a side of bacon. The bacon was not really cooked enough for my taste, but it had a good flavor. The French toast is made from sour dough which means it does not soak up a custard and it gets crusty on the sides. I liked the flavors but was not as expected.  Loved the mimosa. Good size for only $6."

                "description": "came here with my boyfriend after a friend recommended me to try it.  My boyfriend really enjoys trying different breweries and different kinds of beers. He said \"i enjoyed it but wouldn't be back if i was back in town\"   We loved our experience here though our waiter was really good at explaining to us the different beers they had and gave us great recommendations.   We got one pepperoni pizza to eat with the beer and it was really good! its very very thin so if you're not about that then don't get pizza haha  You can also buy their beer as a 6 pack in cans which i thought was really cool.   I agree.. I don't know if I would be back but I would recommend to those who haven't been.  from the outside it may seem abandoned and even a restaurant so don't think your gps took you to the wrong place like we though."

It is very near the Riverwalk, so we decided to come in and have a beer. Good choice.  We sat at the bar and the bartender was a younger guy and I ordered an IPA, it was solid.  The bartender was nice and gave me some free stickers and everyone was having a great time.  Great little tap room, especially after a great BBQ dinner at Augie's."

The variety of beers is what puts the cherry on top to this masterpiece. Customer Service was also a huge plus. They were all very attentive and welcoming.  10/10000000 Recommend   P.S.

                "description": "We have tickets at the Tobin Center and wanted to eat close by beer our show. We are always interested in local breweries and my husband loves pizza, plus this was a quick walk on the Riverwalk. I like that you can get your pizza in the six inch size. We ordered two different ones (pepperoni Gorgonzola and the Formaggio e Bacon). Both were delicious, but we preferred the Gorgonzola one, which also had a balsamic glaze. The service was excellent. I'm sure this place is really busy on the weekend. Not too bad for a Wednesday, either. We'll definitely be back. This is a thin crust pizza, so if that's not your jam, you should know that. It's hard to find a Porter or stout at the micro breweries around here, so we were pleased with the milk stout tonight. Anyone that can point me to more local dark beers? We look forward to trying the Rio De Leeches and the double chocolate coconut when they get it on tap."

                "description": "We'll definitely return. But not for the service.  Our waiter, a guy with a calf tattoo wasn't unfriendly, but he wasn't welcoming either. Kind of aloof if I'm being honest.    We order the Rio de Leche and a cold brew with vanilla sweet cream.  The former is a sweet stout, much like you'd expect a dulce de leche stout to taste. The cold brew was properly bold and very refreshing for today's heat.   To eat,  the prosciutto, mushroom, and arugula (an upcharge) pizza. The pizzas are 6-inches at the biggest, it seems, and this particular pie was topped with shaved parm and mozzarella. We'd definitely get this again. I ordered the strawberry stuffed French toast, which wasn't a prominently strawberry dish. Instead, it was only topped with one berry, thinly sliced. Very disappointed with this as I feel it was a bait and switch. The \"stuffing\" was a thin custard which was tasty.  The bread was a sourdough that complimented the sweetness of the filling very well.  They offer a 10% military discount and that's always a nice gesture. Parking may be iffy on busy nights, but we were able to find a spot right outside with no issues. The interior, also, looks like it can get packed on busy weekends. The one downside to the meals is that there's no heat lamps on the pass (which is just a metal rack) so unless you're waitstaff is on it, food may get cold as it waits for pick up."

They attempted to social distance by having tables in between blocked off, but since it's a small place in general it didn't really work. The service was great! Legit all the workers there were so attentive; they weren't even our waiter and they still asked if we needed anything! The food came out HOT and relatively quick with the number of people there. We got the Spicy Hawaiian and Formagio Bacon. They were both sooooo goooood. They were piping hot, so be careful! And they have a good selection of beers too! Will most definitely be back!!!!!"

Ok, for real, my friend and I wanted a place near our friends' house to chat and have a drink and this was the first place to pop up.

The food is alright, I wasn't to please with my fried pickles. But that wasn't a show stopper for us.   Well spaced seating areas. They have live music here.

                "description": "I love this place, the people there usually seem like they love their job. However, today... there was a server at the window who was not friendly or respectful. The first time I went there, she was in a rush to get everyone served which is fine, people need to get served but ma'am you work in customer service but home girl was legit yelling \"NEXT CUSTOMER OVER HERE,\" and for me it was the tone too. I was giving her my order, and each entree I ordered, she told me, \"just a sec.\" I'm not aware of the system they have there but I guarantee it's not that slow. Even if so, you speak to people with respect, your in the service industry and your a grown women. You should know better.   Hops and Hounds always has a band playing so the music is loud and it's right by the windows where you order. It's hard for both the customer and bartender to be heard correctly. The second time I went she seemed so irritated. I was purchasing alcohol and didn't have my wallet on me bc my tab was still open, I asked for two margaritas and she looked at me up and down, said she needs my ID. I asked my child to get  it from my boyfriend at our table, she again with a tone, \"what else,\" and I said it's all alcohol that I need. I ordered two margs. Told her lime on the rocks, mango frozen. She said the mango is going to look weird bc all the mixes are still green from st. Patrick's day, that's what I heard. Like I said the band was loud Af. She puts down a lime/mango marg on the rocks, and a lime frozen. I said I'm sorry ma'am, but I need a Lime on the rocks and a mango frozen. She then processed to explain herself about how she confirmed the order with me in the first place, and I said well I'm sorry ma'am I can barely hear you. Then from what I heard, she says ok, mango rocks, and dips to go make it. I tried to stop her by saying wait, and then I get the girl next to her to stop so I don't confuse her again and confirm the order. The girl tries to get her attention, she doesn't even turn around, but says to the other server, \"she said she heard you.\" My kid told me about the ice cream float, and I tell her... instantly looks pissed. The amount of fake energy this woman gave off, along with a rude attitude, the rushing of customers... eww. Go find somewhere else to work bc customer service is just not it. When I got to my table, my boyfriend asked me what was wrong and I told him how I felt about her service and even my sister in law said, the Latina with the long pony tail and hoops, yeah she's not friendly at all. Uhh, GIRL BYE   However, I ended up closing my tab out with Alysia by the Large Dog park and uhh, sweet as can be. Said hi with a beautiful smile, what can I get for you... I asked her when I close my tab does it go to the server that opened it or to bar crew as a whole, and she told me that they split everything at the end of the night. Once she told me that, I immediately knew why this girl thinks it's okay to talk to people however she likes, she's going to get paid anyway. Typical. I told her that sucks bc there's a bartender back there fucking  it up for everyone and then proceeded to tell her about my experience with her. She said she would talk to her and I said, I'm not a complainer but I served for 4 years and managed, and there's a way you talk to people.  Our float never came but oh well. I love hops and hound, I just hope they weed out the bad energy from there."

Saturday, we finally decided to check it out even though we don't have a fido. It was surely a busy time!  My husband decided to try the bone-in chicken wings and got the 12 piece with BBQ sauce and the Korean Pepper sauce. I decided to get the kid's meal with 6 boneless wings, tots and apple juice. We did get a Bark-arita to share too with 2 mango, 2 prickly pear, 1 strawberry and 1 lime. Great flavor with the chicken wings! The tater tots were awesome. They originally gave me the fries instead of the tots and then I got a bonus portion of tots! The Bark-arita was actually a lot to share between the 2 of us. Maybe a draft beer next time!  Love the outdoor space, the fan with misters and seeing people with their pooches. Definitely will be back for the wings again and try other foods."

The dog play area has chairs to sit and hang around other dogs or you can grab a picnic table outside of the dog area and leave your dog in the play area. Tons of dogs on a Friday night but for the most part all playing well together."

                "description": "Drinks are great and what I would consider fairly priced! Overall it's a fun place to hang out for brunch or an early supper with your dogs! Definitely more for the \"younger crowed\" (20s and 30s) but still enough things for your teens or pre-teens to at least stay engaged..... biggest issue I've had all three times I've been is the amount of time you wait for your food which causes it to be like warm or cold. Food is also a tad overpriced but still tasty enough that it won't bother you."

                "description": "Great spot to be with your dogs while enjoying drinks and food.  Unique to have patios and dog parks combined with bar and food.  They also have live music here to enjoy on the weekends.  The weekend we stopped by with our two dogs, there was a dog spa service as well.  They have bars located by the dog park areas so you can watch your dogs while enjoying alcoholic beverages.  Make sure to start a tab at the main building to be able to order drinks at the dog park. I haven't tried the food menu yet, but I did see that they serve food for dogs!  My dogs enjoyed being off leash inside the large dog park, where they can play with other dogs.  Make sure to hold on to your drinks when dogs get rowdy and body slam your table.  The floors are astro turf with rocks around the fencing area so you don't have to worry about your dogs getting dirty.  I'm excited to come back to have fun with the dogs!"

In addition, the food is pretty good and they have a great drink selection. It's pretty kid friendly too. They support the local shelters and it's just a fun atmosphere. I would give them five, but the parking is a mess because it's so busy."

                "description": "Eh.. it started with being overcharged. I had ordered one cheeseburger and one kid's chicken strips. Somehow it was $46. After paying I asked why so high the cashier found out I was charged for an extra cheeseburger. They told me they would fix it and promptly brought my new bill to my table.. but after reading it I still had extra food in there.. the second time requesting for them to review my bill seemed like a bit more of a hassle as I got some push back. They did apologize and they were very friendly so their customer service was actually really good. Food wise though, you definitely don't go there for the food. Chicken strips were completely bland. My group had about 8 kids and none of them liked their strips. Burgers were not tasty either. It is just a good place for dogs and kids.. that's about it."

                "description": "One of our favorite spots to go to, we visit hops and hounds many times a week. Unfortunately, the more we come the more it seems we find problems with owners bringing aggressive dogs. On multiple occasions we've had dogs jumping on us trying to get to our dogs and fight, as well as pulled other peoples dogs out of fights too often. It seems to be comical for the aggressive dog owners and unimportant to the staff as they \"did not see it\"  It's incredibly frustrating and anxiety inducing to have a fun place we used to love to spend our weekend at, turn into a bad experience almost every time. As an owner of three dogs, one being extremely dog aggressive, i find it incredibly irresponsible to bring your dog into the dog park itself, and something better needs to be done here by both the staff and dog owners before someone ends up hurt."

The bartenders dressed it carelessly and made it difficult to hold without getting dirty. There are 2 dog areas one for small dogs and one for large. There should be a limit on number of dogs in each area as the big dog section was very crowded. There was a patio for a performer /band but no live music on a Saturday night. The obstacle courses seemed interesting"

Unfortunately this is the third time we've gone and the experience is the same. VERY LONG wait times for your food and when you finally get it... it's not good. The burgers are dry, chicken sandwiches are unflavored. Aesthetically, the food is appealing but once you actually taste it you're left with disappointment. Three poor experiences is enough for our family not to go back."

It's somewhere I can find myself just sitting for a while enjoying the company of friends. The staff was so friendly and very attentive.   The beer here is really good, and I don't even like beer so that's saying something. The Bulls Bock has to be the best beer I've had.   We got the Bavarian pretzel, house salad, and Cubano sandwich. Everything was great. No complaints on the taste or quality of the food or beer.   My only thing would be price racked up to over a 100 for two people.   But I think I would come for beer and a pretzel vs a meal."

                "description": "Longtab Brewery is a welcomed addition to this area of San Antonio's culinary scene, they have excellent micro brewed beer crafted in house, and only beer crafted in their house, beer lover or not you have to appreciate the love they show to it.    All in all this is an excellent place to hang and grab a couple of  beers, with excellent snacks and sandwiches once that buzzed hunger monster strikes. I will say though not to treat this as a gastro pub, their focus is much more on the beer and less on the food.  Not to say the food isn't good, my grilled ham and cheese was excellent! But It was simple, most people could've made it at home in about ten min.  That's not a jab to the restaurant, it's simple and makes sense and I enjoyed it thoroughly!   My dad had the brat and same theme, it's was very good but very simple, just something to tie you over with your brews.   As far as negatives I did notice a few things but honestly they're more of observations. I would say a appreciate the small fresh menu but it's a little overly simple for my taste, at the very least give an option for fries as opposed to chips or some kinda interesting sides! Maybe some German themed beers ones to compliment the beer types even and entrées.  A couple more menu items sure would be nice, especially something that wasn't hand held, I think that would really get them closer to a 5 start spot.  Also pricing for the portion size I would say price if is flirting the line of being high, beer seems to be pretty average cost wise.   Also service wasn't bad or anything but it was very laid back, almost a little too laid back if you know what I mean. And as much as I love the view of the awesome brewery vats and equipment without a glass dividing wall like most places similar to this place have, you get all those  strong smells associated with it, it could be a little off-putting for some but not unbearable.   All in all a great place to hangout and grab a few beers and maybe a snack or two, it's nice to see more places like this making their way to SA and sticking to their guns, this is not your sub par bar or ice house by far."

Located in an area full of car repair shops, you could easily pass it up.   This place is for everyone. It's a coffee shop, brewery and they have food. They also serve wine for those that don't want beer or coffee.  The most surprising thing is that their food is legit. It's delicious and they serve large portions. I didn't expect much from their food, but I was wrong. They also sell canned beer and coffee to go.   We started by sharing the soft pretzel. It's a perfect appetizer for beer.   For my meal, I had the Blackened shrimp hoagie. it came with large pieces of shrimp. It was perfectly seasoned. The side was house seasoned chips. I can't complain. It was a good meal.   For beer, you can always as for half pours so you can try most than one. This place sells typical beer. Nothing too crazy.   The wine served is from Messina Hof. It seems like they support local Texas businesses. They also have cake thieves bakery items for sale.   There's plenty of options for seating. Parking is available on site."

                "description": "What started out as a Yelp search for pizza ended up bringing me to a new brew pub in my own backyard. Who woulda thunk! I was pleasantly surprised to find this place opened up in my old stomping grounds and I was none the wiser, shame on me. So, here I go to check it out and soon find Longtab in a commercial business park that I have driven by hundreds of times before.  As I walk up, you'll notice the outside is painted in Army green and this is for a purpose. Come to find, this establishment is owned and operated by former Special Forces members and Green Berets. To all, thank you for your service! Upon entry, I was greeted with a friendly, \"hello and you can sit wherever you like\". The inside is super clean and neat. There is a front area with tables and a separate back area with sofa and more tables.   After looking the menu over, I start of with the pulled pork sandwich and the Stilleto. The Stilleto is a Belgian brown that is dark but not super heavy and had notes of coffee and chocolate. Good bold taste.  Next, the pulled pork sandwich came out and I was ready to sink my teeth into this bad boy. The meat was super tender, juicy and season well. The challah bread was soft and soaked up all the juicy goodness from the meat. The side of black pepper kettle chips paired well with the sandwich and completed the meal.  I asked one of the managers about there selection of beers and he told me that they do rotate the offerings and will have seasonal offerings as they become available so I'll be sure to keep up to date on that.  Overall, I really like this place and the fact it is so close to me and that it support those that have supported us makes me definitely want to come back."

                "description": "Epic establishment!! The food was absolutely delicious. We ordered the massive pretzel which was cooked perfectly. They need to give you more beer cheese dip because the one cup won't remotely take care of how big the pretzel is. The currywurst and bratwursts were so delicious. The beers were so smooth and we tried a variety. I did end up spending more money than I expected because the environment lended itself to a fun time. The servers and bartenders were so fun and friendly. They were attentive, talked to patrons and made the atmosphere lively. The crowd is diverse but primarily veterans since it's a veteran owned small business. They are only open till 10 pm during the week which was a bummer because I could have enjoyed that atmosphere much longer. Looks like I'll need to come back soon. Hidden off of Bandera road; it's close to our home at the border of Leon Valley/San Antonio. They also have a wide variety of glassware you can purchase as well as apparel with their logo. Great times and I'll see you soon!"

All the food was served hot and tasted great, really enjoyed the pairings for the sausage plate. Loved the music played and overall atmosphere as well. Our server was not good though; she was slow with the orders and of course forgot an item ordered because she negated to write anything down. However, the service recovery was immaculate from the gentleman who came over to apologize about the missing dish and had it quickly sent out. Did not do dessert but did bring the peaches and cream cheese pop pastry to my niece. She said it reminded her of an empanada and she liked it a lot."

They were hosting a special car and cigar event the day we visited so half of the venue was reserved.  However we found a small space at a communal table to belly up to and at one point one of the staff members came over to talk to us and sat down to talk to us for a bit.  Not only did she share info about their brewery but about other breweries in the area.  Felecia, the event/bar manager made sure we enjoyed the beers we were poured and if we didnt made sure we were offered something different.   Huge outdoor space for those amazing weather days.....nice indoor space with a few TVs.  Definitely check out Alamo Brewing!  Great merch as well!  Sorry Steelers bartender maybe next year man!

We waited an hour and a half to get a small plate of pulled pork nachos. Unbelievable. There weren't any other food vendors (Unless you count the Girl Scouts and their cookies).  Recipe for disaster selling alcohol and food taking 1.5 hours for a small plate of nachos. Total disappointment.   The beer = 5 stars Experience = 0 stars"

For food, there's a variety of sandwiches and snacks in case you're hungry.  They have optional spacious indoor and outdoor seating ready.

They smoke their own pork and turkey, which was delicious.  Food: Pulled pork nachos were pretty damn good. Would definitely get again.   Drinks: They have a pretty decent list of beers. Not the greatest variety but they have their focuses and they do a great job.   We would for sure return and maybe bring a football to play on their 50 year field in front of the tables."

There is plenty of outdoor seating and they are now offering table service to ensure social distancing. We started off with a few of the beers (both of which were delicious) and a giant pretzel! The pretzel was hot and very soft, and served with a very tasty mustard. The staff was very friendly and gave us a few recommendations as we tried another couple of beers during our visit. Overall a wonderful place to spend a few hours and grab a drink, especially on a nice day! We will definitely be coming back again soon."

I had a little trouble finding it because there is construction going on in surrounding area, but I did not give up! I knew it was going to be worth finding!   I was right. They have a massive parking lot, so no worries on finding a spot. The brewery is more than just a line of taps. There is a large biergarten area with benches and plenty of games to play. Large bathrooms in a separate building as well which are super clean. While there is not a ton of seating at the main bar, you can easily find a spot to sit or stand just about anywhere else. This brewery hosts a ton a big events that draw large crowds such as Oktoberfest, a wing festival and even a weekly bacon and bingo night.   My visit was extra pleasant thanks to the awesome staff. Big shoutout to Stephanie who was the best beertender I have come across in a LONG time! Super friendly, very helpful and just a genuinely awesome person who made my visit to Alamo Beer a five star experience. She helped me pick an awesome beer to enjoy and I will definitely return next time I am in the area. Bring your family and friends!"

Came on a date night and decided to go for a flight to have a variety. Flights come in 4s.  My memory is too bad to remember the names but I mostly go for the light beers. I truly enjoyed everything I sampled and the beer was so fresh from the tap.   Great environment to hang out with friends, kids, and your dog. I saw a lot people with dogs and kids. On the website it says they host tours on Thursdays and Saturdays for free and you do not have to make reservations, but must wear closed toe shoes. They also have a corn hole league for the competitive sports fans.    Also, ladies the restrooms are amazing. Plenty of stalls and they are roomy. They kept the restroom very clean and stocked with the essentials."

Leaving a bad review in a pandemic of a local business is generally poor taste in my opinion but since this place clearly doesn't care about the pandemic why should I???  Place had a huge, crowded line inside with NO MASK OR SOCIAL DISTANCING REENFORCEMENT WHATSOEVER. And the lady behind the counter was wearing an ineffective glittery mesh mask that I could see through! There were signs up for it but everyone in this industry knows damn well no one reads signs and you're gonna have to tell people to put their freaking mask on and follow the rules.  On another note the guys working the counter were lovely and I'm sorry they have to work somewhere with such little regard to their health well being. Do better!"

                "description": "Busted Sandal was one of the local breweries I wanted to check out and I got the chance when I friend came to visit from Austin. So, the San Antonio location is in a pretty dark little warehouse/industrial area and Google Maps will take you to the back side- don't be fooled by this.  The tap room is pretty large and especially midweek there's not many people there. Our beertender, Isaac was friendly and so were some of the others sitting there enjoying a beer.  They have a good range of beers, ranging from easy and accessible to hop-heavy to a decent Scotch ale you don't see it too much.   My buddy even got a free brew since it kicked before a full pour could be drawn.  They don't have a kitchen here but they do have some snacks. We ended up getting the 'charcuterie plate' which was just cheese and salami, not exactly what you imagine when you hear charcuterie, maybe a little bit more variety to it."

                "description": "I did not find a beer I fell in love with. Overall, all the beers were alright. The place is small. The parking lot cramped. When we went it was a bit awkward. If someone laughed too loud or a group got louder than another then the whole brewery became quiet...Idk...Just weird vibes. The workers were great. Just the beer was...alright."

                "description": "We came here on a whim last week and it turned out they JUST got to reopen since covid started and we were their FIRST customers since covid! The way it is now is that you can not only buy a pint anymore. To meet the covid requirement, you buy a commemorative covid cup that comes with tokens to redeem 2 drinks and one snack. I hate the waste of plastic, but I get it. The cup is funny too.   It seemed like there is quite a following of the brewery though. We were only there for an hour and there were two groups of guys that came in with their pints. I guess there was a discount if they brought in their own pint(?) I'm probably wrong. But everyone seemed to know each other and it seemed wholesome."

                "description": "Had a great time at this little unexpected spot. This is one of 2 locations, a little smaller, and completely indoor. There's a couple of tables available, spaced out well for groups, and some bar seating available. The bartender was super helpful and got us set up with some flights and charcuterie board! Got to try every beer on tap and really found something for everyone in our group. The charcuterie board was a nice snack, and when we ran out of bread it was replenished so we could finish of the hummus and cheese!"

                "description": "Ok, Let's Review... First time here and for  \"Porterpalooza\"... Beer selection was good using El Robusto as the base. .  DJ, inside seating, food truck and an alley for a beer garden..( Eh, not great). Bar staff was quick and friendly. They blew out of two selections the first hour in.  Limited ticket sales was a good idea, with limited hours. Steady turn over of patrons and two unisex bathrooms. Not bad.   Even though this was a prepaid event with limited ticket sales, it wasn't organized or well thought out. Several walk-ins were confused and not handled properly outside. Also the times we went to the bar we observed nobody tipping. My partner and I being from the entertainment and service industry,  we found this to be very sad, but expected at a pre paid event.  That doesn't make it right, Millennials.. \"Pay up for service ya cheap bastards!\"  I dunno, we like the products, although not sold in our stores other than a couple of selections in cans and not porters or stouts. Not many on tap at the brewery on Nitro that we experienced or appeared to us when served  They are looking for investors. What they need is a manager to run the tasting rooms and make them enjoyable with the space they have and selections they offer.  Room for improvement, but we like the products."

                "description": "This brewery makes some good brews and deserves some attention!  As others have mentioned, it's on the smallish side, but the good news is, they've busted down the walls and have expanded into the space next door. It's not finished out yet, so it's not the purdiest, but you can still hang out on that side of the joint if you need more room.  They currently have nine brews on tap - IPA's, porters, and even a couple of the standard lagers and wheats for boring guys such as myself.  Six of the beers are available year round, but they have several other seasonal types that are rotated in and out.  Check their web site and look for the \"La Chancla\" series of beers for availability.    Purchase a pint glass for $5 and get $3 refills on Wednesday nights - this is a good deal that you DO NOT WANT TO PASS UP!  Parking is kind of tough and Google Maps takes you to the shopping strip but it's hard to find your way to the front entrance - not the fault of Busted Sandal - totally a Google Maps issue.  Ask for a tour of the brewing room - it's VERY cool, and you get to hear about the entire process and how passionate they are about their brews and the brewing process.  Bonus - there's a really chill and laid back dog that wanders around the place and lounges about.  I don't remember what his name is, but I shall call thee \"Jake\" as it seems to be a fitting name - unless it's a female dog.  :)  The two brews I tried (and thoroughly enjoyed) were:   Finding Friday Mexican Lager  Jeff-E-Weizen (no, I didn't spell it wrong - it's their twist on a traditional Hefeweizen)  Thanks to the Busted Sandal for keeping boring guys (such as myself) who aren't on the latest quest for IPAs or sours in mind.  Love your brews bro!!!"

                "description": "$3 dollar beers on friday's, ugly sweater parties, small room. Dedicated to making its patrons happy with specials all the time. Bring a pint glass, as they sometimes have specials for just bringing your own pint glass. Lively anniversary parties with food trucks and special glasses for anniversaries. I highly recommend getting their early on weekends as their is parking, but far if the main spots are filled. The bathroom is always cleaning and the tour is quick as it is a small but fun packing location.  I like when people are on beer tours from outside the city and provide a varied insight on the drinks. The beers are often on specials on the wall so be sure to stop by and check out the board. They take cash or card."

One recommendation is I wish they had food or snacks to munch on while you're enjoying their pretty large flights of beer. All the employees I've met there have been more than helpful!

                "description": "I'm a brewery connoisseur, I love all things brewed. Busted Sandal was a spot I stumbled upon miraculously, by the help of the beer gods I'm sure. It's a little hidden gem off of  Fredicksberg and 410, like many in that area. It's a small brewery but very unique indeed. I love the vibes and of course the beer options on tap. Their IPA's are off the chain but the Mexican lager is not too bad it self. The hospitality is top notch and I had a good time with the regulars and bartender. It was a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon.   My first sample was Finding Friday Mexican Lager their most popular according to Mandy. It's a smooth lighter option but with a nice finish in taste.   Next was the Slippery Rock IPA, which I'm a IPA lover hands down and it was not too hoppy just the right amount of hops and flavor was good for me.   After my fav was the Wine Barre, so unique and different definitely a brine taste that wine has with a beer finish. You have to try it to understand.   Lastly was the Hop Dong IPA, a good way to end the brew adventure and left me wanting more.   I will be returning for the rest of the beers on tap and to visit my new friends. Awesome brewing experience I highly recommend for a cozy low key spot."

I liked how they also offered wine as a drink option. Looks like they are building a 2nd part. We sat in the 2nd part, in the dark, with a fan pointed at us. The chairs aren't too comfortable, as some were falling apart. Prices were great. Need to add more restrooms once they expand."

                "description": "Currently at time of this review: they're doing impromptu beer tours. Nice clean facilities and they can their own and distribute the beer from here! They just started serving beer flights 7/7/18 -9 beers for $15, what a steal! Also they have pint glasses $5 with $3pint refills on Thursdays (hint hint). They serve half pints too and barefoot wine for the winos. Momo and the Staff was so super friendly, homey and even got to meet the brewers who took care to explain each beer! Great selection of beers-I am partial to the porter, Mexican lager, and fire pit wit. Their 210 ale is akin to miller but heftier, aromatic and zillion times better! Can't comment on the IPAs since I'm not an IPA drinker. Watermelon ale was very aromatic, fruity yet light since they use real watermelon and there is high turnover so try it while you can. It's easy to drink if you like fruity beers.   Getting there: when you turn on Oaklawn and see the busted sandal sign it shows a right arrow, but really it's an IMMEDIATE RIGHT AND RIGHT hook around to it.   What a cute little place that is expanding! I never knew it existed so close to me until now as I am leaving SA! They're going to expand the bar area to eventually 20taps and a hang out area. Look out for their anniversary brew in August using a special TX plant!! I really hope they keep their homey feel. Lots of room to grow -looking forward to seeing them the next time I'm in TX! Loved it! (Check out my pix of the place!)"

Meaghan did a great job of connecting and although she is new to beer she made a big effort to speak of how she's learned to appreciate it. Mario showed up later and filled in the gaps.

The door doesn't say what their Sunday hours are but they were open and the bartender, Moses, invited us right in. We ordered a flight of 9 beers for $15 to begin with. The bartender was very informative in explaining each brew to us. We even got to try a new one that they didn't have on the menu yet. Both owners showed up during our visit. One had a good conversation with us about the beers and the other gave us a tour. This brewery is small but they are expanding and renovating. I'm pretty sure we just became regulars."

I booked this tour for my buddy's bachelor party, and Dan was super helpful throughout the entire planning experience (Covid caused some changes in group size and tour time.)  Mike was a super knowledgeable tour guide, and his choice in music for the van was fantastic. Mike was also super personable and answered the entire groups questions (Even if they'd been asked earlier in the trip )  The breweries and staff (Especially Dos Sirenos) that we went to were great, and the beer was even better.   The whole experience was fantastic, and If I am ever back in San Antonio I will definitely re-book.   P.S. Make sure to eat at least once on the tour so you can enjoy more beer"

                "description": "We booked craft cruiser for a bachelorette party in Fredericksburg and it was amazing! Everything was taken care of for us- we were picked up from our air bnb and driven to 3 wineries, then driven home. Dan did a lot of legwork making sure that wineries were open due to CV19, and letting us know what to expect. He even made reservations for us at two of the wineries we visited. In a very uncertain time, he took care of everything for us and everything went smoothly so we were able to have a good time and not stress about planning the wine tours! He made recommendations for places we could go and customized our tour for us. Our driver John was awesome! He was very friendly and took great care of our group (including opening the van door for us). He was very responsive via text inbetween each stop and always had the van pulled up and ready for us when we were ready to go. He also was our stand in photographer for our group at each location and was a TOTAL trooper. All around an amazing experience whether you're wanting a wine tour or brewery tour in the San Antonio or hill country area. And to make things EVEN better they cost about 1/3 of the price of other tours. Check them out!"

                "description": "I was super excited when I came across the SA Craft Cruiser on Instagram! I mean what better way to spend a gorgeous San Antonio day than with beer and pizza?! I had never been to ANY of the stops on the tour, so I was looking forward to knocking some things off my to do list! Tours are always the best way to fulfill that list! I did the ALL-Inclusive tour. The ALL Inclusive tour includes:  *Safe transportation to each brewery *Brewery tours *Souvenir *Unlimited tastings *A meal on Saturday and Sunday tours  Saturday Tour: *Alamo Beer Co *Freetail Brewing Co.  *Busted Sandal Brewing Co.  Start time: 11am  The tour met up at Pizza Italia (a local pizzeria) located at 3023 Thousand Oaks Rd. Upon arrival the group was greeted warmly by Dan our host with most! We walked into Pizza Italia and were led to the bar where we were given a few samples chosen by Dan from the 30+ beers on tap. Dan offered samples on anything we wanted to try after that.  While we sat at the bar, pizzas were being ordered and waivers were signed for tour permissions. The pizzas came out pretty fast and we were directed to our table where pitchers of water were waiting along with cups. Tea and sodas were offered as well. A variety of pizzas were ordered for our group, from pepperoni and sausage to veggie! I loooove ranch with my pizza, so Dan must have read my mind, he came and placed cups of ranch on the tables. The ranch was so good!  I had the pep/sausage and it was delicious! Dan made sure we had everything we needed during our lunch! We had plenty of time to eat and converse with the people on the tour. After a great lunch it was time to jump into the Craft Cruiser.  I must admit when I saw the Craft Cruiser I wondered how we were all going to fit in there but we did and VERY comfortably! The Craft Cruiser was very clean and airconditioned well.  Dan had great tunes playing and took requests as well for our drive to the breweries.  Second stop was Alamo Beer Co. located at 202 Lamar.  While I've had their beer (Golden Ale is my fave) I had never been to Alamo.  I ordered a beer flight and each of the beers I tried were really good! Alamo Beer Co. is super cool and I enjoyed it.  (Sidenote: I had a massive headache that started before the tour and once Dan knew I had a headache he found some tylenol for me while we were at Alamo which was super nice!) Again we had plenty of time to enjoy the atmosphere and enjoy more beer!   Third stop had us at Freetail Brewing Co. located at 2000 S. Presa St. Freetail was very spacious! I loved the day of the dead themed art on the walls! It was very bright and super cool. I ordered a flight to start off with and all the pours were good! Dan made sure we were taken care and asked us if we needed more beer. Freetail has free popcorn, which was delicious and perfect with our beers!   Last but surely not least our final stop was the Veteran owned Busted Sandal Brewing Co. located at 7114 Oaklawn Drive. I honestly was not aware of this brand of craft beer until my tour. The tasting room was very small BUT they are working on expanding so you need not worry! We were totally comfy and the guests at the bar who were already there welcomed our group.   Mike DiCicco, founder, brewer and USAF Veteran greeted us in the back for the brewery tour. We learned alot about Busted Sandal, the process and future plans. We were able to see the canning process up close and personal which was super exciting! I never realized how much goes into the process of canning! I had a chance to weigh a few cans as well. Dan worked the canning line while we were there to help out. I learned that he volunteers at Busted Sandal to help support local which is truly amazing! After the tour we had more beer and were able to keep our pint glass! (If you bring your glass on Wednesdays pints are $3) Sadly, it was time to depart from our final stop and head back to our starting point Pizza Italia.    End Time: 5pm  Dan handed out koozies before we said goodbye! I totally enjoyed the tour! It was absolutely fantastic! I had the opportunity to visit places I've never been to, I met really cool people, and had a plethora of beer! I highly recommend the tour to people who live here or who are visiting! From couples, to friends, birthdays, bachelor/bachelorette parties, just because, and Sunday Funday it is the perfect outing! Dan was AMAZING and made the tour fantastic, he made sure we were all happy! I look forward to future tours!"

                "description": "What an enjoyable experience! If you're looking for a legit brewery tour where you'll get to barhop at all your favorite local brewery's, start off with some legit pizza , and end with a great tour and souvenir glass, this is your tour to hit up!   I was very impressed with the smoothness of the tour and how it flowed throughout the day. It began at 11:00 am. and ended at 5:00 pm. Every Brewery we went to, we got to sample the drinks, and drink as much as we wanted all while having our DD ( craft cruiser shuttle us around town ). It was absolutely wonderful. I would definitely go on this with several buddies of mine who are beer drinkers. They also have wine tours as well! It was a clean, organized, and efficient tour with a knowledgeable operator."

                "description": "We heard about this through a mutual friend of ours and wanted to do something different since my fiancee Steve was turning 40, so a big milestone birthday!  Dan was so helpful through the whole process from start to finish.  He provided a private link for me to send to our guests so they can each pay separately and choose an all inclusive for us beer connoisseurs or a pay as you go option.  We wanted to thank our guests and provide lunch we opted for Smoke Shack which delicious!  They were there right on time, plenty of food and even packed up our leftovers for us.  They picked us up and dropped us off so we didn't have to worry about driving which made the experience better as we all were able to mingle and chat.  We had an array of ages fro 21 to 65 and everyone commented on what a fantastic time they had they never knew San Antonio had something like this to offer.  Our drivers were laid back which is what we wanted but also professional and courteous.  We have some bachelor/bachelorette parties to plan in the future and will definitely keep Craft Cruisers in mind for our future celebrations.  Also a guest of mine already asked for contact info to start planning a tour of their own so what does that tell you! Thanks so much for making Steve's 40th birthday one to remember!"

                "description": "Craft Cruiser was amazing! I scheduled a private wine tour in Fredericksburg for a bachelorette party and everyone loved it! Our driver Matthew was absolutely fantastic and super professional. With other transportation services I have felt rushed and the driver is distant, but that was not my experience with Craft Cruiser! Matthew was super friendly and very knowledgeable of the area. He suggested wineries and told us what their best wines to try were. He never rushed us. He would drop us off and go in and make sure that we were set up with a tasting before he would hang back and wait for us. There was never a time that we had to wait for him, all we had to do was shoot a text and say we were heading out, and he would be there right out front for us. And if we were taking extra long, he would come in and check up on us to make sure that all was well. I will definitely be using Craft Cruiser again and recommend it to all my friends. Their private tour made our bachelorette party one to never forget!! Thank you Craft Crusier!"

                "description": "What we liked: got to meet a great group of total strangers who also booked the tour and we had a blast. We did the non all-inclusive which was good for me because I'm not much of a beer drinker but I had booked this for my boyfriend's birthday. Dan was super cool and made us all feel comfortable and safe as we made our way to the different micro breweries.  Everything was timely and we didn't feel rushed. We used groupon to get a rate discount. Even if we had paid full price it would have a been good deal to not have to worry about driving everywhere. The meet up place Pizza  Italia was also great - great pizza and it had a big variety micro beers.  I would have liked more upfront information about the beers each bar offers and how to get the most at each bar. For example you can order a flight if you want to sample different beers or you don't know what you like. At the first bar we each ordered a full glass only to not really like it. So we ended up switching glasses! Ha!"

                "description": "I've seen this place on Texas Eats and I've had this place saved in my Yelp collection for some time now. I wanted to try their brunch hours but didn't get a chance to make it. Since i was here with my family for my mom's birthday, we decided to give this place a try during the afternoon hours.    The wait was not long at all. The Pearl was busy today with lots of people outside since it was so beautiful out. However, even though they told us it would be a 30 min wait, we literally waited about 10 mins and our table was ready. The hostess was very hospitable. Instantly when you walk in, the history of the place surrounds you with warm. The inside is very nice with high ceilings. There was enough space inside for social distancing so our table was perfect.   The manager Carrie was so nice and catered to us. We also had the best waitress, Julianna. I believe how a waitress starts off is how they end. She instantly was super pleasant, relatable and really knew the menu. When we asked questions about the specific of the menu, she was very kind to us and broke things down. She also was accommodating when it came to checking on us. I love when a waitress checks up on me as well as give us time to eat. She knew the right kind of balance. She was quick and also fun to talk to. I haven't seen much reviews on here about Julianna but i hope more people write about her because she literally should be recognized for her hard work. I hope she eventually gets a raise or a great blessing in the future because the experience was great because of her. Some of the food i wasn't a huge fan of, but majority of it was good. The Mac and cheese was good but it just reminds me of Luby's. Nothing to rave about. Not that it's a bad thing but i can tell it's not like baked Mac and cheese that I'm use to eating. However, the chicken sandwich, jambalaya and cornbread was great. I gave this restaurant a 5 star definitely because of the customer service and experience. I want to come back and try their brunch hours.    Thanks again to Julianna and Carrie for being so kind to my family especially my Mom for her birthday.   FYI: we tried the grasshopper cheesecake and it was really good. I'm a big fanatic of cheesecake since i love the original cheesecake. So when the grasshopper cheesecake came, i was a little skeptical because it consisted of Oreo crust, chocolate filling and mint on the top, but to be honest, the name and look of it doesn't do any Justice. As you can see, i didn't have time to take a picture of it because my family and I demolished it."

                "description": "We chose this place for our 8th anniversary dinner and were not disappointed.   We started with the deviled eggs with bacon jam (winner) and the pretzel which my girls loved.   I had the fried chicken which was cooked perfectly. The batter was just a little too salty but otherwise perfect and crispy. I was only able to eat the drumstick and thigh portion. I would have split this with my husband but he was eating the burger (which I'm sure he loved because he barely stopped chewing long enough to breathe) so the breast and wing portion came home with me for later.   My little one had the grilled cheese and red potatoes. It was huge. She barely got through half the sandwich. She loved the potatoes and never complained that there was skin in them (she won't eat mine if I make it like that). I tasted the potatoes and they were .  My teenager had the jambalaya with porchetta and she loved it. So tasty and the pork was so crispy and lovely.   I was ready to eat the chocolate cake but I was outvoted so we had the carrot cake. Best carrot cake and silkiest cream cheese frosting I have ever had. The caramel sauce and the brittle just sends it over the top. The cake is not too sweet and is large enough to share. Three of us shared one piece.  The little one wanted ice cream so we got her the vanilla bean ice cream which was three small scoops of vanilla heaven. She was very happy with  it.   The waiter was attentive and friendly and quick. We got excellent service, for sure.   We will definitely be back."

                "description": "You're in the South, indulge in the comfort food!  The place is set in a rustic looking warehouse repurposed as a restaurant. The whole area has a very upscale vibe set into a city neighborhood. Being from Colorado, the trope of liking craft beer is very true so I was looking forward to some good brew and I was not disappointed! I ordered one of their German style lagers to start and a Mexican lager later on. I was very happy to see them served in the correct glass. They also had Frose on the menu which I didn't get the chance to order unfortunately.   The food was spectacular! I was craving fried chicken and ordered the sandwich. It was beautifully seasoned, crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside. My husband ordered this porchetta jambalaya dish that was so unique! It is basically a gigantic chicharrón in a bed of rice with sausage. The rice was sooooooo good! I kept tasting it trying to discern the ingredients so I could make it for myself.  Lastly, the wait staff was so kind and attentive! I don't know if it is just because I am from Colorado but wow they were so nice and went out of their way. I can't wait to come back here :)"

We were seated promptly and our waiter reviewed the menu with us and we followed his recommendations. I had the meatloaf and to be honest, it was over cooked and the edges burnt. The middle was ok and flavorful, but I was expecting more due to the reviews. We really liked the ambiance of the the restaurant was very cool. Wait staff was great. The Pearl experience was pretty cool. Overall, we will probably be back, but not anytime soon."

                "description": "Everything about this dinner was lovely other than them running out I'd the snapper cheeks and frozen rose.   Came here with girlfriends after enjoying the holiday shopping festival ...which was beautiful scenery and atmosphere. You got to love this location to people watch or even inside where the industrial architecture gives a heat vibe to dine.  I loved that I was able to make reservation on my app and we were seated right away and I get points!!  The girls ordered the pineapple cocktail which I'm told was crispy, fruity and delicious on a warmer night. I just can't eat pineapple like that. I settled for a red wine since they were out of the watermelon frozen rose or any of the frozen drinks that night. I must say the Quest (?) red blend was an excellent choice and I'm glad the waiter offered to let me sample a couple wines to get one I liked.    We all ordered the half chicken which came with tiger spice and a white bbq sauce. This was my first time experiencing a white bbq sauce and must say it was a flop. None of us like it as we couldn't get past the look of ranch but the taste for me didn't hit the mark for bbq sauce. However, the he tiger spicy sauce is . My only feedback is I wish it had a fresh out the grease hot fried temperature which it didn't. Very good though.  Sides: cornbread, green beans, grits and I tried the watermelon salad. All were worth it but the watermelon salad could have used some kind of acid or vinaigrette on the dry lettuce in the bowl. It really was just like eating 5 cook slices of watermelon and not sure if I'd get this again for the price.   Overall, perfect location, beautiful scenery inside and out, prime spot for people watching out to courtyard and moderate prices, solid portions. I like this location better than the Rim and the menu. I do think gumbo should be offered in both locations."

                "description": "We have always gone to Southerleigh the Saturday before Christmas - last year we almost walked out due to the attitude of the host - this year  we did .  Granted we booked for 6 but added one more - but as they were  already trying to squeeze 6 of us at a small table designed for 5 or less which is never comfortable and always too cramped , they refused however not in a polite or acceptable way.  I coupe have dealt with the inability to accommodate us and I get they have policies and we added one more BUT what I could nor deal with was the rude, condescending attitude of the host! She is one of that rudest people I have met on my life! Honey - you are a host - not a CEO!! Kindness and manners have are an asset that will get you far in life ! Within a seconds of us arriving she fired back with a rude, aggressive demeanor and even went after my kids! She did offer to sit us outside - in a storm.  Everyone should be treated equally and nicely and certainly not talked to like that by an hourly employee that thinks way too highly of herself.  She ruined a tradition that we have had for many years and as my husband and I both have taken many business associates here over the years and hosted corporate events - I highly doubt if I will be back as the customer service has been declining the last few years !  Even if they had a table - that's enough for me to walk!  So we went to the Boiler House that has table and people with a smile!"

                "description": "Southerleigh's Famous Pressure Fried Chicken | Ok... Ok... I have to start with this one dish because it was absolutely AMAZING! As I exclaimed to everyone around me at my table, THIS is the greatest dish of fried chicken I've ever had.. and I've had a LOT of chicken! I'd go back to San Antonio (and I'm currently trying to find an excuse to do so) just to take my girlfriend and try this chicken again. Fried to perfection, a light crisp around the brim of the chicken encapsulates the flavorfully juicy inner meat. PLUS - that combo sauce (tiger sauce) added on adds a nice n light kick to the already champion-of-a-dish. Highest recommendations - this is what made my night. A must-get.   Fried Frog Legs | Now, this appetizer stands out from the rest! It was my first time trying frog legs - and let me tell you... I'd try them again! Absolutely fantastic preparation for a unique dish. Thinking of trying them for the first time too? It's like perfectly-fried pieces of gator. The aioli included really adds another dimension to the flavor as well. Check this one out!   Wood Fired Pretzel | This app is to be as expected - a great wood fired Bavarian pretzel. Not my cup of tea, but if you're wanting some \"bread for the table,\" this can make do. I'd say go for some of the more unique flavors Southerleigh has instead - like the Frog Legs or Oysters!   East Coast Oysters | Wonderfully prepared - Southerleigh's Oyster prep goes a long way - long enough for me to actually forget my initially bad experience at another restaurant trying oysters for the first time. Love of oysters didn't happen to me at first sight - so this second encounter really had a positive impact. Highly recommend for oyster advocates and first time samplers!   Classic Meatloaf | A companion at my table ordered this dish - let me tell you, it's quite large.. be hungry and beware! He says it was rather good - but was jealous of my fried chicken.   Cracker Crusted Gulf Redfish | If you don't end up choosing the fried chicken I keep advocating for, then go with this dish right here. Southerleigh does a masterful job in frying their foods to perfection. With a light outer layer entry, you are taken on a deep-sea dive into the gulf of mexico with a flavor explosion from the adventure that is the Gold Redfish. Fantastic second place entrée in my opinion!   Beer | A majority of the brews they have to offer are brewed in-house which is pretty cool. They have a variety of quite unique flavors! Looking to try something different? The \"It's Just Red\" has a very unique flavor that I've never tried before. Let me tell you thought - half my table enjoyed it, half enjoyed just tasting it - but couldn't finish it. It has a fruity kick - almost sour if I recall correctly. I enjoyed the Gold Export Lager! It was very balanced and smooth and has that home-brew essence you may just be looking for.   With great and quick customer service for out large party, fun rustic ambience, delicious apps, historic foundations, and a brewery / top-notch bar, it should make sense as to why Southerleigh is an experience not to be missed. It's also located in the coolest part of town - the historic Pearl District! Fun tip: checkout the attached Pearl hotel - the rustic architecture and speak-easy steampunk vibe make it one of a kind. Check, check, check it out!"

I guess it's expected for this type of establishment but I would say it's way above average but not enough to call it \"fine dining\".   The friend chicken I had was large and good....but not sure if it was worth $20. Howe ever their crawfish roll looked legit!! I didn't eat it but saw it going around, so next time that might bring the bang for the Buck."

I got the pineapple cocktail, and it also didn't taste like much. We got the pretzel to share but it didn't seem fresh and the dips weren't my favorite. Lots of places to try in the Pearl and for me this isn't one."

                "description": "3.5 stars  Service was a bit uneven. The building is beautifully restored - this restaurant is in an historic building which share space with the elegant Hotel Emma.  They didn't have much variety for fresh oysters at 5pm so we decided to skip those and did try the seafood salad...which is decent - a bit underdressed - so we asked for a side in addition...it really needed something else to perk it up. Perhaps more salt/acid/anchovy? Something not there...  For fun we ordered the antelope tartare which was oddly pretty satisfying. Very lean chopped meat on bottom with a drier version of chopped egg salad on top with a very nice complement of thin seedless pickled jaleopeno slices on top. Served with crackers. Definitely worth trying.   The fried chicken coming out of the kitchen looked delish but we didn't try it.  The Pearl Historic District where this is located is fun to wander around...there is a good farmer's market here on Sundays as well."

                "description": "I have never had a bad meal  at Southerleigh. The cornbread is so good that you will think about slapping your whole family. It's my mum's favorite cornbread to eat. The service has always be great. The 1/2 pound burger was cooked perfectly and it was delicious. It comes with a bacon jam that is fabulous. It makes the burger better.   The beer selection is very good. There is something for everyone. The beer selection changes often. If you are at Southerleigh's and they have Godzilla Go Juice available you must get it. It's a sake beer. The Eggnostic beer is excellent as well. Both are worth the money. This place is a must if you have not tried them."

The deviled eggs are so addicting and I had to remind myself to slow down and leave some for the others at the table haha  The fried oysters were served in a ToGo container so the steam softened the crust (which is expected) but they were still really flavorful and delicious.   #GoodEatsInSA #GoodDrinksInSA #SAFoodPics #SanAntonio #SATX #PowerLunch #PowerDinner #Food #Meal #YelpElite #SAYelp #SANightLife #Yelp #SABestFoodPics"

                "description": "I've been here a few times for brunch and it's definitely not a bad spot to hit up while at The Pearl. I got the Carolina Gold Rice Grits because I'm always tempted by browned butter and fried sage, but I will have to say that this particular dish didn't necessarily hit the flavor marks. The browned butter was more clarified, and the few bits of sage didn't have any standout flavor. The rice grits were truly rice and the entire dish lacked flavor: Crystal's hot sauce and salt and pepper to save the day. Egg was poached perfectly. I'm not bashing the dish in any sense, because I had high hopes for it, but it could've used some major flavoring. Maybe back to the drawing board with this one. Other than that, lovely restaurant, pleasant service."

                "description": "Southerleigh is a great place for brunch vibes! It is located downtown at the heart of The Pearl. They have indoor and outdoor seating but I love sitting outside because I love seeing all the dogs that walk by especially on days with the farmer market going on.   I ordered the steak rancheros and my girlfriend got the waffle. For me, my eggs were cooked perfectly but my steak was just a bit over. The steak was seasoned well, the salsa had the right amount of acidity to go along with the eggs, steak, and potatoes to create the perfect bite.  They also have a wide selection of beers and you can get a full bottle order of champagne for your Sunday afternoon mimosas.   Their brunch menu is a bit limited for brunch and I am not sure if it changes seasonally but it is a great place to enjoy some brunch while taking in the vibes of The Pearl."

                "description": "Walked into Hotel Emma and to the left is Southerleigh. My friend took us here as out of town visitors. Sat down as per our reservation and ordered deviled eggs to start and our drinks. Since we were at a brewery, I ordered beer. If you like sours, I recommend the \"Gimme Some Mora\". Tastes light for early drinking. Deviled eggs complement well with the sweet bacon jam.   One of us rarely has seafood so we made the bold move of ordering oysters and scallops to share, to expand her taste horizons! Scallops were a bit on the well-seasoned side for me but in small quantities, it was divine. Not overcooked so it was very plump. Oysters were also fresh and well shucked. Though not a seafood exactly, we also went for the southern delicacy of frog legs. I'm not familiar with the baseline of frog leg texture but we felt it tasted like a cross between chicken and fish, so an amphibian. We added a house salad to balance our meal.   The end but also the highlight of this lovely lunch is the fried chicken. The fried chicken was so juicy and deliciously amazing that I wish I could bring it back home. The skin is perfection! The provided sauces highlighted the foods rather than covering it's flavor."

When we asked to be seated outside we had to wait extra 5-10 mins  2- After we sat outside, and ordered we waited for like an hour for our food then the manager comes in and tell us our food will need an extra 15 mins to get out.  3- When the food came in, it was terrible. Cold food, dry. Very bad experience.   Unfortunately, I had a bad experience with this restaurant. I've been here few times but this time was just the worst. The manager Scott tried his best to make it up for us, I definitely appreciate his help and effort"

The owner is very big on supporting his fellow locally owned breweries and distilleries and stated that all of his 70+ beers and 99% of his liquor selection is locally owned.   The Duchesse burger was excellent and cooked just the way I wanted it and the corn fritters were another great appetizer! Don't skip the GOCHU IPA wings, another hidden treat.   They have happy hour all day long Wednesday with $5 cocktails. Check them out when you get a chance SA! Impressive little spot!"

We usually have had a 5 star experience during our visits.  My Dad has been wanting fish and chips and so we brought him here to give it a try. The fish was indeed 5 stars with the portions, seasonings and crispness. The chips were 4 stars, could be crispier. We tried the elote fritter and there wasn't much corn in them so that was slightly disappointing. We ended the meal by sharing the banana fudge ice cream. I always like how they change up their ice cream selections. Dad enjoyed the ice cream too.  Definitely look forward to visiting again. I've loved their burgers and may need to have one next time."

                "description": "Unfortunately, I have to say everything has declined at Hoppy Monk. Not sure if the gentleman we previously had no longer works there but everyone I've had in the past 4 visits have been horrible! Every time particular friends go, I hear they have a great time and receive great service. The last few times that I've gone the experiences are very lack luster. Tonight i went with a friend and the server refused to look at me for whatever reason. Even though I was the one speaking directly to her, placing the order, making requests and would be the one paying the check and her tip...she was not very  pleasant or attentive. After the fourth time of experiencing disparate treatment it's safe to conclude that this business is not inclusive of all patrons, especially black patrons."

                "description": "Hoppy Monk visit...  After a hiatus,  we thought Hoppy Monk would be a great spot for a small family gathering.  What a pleasant surprise to find a major improvement to the parking situation with a new under-cover structure, and probably double the parking the last time we visited.   That was big on our visit during Happy Hour on a Friday,  as their parking lot was packed!  We took our two Pups with us and immediately found a table on their spacious and well-appointed patio.   What a great feel Hoppy Monk has with all the groups, friends and families enjoying the great fall weather and Hoppy Monk's great craft food and drinks.  There were plenty of pleasant servers who looked like they were happy to be there.... in stark contrast to so many places these days.    Their drink menu is amazing with pages of craft beers and handcrafted cocktail options.  The Spirits section is several pages long. They have an actual drink and food menu just for \"Hoppy Hour\"! Their overall menu has continued to evolve and while we ended up just ordering a bunch of appetizers on our visit, I found 5 or 6 new menu items I've got to try.  Put it on my Holiday checklist.  Great to see Hoppy Monk doing well!  5+ Stars"

I couldn't get enough of that gochujang sauce so I ordered the actual chicken wings. I think I liked the cauliflower better because there was a lightness to it. Regardless, their gochujang is very concentrated, spicier and not as sweet as most places.  Rabbit tacos were cumin-y and tasty. I didn't expect to get that earthiness. The whole taco was just delightful. The elote fritters were also quite tasty according to our friend.  Wasn't a huge fan of the mushrooms, but the sauces (red pepper and walnut) definitely added some needed flair.  We had an awesome server and we also had leftovers!  Can't wait to dig in then come back for more  Se ate the leftovers and came back the next day.  The cheeseboard was delicious."

                "description": "Having visited their location in El Paso, I was very excited to be staying close to this location.  I still have daydreams of the Gochu wings and seemingly endless beer selection that I encountered previously. This location didn't let me down either: excellent personal service, good food and so much beer to choose from that if you set the glasses end to end they would circle the Earth 7 times. I might be exaggerating that last one. Yelp needs more hyperbole. Let's just say you have plenty to choose from.    This time I really branched out and went with the Gochu chicken sandwich. That sauce is as good as I remember, and I really like how they used whole boneless chicken thighs. Very good. Also good were the side of   Macha brussel sprouts. The light honey and almond touches really made these dynamite.    I won't go too much into the beer choices. Let's just say you're good. Get a flight and try a few. Your mom isn't watching. Unless you are having lunch with your mom. Just make sure she has a beer too so she won't give you that judgmental look and tell you again how you are drinking too much and why is it that you never finished college, and shouldn't you have children by now? God mom, just let me live my life!    I'm sorry, where was I? Oh, this is a good place. Go enjoy it."

The patio area is so cute and spacious, it was very cold when we went but the heaters helped quite a lot. The food was super delicious and portions were very large so we were both able to take home leftovers. It's a bit far from where I live but it's super close to my friend and she is appreciative to have such a great spot so close to her and doesn't have to drive far to have a nice time in an awesome atmosphere.

                "description": "I've been coming to this restaurant/bar for five years now. they have a unique menu, outstanding cocktails and an extensive beer menu.  It has one of the best patios on the north side and they often had music on the weekends, although I can't be sure as of recent times because I have not been here on a weekend lately.  I absolutely love the wings, burgers and fries. They do offer some very unique items on the menu but I'm sad to say that I was disappointed when trying something different recently; namely the drunken mussels pasta. The description sounds amazing but in my humble opinion, it is spaghetti with mussels (still in their shells) in a very watery/brothy sauce with spices.  It seems like they are going for a Ramen type dish, but it was a big miss for me.  They were kind enough to exchange it for a burger though.  Highly recommend this place for ambiance, drinks and staple menu items."

                "description": "We have been here before, once before the pandemic for St. Patrick and live music, once earlier this year just for drinks and apps. The beer list is decent for San Antonio. We ordered the fish and chips, the Trappist mushrooms and Mac and cheese. The cheese sauce looked watery but I liked it. It's not a huge plate, so if you have an appetite get something with it. The batter on the mushrooms was excellent, very flavorful. This is a huge portion, definitely shareable. You get a choice of aioli: I got citrus and umami. I loved the umami, didn't care for the citrus.  If you like fish and chips, I would skip it here. The batter was bland. Even Tartar sauce wouldn't help. The fries might have been good, but they were cold by the time we got ketchup. Maybe they should use the batter from the mushrooms for the fish. As is the case at most places, they seemed short handed. The server was nice enough but over extended. And the folks running out his drinks kept taking them to the wrong tables. They may need to rethink their process there. I would have liked to try their duck tacos, but I guess they don't do this anymore. Parking is kind of wonky and the lot is kind of chewed up. It was seat yourself and there is outdoor as well as indoor seating. The outdoor tables can be pretty worn, but the inside is opened up, sitting nice weather, so that is a nice option."

There is an outside sitting area you pass through to get to one of the entries. It was relaxed, people were conversing, and the music wasn't too loud.  I took a seat inside and the architecture looked reminded of an old church house.  I ordered the Duchesse burger with fries.  The bun was soft and nothing like a burger bun. The meat was flavorful and juicy.  I would highly recommend getting a burger.  There was lots of beer selections as whiskey too if you are looking for a good craft beer selection."

Only issue we were overcharged for items we didn't order.   This seems to be happening more and more with places that have the pay pads at the table verses letting you see an actual receipt and then making payment.   They made it right but good thing I looked at the receipt once home. *receipt is not emailed until about an hour after payment was made at venue."

Nice place to hang out with friends.  I believe Joshua was our server and he was good. Guacamole with bean nachos I believe - 5/5 Cauliflower wings - 4/5 ( it was a bit sweet but was ok to share) Beer flight sampler - 3/5 ( I am not a fan of beer and didn't feel anything great about it) French Fries - 5/5 Long Island ice tea - 4/5 ( it was different from other Long Island teas it had a strong essence on a herb in it, not sure what it was) Coconut and raspberry Ice cream - 5/5 ( it was nice and tasty)  Will definitely visit this place for again. Nice hanging spot which was very pleasant. Staff was very friendly."

Been several times and been super impressed with their beers, even bought several of their limited releases (if you didn't get their version of Bourbon Barrel Aged Black is Beautiful or their Puro San Antonio, you MISSED OUT).  They also have panini for sale in case you get the beer munchies.  If a panino, is not your thing, there's other several businesses next door that also sell food  This brewery is located in such a nice spot that it's on my regular rotation of places to have a some good suds.  You can drink indoors or outdoors, at pease and just chill with or without your significant other, friends, or dog.    Also worth noting, this brewery participated in proving, clean, safe, drinking water during Snowmaggedon, even outside of their normal taproom hours.  The community appreciates it!"

                "description": "It is refreshing to have another craft brewery in San Antonio to not only compete with the other breweries in the area.  This place though is one of the best. Small, personable and fun.  The employees do a really good job suggesting beers that they have on tap.    I think I have mentioned a couple of times that I like dark beers, they have a number of stouts on tap and the Mint stout by far was the best.  I also had a pint of their copper and it was refreshing to end the evening with a finishing beer.    Thanks Black lab for such a great evening."

                "description": "I hope when this reaches you Covid-19 would've been a fleeting memory. We all would be maskless carrying on with our lives as if nothing ever happened. However we don't live in Disneyland and instability is our new reality. Consistency is King, a currency few businesses  carry. Not only is this exhibited through its product but also by its service. As the pandemic wears on us the need to find meaningful experiences in the midst of chaos is increasing.  I will say I feel for the Black Laboratory Brewing  opening in the same year as the coronavirus continues to disrupt our lives. A lesser brewery would've surely folded. Instead they continue to consistently put out the city's finest craft products with service to match. Seeing their transition moving their sample beers from local businesses to flowing taps speaks volumes of their resiliency.  Before I write any further turning this into a  barrel aged review I should state what I liked about this brewery to include a few minor critiques. The taproom itself is in a small business co-op. Depending on the time of day you go parking can be limited. I've already gone on numerous occasions and their beers alongside their service is what keeps me coming back. Each time I have gone brewmasters are always willing to explain what's on tap with accompanying samples. The whole Black Lab team are extremely friendly, passionate and this reflects in every beer made.  For example I've tried their \"Black is Beautiful\" imperial stout up to my most recent visit with their \"Updog\", a triple ipa so potent it could take down an Imperial Snow-walker. If you're into lighter fare I've had their \"Grapefruit and Chill\" a  beer you need to drink with Jimmy Buffet blaring whilst rocking a Hawaiian tshirt. The diversity in their styles means there is something for everyone. Again consistency across the board seems to be the call of the day.    If I may add a few critiques it would be in available space and onsite taplists. Firstly it is a very small brewpub. As a result of the pandemic patrons are opting more to sit outdoors. This can be problematic. Since seating is shared with other businesses tables can fill up quickly. I've already had owners in adjoining spots give me the ojo. In addition on the each patio table is an online menu. Upon scanning it it takes you to their taplist via their website. In the future I hope they make a menu exclusively for when you visit as they rotate their list readily. While these are small critiques that are not dealbreakers, at least not to me. In the end consistent product and great service are really any place's calling card in these precarious times.   As a craft beer enthusiast, a patron of the world I know we have been on this long manic ride since March. We've seen iconic businesses that we would've never imagined closing are now leaving for good. The simple act of leaving our homes has new implications. The question that seems to not have a real answer: How do we support local businesses and still maintain best practices? I don't know. All I can tell you if you're looking for an oasis from these claustrophobic, home cocoon, anxiety-ridden and Zoom fatigue times please head out to the Black Lab for some liquid therapy.  ps. Don't forget to get a pizza from Truth Pizzeria next door to go with your beer! That way you get in your cardio workout."

                "description": "East side nanobrewin'!  These guys are running a pretty tight operation. They have storefront in a newly opened strip shopping center. It looks like the old building was a big service garage or something that they've turned into a strip shopping center. With a pizza shop next door, it's the perfect combination! You can get your beer here, a pizza from next door, and bazinga! The pizza seems a better option that the paninis that these guys are offering. They share a patio, which is dog friendly.  My only complaint about this brewery is that they didn't have a menu that you could take back to the table and pour over. They sent me to the one on the phone (mine was dead and needed charging) or go to the one pasted on the door. I opted for the one on the outside door, but had the hardest time reading it since people kept coming and going through the door while I was blocking it trying to read the menu. Derp.  They don't serve beer in glass here. Apparently they don't have the right kind of stuff yet to do so, so it's all in plastic cups, which seems kinda wasteful. The flights are served up in a bunch of tiny disposable plastic cups.  The beers I had were decent- especially the core beers that they seem to sell all the time. Bindi Blonde Ale was my fav, it's a good beer for drinking on their hot patio in the shade. I like that they also do some crazier, far out beers as well, such as minty or fruited milkshake IPAs. The service was fast and friendly, and you could tell that the ones pouring up the beer knew their stuff and were able to talk about what they were pouring articulately! I liked everything I had on the flight!"

                "description": "Large taproom. The GM was there and very knowledgeable about the beers. He gave us samples until we decided on our favorite. Very low key for a Thursday night, which is fine by us. You can order food (pizza, pretzels, etc), but we didn't, so no review there. Hopefully, the pizzas are just like the one at their other location, which are yummy."

                "description": "The beer is good, which I suppose is the most important thing about a brewery, and the only reason I didn't give them one star. But the overall experience was not good. The service was unfriendly. And the ambiance was awful. Uninviting warehouse in derelict area between railroad and freeway overpass. Outdoor space is surrounded by barbed wire fence and you have to scream to be heard over the noise of the trains and traffic.  I just can't figure out why this place got so many 5 star reviews. Are San Antonian's standards that low? Are the other breweries so much worse than this one that this one seems nice by comparison?  I guess I'll never know"

                "description": "Go for the beer and perfect San Antonio ambiance, stay for Reggie. Our first visit so he asked us what kind of beer we liked. After an embarrassingly detailed description, Reggie hooked us up with the newly released Buffalo Hump IPA and it was exactly what we were looking for. Sat outside and watched trains go by, listening to a perfectly curated play list. Reggie checked on us just enough while also suggesting some San Antonio sites we might enjoy. Love this place!!"

It is spacious, the painted murals are neat, board games are available to play and the beer selection is good. I started off with a flight followed by a pint of the cherry bexarliner.

                "description": "This review is for the BREWERY near SouthTown, NOT the restaurant on 1604.    The seating area is spacious but still gets packed by early afternoon on weekends.   Not only can you get the regular Freetail brews here, but they're also serving a handful of Ghost Pixel brews.  Ghost Pixel is a collaboration between Chaos By Design and Weathered Souls Brewing Company.  I'm not sure how they ended up in the Freetail Brewery, but hey, it'll give you a reason to head down there, enjoy some cold suds, and find the answer for yourself.  Brewery tours at 3p and 5p on Saturdays. You can purchase beer to go in 4 packs, 6 packs, and 22 oz bottles. Growler refills are $9 for the Freetail brands, $14 for the Ghost Pixel brands.  They offer some merchandise for sale, t-shirts, pint glasses, glass growlers, and river safe metal growlers.  Every 1st Saturday is comedy night and they usually have other events going on the other Saturdays of each month.   Another cool thing they do is bring in local businesses for events called \"pop-ups.\"  They brought in a local gourmet popcorn place called Pink's Popcorn a while back.  You could purchase a \"flight\" of various popcorn flavors and they were also giving away $5 gift cards to their stores.  There's a locally owned cupcake company scheduled for an upcoming pop-up, so get out there and check them out.  Check Freetail's website for their calendar of events for details on the Saturday events as well as the pop-ups.  TIP:  Drive slow if you have to park in the side parking lot.  It's gravel and there are a lot of potholes and ruts."

I loved the hand painted wall murals and there are board games available to play.  There's also a food menu available, but on this visit I just tried did a beer tasting.  The have a wide variety of beer styles, so should be something on the menu to please everyone.  Their our taproom available-only beers and seasonable beers on draft, and they have specialty beers for sale by the bottle as well.  I enjoyed their IPAs and especially the Imperial IPA.  The La Muerta stout was also tasty."

                "description": "Awesome $4 Flights!  SITREP  With beer flights easily going for twice as much elsewhere, including my home turf in Sacramento, this was a welcome surprise to enjoy a variety of four (4) delicious, refreshing craft beers basically $1 a pop! https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/freetail-brewing-san-antonio-2?select=mIJWirF3nDr4Lp1yk6QGyQanduserid=3mNz5nQFTIBQm0oU5mBR0w  THE SETUP  Located inside a warehouse, the facility is spacious - plenty of room for brewing and retail storage and distribution needs.  The décor inside is almost festive, giving you the impression you are celebrating Halloween and Dia De Los Muertos, with wall art and mural art going from the floor all the way to the ceiling.  THE BREWS  Again, they have a flight of FOUR 4-ounce glasses for only $4!  The beers I pulled the trigger on included:  1. Soul Doubt IPA https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/freetail-brewing-san-antonio-2?select=t1qYWf8PsXQK_YjXOAdNPQanduserid=3mNz5nQFTIBQm0oU5mBR0w  2.

Belgian Hostel Style Stout;  https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/freetail-brewing-san-antonio-2?select=avzOodKMLifNrfMLldlYewanduserid=3mNz5nQFTIBQm0oU5mBR0w      and,   4. San Antonio Pale Ale https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/freetail-brewing-san-antonio-2?select=ro01q7VvBQNfbS4petZbPQanduserid=3mNz5nQFTIBQm0oU5mBR0w   All were tasty, and not bitter.  PARKING  Such a breeze!  The brewery has it's own large parking lot.  I don't think even a large party would push it over maximum lot-capacity.  THE LOWDOWN  If you find yourself in San Antonio, and enjoy innovative brews, definitely make Freetail Brewing one of your planned stops."

You can order a flight of any 6 beers on tap, I recommend the dark saison, it was delicious, and different than anything I've had before.  The space itself had a warehouse type feel, picnic benches setup for seating, and games like a giant connect 4.  Overall pretty similar to a lot of the breweries I hang out at in San Diego."

FTW?! even better...the beer is actually good!   Large, spacious. A couple of TV's for watching events. Lots of cool artwork and murals inside on the walls. Picnic table set up with board games and cards for your entertainment.   The only downside, there is no food nearby as the brewery is in the middle of nowhere..."

                "description": "Freetail brewing is a staple in the SA brew scene. They have a variety of different beers including tried and true ones as well as seasonal flavors. They also offer the conserveza beer which part of the proceeds goes towards the SA zoos conservation efforts. They also offer topi Chico, sodas, (I think wine?!) for people who aren't big drinkers, they also offer chips and snacks. They usually have a food truck outside when we have gone. We usually come to Freetail when they're hosting an event. Our current favorite is \"hoppy endings\" comedy show which they host I believe every 3rd Saturday. They usually have a few comedians and it's FOR FREE. Be sure to check out Freetail for some good beer and events!"

Came with a group of Yelpers on Sunday afternoon of Yelp Spring Break on a trek of several breweries that day and we spent the most time here.  The beers were good, the atmosphere is fun with a graffiti/dia de los muertos theme running through the building.  We did not tour, but just drank.  They did not have food, but they did have some comp popcorn which was MUCH appreciated!  I need just a little bite to go with my beer!  Its kind of out in the toolies, not much around there, so eat first!  Overall, liked it.  Would return.  Recommended!"

Great drink specials; $4 flights and pints. We ordered the flight and unfortunately did not find a favorite within the flight of 4. Don't know that we will be back.

They are clean, clean restrooms, water fountains, have a yoga class in the next room over, games, a huge screen playing the office at the time, and cute glasses with color on them.

                "description": "Alas, the ominous day when I fail to give a brewery a five star rating. First probable red flag: nearly empty on a gorgeous Saturday afternoon, with the exception of a bridal party. Really.   The taproom is vibrant and has so much potential. Graffiti is tattooed along each and every crevice, including on the picnic tables. You can sense the history of Freetail, young or old. They have your standard board games and a popcorn cart for the grazers.   Unfortunately, I really was not impressed with the beer selection at all. At $4 for a flight of 4 tasters, Pinata Protest and Bat Outta Helles were the easiest to drink. The prices are consistent with your typical brewery.  I can't quite put my finger on why I didn't enjoy myself as much here as I have at other breweries. There just wasn't much happening. If there was music playing, I couldn't remember it. I think the taproom as well as the beers are very much forgettable."

Besides the pretzels, they have a huge beer list, overwhelming, but the servers are pretty good in helping you.  Trivia on Thursday!  You cannot go wrong with any of the food, I tried a lot of different things.  The German Plate is where it is at! The potato salad alone makes this dish."

                "description": "Update to the update:   Flying Saucer is still one of my favorite spots in San Antonio for good beer, surprisingly good pub food, and excellent service.  I stopped in on a whim on a Friday afternoon. It's pretty dead but the regulars are here. Read my other reviews for more detail but I'll just sum it up.  Flying Saucer has good food. Their Rueben is probably the best version you're likely to get in San Antonio. It's seriously good (for San Antonio). Flying Saucer fries are ridiculously good. They're always crisp, never soggy. (Mine were on the edge of being too crisp today).  THEY STILL HAVE BELL'S OBERON ON TAP IN DECEMBER!!!!!!   For those who may not know. Bell's is a brewery in Michigan that has tentatively branched out to other areas. Flying Saucer (and similar places) sometimes gets it in the summer. It's a seasonal beer (spring/summer). Every Michigander knows the unofficial Spring kickoff is when Meijer's have stacks of Oberon on the shelves. So to find it still on tap in December is amazing. It's my favorite beer all time hands down. But don't y'all drink that ish cuz I'm coming back to kill it.  I sat at the bar and Ashely--the woman behind the bar--was great. Attentive but not over bearing. Perfect service."

Ordered their Smash Burger lunch special which in-essence was a burger on a wheat bun with two patties and fresh jalapeño.  It was served with a pesto mayo. The burger was better than I expected.   The waitress Rachel was fabulous and when she asked me which side I told her to pick her favorite. Arrived were seasoned waffle fries that were super hot and tasty.   This was one of the better lunches I had in awhile. I will definitely have to make it a priority to come back."

                "description": "We have been coming here for years and tonight's service was unfortunately subpar. This was our first trip back since before the pandemic and we were looking forward to catching up with friends at one of our favorite spots. Throughout the evening our server seemed short with us and couldn't wait for us to finish ordering before attempting to walk away. Waters were only half filled which was strange. They seemed  flustered with our group whenever we attempted to flag them down. They had a few other tables so perhaps they were overwhelmed. Only towards the end of our meal did the server ask if we needed anything else. On top of this my food came out late like they had forgotten about it (everyone else in my group got their food), and my burger was burnt. It took a long time for our server to return for me to tell her about it and I was hungry, so I cut the burger in half and ate around the burnt part. The fries were good. I asked the server about it being late and burnt and asked for a different burger that wasn't burnt. They said the manager already discounted it and that since I ate some of it, they couldn't discount it more than that nor did they offer to replace it. I appreciate the discount, however we wouldn't have known at all since a manager nor the server came over to tell us, and honestly I would have preferred a non burnt burger to a discounted one. We still tipped 20% on our bill because we know that service here is typically better than this. Perhaps this server was just having an off day. Hoping that our next visit is better!"

These things are all over the country now and they're very very popular with drinkers and pub food and pub quiz lovers. Basically they're sports bars with pretty decent food, notably much, much better than Buffalo Wild Wings - which isn't saying much.  They show a lot of sport and have some very challenging quizzes, and they all have very elaborate and extensive and interesting decor. For this reason I give it a high rating, and Barbie enjoyed our short stay here as did I.  Definitely one of the better sports bars and quiz/trivia pubs that we've been to lately."

Not only did we have a blast that would have made Alex Trebek proud, but we enjoyed some truly awesome brews with some decent food to keep them company :-)  Having spent a very enjoyable evening here, I'd come back again just for the trivia night, but even if I didn't like trivia their extensive selection of beers would bring me back for sure!  The prices were surprisingly reasonable, and the bartender was exceptionally friendly and very helpful assisting us decide on what to order.  Tip: While they offer a plethora of beers here, the food menu is fairly limited.  That said, I've tried both their Reuben and one of their burgers and enjoyed both very much.  My friend praised their pizza and their grilled cheese as well.  Flying Saucer is without question the best trivia pub/sports bar I've been to thus far in San Antonio and I look forward to returning!"

They have an amazing beer collection to offer.  I typically order one of the beers that they are trying out.  This last weekend I ordered the Banana beer.  Great start and awesome finish, not sweet but you could definitely taste banana in it.  You can find a pour for everyone's taste in their selection.    Now onto the food.  But first, let me just say during the right season they do have a beautiful vegetable garden growing on the premise that is used to enhance some of the menu items they offer.  They offer a delicious pizza made with fresh ingredients, it always hits the spot. You can also order a Red Beans and Rice which is also very good but my favorite is the Cornbread which is included.  I always order extra cornbread, it's that good. I've also had a few of their salads.  Music, music, music!  It's mainly an outside venue with plenty of seating throughout its open area and a few tables inside by the bar.  So that being said they have included a great stage for live music from Thursday to Sunday.  We have enjoyed various bands from blues to Texas country-rock to name a few.    A must to include in this review is that it is a super and I mean a super, dog-friendly venue.  I love this about GB.  So if you're looking for a place to kick back and enjoy the Texas vibe Guadalupe Brewery is the place to be for sure."

Truly amazing to see how hard work and wonderful personalities can flourish a business. We love the owners and see them every time we are here.  They have a lot of experimental beers, as well as flagship beers. The owner said they were going to add more porters and browns to their permanent selections to suit those who aren't into the unique pours.  The pizza is phenomenal and made to order and the space is wonderful to soak up the sun (or shade) and listen to live music with your furry companions."

I have love to watch them expand from a single room and 10 foot wide porch to the multiple building compound they have now. The beers are always delicious, the staff is always extremely friendly, and the addition of the new pizza kitchen is a huge plus.  Last time we were in, we ordered a build your own pizza that included a plethora of delicious meats and even topped it with truffle oil.

This marked all the boxes. It's a large outdoor seating options w plenty of tables and different areas to sit. There is live music, the brewery, several options in food and craft beer. I tried the spiced apple cider and a friend had the Texas honey ale both made locally and they were not only great tasting but pretty strong for a craft beer. The weather was gorgeous and such a great location. We tried the pizzeria on site and it's presented as \"Detroit style\", wasn't sure what that meant but was really happy w how it came out. Square/rectangle size sliced into 6 squares and very soft pillowy dough w a good amount of toppings and sauce ratio. We ordered 2 and an order of red beans and rice. Would definitely try them again so I could try other things on the menu."

The beers taste fantastic, especially the bourbon infused one! The brewery also has live music and the band we listened to the night we were there was awesome! There is a second tasting room where you can get flights instead of full tapped beer-that area houses the main brewery area. There is also food at the Guadeloupe Pizza Kitchen which is off to the side of the brewery...the pizza we got that night was the Detroit style pizza, one was veggies and the other pepperoni and it was very tasty! This is a great spot to hangout with family and friends!"

                "description": "After a long day on the river we went in on a Friday being and I'll admit we were a little hangry. Everyplace in NB was packed out and GBC was no exception but it was for good reason, thankfully we didn't let our hunger or the crowd deter us because we would've missed our big time!   So they have two separate building you can order beer at, and a pizza building, pub fare building and taco shack all surroundings common outdoor seating area.  I will say the beer selection and quality was amazing, They had so many unique flavors full of body, light to dark and low ABVs all the way up to 15%! Im so thankfully they weren't 90% IPA which seems like the trend nowadays but truly had a large variety as selection to please everyone.  Their cider was perfect my tart and not sickly sweet like every cider is, super refreshing.  The food was no second fiddle either, and held its own not just against the beer but other rival restaurants with similar fare.  First of pricing is really good so you're not gonna break the bank. Also you get a ton of food for what you pay.  But the icing on top is that the food flavors are soooo good, we had the cheese curds, blue cheese burger from the pub food building at it was honestly one of the best burger ive ever had.  The pizzas were equally as wonderful and had some awesome combinations you don't normally scene but they have them down. We got the one with corrizo and it I think is one of my favorite pizzas now!   This place should be a regular watering hole for everyone! although it's outdoor seating the trees, canvas overhang and mister make it bearable and they really have an ambiance that make you wanna stay and hangout, especially with the live music in the garden patio setting.   As a suggestion/request I will as the business owners to blessed put up some fans! Not just for the heat but the stupid flies especially in the smoking section were super annoying!"

It was our first visit since they expanded and it's even better than before. Same great expansive beer options with a lot of new outside space. They also have a separate small batch only bar and overall, their prices are very good. It's also dog and kid friendly and all the people that work there are very friendly."

                "description": "I was visiting from out of town and admittedly came to Guadalupe with high expectations due to the very high rating here on yelp but I can honestly say that those lofty expectations are not why I'm giving an average rating. The layout threw me off when we initially got there but we quickly figured out where to order food and where to get the beer. I got the Tiki IPA and we ordered a Detroit style pizza, Caesar salad and focaccia. Everything but the salad was really good but it took AN HOUR AND 20 MINUTES TO GET OUR FOOD. I have NEVER had wait remotely that long for food before, anywhere. Only other complaint is fairly minor in that the beer was $8 for 13oz which I felt was a bit expensive."

                "description": "Guadalupe brewing is one of our absolute favorites, and they keep expanding and somehogetting better and better. Amazing flavors and unique beers for every taste ranging from light pilsners to heavy stouts, hoppy IPAs or sour berlinerweiss. They have unique flavors such as dreamsicle, and If they advertise a flavor in a beer it'll definitely be a leading flavor and not slight hints! They have an outdoor seating area that is gorgeous, and an inside area as well. They also have two different bar areas to order from- and some beers are only at one bar and not the other, so check both before you choose! You can get reservations for a week in advance, so they're great for groups/special events. They also serve pizza which is so good! They offer normal or Detroit style, and is an absolute must!"

                "description": "This is a bring a group type of place. Tons of seating and a great atmosphere. We sat inside by the bar but it was still really hot. We were hoping it would be a little cooler since it was by the bar inside the building but this is Texas after all.   We really enjoyed it and the burgers were so good. We did a flight of beer so we can taste a multitude of what they have to offer. The Peanut butter stout was amazing. The only complaint was the copious amount of flies swarming us, lol. We tried not to let them bother us but they were drawn to our food.   We probably would have stayed longer but the heat and flies got the best of us. We ended up going to a different place to day drink. I think it would be even better during the fall, winter, or the spring."

The food truck will run out of some things so get in line ASAP' if you're hungry. I'd recommend the truffle fries and rib sandwich."

We've even slung beer for them on occasion to help out with events and goodwill.  From a \"closet\" with an outdoor grill on Friday nights, to a full dining and entertaining establishment,  Anna and Keith have never lost focus of their dream even all through Covid they have persevered.  The latest additions of a awning over the beer garden and customer laser engraved new tables to sit, three food choices including a new boffo pizza kitchen, you can't go wrong to stop in, relax and enjoy their hospitality.    Parents... there is a posting on the GBC website, please leave your minor children at home after 7pm. We don't see a lot of adherence to this request and this insults your hosts by being rude and reflects badly on you as a guest.  \"Prosit\""

I had a simple pepperoni pizza and it was absolute perfection 10/10. Better than Via 313 in Austin, which I hold as the standard by which Detroit Style pizza should be measured. One pizza was enough for one person, and I really wanted to order and second but I resisted."

                "description": "I had the privilege of attending Barrel Man Brewing's Grand Opening. There were a lot of people out supporting this brewery. It was pretty much busy the whole time I was there. The vibe was great. People laughing and having a good time enjoying their cold beers. It was a party.  The Head Brewer and Owner Fred was serving beers. Very attentive to every one. He was a machine. Serving the endless lines but still managing to engage people in friendly conversations with a smile on his face. I had several of his beers. All delicious in its own way, but my favorite was his \"SerenDIPAty\". At an ABV of 9.2  I think it drank more like a session IPA. It wasn't bitter or harsh like other double IPA's. It was smooth and very drinkable. I'm in no way a beer geek. But I felt like his beers were very good. I also tried their \"Islander Brat\". Let me say this brat really caught me off guard. The papaya slaw is everything. The garlic up front is really strong (in a good way). You'll definitely keep vampires at bay. It has a spicy kick to it and a nice texture. Combined with the brat and pretzel bun, that is brought in from a local bakery. This brat is the perfect pairing with their beer. I also liked that it came with chicharron instead of chips. To tie in their Filipino theme. Sorry no pic of the brat. I wasn't happy with the shot I took  Overall I love this brewery. Great beers, great staff, great food and a chill vibe to enjoy a nice cold beer.   I wish them all the success!"

I purchased a flight and there wasn't a bad beer in the bunch. I really enjoyed the porter, but their IPAs are great as well.  We also ordered the bratwurst, which comes in two varieties of trim.  Both tasted great and were very reasonably priced.  The attributes indicate that masks are required - this needs to updated. Looked pretty much like a freedom-loving zone to me.  Had it not been, I would not return.  I highly recommend you stop in on your next trip to Boerne. Has a much friendlier atmosphere than some of the better-known places in town."

                "description": "Have been wanting to check out barrelman for a while, but wanted to give them some time to build up their own beer inventory before checking it out. They now have 4 of their own beers including two IPAs, a brown ale, and a golden ale, and guest taps to fill in the gaps including a cider. They offer a 12oz or 16oz pour for a very reasonable price. ($6 for 16oz IPA- amazing!). We tried both IPAs and they were both solid with a smooth finish. The bartender was friendly and quick getting our beers out. We already had dinner plans but we saw a few of the pretzels around the taproom and they look DELICIOUS. They're huge and you can tell they're buttered and salted. The taproom had lots of tables available and the back opened up to a back parking lot area for room to move around. This place is definitely pet and kid friendly. They had a really cool vibe with some 90s Rock playing (including tom petty). Definitely looking forward to watching this brewery grow and can't wait to come back to try more of their food/drink!"

                "description": "This place is a keeper y'all!  They have been around for 15 years now and 15 years in my book = perfection.  Why have I never heard of this place before???  We went on a Saturday night (I think, lol) and it just happened to be their 15th anniversary party.  Beer and drinks were cheap, and I heard a rumor that the drinks were pretty stiff.  They had Karaoke (of which I did not partake) and a side area with 3 or 4 pool tables.  There were 8-10 of us (I might have been seeing double, so don't quote me on that) and we were able to all sit together.  It did get busier as the night wore on, but it was not crowded at all.  It's a dive bar and I respect it for that, the only thing keeping them from five stars as a dive bar is that they only had two bartenders and only one bar back that occasionally showed up.  This meant we were standing in line for refills for a bit longer than we wanted.  They really were busy."

                "description": "I love dive bars and karaoke and this place has both. Hidden Tavern has karaoke 6 nights a week starting at 10pm. The Monday night host, Dave, is my favorite. He is very friendly and has a wide variety of songs to choose from. If he doesn't have it he'll get it for you. Quinn on Wednesday and Saturday nights is also tops. They have a huge dance floor and stage so you can get your rockstar on. There is also pool tables and darts if karaoke isn't your thing. The bartenders here are awesome and know how to pour a drink. Especially Jess and Maggie. Also a shout out to the bar security, Ray. Best of all the drinks are cheap and they don't skimp on the booze."

                "description": "This is one of my favorite spots to chill with good people and feel like a rockstar.  So the drinks are always made with just the right balance of liquor to mixer ratio. The people here bond over karaoke like no other crowd I've seen.  Ask for Jess when looking for a bartendar who knows how to take care of her clients. Also both Eddie and Quinn are very professional and some of the best KJ'S I've met that know how to balance your vocals and make you look like the next American idol. This place has gone above and beyond my expectations everytime."

                "description": "It's never a bad night for karaoke. The drinks are always decent and fair priced. The karaoke djs do not play favorites. Ever time I go, even on a weekend, I get to at least 2 or 3 songs. They let me throw my husbands 30th bday there just because I asked. The staff has been incredibly friendly from day 1. This is the best karaoke bar in San Antonio in my opinion"

                "description": "Very sad time last night. I am a frequenting customer and I decided this one time to take one of my girlfriends out to my \"drinking spot\". We got there at 1am, ordered our drinks and received the WORST customer service of my life. Not going to lie, most of the time it seems like the bartenders were hired from a \"wanted ad\" on craigslist but this particular girl just took the cake.   She was asian, wore heavy eyeliner and a Tshirt that said PINK on it. Rolled her eyes everytime my friend ordered a drink because she was busy talking to the same group of people. at 1:45 she pointed at her from over the bar with a disgusted face and said \"You better finish that, were closing at 2\" im sure there is a much better way to say that and a lot nicer. My friend, playfully goes, \"aw we just got here.\" Smile on her face, bartender scoffs and goes, \"Not my problem you got here too late.\" Seriously what is that girls problem!?   My friend stood up at one point to fix her dress, again the bartender yells \"Hey you cant take that outside, you have to finish that here now.\" My friend replies, still pleasantly despite this girls attitude, \"I know I will.\"   SHE ROLLS HER EYES and says \"Or whatever, just act like im stupid\" Im at this point inclined to agree that you did in fact hire a stupid bartender.  These are just a couple of aggressive comments that your bartender shot my friends way unprovoked. And now im sad to say I will NOT be returning to your establishment. I will NOT recommend this place to anyone, in fact I will be avidly turning people away from it.   I honestly have no idea what that girls problem with my friend was, and this is not a drunk post. I was the Designated Driver and didnt drink anything, so I know what im talking about.  All in all, you hire terrible bartenders that drive away customers because of there own personal issues. You just lost a lot of business within an hour, congrats.  PS: I want the manager to contact me. I want to know why you hire someone like that."

I had a hard time staying here, I don't like my back to the door. It does have tables and chairs that you can move around.When we walked in people were smoking right at front door. I had to walk through smoke to get into the bar. It is centrally located.which is very convenient if you're picking up food or going shopping and just need a break. I did not stay long because of my own personal preferences. No one did anything wrong. Check it out ."

Alison and I stumbled across this place toward the end of a date night after having visited some other bars in the general area of town.  This one took the prize and we wish we would've just started out here to begin with.  Cheap drinks, TV's with sports and SNL. And, we were there on a Saturday, the aforementioned karaoke.  Get your name in early as the crowd really likes to sing here. I recommend just taking cash as they had some difficulty, for whatever reason, with their credit card processing."

                "description": "Dorćol Distilling is by far my favorite distillery in San Antonio! They are known for their award winning Rakia, which is a handcrafted apricot brandy. With this exquisite spirit, they create amazing and very refreshing cocktails perfect for our crazy Texas weather. If you are more of a beer drinker, they also brew HighWheel beer. My two favorite are HighWheel SA Hefe and HighWheel Betty.  During COVID-19, they have remained closed to the public but they offer curbside pick-up on all of their products; Rakia and beer. If you don't know how to prepare cocktails with Rakia, don't you worry! They have the recipes for all of their cocktails online. They also have a few cocktail making videos on their social channels, which are super helpful.   If you love beer and brandy, make sure to support local and check out this amazing distillery/brewery!"

Dealing with COVID hasn't been easy, but they've been creative and been able to keep their staff.  I prefer to make a stop here instead of buying at HEB.  Nothing wrong with HEB, but it's nice to also buy some Rakia or something else they've been working on. Their outdoor area is nice so you won't have to worry about being close to others.  If you're bar hopping, you should definitely stop here."

Our wonderful, fantastic, stupendous Yelp CM's open fare-thee-well was hosted here, and there was SoFlo Pizza to be had, drink tickets for Elite Yelpers, and overall just a fantastic night to rub elbows with the coolest Elites in SA.  This was my first time at Dorćol and I can guarantee you it will not be my last. This is a super hip distilling co with some ultra smooth drinks. Yeah, I'm used to paying $10 for an Old Fashioned, but the $12 Old Fashioned here totally rocked my socks off. It was smooth, it was subtle, and it had a giant branded ice cube. BRANDED. ICE. CUBE. SO DOPE. Those of you who know me know I always judge a bar by their OF. This one takes not just the cake, but the whole bakery, y'all.  The mixologists/bartenders were witty and fun, and made excellent recommendations. I had the porter, which wasn't as malty as I had hoped, but still hearty. Then I had that memorable Old Fashioned. Not gonna lie, I think it beats out the one at Eddie V's. Then I had the Mother of Pearl which had Absinthe, and that had me seeing fairies for about an hour.  I took a couple of minutes to write a Thank You card to our wonderful CM Tomas, and schmoozed with fellow Elites. (this review is also their notice that I got home safely. I see you Adam, Brent, Aurin, Raven, and Joey.) I had an amazing time watching people dance, play with the giant selfie light, and enjoy some top notch drinks.  Now that I know where this place is, and how incredibly smooth their cocktails are, I definitely want to come back. Especially for that Old Fashioned. Holy yum, y'all."

                "description": "It's a favorite!   They make their own brandy and then build an array of cocktails from that single brandy. Their cocktail menu changes slightly over time, but the favorites seem to stick around. While I enjoy their variety, I always go back to their Ups and Downs. It's the best. It has slight coffee and chocolate flavor and just a tinge of sweetness (which is perfect for me). And it finishes extra nice as it has a maraschino cherry waiting at the bottom for you. They also brew beer there, but that's not what I'm there for! I hear its good, though.  It's relatively small bar. The front section is extremely small, but there is a back area next to their distillery pieces. And when the weather is nice, there is a bunch of seating outside, where they occasionally have live music at. It's generally not busy, which I enjoy, as well. Overall, it has a nice intimate feel.   The only complaint I have about this place is that they only open Thursday - Saturday, and they close early. :'(   The artwork is enjoyable and rotates occasionally. The jams are good, the servers are friendly, and the cocktails are the best. It's a great after-dinner drinks spot."

Then we had to turn around and then we got stuck on the other side of a long train...   The place is rather small but it is lovely. Great outdoor seating, some covered and some not. Our friend said they recently added the cinder block wall between the patio and the train tracks. Maybe for noise, maybe for safety? Unfortunately it cuts down on the breeze.  The bartenders are fast. Staff members are constantly walking around picking up empty glasses for you.  The menu is small but potent. The Bee's Knees was surprisingly small but effective. I loved the flavor and the color. It was very pretty... I also had their version of a Pimm's Cup and it was also very pretty and tasty. My husband enjoyed his beer and it came in a pretty glass.   This is a pretty place to have some craft beverages. I highly recommend you go to the icecream challange next year if you can. It was delicious and we had a great time chatting with the other attendees."

                "description": "They're known for their rakia.  Rakia is Serbian/Croatian for brandy, it's made from apricots, and they distill it right here on location.  All the cocktails are based on rakia, the only other liquor I saw here was absinthe.    My friend had the Strawberry Port Cake (rakia, sugar, rhubarb bitters, some sort of strawberry liqueur, and other ingredients) and let me take a sip.  It was very fruity and refreshing.    Second cocktail up was the Mother of Pearl (it was the only cocktail I saw that was not based on rakia).  This was a coconut flavored drink with absinthe as a base.  Again, I just took a sip, but it was very good.  And I was informed that the absinthe was astounding - but what do I know?  All I can tell you is the drink tasted good.  If you know me, you know liquor and mixed drinks are not my thing.  I'm strictly a beer dude, so luckily for me, in addition to their famous rakia, they also brew a handful of their own beers.  I checked their online drink list before I went and saw a list of 5 or 6 brews.  I tried the Betty, a Kolsch that was light, crispy and tasty, but kind of watery and too much on the light side.  Not the best Kolsch I've ever had.  The bummer was, that after I finished my last beer, I was informed that there were taps on the left side of the bar that I hadn't seen.  Supposedly, they have a red ale that beats the pants off the Kolsch.  I'm going to have to make another trip down there for that one.  Cocktails are $10-$12, so yeah, it's a bit pricey.  BUT the bartenders do make an awesome and *consistent* drink.  Each subsequent drink tasted exactly like the previous drink. Cocktails aren't a science, it's an art.    The inside bar area is a bit cramped, but they have a patio area with tables and chairs to chillax on.    The night I was there, it started raining and they let us drag the tables and chairs into the distillery area, so we could take shelter from the elements.  Final verdict? YES, I would hit this place up again.  A very unique place technically not in Southtown, but close enough."

                "description": "\"Dorchal\" is a beautiful oasis for well crafted drinks. They have beer in addition to their own Rakia (brandy) - Kinsman. Alas I sampled the mixed drinks and then went on to their beer without having tried the Rakia neat. Their 'Mary Pickford' also features their home made grenadine. I also went with more bitter drinks like the Negroni Bianco, and their Paper Airplane. I think I liked the smoothness of the Negroni the best.     Had their IPA, not bad. And their Irish red ale.. twice. It was good.    With it raining we took to moving tables and chairs inside the distillery half. This allowed plenty of room and easy convo.    It appears since they are a drinking place that you can BYOF - bring your own food (or order delivery).  I \"sampled\" quite a bit more than I normally would. But 1) Tomas was a Tomastic enabler... Many thanks! 2)  I staved off a complete hang over with the assistance of Drinkwel before and after so I thankfully only woke up with only slight brain fog. I'm still testing them out, But they've worked rather well for casual drinking.      Again Tomas was most Tomastic presence throughout the evening. And again thanks and to the Dorcol crew for such a great evening and chill venue."

                "description": "REVIEWER # 45  Dorcol has this sexy spice to it that I'm LOVIN'!   I walked in with a couple friends on May 5th, 2017 and totally thought it was just a \"brewery\" until I seen their menu!    Dorcol is known for making a bomb Serbian apricot brandy (A brandy made of nothing but apricots imported from a family friends orchard), which I didn't get a chance to try; however, let's just say that they definitely don't disappoint when it comes to making a delicious drink! This place was lively on a Friday night and best of all; they had a DJ that was playin' all the jam!!! Yes, that was me swinging my hair and dancing THE.WHOLE.NIGHT!   The Friday I came, it was packed house! Many people surrounding the bar trying to order a drink. I can't blame them because I had front row seats at the bar and trust-and-believe I was not leaving until I had my drink in my hand. HA! Chris Mobley, one of the owners of the bar, was able to take my order as I ordered over 5 drinks for me and my crew. Chris was so patient with me and didn't seem frustrated, I totally appreciated that.   Chris also works with co-founder Boyan Kalusevic on this beautiful Dorcol creation! Kalusevic was born in Dorcol (hint the name of the business) and comes from a family that has a huge background in distilling.   They recently introduced craft beers and a mix of cocktails to the menu and I have to say, it's been a BIG hit! They have over 20+ drinks that are offered here.   They are only open on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights! Although I wish they were open more days out of the week, I will take what I can get! P.S- They have a good reason on why they are closed during most of the week. My understanding of it is that they spend the days they are closed to produce Rakia, a Serbian Apricot Liquor, which is what they are well-known for making!   This place is a MUST-DO on your bucket list of things to do when visiting San Antonio. It has such a wonderful hip vibe and friendly bartenders. I have to admit that this place can be great for private events: Birthday parties, Bachelorette party, College graduation? You name it, I am sure the owners can make something happen!"

                "description": "The Best Cocktails I Had While In San Antonio  SITREP  Little did I know that when I came with my friends to visit Dorcol In this modest little neighborhood South of Downtown San Antonio (SA), that would be blown away by this wonderful distilling company that makes the most amazing cocktails in this lovely city.  THE SETUP  My buddy Savanna M. and I pulled the trigger on a couple of their specialties:  the Apricot Daiquiri and the Jack Rose.  * The bartender knew his stuff and it was fun to watch him in action https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dor%C4%87ol-distilling-company-san-antonio-2?select=NJNUUOgjOeWachlC_R3cjQanduserid=3mNz5nQFTIBQm0oU5mBR0w  * And the drinks were AMAZEBALLZ, and that doesn't even fully do these hand-crafted cocktails justice.   https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dor%C4%87ol-distilling-company-san-antonio-2?select=MVENc2vf5knDycdeI5kEeganduserid=3mNz5nQFTIBQm0oU5mBR0w  And out in the courtyard where the DJ was laying down some jiggy mixed beats,  https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dor%C4%87ol-distilling-company-san-antonio-2?select_video=m72rGVYwjmkPkY2xA5ezzwanduserid=3mNz5nQFTIBQm0oU5mBR0w  HOT DOGS  The associated vendor was selling the most amazing goat-meat hotdogs.

                "description": "I finally made it to Dorćol!  Sadly (sort of), it was to say goodbye to our wonderful Yelp CM, Tomas as he ventures off on new adventures.  I immediately loved this place because it reminded me of the super-cool bars in Wynwood (Miami).  Industrial decor with painting by local artists sealed the deal, but what really got me were the drinks!  Their paper plane (one of my all-time favorite drinks) were amazing!  Warning:  they are tasty, but man, are they strong in a sneaks-up-on-you kind of way.  Most of the cocktails at Dorćol are made with the own apricot brandy.  I will definitely try the old-fashioned there next time!  I can't wait to return to Dorćol and work my way down their awesome drink menu!!"

                "description": "It's worth going out of your way to enjoy a drink and the laid back atmosphere. They have a variety of signature cocktails to choose from and they all sounded interesting. I tried the mother of Pearl and the tea-kini. Both were great. Perfect flavor. Not too sweet and with the right amount of alcohol.   The outside bar has beer. On a Saturday night, they had a band in the patio. If you prefer to watch football while enjoying your drink, you can do that too. They have a TV in what seems to be the distilling room. Definitely a little of everything for Everyone."

We couldn't believe such a fun, chill place wasn't packed on a Friday afternoon. The cocktails were delicious and very varied - pretty much guaranteed to find something for everyone here. The bartender was polite, and the woman who greeted us gave us a little overview of rakia and some history of the distillery. It was a great experience and would love to go back if I get to visit again."

We had made many unsuccessful attempts at a visit and finally hit them when they were open. It worth the repeated efforts because this place is really cool.  Lots of attention to architectural details and art making it a very comfortable place to hang out. The cocktails they concoct using their products are outstanding.    In one word WOW for the whole experience and can't wait to go back when the outdoor seating area is complete.  Job well done"

I'm sad I have to let the city know about you but I feel it's town to disclose your location and have everyone else enjoy you like I do.  This is not your standard bar nor is this a place that holds itself to the uppity up fru fru spectrum that can be known around town. Nope they're genuine and stay true to themselves.  Located near the train tracks (which you honestly can't even really hear unless you're located outside in the patio) you'll see a beautiful lit patio available for you to sit at.  Once you enter the doors you'll see an impressive menu focused around the rakia that is made in house.  If you'd like don't forget to ask the owners for a tour as they'll be more than happy to give you one in the back!  I love this place and how low key it is. You'll have such an appreciation for craft cocktails once you come here.  Their interpretation of iconic and innovative drinks is simply impressive!"

                "description": "I'm betting that if I had come to this place on a normal night, this review would be five out of five stars. However, we had our after party here after the I love SA YSB party, and I'm pretty sure no one told the poor bartenders that we were going to show up, since they were then deluged with yelpers.  It took me about 15 minutes to get a drink, but I tried the Brandy Alexander $10), which was delicious. It was fun to watch the bartenders make the drinks as well. The Spurs were playing that night so seating was kind of hard to find as well, they have a large interior section and exterior but between sports fans and the Yelpers, there were not a lot of places to sit.  There's a small tent that sells sausages as well, in case you get hungry. They also had charred artichokes that you could buy.  Overall, a nice craft cocktail and beer bar, I just wish that it didn't take so long to get my drink. However, you could tell that the bartenders were slammed and that they weren't expecting so many people."

You walk in and based on the menu in front of you, you would think your at an old fashioned bar with a twist.    The menu is full of cocktails, many of which have to be stirred and not shaken.  Look to your right, and you will find a smaller menu with the beers on draft.   I love the setting.  Your being served in the middle or shall we say side, of the brewery. We had a DJ outside and along with there stirred cocktails, there was nothing I could want more."

                "description": "2.5 Stars  I have to be very cautious as I write this review not to venture into Beer Advocate or Untappd territory. I assure you that I don't have an account for either. I have gone to their brewpub a couple of times. I've tried several of their beers at various places(Gooberverse series- Kanye Zest etc.). And I recently utilized toast tab to score their highly publicized beer, \"Rojo.\" So why am I going against popular opinion? Am I being a contrarian? Difficult? I will tell you there will be times on Yelp when you're on the fence about a place but cumulative experiences always tips the scales.  I remember before Islla even opened trying their Pineapple Empanada IPA at a local festival. It was hands down the best beer I had at that event. I really appreciated their ethos of blending cultural roots with creative takes on craft standards. Unfortunately for me that is where my affinity for them ends. Firstly I went to what was supposedly to be a soft opening. But a misprint by a local zine turned this event into a full out grand opening. Needless to say it was a perfect storm of circumstances: crazy crowds, unavailable styles, lukewarm beer to include service.  To be fair to them I understand they must of been taken by surprise. Which I assume included going back to the drawing board to regroup. I decided to reserve my review contingent on a future visit.  So I waited a few months to allow the crowds to dissipate. The next time I went the place was empty. When it is not crowded this is the most optimal time for a brewery to make a connection with the patron via tapmaster. Instead the dude seemed like, \"Whatever.\" No, \"Is this this your first time here?\" Or \"Are you looking for a specific style?\" I ordered the Suavecito 37 dressed with cajeta on the glass's rim. In all honesty I was a bit confused. The only time I have any one dressed is with a Corona and I try not to resort to that. Subsiding the beer this experience was less desirable than the first. The vibe was very unwelcoming. A brewery should create the feeling of being at a second home. No one traverses across town only to chug a beer wanting to leave.  Again I have to tread lightly not to go into Ratebeerland. The pivotal experience for me was an online purchase made on their toasttab account.  I was hoping to score the second batch of the Rojo made with Big Red soda. So an order was placed. I got a Saturday pick up time and date. I was ecstatic as it sold out in minutes. A few days later they posted a letter online saying that a glitch in the computer sold inventory meant for future release dates. The only recourse according to them was to divvy  pick up times into three waves. Surely my given Saturday date( first day of the relaunch) meant I would still get a late pickup or at the least be included in the second wave. Wrong.  Much to my chagrin I was not even given a second wave spot but relegated to third. Which meant an almost three week wait. I began to wonder how did they determine cutoffs? If the amount sold was in the hundreds why didn't they just do purchases in a first come first serve format? My conspiracy theorist brain went into overdrive. Did they pull the names of favorite regulars and place them in the first two slots? Was inventory even ready for pickup? If it was why didn't they just distribute orders throughout the week? Computer error on your part is still your part. It's best business practice to at least attempt to fix a mistake.    My experiences at Islla Street Brewing Co. have thus far been a series of unfortunate events. Even as a professed misanthrope I try to remain optimistic. However one of my biggest Yelp pet peeves is a business that doesn't attempt to make things right. To me this should be included in a business's mission statement. It shouldn't be, \" Too bad so sad.\"  Now I will segue into my craft beer enthusiast mode. Ok so here's what I think of their, nevermind. When you get past the chest thumping, gimmicky, inconsistent beers to include poor customer service all you really have is hype. And that's helpful to sell a beer but that alone can't sustain a brewery.  ps. In the Immortal Words of the Greek Philopsopher Flavor Flav- \"Don't Believe The HYPE!\""

                "description": "What a gem! Recommended by a fellow Yeeper [Yelp Elite], I am so happy to have found Islla Street Brewing. :D Such a chill spot and friendly folks. Smallish space with several tables and streaming music.   They're producing some of the very best micro craft beers; nothing like you will find anywhere else. Just check out the menu [see pic]. Islla's mission is to create beers that reflect their heritage and culture. They bring in ingredients that elevate and highlight each batch. Where else are you going to get Strawberry or Pineapple Empanada DIPAs or one brewed with real pink Concha pan dulce? Off the charts! And they use garnishes with some that really stimulate the palate.  Islla's interesting brews might seem a bit kitchy to some; however, as a certified beer nerd who has visited well over 100 breweries I can tell you there is a LOT of skill involved in their processes and the results are outstanding IMHO. Simply put: well-balanced, none to sweet, tart, or bitter...scarily crushable suds.   On your first visit I suggest sharing a couple of flights. Be sure to try the Suavecito '37 (grandpa's nickname) if it's available - a super tasty brown ale with toasted coconut, coriander, and Mexican caramel. Mmm. Cheers!  Note: During my visit, their was a Taco Truck on-site that was bomb!"

Unique in taste (seeing at the ingredients they use to brew their beers i.e. nopalitos and guava), their beers are true South Texas and nothing but solid.   You just can't beat their vibe. Their space is really unassuming but comfortable.  It's like walking into your friend's garage during a barbecue with Selena jamming on the boom box.  This is a San Antonio institution that you should take your friend's, family and out of towners to."

Islla Street may be new, but they've already become my favorite San Antonio beer... soooo freakin' GOOD!!  The beers are all awesome twists on standard styles - IPAs made with fruit empanadas. Stouts brewed with conchas or horchata and flan - and *consistently* delicious. The family ties just make them even better.  They do have flights (YAY!!), but currently don't have any to-go options like growlers or crowlers - on-site only.  Dog friendly. *Awesome* music (sometimes just a smidge louder than I'd like though) - my favorite is when the playlist (from the iJukebox) is filled with mariachi-meets-pop/rock/metal mashups haha). Usually a fantastic food truck posted up waiting to provide the snack action.  Don't hesitate - go visit! Cheers!"

                "description": "Considering that we're still in the midst of a pandemic and many small businesses have been struggling as of late, I like to give them my support the best I can.  Islla St. Brewing ,however, just had to make that a huge and really difficult challenge.  I drove here at the spur of a moment just to try that much talked about Big Rojo beer.  Then some girl asked me for an order number.  I had no clue what she was talking about.  I just wanted to buy some damn beer.  Then she told me I had to place an order online.  I was immediately disappointed, said to myself \"Fuck this!\" and quickly drove away.  Never again.  Not a good way of developing good customer relations...tsk...tsk."

                "description": "Great brewery with a great atmosphere. I am sure they will need to expand in the future.   The beers are very good. I love that they add extra touches like caramel or tamarindo on the rim. My favorite was the suavecito. The coconut flavor stood out. They also have sangria. Sangria is good, but give their beers a try first. You may just be surprised. Even if you don't like beer, you may just enjoy one of theirs. Definitely get a flight.   The area is small with only a handful of tables and the bar area,  but we didn't have trouble finding a seat even with the place full.  The night we went, they had a DJ playing tejano music. They also had a food truck parked outside.   I will definitely return..... I only wish they were closer to home, but they are worth the drive"

                "description": "Probably the most overrated Brewery in Texas.  Customer service was terrible, was unable to buy beer in person was told I needed to order online.  Finally got my hands on their Rojo beer and let me tell you.  The beer tasted like big red and Lonestar light had a child out of wedlock and named it diabetes.  I poured most of it out, for it to be so hyped doesn't surprise me, San Antonio has bad taste I mean joes volcano stayed open 20 years and that shit sucked too."

It's like sitting in the neighbors garage drinking their home brewing hobby beer.   Wait. That's not entirely fair. This beer oozes SA culture. Beers made with empanadas or pan dulce in the mix. Chamoy and chile on the rim of the glass. Sangria available for non-beer drinkers. Food trucks on weekends.   Give them a shot. It's a fun way to spend a weekend afternoon."

Friday night was poppin', tap list was impressive, the welcoming was warm and the drinks were flowing.   We had a flight of all 3 IPAs on the tap list. HeMango being our fave, and I ended up preferring their Chola blonde by the time our visit was over.  One other random thing I liked was the restroom..  ik it's silly but they had chongos and Bobby pins to pick up my hair (it's hot out here y'all) super dope of them. We even met a few people and chatted, super chill environment, everyone was just drinking good beer and relaxing. All in all an enjoyable experience. We'll be back."

                "description": "One of my Lyft drivers recommended Big Hops as beer destination while I was visiting. Unfortunately, I didn't have a lot of time left so I bookmarked it for next time. However,  I was fortunate enough to have a recently transplanted friend come pick me up for a quick catch up.  Big Hops is one of those spots where there's not just a lot of beers on tap but they're well (and I hate to use this term) curated. I'd been to more than a few spots in my first short stay in Texas and there was a BUNCH of good beers on hand. I had already had had a few earlier in the day and the beers here were not only one I hadn't come across but damn tasty.  Now, a lot of beer nerd type places can be condescending, especially if you're not up on regional breweries or what's pouring. Our bartender, David was super laid back and let us try a bunch of beers but also was someone you could talk to about beers.  We showed up pretty close to closing time but he let us stay-it was his birthday and his gf showed up with food and he was in no rush to leave/throw anyone out. We ended up buying him some birthday beers. I need to head back on my next trip."

                "description": "I don't consider myself a beer enthusiast, which makes my 5 star review even more profound. Big Hops has such good stuff on craft front that it makes me wish I loved beer more. This is a beer bar without pretension, a fun place to hang out with friends, and an even better spot to enjoy a quality pint.  They have something like 30 taps that rotate with seasonal stuff happening throughout the year. Their happy hours (typically 3-7pm on the latter half of the week). Sample as many beers as you can and definitely take the bartender's suggestions if any. The last time I was here, the bartender was celebrating a birthday and we ended up staying past closing time.  The vibe is laid back and there's decent seating for various groups from bench style seating and small'ish tables. I prefer sitting at the bar and bantering with the bartender. I particularly enjoy their sours, flavored IPAs (peach and/or grapefruit especially), saison. It's one of those places where I'll try anything the bartender is willing to give.  Prices are solid and they accept credit cards. Given how hot San Antonio's weather has been as of late, the thought of drinking a nice cold brew suddenly sounds really great."

                "description": "I was going to give this place 3 stars, but decided to bump it up because of the manager.  Super cheap prices on the menu, however, they charge for the glass. So what seems to be a $3 beer Is actually $7-$8 with the glass included. IF you miss this - you will be VERY surprised by your bill at the end of the night.  Storytime:  I got charged an extra beer I didn't order. I talked to the server about it and he was not seeming to understand what I was talking about. Got a little impatient with me and could tell he was getting frustrated. Thankfully he put me with the manager and we got everything squared away. Instead of taking it off of my bill he offered me a free beer on my next visit. Eventually I'll cash in my beer.  The manager handled the situation with such poise and understanding.   This place has a private lot with indoor and outdoor seating. Check it out and be mindful of the prices!"

It's so welcoming and a great place if you just wanna grab a drink and have great conversations.  They do not serve food though but you're more than welcome to bring some. I love the fact that this place is more intimate than the bigger places around the area so it's not so overwhelming. Definitely recommend for anyone to try they will give you samples to try and they are very knowledgeable about the beer they sell."

                "description": "Our go to local hangout for craft beer. They are a \"growler\"  station, so they don't brew their own beer. They frequently rotate out their tap selection so you can normally find some thing new and to your liking. Good selection of all types of beer, some from local breweries and some from across Texas. We enjoy the outside patio as there are  a couple of picnic benches with umbrellas. The shopping  center itself has music playing and it's always soothing. The inside is just a few picnic benches and a little to dark inside for my tastes, so we normally sit outside. This girl is solar powered!  They don't serve, food, but there are several restaurants In the same center and you can order and they will bring it over to you."

We've been here multiple times. With friends and without friends. Their service is great, we always love the rotational beers, and it's extremely clean. If you order 1000 Degrees pizza next door, they'll even come by and bring it to your table.  What's not to like about beer, pizza, sports on tv, and a chill environment?

                "description": "The quintessential after work bar. I've spent time here after brutal Mondays, stressful Wednesdays when I thought the week would never end, and celebratory Fridays.   Don't get too attached to a beer on their menu. They rotate frequently, which is cool, because it forces you to try something new with almost every visit. The staff is friendly and works hard to get you served in a timely manner.  The tables are graffitied to hell and back, which gives the space interesting character, and this is the only bar in town that I know of that plays The Growlers and The Allah-Las without a patron using an internet jukebox. That alone makes this spot worth coming back to. (That and it's walking distance from work and right next to a pizza shop)  Stick around on Wednesday nights for pub trivia, and swing by during a holiday or special event--you might score a free glass to take home."

I truly enjoy grabbing a copy of the SA Current by the door, ordering a 9% IPA and sitting down with my love while sipping some of SA's finest craft beer. There's TV's overhead for sports games and next door there's a jimmy john's if you are feeling hungry afterwards and the newest build-your-own pizza place 1000 degrees. The restrooms are very clean and probably the cleanest I've seen at any bar honestly, because they are SPOTLESS. If you want to feel some of SA's rare wind take a seat outside on the back tables in the patio area. Cheers!"

                "description": "Have been trying to find more IPA and craft beer focused places around town, getting into beer tasting as of lately so I thought I would start here; When I arrived, the Huebner location was very cozy and small, just my kinda bar! The vibe was very chill and laid back, the lighting was very relaxing, not too bright but enough to see the entire bar. The bartender I dealt with was very friendly and attentive, at first I was picking random things from the menu, but then I requested his recommendations since I know very little about IPA's; he was very informative and looked like he enjoyed his job (big points).   The place was very clean and tidy, the layout to sit was unique, I chose to sit by the window on a bar stool as to not take up a table that could sit people with more than one guest. The place does fill up very quickly on a busy night such as watching the game, or the night I went was apparently trivia night so people came in and the seats filled up fast. It's a shoe box size kind of location with good size tv's and a sound system, they even have a deck out back to enjoy the weather which I loved.   The beer selection was very diverse and it's something to periodically come back and check was new beers are on the rotation, the price wasn't bad at all either for the kind of beers they were serving.   Took one star away due to the trivia night people turning off the television while I was watching it, and proceeded to act like I didn't even exist, I was watching the Spurs game and having a good time; then they proceeded to set up their equipment around me where I was sitting as if I didn't even exist. I found it completely rude and even tried acknowledging them since the game was only in the 2nd quarter, but they completely blew me off. So just a fair warning about the trivia night people.   Other than that, I would def come back again but NOT on trivia night."

                "description": "BIG UPS TO BIG HOPS.  Rookies beware, there could be an awkward moment when the bartender asks you what you'd like and you're just staring like a zombie at the flashing screen of rotating beer selections. If this kind of moment is something you'd like to avoid, I've found the website is up-to-date, that way you can make your decision before leaving home, and be cool and confident when you walk in. This is a small bar serving beer-only with about a zillion options to choose from everyday. The place is simple enough: L shaped bar, 6 or 7 tables around that, and a few TVs with one showing everything on tap that day. There's a patio somewhere past the rest rooms, but I haven't ever made it back there. And that's about it. If you're into beer what else could you ask for? The vibe is grungy. Corrugated metal, stickers on the walls, and scruffy beards are everywhere.  Your flannel jacket and your stained t-shirt are equally appropriate. It's casual. Bring food if you're hungry. You can also stumble down the sidewalk and bring something back. There is a lot to choose from nearby."

                "description": "I like Big Hops a lot. It's a small, friendly bar with cool music, screens for Spurs games, and friendly beertenders. What more do you need?  First, the BH is located in some random shopping center off huebner in the back. Kind of out of the way but not really. It's a really small space with limited seating--several benches, bar seating, and a small outdoor area in the back.   It's a cool first date type place because it's usually not too loud and, depending on when you go, not usually too crowded. I went on May 4th and they were tapping a special keg w/ glass and it got super packed--like uncomfortably so--but I think that was just because it was a special occasion.   They have a variety of beers on a rotating tap--plenty of Texas beers--and others from around the way. This season they have Bells on tap so I have been spending some time there. I love all Bells beer, especially Oberon, their spring/summer beer.  Um prices are on par with other craft beer places. That's about it I guess. Check them out if you're in the area."

                "description": "Honestly, any place with good beer and a soccer game is a winner in my book! This place carries a great variety of beers on tap. Find one you like and want to take home? They've got growlers for that!   I recommend gulping down an Brash Abide  white Russian Milk Stout. This beer goes down smooth and leaves you wanting more. It is the White Russian of beers, and I seriously can't get enough! I also tried the Pineapple Thai Basil by Collective Brewing Company. The name in itself made me curious and I just had to try it. I mean, basil, in a beer! It's a sour beer, which I normally steer clear of, but the flavor in this brew intrigued my tastebuds.  If you like something, get it before it's gone! The greats don't last long!"

The draft list is digital so it's always updated and you can even find recent Untappd check-ins displayed as well. Although no food, Big Hops let's you bring in pizza from next door! The staff is wonderful and very inclusive even when they are providing no more than five minutes of service."

Fries were good. I don't usually care for ketchup but theirs was super yummy.  We sat outside in their beer garden. Lovely breeze, cool live music, fun vibe! (FYI, we're in our 60's and retired.  We were the oldest by far but felt younger just being here.)    Parking was a challenge but worth it!   Prices are a bit high but tips are built into the price and the quality of food was worth it!!!"

                "description": "We have enjoyed coming here for quite some time, always giving it a five star. This visit was average at best.  Nobody wiped down our really dirty table. After asking twice, I went and got the cleaning supplies myself to clean the food and spilled drinks off the table. Really, it should have been done right after bussing it.  Our pretzels came out luke warm but edible. We were not given any utinsels / napkins at the check out or when the food was brought. It seemed like the beers and ciders were much more limited than a couple months ago.  As for food, I ordered the fish tacos, which I have had before. This time they were mainly slaw with a few tiny pieces of fish.   We also ordered the pork chop but after ordering and paying we were advised that they were out. We subbed in the burger which was okay but nothing special.  Getting flimsy plastic fork and knife instead of real silverware (or decent quality plastic) was a bit of a challenge for cutting the burger, I can only imagine how it would have been with the pork chop.   We will be back, but are in no hurry.   We appreciate that they are dog friendly, so an extra point for that."

I had the burger and my son had the brisket cheese fries. The burger was very tasty, zero complaints! Nice serving of fries comes with it.  The brisket cheese fries stole the show though! Big mound of fries, really good brisket (and I normally won't try brisket if the places isn't smoking it on-site), and the cheese sauce is quite good, although you need to know it isn't Tex-Mex style queso.  Because of the situation, I had ice tea...I wanted a beer! I'll definitely be back to try one!  Follow me on Instagram @CheatDay_SA"

It's seat yourself and order at the bar. We sat out back (quiet without traffic) with our pup. The beers are SO delicious and made so well!! The Blonde has a German spin to it. We had the pretzels for an appetizer and wow the flavors of the cheese dip and mustard (kinda spicy mustard and I hate mustard but it was good). My husband ordered the friend chicken biscuits and gravy. Amazing!! More like a chipotle gravy and thick and sooo filling and rich! We was in Heaven!   I had the Chicken Fried Chicken on a potato bun- I am not a friend chicken person (maybe 1x a year), and I got it with the jalapeño lime wing sauce. Holy hell! Just spicy enough (not too much) but perfect! So filling and amazing and the fries had a homemade vinegary ketchup with them. Get this! Awesome! It started getting crowded with a lot of kids, but deff go early if that's not your thing. Awesome service and no tipping allowed!"

                "description": "I want to preface this with saying that we did attend Cibolo during the local Boerne Christmas parade, so they were SWAMPED. For that reason I am giving their food a complete pass on this review. It took awhile and came out cold, BUT I could tell it was high quality and I will be trying it again on a much less festive occasion. Their beer is quality stuff. I tried their seasonal Pumpkin Spice IPA along with another of their usual IPA's and I came away impressed. The one thing is, and again it was very busy, their beer menu chalkboard was a little chaotic and hard to follow. I would highly recommend Cibolo, and I am looking forward to trying it again. A good experience with the food and a little more time to read the menu could easily change this review to a 5 star spot."

I live in Houston and anytime I'm even remotely close to Boerne I make it a point to stop here for a beverage and a meal. There is plenty of seating inside in the AC but also outside,    for the beverages  I chose  the  Boerne Blonde  and then an October Fest , the entree I ate was chicken fried chicken sandwich it was amazing, obviously hand breaded and fried on a homemade bun with fresh cut fries, one additional tasty treat was the house ketchup with a touch of star anise. The chicken was moist, the bun extra flavorful..... the homemade fries are on point too, my wife ate the Meze plate, it consisted of the best hummus,  marinated feta, tomato carrots, and cucumbers, olives and pita bread with a drizzle of a balsamic glaze..... everything was perfect if you are looking for a destination date spot to make a great impression this is the place  Look I'm telling you to try this place and you will be hooked like the rest of us dont forget to tell them jimmy sent you!"

The chicken sandwich was great and tasty and you get plenty of fries. My wife ordered the chicken salad sliders and she said those were some of the best she's tasted. I gave them a try too and I agree. They have plenty of beer and wine to choose from too.   Seating outside front and in the back!! Pick your favorite spot and throw your feet up and relax.

                "description": "Not a bad place to try some \"home brew\" tasting beer and burgers on rolls. The place is clean, the people are very friendly. It's a kid friendly family environment, not a place to act up and cut loose for sure. Limited parallel parking along a busy street. 85.00 for 3 burgers and 4 beers. No tipping allowed because the staff is paid a living wage, a plus for sure.  Tried 4 beers, Blonde, October fest, whisky sour and the IPA and all have the home brew unfiltered thick grainy after taste but they are decent, as good as my home brew at least.   Major draw back is the food and drink ordering is at the bar so getting another beer is a long wait.  As patrons take their time studying the menu while others stand in line for a refill time can be passed by conversation with the locals or admiring art for sale on the wall, it doesn't seem to bother anyone and I didn't mind but I wouldn't make this my regular place for this reason, I recommend a dedicated bartender for alcohol only and food orders could do both.   FYI everyone is nice here"

My friends got the blueberry lemonade and it tasted weird and not sweet enough.  3. My friend got the chicken sandwich and it had absolutely no flavoring and seemed to be more batter and crust than actual chicken.  4. I got the wings and fries. My fries came 10 min before my food... so I had to send them back when my food came.  5. The wings were so tiny  it was actually funny how small they were lol.  6. The ranch was the most redeeming thing about this place!! ABSOLUTELY AMAZING RANCH YUM YUM YUM!  7. Our server was also very very nice and helpful.  Overall this place was disappointing :((("

I came here with my brother-n-law for some Fiesta 2022 fun to meet up with his crew of friends.   We all sat here and talked about what we planned on doing while at Fiesta.  A lot of great areas for seating.  The bartenders here were very tentative to everyone ordering drinks.  They don't hold on to your card here either when you leave your tap open.  Parking is semi limited when packed but there is street parking etc to park."

I came for their happy hour because the $5 frozen margaritas ($1 extra for flavor) are so good **and strong.  They put on some really fun events from time to time including djs, live music, and vegan pop ups!   They do have food options as well that you can order at the bar.   Definitely a solid spot, great to visit when the weather is nice, for a family outing, get together with friends, or even if you want to work on some stuff (they have wifi)."

This was my 3rd time visiting and i loved the atmosphere, music, food, and prices during HH.  The food from the food truck was also really good and fairly priced considering the amount of food given.   The 2 hand filling double cheeseburger was definitely belly filling, flavorful, and cooked just right.   Cant wait to go back when they have live music and sports on the TVs."

The place has a menu that changes regularly and old favorites to keep you coming back. My favorite are the deluxe tots with the over easy egg on top.  They also have a great Happy Hour that you can check out on Facebook.  I highly recommend their frozen Margaritas too.    The place has ample parking and there are a lot of cool local shops in the same area, like a plant shop. There is also great indoor/outdoor seating.  You place your food and drink orders at the bar and pickup your food outside when your buzzer goes off. Also, huge plus is that it is pet friendly."

Margaritas are not my first pick but my nephew recommended them, they were too strong to enjoy the taste.  It was a busy night and our first time there as well, we walked up to a long line to place our orders. When we finally reached the front the bartender looked and sounded a little frustrated. Her customer service can use a little refreshing.  Be careful when placing your order there is a tree root sticking out which tripped many people including myself. Overall I would return solely for the food not so much their drinks"

Our second round included frozen margaritas - my personal favorite was the prickly pear, though the mango was enjoyable as well.   The menu was short and sweet, but the Korean bbq wings were spicy and delicious, and the fries were exceptionally crispy and hot. I was impressed.  Great atmosphere and crowd in the evening, and a band was playing live music all throughout. It was a bit loud for my taste, but still possible to hold a conversation. Would definitely return again!"

Big selection of beer, great margaritas, and the hamburger is SO good and the fries are even better. Wings are great too. I've only been during the daytime when it's very family friendly, with a playground and trains periodically running by which the kids seem to love staring at. I've been there on both Saturday and Sunday afternoons and we've never had an issue getting a table (although as the weather gets hotter, finding a table in the shade might get tougher!)"

We saw Burleson, which somehow I thought it was so much further out.  It's across the street!!  When we got there, we were welcomed with a friendly smile.  I got a chamoy margarita which was delicious. It hit the spot after walking in the sun.  We ate there and I got the burger, it was great! My husband got the chicken sandwich and he said it was the best!  Great place to hang out at. I enjoyed my time there. I almost catnapped a grey kitty that was roaming around.  It was such a nice find! Glad we finally got to visit!"

                "description": "This is my updated review of Burleson. My husband and I went there on Friday night and the vibe was awesome. There was a great DJ playing excellent music. I had 2 Sky Trooper IPAs and I loved it. And I had my first burger there and it was FREAKING DELISH. It was char-grilled perfection. The bun was also char-grilled to perfection. It is a thin patty and the fixings are simple, lettuce, tomato, onion I think, mustard, and maybe pickles. It was a classic American burger. No frills, just thrills.   Then I thought about this burger every day since and we decided to go there today and bring the whole family. It was a Monday and I have been told to never go out to eat on a Monday b/c the regular chef/kitchen staff are not on duty. But who knows if that is even true or not.  Anyway.....I ordered 2 BURGERS for myself. That is how good I thought they were. And before I forget, the FRIES are the BOMB!!!!  I had my first bite of this Monday afternoon burger and I have to say I was disappointed. The bun was barely toasted and the char-grilled flavor was not as significant. The bun I could tell was a wee bit old and a wee bit dry. I was sad. The burger wasn't bad but it wasn't the burger I had on Friday night which was SUPER CRAZY AWESOME. What happened Burleson?   I still love your vibe and I will still make this my happy place for sure and I am hoping this was a fluke.   And another really cool thing I have to share from our Monday visit is that their coke was running a bit weak so the bartender brought us bottled cokes instead and didn't charge us extra. We didn't even ask for this nor did we complain about the soda he just noticed and brought them to us of his own volition. The staff is so nice here and I LOVE the place.  People are always having a great time here. You can bring the dog, the fam, or friends and just chillax yourself.  Please take care of that burger."

This was on my list to try, so we stopped at this old building that houses numerous businesses along the Alazan creek with a view of SA skyline.  This area is changing in front of our eyes, so get over there before it completely gets a makeover.  Though I am excited to see Alazan creek walk/bike trail that will lead you to Woodlawn Lake in the near future!  There was a good quiet crowd outside enjoying a nice Sunday winter day.  Went inside to look around and chat with the bartender about how they picked this place out of everywhere in SA.  It started with a caramel maker...  The whole building smelled like Chai tea as they were mixing it upstairs, so go on a Sunday if you want the sweet smell of Chai as you sip on your beer.  I decided to go for Copperhead ;) which was a Pale Ale that was full of malty notes.  This was a solid beer as I sipped at the tables outside and admired the SA skyline in the distance."

                "description": "The unintended effect of transplants coming to San Antonio cannot be discounted. Areas a generation that seemed overlooked are coming alive. Thus the same warehouse in the Westside that houses \"Shotgun Coffee Roasters\"  becomes an intermediary. A coffeehouse, a brewery in the Westside? Say it isn't so but at least for now our city is experiencing a renaissance of sorts . As a result more unique businesses are hedging their bets, opening up  in our city. Which brings me to the Vista Brewing Company.   I could go on, using flowery verbage to describe my experience here but why. So I will give you the rundown. Parking is very problematic. You can park in residential areas but be careful. Vehicles come down the street and like Sammy Hagar \"They can't drive 55!\" It's housed in the same building as \"Shotgun Coffee Roasters\" an excellent coffeehouse by the way. It is really small with some indoor seating with more outdoors. So basically you go to the counter and order your pour. The taplist while a bit limited has something for everyone. I settled on their \"Middle Trinity\" a Belgian Tripel. I would remiss if I didn't comment on the tapmasters as they are friendly.  My understanding is that this is their third location the other two being: Beecave and Driftwood. While they don't serve food in the foreseeable future they will have rotating foodtrucks. I must admit the beer I had was not too bad. It was much more sweeter, boozier than I anticpated. So sitting here I did have a critique. Since this area is close by an open ravine there appeared to be an insect issue. I was bit a few times and shooed off mosquitoes whilst drinking my beer. I hope they consider bringing in a pest controller periodically.  Still I recommend coming here. It is a unique addition to this area. A brewery in the Westside? I never thought I would imagine seeing one here in my lifetime. The Vista Brewing Company is a charming place with good beers and service to match. Will patrons  that never frequent this area venture outside their comfort zone to come here? I don't know. Time will tell. Next time I come I'm drinking inside."

                "description": "Visited on a Saturday afternoon and this place was super chill. Bartender was very friendly and had good suggestions. Great spot, - the converted warehouse it's in is very cool and outdoor area was nice. Beers were light and crisp. I had the American Pale Ale and  the weizen and would recommend both (nice day-drinking beers ). I do not typically like wheat beers because I find them too heavy, but theirs was light but full of flavor.  Looking forward to visiting again soon."

Love coming in to try some new beers whenever I have some extra time on my hands. Taps rotate all the time so it's always fun to see what they have!"

Not only are the beer connoisseur knowledgeable but the have a great sense of humor and easy going. I never feel rushed and they give great descriptions of the brews.   I chose their flight which is $9 for 4 options. I chose mostly IPAs but not sure what the exact ones I tried but everything was so good and I've been several times after this they always have opportunities to grab a free glassware with purchase of beer of course!   The location is so convenient and I love their beer options. I will be going here any chance I get to get my IPA fix and to try some new options!"

Though the music tends to be a little loud to have conversation.  They have events most every day too - happy hour, trivia night, etc.  No food here but they are totally cool with bringing in food to enjoy with more than 30 seasonal taps.  Lots of TVs too and outdoor seating for those rare perfect SA days. Board games and cards too. Overall great place!"

I thought they been open for a while now, however this was their 3rd day of being open. As a celebratory post opening, we offer chocolate cake. Such a nice detail. We the only customers in there, but I bet once word gets out it will be very busy. Daniel and Maryla (?) were exceptional and great customer service!!! We will definitely be back because of them. I had a Austin Eastcider Blood Orange and my friend stuck to the IPA route.  Everything was reasonable priced, and in the future they are supposed weekly specials. Bring your growlers to get filled here. They also sell crowler's as well."

Burgers are great, they discontinued their lamb burger, that's a BIG downer bummer for me  Nachos are awesome and very filling and they are not stingy   Salads are also very good here especially the kale ceasar salad I highly recommend it, this is a MUST   Kids meal range from cheese sliders, fish and chips, macaroni(I think it's the KRAFT box kind), personal pizzas and chicken strips   Jambalaya is a MUST(with penne pasta), the lunch half portion is huge I can only imagine the dinner portion   Pizzas are ok   Their version of chicken and waffles called Nashville chicken and pancakes is awwwwwesome that's a MUST along with their Nashville chicken burger   I'll still continue to come here because I've been here enough times to know what's good and what is not"

I just went with some basic wings because I was being so indecisive. But they were no basic wings okay. Those wings were too good. Hot saucy and crispy at the same time, which is hard to accomplish. The blue cheese was good too.  I got sweet potato on the side with a maple syrup which was also very good. Will definitely be back for the wings very soon."

                "description": "The pizza was so good. Thin and packed with delicious condiments in every bite. Eight slices were enough for just me and the crushed peppers were the finishing touch. The tea absent from this picture was as good too. Flavor wise it was what I needed and wanted.  The service was so friendly and always making sure we had enough to drink. The waiting time was around 20 minutes on a busy weekend downtown but worth the wait. They had screens all around showing a sport's game. The sitting was comfortable and the noice level very reasonable.   I would definitely come again and keep on trying their different options and enjoying either the view you can get or just watch a game. I can say I recommend it hundred percent. Provecho!"

                "description": "Epic location, epic draft beer selection.  Come for the beer and stay for the views! They have an epic selection of local beer on tap (see photo). We came for lunch and I had to sample some San Antonio brews.  Ended up trying the Honey Blonde ale and Nitro Pecan Porter. Both are worthy of repeating. For food, we started with Miguel's Queso (creamy with a kick, definitely cheese-forward). Then we shared a plate of vampire tacos and the chicken avocado sandwich.  The sandwich was just OK, but the tacos were excellent! Soft flour tortillas coated in cheese and fried to a crisp... What's not to love??!  Would come back after dark for views of the river walk."

                "description": "I had a great time stopping by this yard house location for a quick bite and beer. As expected for a Friday night it was pretty loud and the bar was packed but it didn't take long for me to get seated for my party of 1. My server was awesome and he did great even after sharing it was his 3rd day on the job. He was attentive and made sure I was taken care of. To no surprise the gardein wings were amazing, that whiskey black pepper flavor is everything! The side salad was simple by made well and the beer selection can't be beat! It's a solid choice if you're wanting a dinner or lunch in the area and especially if you're looking for a place to catch a sporting event with all of their TVs!"

                "description": "I started with Grand Patron Margarita and it's so good. (I've ordered a couple). We got the guac and chips app which was also really good - very fresh and had really good flavor. The chips it came with where perfect for dipping and perfectly salty. Our server Nick is super helpful and polite. When we asked about different entrees, he was knowledgeable and able to give us very descriptive details about different items. For dinner I ordered a Baja fish taco, Baja shrimp taco, and blackened shrimp taco - with fries. And he got the 8oz pepper crusted filet with the kale and romaine Caesar salad.  Everything we ordered was AMAZING. I especially loved both shrimp tacos. The steak was cooked perfectly and so delicious. We will definitely be back while in town. Kudos to Yard House for a job very well done!"

                "description": "I was recently in San Antonio and decided to try the Yard House restaurant near my hotel. I had never dined at a Yard House before. I wasn't certain what to order, but I wanted a big healthy salad and I ordered their large Cobb salad. (mixed greens, baby tomatoes, edamame, carrots, radish, egg, bleu cheese, corn, bacon, avocado, ranch) I was very surprised by the size of the salad and with the variety of items it consisted of. It was so good and I know that I took more than half of it home for a second meal. I'm definitely going back to Yard House to order this big salad again!"

Went straight to the bar and ordered a few beers and the Korean BBQ Cheesesteak. This was perfectly made. The meat was tender and tasty, perfect amount of cheese and the bread wasn't hard. I love cheesesteaks and this Korean version was awesome. I also had the fries and they were crispy and perfectly cut as they weren't too thin or too thick. Great meal, highly recommend!"

                "description": "While visiting San Antonio for a convention, our hotel was located across from Yard House, which made it super convenient. We visited late on our first night, around 9pm, and it was still busy. I would assume people visiting the river walk keep this location consistently busy. We ended up sitting at the bar since it was only two of us and could skip the wait.   We order the Zoodle bowl with shrimp and the Steak Bowl. Both were very good! I was surprised how much I enjoyed the zoodles since it was my first time trying them. The price was a little steep, but there were quite a few shrimp to make up for it. Service was fairly consistent and we enjoyed our dinner!"

                "description": "Where to begin... After walking on the River Walk mid day on Memorial Day, I was in the mood for a good chargrilled hamburger  I poked around in Yelp and found this promising looking place.  They were tucked away on an upper floor of Rivercenter Mall, a little pricey, and we had to wait a little to be seated, and a little for our food to be served. And by the way, not an exhorbitant amount of time. It was just busy.  But.... Oh. My. Gosh.  The burger was perfect, one of the best I've had in a while. The first bite had that just a bit of charred crunch and charred flavor, followed by melt in your mouth perfect burger. My wife got fries with hers that were fresh cut properly cooked.  The waiter read my mind by bringing me a two glass refill of my tea/lemonade.  Everything was great. Just a perfect experience. This is a sign of a great manager and staff. My favorite upscale burger place in the area"

                "description": "Very disappointed with our experience here at the Yard House.   Our server was all over it one minute then she would disappear and you wouldn't see her again for ages.  I ordered a second beer half way through my meal and didn't receive it until about 5 minutes after I finished my meal.     As for the food, our cheese curds appetizer was probably the highlight of the meal.  My wife has a Caesar Kale salad with Chicken and the Chicken Tortilla Soup. The chicken was very salty and the soup came out barely warm.   I ordered the fish and chips and the fish had been fried so long I honestly thought when they put it down in front of me I was being pranked.  It was almost the color of a brownie, but no it wasn't a prank!   The fish was a thick filet so thankfully once I touched the batter and it exploded into 10,000 pieces the fish inside was still somewhat edible.    When it came to paying our bill we used the machine on the end of the table but it turned out to be out of receipt paper.  We were traveling on business so had to have a receipt for expense purposes.  We ended up having to wait about 10 minutes for our server to appear and tell her what we needed.  She disappeared for 10 minutes then came back with the wrong receipt.   It took another 5 minutes for her to return with the correct receipt.  If you are coming here for classic rock.  Unless you consider Ah Ha - Take on me and  other similar 90's pop Classic Rock then you are probably going to be disappointed."

It's small and theres a large patio where you can just chill out with your friends.   The Helotes' old town is amazing because the patio is shared by multiple businesses which means you can eat and drink whatever you want from the stores. You can't bring in outside drinks or food but the atmosphere is great. The ambiance is complete with outdoor lights--- which I, as many are, am a sucker for.   On Wednesdays, there is a person who is playing live. Due to COVID, the tables are separated 6 feet apart and no one is supposed to move the seats to keep everyone apart. If you haven't tried this location, I would definitely recommend it."

On opening day, they had a good crowd, but the ordering went  smoothly. The bartender served while the cashier checked people out.   I tried the wine barrel beer. It was very smooth with a hint of oak. Definitely a little different, but very good.   For now, they only serve beer. If you want a snack, wine 101 has a good selection.   They have a small area with patio tables under the patio, but the common area also has some tables under the shade of the trees.   Street parking is available. It can be limited and you may have to walk a little depending on the day."

However they do not serve food and the other businesses are really missing a great opportunity.  We went on Sunday afternoon and none were open.  We saw many people come and leave when they discovered The Cracked Mug was closed all Sunday and Wine 101 does not open its kitchen until 4:00.  Seems a huge missed opportunity for these businesses, as I said, at a time when people are looking for places they can go and enjoy a nice open air space.

                "description": "The Modernist is definitely the best bar in the city. Each bartender is creative, kind, and knowledgeable. My friends and I have been coming here for at least three years; the laid back atmosphere (the indoor bar is essentially a living room) is the perfect atmosphere to enjoy a one-of-a-kind cocktail (or three) with friends. If you're abstaining, or have had a few too many, they make excellent non-alcoholic drinks as well. Heads up for first-timers: there's no menu, so be prepared to talk to your bartender about what you'd like and be open to trying new things--that's the best part! It's also handy to know that they don't accept parties that are larger than 6 to maintain the cozy vibe."

Every time i come here I always try something different which makes every experience very interesting. You basically just tell the bartender what you feel like drinking as far as flavors (sweet, fruity, botanical, warm, spicy, etc..) and they make a special drink just for you. It seems like they also have signature drinks that they make, Which I have to try soon.   Austin was our bartender and he took very great care of us. Every drink he made was perfection.   The prices are very fair, they make all their cocktails with high grade ingredients and still charge a pretty average price. I love this place and would recommend everyone to come."

Also had a few fire pits that's we could gather around to stay warm.   Craft cocktails were very good. They can make everything you can think of.  Smooth jazzy music was playing throughout the night. Cool vibes."

The outside of the building is so inconspicuous but the inside is so romantic! Truly a great date spot if you want something intimate. My one complaint is that the seating here is incredibly limited (because an actual small house) but at least it's easy enough to join a waitlist and get a text when there's space for you!"

Speakeasy vibe in what looks like a converted house on Grayson street- you'll know you're at the right place based off the mailbox. Walk into a dimly lit, intimate vibe. Feeling adventurous? Tell them your spirit of choice, and they'll ask you some follow up questions to make you a unique cocktail. Seriously such a fun experience. Want to stick to your favorite, tried and the cocktail? They'll make that for you too! Not drinking alcohol but don't want to miss out on the fun? They'll make non alcoholic drinks also. Really an amazing vibe and experience."

Now here is the caveat, you have to have at least some idea of what flavors and liquors you may want in your drink as there is no menu.  If you don't, the bartenders (who are freaking awesome) will try to fill in the gaps with a series of questions to gauge your taste.  A great place for cocktail lovers and those new/getting to the cocktail scene!  I've never been disappointed with a drink I've had and hope you won't either! Cheers!"

Located in an unassuming, unlabeled home, you'll be greeted with dim lighting and a relaxed ambiance when you walk in. This place makes for a great date night spot to enjoy unique cocktails and cozy up on one of the couches in the space. There's also an outdoor lounge if hanging out outside surrounded by twinkling lights is more up your alley. :)  What I really love about this place are the bartenders. You won't find a drink menu at The Modernist. The bartenders are prepped and ready to make any drink or cocktail you could probably request, but what makes this place truly unique is if you tell the bartender what type of liquor or flavors you like in your drink they'll whip up a concoction on the spot for you. I've gone both routes and have never been disappointed.   Check them out during your next night out. You won't be disappointed."

                "description": "First and foremost, this place has awesome bartenders who truly care about the craft of concocting quality cocktails.   Initially, I wasn't sure if I arrived at the right place because it's almost disguised as a regular house. This makes it all the more of a cozy experience.   The bartender who served me was such a delight. He made me two delicious drinks that are in my top five favorite drinks of all time. He used smoked salt to complement my spicy vodka drink (nameless) which was such a great pairing. My second drink was a pisco sour which had the right amount of egg foam and a well balanced alcoholic portion. MAGICAL!   Overall I highly recommend coming here if you want an authentic bar experience without the noise from regular bars that just want to churn out mediocre drinks. Consider this place a little secret that you're in on. Also, free parking near downtown? You can't beat that. BRAVO MODERNIST!!!!!!!! You have my heart."

They did have one Heffe when I was here today, but they said they are discontinuing it and only going to offer sours.  Sours are really not my taste, but to each his or her own.  I sampled a couple of the sours and they were ok, but again, just not my cup of tea, so I won't judge them on that.  Staff was very friendly, very knowledgeable about the different beer selections.  The clientele that we hung out with and spoke with were also very friendly and cool.  Bar area was kind of small but there is also a bit of seating back in the brewing area.

                "description": "Dear city of New Braunfels:  I hope you understand what you have here. New Braunfels brewing Co is in my opinion, one of the best breweries of Texas, definitely the best when it comes to sours (in my humble opinion).  I am gonna go ahead and sound like a pretentious douche, but my husband and I are huge fans of sours, and we have been to over 60 breweries around the country. This one is absolutely a keeper.  The brewery is ran by a family that lives in town, they do everything from cutting the fruit that goes into their beer, to brewing and marketing, so don't expect fanciness, a very small group of people runs the entire show. They are usually very good about updating their menu on facebook.   Remember, this brewery specializes in sours, you will not find the regular styles like Lagers, IPAs and Stouts and such. If you are looking for anything other than sours, please skip it instead of giving it a bad review.  The tap room may be tiny, but it's packed with awesomeness and flavor. The staff is super nice and knowledgeable, and they are always ready to help you and tell you all you need to know about sour beer.  This brewery is not a place to hang out for a long time with your friends, but more of a place for doing a quick tasting and take some bottles home. This is absolutely not a good place for large groups.  I recommend that you buy a flight, which is $8 for 4 small pours, that way you can taste different things. If you want to commit to just one, the prices are very reasonable.   My favorites are Saison de Nefle, Hell yeah! and PKL FKR.  We like their stuff so much that we bought a membership to their club, which is totally worth it."

Very friendly staff were quite informative.  Only the second time I have tried a sour, first time at Jester King and I did not like. They gave me a free taste and off I went.  We quite liked the sours actually better than some of the wheats. We tasted 5 of the 8 taps and liked all but one.   The sours are like a double fermented beer inoculated with live bacteria and can be quite puckering. Some are barrel aged up to a year.  If you're in town I highly recommend stopping in. You can even wander around the small brewery on your own.  Oh btw, they will pour you a cup to go. New Braunfels allows open containers, drink up!"

Really small inside area, but a nice little beer garden out back. No food.   Also, importantly, if you don't like sour beers - I wouldn't make the trip. That is what they specialize in, and every beer on tap is some form of sour except one."

                "description": "We definitely hadn't planned to stop by New Braunfels Brewing Co on our last brewery tour, but while we were at Faust Brewing, the bartender let us know they were having an anniversary party. We decided to stop by and see what they had to offer.  It turned out that most of their beers leaned toward the sour end. Sours aren't necessarily my favorite, but I was intrigued by the pickle beer. (Not a fan.) However, they had some dark sours that were actually delicious! This was our third brewery of the day...so that may have influenced my taste buds, but no matter...I still enjoyed them. And the anniversary party was hopping and it seemed like a lot of people love this place.  We'd like to go back and check them out on a non-party day, just to see what they've got. Definitely on our list of places to go again!"

                "description": "I was sooo excited to taste these guys beer. Thier website promised some adventure in a cup. Ummmm DISAPPOINTED, is all I can say.   1. They don't change the website, but to quote the guy pouring, \"nothing in life is a sure thing\". I'm pretty sure the \"on tap now\" list is supposed to be a sure thing. Thanks for not only being a Dick, but for wasting my time.   2. All of the beer follows the ode if a little spice is perfect the whole bottle must make it better. Not good. I tried 6 of the 8 beers hoping for one I could finish. NOPE   First clue I should have just turned around was the bartender asking me if I was hungover.  (Nope, but thanks for telling me I look like s°~×  before saying welcome to our brewery)   NEVER AGAIN"

                "description": "We had an accidental run in with this brewery. We happened to spot it as we were getting out of our vehicle on our way to another place. The open sign was calling us, and for it being past 8:00, finding a brewery open that late is unique.  The tasting room is fairly small with a few bar stools and a bench in the brewing room. They  invited me to go in the brew room to take pictures.  These brewers are some of the nicest we've met so far. Great company and conversation. They even recommended some other local businesses, which I now have bookmarked.   The beer: they specialize in wheat beer. That's not typically the style of beer I enjoy, but I did find one called the \"Hot Child\"- a cucumber and jalapeño infused beer. We only had time to have one beer as their tasting room closes at 9:00. Currently their tasting room is open Thursday-Friday 5-9pm. I hope to see these guys at Wurstfest someday."

We ordered wine which came quickly. Then ordered our food. Eventually the waitress showed up and tried to give us a salad with the wrong meat, a burger and another sandwich instead of soup, oops wrong table. And then took a long time for us to get our food out. I think they might have forgotten to place the order. Once the food showed up the salad with grilled chicken was very tasty. The Postale soup was delicious. And the bison burger was cooked perfectly. The side on the bison was a  GIARDINIERA which was a bit on the spicy side."

                "description": "The oldest, and probably the slowest bar in San Antonio. We caught a ROACH skittering on top of our table when we had finished eating...   Before that, we waited half an hour for our drinks before asking the server where they were; they had never put in the order so we waited longer. Once our table upstairs was ready, the new server and his assistant introduced themselves and then never came back to take our order. We waited 20 minutes while we saw him go back and forth by our table, completely ignoring us. At one point we went up to him to tell him we were ready to order... He told us we would get faster service ordering food at the bar. I don't get what the point is in having a server then?   I only give it two stars b/c the interior was pretty cool, but the service was probably the worst I've experienced in a long time. Food was so-so. Deviled eggs tasted off. Didn't cook the burger to preference. French fries were meh. Paid $15 for a piña colada that was probably only pineapple juice with crushed iced. I was surprised since this place had so many raving reviews."

                "description": "Conveniently located in downtown San Antonio on the Riverwalk, The Esquire has a cozy old time atmosphere. I bellied up to the bar and noticed it is so long, it seems to go across the street! The menu is typical pub food and I opted for the fried seafood platter and my favorite beer, Shiner Bock.  The belly buster portions of tasty fish, prawns and delicious french fries  was more than I could handle and I hated to not clean my plate (There are starving people in China you know) leaving a lone piece of fish. I was admonished for wasting it by a guy down the bar when I threw in the towel. Lively atmosphere for a Wednesday night with some classic rock being played on the jukebox. Definitely want to return again as I would describe in one word \"FUN\"!"

All that said, I was BLOWN away by the whole experience. We came on Repeal Day - a celebration of the day prohibition ended- and there was a live jazz band and a burlesque style performance.   It. Was. Epic.  I am honestly considering flying back to San Antonio next December just to experience their Repeal Day celebrations again!   Beyond the show, the food and drinks are also worthy of a repeat. The drinks were strong (I would expect nothing less from a previous speakeasy) and had fun names and creative concoctions.   We ordered the plantain chips to start, the brisket sandwich and pork snitzel, topped of with the fried apple pie for dessert. Everything was well prepared and delicious.

We ordered the Bexar Hug and Fancy CVS cocktails. For appetizers, we ordered chalupitas and chili salt fries. Really liked the chalupitas but the fries were okay. For main course, we ordered the jerk shrimp wraps and bison burger. Both these were really good. For the dessert, we ordered the fried apple pie. I am so glad we ordered this inspite of being very full. This was delicious and so flavorful. Not overly sweet but deliciousness in every bite.   This place is huge so there is ample seating. Recommend stopping by this place on the river walk for good food great ambience and good service."

She felt horrible about it. Just my opinion but there are dozens of places we have eaten at that are so much better around here!! Just a heads up!!"

                "description": "AWARENESS: Hungry walking around the River Walk in San Antonio, my wife and I happened upon The Esquire Tavern.  A nice, well maintained \"old school\" building with an outdoor patio area overlooking the river.  Nice!  NARRATIVE: The Esquire Tavern is an old school tavern.  They have an extensive beer, wine and spirits menu also a food menu guaranteed to satisfy the best frugal taste buds.  When I saw on the menu they offered a home made fried Bologna sandwich, I was done looking.  My sandwich came with a huge slice of fried Bologna, almost an half an inch thick.  Savory, rice and not greasy.  It was so good that before we headed back to home, I made it point to return and grab another sandwich.   SCENE: The Esquire Tavern is located on E. Commerce Street just off of S. Saint Marry's Street and the patio area of the restaurant overlooks the famous \"River Walk.\"  RECOMMENDATION(S): San Antonio has so many great places to eat, its hard to recommended a few or just one.  I can say, the reason The Esquire Tavern stands out in my mind is that Bologna sandwich.  I will NEVER be able to think about San Antonio without thinking about it."

Their craft drinks are amazing, and they used to have a bartender works towards the left side of the bar that I love the way he makes my cocktails, but the last few times I have visited, I couldn't find him.   Their house tequila shots are amazing; hence, anything that is made with the house tequilas are amazing as well. Our favorite and one of a kind would be the 'Bloody Mary'. Ask for house tequila with blue cheese. Trust me, it won't go wrong."

But last night, we were hassled at the door by a smart mouthed employee and we won't EVER return. Too bad for you as my husband loves good bourbon and we've spent a good amount of $$$ here in the past.  I know it's hard to find good employees, but if they're running your customers off, it may be a good time to reassess their role.  Update - to Don M - we had our IDs and showed them to the guy. He didn't identify himself at first and just grabbed me while I was walking by.  My husband and I haven't been asked for our IDs when we've visited previously, so your explanation doesn't hold up."

I've been here before with the girls and today I came with my husband - both times a flashlight was needed.   This bar gives me a little bit of gentlemen club vibes , bottle everywhere, very dim lighting, men bartenders dressed up, cigar cabinet.   Definitely a nice place for a small group of 2-3 to have amazingly crafted drinks and conversation. Not really a girls night out type of feel. It's a small place so the best seats are around the bar but I believe there are 2 couches for a more relaxed feel.   Our bartender was such a gentlemen and surprised us with our drinks because my husband and I didn't know what to order. We got the bluegrass and the righteous- both so delicately crafted with a skill - our bartender for sure had a bachelor's degree on this.  My insides exploded with each sip. So yummy. There really is a drink for everyone in this. I definitely recommend this bar."

I went to meet up with him and he chose Bar 1919.  Bar 1919 is a speakeasy in the Blue Star Complex.  Parking is relatively easy to find in the plaza but the bar is hidden in the back of the plaza underground.  It took me a few minutes to find it.    I ordered 2 cocktails off their specials menu.  Both were delicious!    RUN to this place if you LOVE speakeasies and cocktails.  Definitely an experience.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!"

                "description": "1919 has all the vibes that make a speakeasy great: excellent drinks, friendly bartenders, a relaxed ambiance, and in a location that is hidden just enough away from the hooplah that is reality. (#1) This is truly one of my favorite places in all of San Antonio.  First timers are more than likely going to get lost coming here. The signage is minimal at best and it's hard to see / hear anything that's going on. A key item is the illuminated \"Joe's Jazz\" sign above the basement level where the bar is located. Look beneath the street level railing and notice the blacked out windows. If one is lucky, they might even catch someone drinking along the limited outdoor seating, but inside is where all the action is. (#2)  The elongated bar, along with the ambient lights behind it, is magical in its own little way. It's easy to be impressed with the space and ventilation (#3), where there is seating on each end in the form of couches and tables. I personally think the bar is the best place to be.  It doesn't take a cocktail connoisseur to notice the bartenders are more like mixologists. Their crafty ways can whip up one hell of a drink and the kind that isn't just perfect for a photo op, but complex with its own liquor'y way. Whether it's a classic cocktail like a sazerac or an old fashioned, or one of their signature concoctions like the muthafuckah jones or pimm's cup, everyone is in for a treat. Personally, I like the to tell the bartender a spirit I'm feeling and just let him / her surprise me with something. It's worked quite well.  Whether it's a date night or a night cap, this is an excellent place to enjoy an adult beverage. Drinks are understandably in the $12-18 range and are certainly on the upper echelon of libations. Come alone or bring a friend and step into an oasis that only speakeasies like 1919 can provide. _____________ (#1) Or if to be taken literally, a very large parking lot. (#2) Not a poor choice of words, at all. (#3) Fancy cocktails and hot weather is not anyone's idea of a good time."

I love that it truly has a speakeasy vibe.   This time we decided to try a pour of Pappy Van Winkle  and a cocktail. First, for those that want to have a taste of pappy without breaking the bank, this is your place. They have reasonably priced options. I tried the righteous cocktail. It was perfect. Not too sweet. Great taste. They do offers plenty of cocktails and have a lot of liquor to choose from.      Right now, during the covid pandemic, they do have someone at the door checking your temperature and escorting your group to your seats.  Parking is shared and can be difficult."

In fact, THE SECRET IS OUT. 1919 has over 400 reviews at the moment, which is a tad on the high side for anything [in San Antonio], and it's not hard to understand why. THIS PLACE IS EXCELLENT.  They have it all when it comes to booze. You could LITERALLY fill a moderately-priced above-ground pool with all the amber liquid they have on display. There are clear alcohols available too, but bartenders take much more pride(trust me) in the aged stuff that tends to fall on the visual spectrum somewhere between golden and brown.  Some reviews say they have over 1000 bottles. This is seeable and believable, but what's truly impressive within 1919: the bartenders have knowledge and details on all these obscure bottles AND they can steer you in some tasty directions."

It was completely empty when we arrived (given it was a Monday at like 4 PM) so we thought it might have been closed, but thankfully it was not.  When we saw that they had $5 happy hour cocktails, the gloves were off and the Asian glows were on. Unbeknownst to us, one of the best drinks we'll ever have was about to be made, and for only $5(!?) Five bucks in Chicago gets you no more than a shot of bottom shelf tequila at best!  All the other drinks we tried were excellent as well but I honestly can't remember which ones they were. But the Waterfall is one I definitely will not forget."

                "description": "A gem!  We found this oasis tucked back in the woods outside loop 1604 a few weekends ago and fell in love.  Beautifully lit Beer garden, live music, outdoor picnic tables and a covered patio. Large play area for the kids with a backyard / residential size \"fort\" and swing set. They had a dozen beers on tap and a couple wine slushees.  We really liked the hazy IPA and the Lucas Pilsner.  The peanut butter stout and the amber are also very good. They are only open two weekends a month, so check the website and plan to make some great memories!"

Bringing you live music and great beer on tap is always a plus when finishing out the work week. If you have kiddos and scared of babysitting there is even a play area and a dance floor to enjoy."

                "description": "It was definitely a drive coming out here, but it was an easy drive, since there was not a lot of traffic. There were lots of beer options - ten of them! We got the mother board which is a sampler of all the beers. My SO and I got one mother board to share and sample all the beers. It was a lot of fun and we each had our favorites. There was lots of cute shaded outdoor space, and a patio with misters. There was a tiny table inside, as well, but it's mainly geared towards outdoor seating. There was a Mediterranean food truck on-site as well, we didn't check it out, but it's good to know there's a food option. We enjoyed coming out here and hope to be back!"

                "description": "This is such a unique brewery that is off the beaten path but well worth the drive. There is ample dirt parking and plenty of outdoor seating. There is a covered patio but limited seating. You'll also find a small 21+ seating area. Come with your friends or bring your whole family as they have a huge play area for the kids and ample space for them to roam around. They also have games for adults such as washers and corn hole.  The entire venue is clean and well maintained. In lieu of Covid masks are required indoors when ordering your beer, and they have hand sanitizer stations setup throughout.   My beverages of choice were the Reese's Stout and Hobanero. The Reese wasn't very peanut buttery but it was still a nice light smooth stout. The Hobanero was fun with an IPA touch and not as hot/spicy as I anticipated it to be. You also have the option to have it dressed and I highly recommend it. Besides beer they have wine and soft drinks available as well as light snacks. You can bring in outside food but they do have a food truck on-site. Check their website for information on live music and what food trucks will be there for your visit.   If you're visiting or live in the San Antonio area I highly recommend adding this brewery on your places to visit. Especially while the weather is so nice!"

                "description": "Cactus Land has been on our radar for a while but it seemed like every Time we tried to go they weren't open. Be sure to check their website before making the trek out here! I think they're usually open two weekends a month. It took us a good 45-50 minutes to get here from far west San Antonio. However! This place is awesome and you can make a day out of it and also hit up seersucker (gin/vodka) while you're in the area.   They offer beer flights and different sizes of each beer and have a good variety of beers. Our favorites were the Lucas and sienna ale. The staff was super friendly. The inside area is small with only a couple of tables. Outside area is covered and has fans. There is a large yard area and games. They have a stage for live music for the evenings. Great beer and a nice location once you get there!"

                "description": "Craft Breweries in Texas remind me of the stories of lore. Of settlers, prospectors who came here to seek their fortunes. Their only resource an entrepreneurial spirit that led them to certain success or ruin. Cactus Land Brewery in Adkins, Texas continues in that tradition with an absolutely charming place, a friendly vibe and with flavors as spacious this side of the Pecos.  Coming from San Antonio it's really not too far a drive from here. It's hidden in a labyrinth of small winding roads punctuated by tractors. I've experienced breweries in different settings: industrial areas, a college town, by the ocean. I must admit experiencing a brewery in the country is unique and a first for me. If you look across the way there is another property with horses.   I think I was initially struck by the sight of that, seeing a brewery in the middle of country land. It feels like by design the idea was to contrast the vibe of a brewery with the rugged terrain. For example their taproom is small but exquisitely decorated. The outdoor area is more vast with ample seating and tables. The balance between nature and the urban sensibilities of a brewery are simply yet beautifully stated. I can only imagine this place when the weather becomes cooler, in autumn.   Which brings me to all the important things. The aesthetics as I've alluded to are impeccable. I like that there's a visible board with all available taps: names, abv, pour sizes and prices. Above all the service was excellent. The principal owner, southern drawl and all was beyond friendly. I've been to breweries where staff motions for you to make a decision. Here the owner understands that you don't choose a beer, a beer chooses you.   As far as their offerings they have something for everyone's taste: gose's, ipa's, stouts and blondes. In addition they offer sampler sizes, flights and crowlers. I tried the \"Reese\" a peanut butter stout, \"Texas Juice\" a hazy ipa in vogue at the moment and \" Eat your Breakfast\" another stout with maple syrup. I think out of all of them I enjoyed the \"Reese\" the most. Drinking it reminded me of tearing into a package of peanut butter cups. I tend to think they understand that we attach memories to flavors. Thus beers are brewed with this in mind.  Cactus Land Brewery is a small place big on charm. The beers have flavors as big as a ten gallon hat, made better by excellent service. This taproom is a perfect escape especially from the hustle/bustle of the city. If you like trying out new breweries put this on your check off list.   ps. (Yes there's more!) I don't know why but I felt like any moment George Strait was gonna walk in and say, \"Well excuse me but I think you got my chair.\""

                "description": "This is our local success story! The third anniversary and it is packed with people from San Antonio and surrounding areas. Cactus Land is brewing some of the best beer in the country and trust me, we've tried a lot!   Catch them the first and third weekend a month. Try their varieties of beer from Ale's to IPA's to Stout, there is something for everyone. This is another great example of a family run, family fun business that is catching the beer lovers attention! It's a true hidden gem. Hidden in the middle of nowhere for now but they are building on and I'm sure it will be noticed!"

                "description": "I was surprised to see a brewery in Adkins, Tx when looking to get a drink. My boyfriend and I decided to check it out since it had pretty good reviews.  The drive is very scenic and green which I enjoyed. We went on a Friday at 7 p.m. and it was a packed house. There was plenty of parking in the area. They had live music going when we got there and we were greeted with friendly faces all around. There was plenty of seating outside. We got to try samples and the person helping us was wonderful and made recommendations based on what our favorite beer was.  The prices were reasonable and we payed $17 dollars for a flight a 10 oz beer. I decided to go with their 10 oz snifter Salted Pilsner with Lucas in the rim. This would have to be one of best beers I have had from a brewery that I loved. My boyfriend got the flight of different beers and his favorite was the Oreo Stout that literally tasted like Oreos. It was delicious and I appreciated the fact that these are flavors you can't find anywhere else.  The environment is laid back and somewhere you can go to enjoy the sunset and hear some live music. I will totally be coming back to enjoy a beer on the weekend."

                "description": "My husband and I wanted to check out this place for a while now but we weren't sure if it was kid friendly! Lucky for us we checked out the reviews before hand and saw that they are definitely kid friendly!  Not only was the LUCAS beer delicious the experience and vibe was so chill and relaxing. We got a root beer drink for my daughter, a flight for me and a pint for my husband and combined our bill was about 24$. For us that was such a great price for the enjoyment of the property and live music.  The land it sits on is beautiful and when we showed up they had grouchy mamas food truck!  There is picnic tables to sit on under a large beautiful tree  Or tables and chairs to sit on under a porch like area that has a fan going for the heat.  They also offer complementary cups for water.  Towards the side of that porch is where they have a playground for the kiddos with two sings and two slides!  They also have the land gated where your kids can run and play.  If you want to bring a ball for you child to play with it probably would be a good idea while enjoying your beer.  Overall I loved the atmosphere! We will def be back!one last thing! The staff was very friendly and helpful! It was our first time so they offered samples of the beer which was perfect for picking my drinks!"

They are also one of the few breweries in the San Antonio area, in my opinion, that consistently puts out great beers. Whether you're in the mood for something light and calm or have a hankering for a bit of excitement for the old tastebuds...they wont't let you down. They always have a nice variety of styles on tap to choose from.  Check their website before going to see who will be playing on stage and what food truck will be serving up dishes."

First off, we have a 3yo and I was so happy to see that this place is super family friendly. There's cornhole, a playground and plenty of grass to run around in. On top of that they do offer NA drinks so it was easy to keep our kiddo happy. We tried a lot of their beers and I have to say I enjoyed the majority of them. (I may be in love with Raspberry PopPop). They had a good little acoustic set going on and a very nice food truck. The whole thing was incredibly chill and we can't wait to go again but bring friends this time. LOVE!!!"

You order at the bar from a fairly limited mostly Mexican menu. They call you when it's ready. They have a cool slide for the kids and it's dog friendly. They had the nachos half price so we went with those. The steak were good but the chicken were very tasty. Both had some queso blanco, black beans a sauce.  My only issue is the food took forever and when we went to ask the guy said he got distracted and forgot to call us so the food was Luke warm. We were there for lunch but I'm sure at night it's much cooler"

                "description": "Have you ever wondered where you can get an over priced dry burger AND tetanus? Head on down to The Friendly Spot and pull up a rusted chair presumably rescued from the wreck of the titanic! If you're tired of having kids, drop them off at DeathTrap Playland which is conveniently attached to the sitting area. A cargo net from the late 1980's and playground equipment assembled from leftover construction material by a blind person awaits your kids, also offering a parting gift of pin worms! If you're unsure what to do with your weekend and you hate your friends and family, make sure to make plans at The Friendly Spot and have some of the most unfriendly memories possibly!  Seriously, this place is a severe tetanus infection waiting to happen. Between the rusted chairs and the death-trap kids \"play area\" there is no safe place to sit or relax. As a healthcare professional, I cannot believe this abomination is allowed to stay open. Do NOT go here. STAY AWAY!!"

Food is decent and the drinks are good.  It takes a long time to get your food order so be prepared to wait.  I had the cauliflower and chickpea tacos; they were flavorful with great textures.  The mahi majo tacos lacked seasoning.  The nachos were yummy and great for sharing.  Kids food was what you'd expect from a fast food place."

How hard is it to add one more beer puller? We are here on a Monday at 2. Literally 30 people in line, one bartender, back bar not open.  Bartender is now telling people not to order food. I get it's hard to find fast food employees, but there are good tips to be had here. I am quite sure they can hire bit of help at the taps. Feel bad for the bartender...not his fault.

The kids enjoyed the park while we enjoyed drinks and some bites. The food is standard bar food, but I will give them credit for their fries. The best hand cut fries I've had in San Antonio, well seasoned and crispy. The drinks were super tasty too, highly recommend the blood orange mule. Bonus, they had bomb pops for the kids. A perfect spot to spend a beautiful afternoon."

The Friendly Spot has been around for years and is the spot for a relaxed drink and meal. They have plenty of seating to meet friends for a drink before heading to explore South Town, or just hanging out.   Although, I did not have food this last visit, I was able to enjoy a sunny Sunday with friends after breakfast. They all ordered the Sangria, which looked pretty good, while I had the Watermelon GT. It wasn't crowded at all, which is a plus in these Covid times, and there was plenty of seating.  This is a good hangout to enjoy Summer evenings, or cooler Fall days. Its location is ideal, and their prices affordable. You can't go wrong as a start to your evening, or an early morning meeting."

Both had excellent servers.   The thing that set this bar off from others was the fact that it had so much to do. There was a slide, multiple projector screens for movies, foozeball, giant connect 4, etc.   The name was night a lie. Everyone there was super friendly. The house cocktails were super tasty. And at a decent price. I really enjoyed this place."

                "description": "I have had the pleasure of visiting The Friendly Spot a number of times, as it is a local San Antonio gem.  They have a great beer selection with both draft and cans/bottles available.  The selection ranges from the big name domestics and imports to the local craft beer Texas produces.  They do a great job of keeping the selection relevant with seasonal beers as well.  The food is pretty good.  I would compare it to any good local eatery.  The brisket nachos have a subtle smokey flavor and the Friendly burger is juicy and bursts with flavor on every bite.  Since they use quality ingredients, the Friendly burger can be a tad salty with the seasoning on the burger and the amazing slices of bacon that are used.  My favorite drink though would be the Wutang frozen beverage.  It goes down so easy and can be a pretty sneaky drink, so be careful, but you really cannot go wrong ordering it.  Whether you're from San Antonio, or just visiting, you really cannot go wrong stopping by this local gem."

He was taking our order and I kindly asked him for 2 frozen margaritas. He responded with \"we don't have any frozen margaritas.\"  There's a frozen drink machine directly behind him so we asked \"What's that frozen drink?\"  In a very condescending tone, he rudely replied and said \"Not a frozen Margarita!\"  His response was rude and uncalled for.  He could have just answered the question."

Not for everyone, but they have a place indoors to chill on hot summer days. I'd fire up the pit on a summer night, if they would let me.    They do change the beer menu quite a bit, but they do have there regular beers. Staff is friendly and helpful. Sorry, no beer flights, and I see why, you don't want to get something your not happy with, plus they will give you sample.  They have a kitchen, we've eaten her before, so I can only recommend what we have tried, the pretzels, the pizza, and the bratz.    Now they are about to open a coffee bar, can't wait for that."

Yelp actually points me me that there is an actual brewery in middle of nowhere, just drive through some windy roads to get there.  Well that seems like a fun adventure on a Saturday afternoon.    Little did I know that this little brewery would be located in the middle of a preserve.  This is where hiking trails meets beers. No masks need rules just some friendly owners ready to talk beer and God's country.   Well let me back up a bit as the hiking part is not quite is not quite available aw of 2021.  But the owners of this wonderful property own all of the acres of this incredible property so maybe this may become the next latest and greatest thing since yoga and beer drinking came to be..  I loved everything about this place.  It was spread out so you could find a spot without being disturbed.  They had picnic tables to hang out under the trees, even rocking chairs for grandma. Totally open to all age groups from the kiddos to oldies but goodies.  Normally I'd not want what could be described as chaos in a normal brewery setting but with the beauty and spaciousness everyone seems to get along and make it work.  Kids and AA/NA 'rs are drinking the hibiscus tea while the majority are enjoying a freshly brewed beer.    Beers are a nice mix here. They have nice light options for the Texas heat like a 4.8% Pilsner kolsch Hefeweizen and orange juice infused pale.  Then they get more serious going to a stout w/marshmallow graham crackers and coco nibs and get all the way to a 9% imperial stout with blackstrap molasses that comes regular or bourbon barrel aged. Those only come in a 6 oz pour which was appreciative considering we all do need to sometime and head back to civilization...  I loved all of the beers especially the Pilsner as it was so refreshing in a hot day.  But even the darker beers were super smooth.  I also loved how they gave you taste tests before committing.     They even gave a bit of entertainment going on with a guitar player on the outdoor patio.  Kids were dancing and adults hanging out with their pets. Yep i didn't see anyone not having a fun time, especially when most people have been deprived so to say over the past year, cough cough:D  This was a great find for us venturers, and I wholeheartedly recommend you bring your friends and family to this wonderful scenic treasure.  Yes Beer does exist in God'scountry. Say Amen to that .."

                "description": "This place is a little hidden but I think that's what I like about it. Off the beaten path of 1863, snuggled in the countryside with abundant outdoor seating and space for dogs to play and kids to run. There is shade, which is nice but an inside area for those triple-digit days. There are outdoor fire pits for when the weather is actually enjoyable in Texas.  There is usually an on-site food truck on the weekends. The beer is very crafty and creative. My first 2 visits were very excellent. Recently, my trips have still been enjoyable but a bit disappointing. While I admire the creative side of their brews, I do not care for everything to be fruit-infused. I don't mine 1 beer being fruity, but when that is all there is to choose from (other than the Kolsch) it gets old, fast. When I first was visiting this brewery I loved their porters. I haven't seen them in months. I think I would frequent this place like i used to if there were more non-fruity options.  Other than that, I love how it's family-owned, a large, open space, and just a relaxing atmosphere. Hopefully some non-fruity porters or ambers show up soon so I can head back out."

Beautiful location, both the brewery and the gorgeous outdoor seating area.  Feels quintessentially central Texan. LOVE IT. It was made all the more enjoyable by the live music being played the night of my visit. This place would be worth going to if the beer wasn't very good....but that is FAR from the case. The beers are fantastic with a wide range of both familiar and eclectic styles. You can get 5oz pours of anything, enabling you to try quite a few without getting too tipsy. The customer service was friendly as can be. I will 100% be back next time I am in the area. Drink local!"

Food trucks would also be a wise improvement, but perhaps they didn't have trucks on the day we came."

                "description": "This was the 2nd Big Hops I've been to and while it's larger than the first there's something kind of lost when the space is 4X bigger. Sure, there's plenty of activities: (pool, video games) but there's something missing when there are that many more tables and more bar space.  Had I visited this location first I think I would rate it higher, but the Huebner location had a more cozy, local watering hole type vibe.   I liked the depth of beer on taps but it doesn't substitute having everyone in the place singing 'Happy Birthday' to the bartender; still a great, fun place but a little more distant and that makes a big difference when you're sipping beer in a new city."

Its great for small and bigger crowds and most importantly for all walks of life. The staff is always very knowledgeable and super friendly. They have games, good music and TV's there to be able to watch your favorite team on game nights too. Its an awesome place to go just to meet up with a couple friends, lowkey date night, or even take a book or laptop to do some work/journaling while enjoying a tasteful beer of your choice. My favorite thing about Big Hops is the very calming neighborhood bar feel. Super glad this place is still up and running even during the mess of COVID."

This location has a pool table and arcade games. Lots of space to enjoy your party and the music. Big Hops does not serve food but there is plenty of food options around. They allow you to bring outside food in. If you don't want to bring food in they serve Rico's products for bar snacks."

Plenty of local and out of state micro brews available here.  Don't expect to find any Bud or Miller products.  Mike served us today and after I ordered my beer, he said \"if you like that one, you might like this one.  It's a bit different but...\" and then he continued to describe the flavor of the beer and gave me a free sample.  I was really impressed by the interaction and the beer knowledge he had.  It looks like they have 33 beers on tap and they also have a good selection of canned beers.    A lot of their draft beers can't be found in local stores but fear not; you can purchase a growler from them (or bring your own) and bring it back for refills of whatever they have on tap.  Support this local business and get here fast - you will thank me for it later!  If this location isn't near you, find one of the other three locations."

My friend invited me over to enjoy the Smash Bros tournament again, and it was a lot of fun. I didn't imbibe alcohol this time around, but everyone's beers looked delish.  The bar is still kept very clean, and everyone participating in the tournament shows great sportsmanship. There's a table closer to the door who also hangs out here week after week, and they spend hours drawing and making art. There's enough space to accommodate lots of groups of folks, even an outdoor patio for more legroom (though the interior itself is definitely roomy)  I'm not sure if this is a regular thing, but a food truck parked out back and provided some Asian eats for hungry gamers and artists alike. I love that with all the BH you can bring in food, as I brought my dinner from Chipotle earlier that evening.  Perhaps my most absolute favorite thing was a visit from a customer who had the most adorable, softest, plushiest shiba inu. omg. Best doge. (yes, dogs are allowed on the patio!)"

I really do enjoy saying, I like this type of beer, (they may or may not have it) and they go - OH - well if you like that, then you'll love this!  - I generally do love what they offer up!  It's always fun to go to places like that and try new things.  If I had one gripe it would be that they didn't serve food, but that's OK b/c if I remember correctly there are a couple of good choices in the area.  Definitely give Big Hops a try!"

                "description": "This place is farther away from my normal spot, which is Big Hops on Huebner, but not by much. What draws me to the Huebner location is the proximity to my work and the ability to hide there whilst traffic does its thing outside with me not in it, but merrily sippin' IPAs instead.  But what draws me to the Bitters location is far more innate for me. Sure, they have much of the same beer and deals, but here they have SMASH BROS. If there's one thing I love in tandem with beer, it's video games, and especially THIS video game. I've been an avid player of Smash Brothers since its inception on the Nintendo 64. Needless to say, me and my brother have found a spot to be every Wednesday night from now until the sun consumes the earth.  For those not into video games, they always have sports up on the many TVs and they have things like: darts, pool, and even a LIBRARY for nerds! (me). The latter had me the most excited, because it's one of those DIY libraries where people just contribute willy-nilly and I think that's rad.  If you like beer (good beer), you owe it to yourself to check this place out!"

While we shouldn't have waited for about 2.5 hours for a table to free up,  I suppose the best of things are always accidentally beget.   While we waited, we wandered into the plaza next door and jumped into Big Hops. We didn't expect much, as we knew nothing of this place, but we quickly fell in love!!  While I'm not the beer person, I was still able to enjoy their small selection of wine and cider. We absolutely loved the subtle geek culture everywhere and the inviting staff. On our next visits we were allowed to bring in the sandwiches we got at Fire Subs next door to get an alcoholic refreshment to go with it. This place offers a casual vibe that's perfect for meeting your amigos in a non-formal setting. They also have some board games you can play with on a shelf.   So if you're looking for a casual chat and beer, this place makes for a great rendezvous point!"

What usually goes for $15 for the 6-pack they wanted $42. Went down the st to a liquor store and got it for $15. It was just a mass produced IPA, not some bourbon barrel aged stouts."

                "description": "We stumbled into Big Hops on a quiet Saturday evening after a wild shopping spree at Hobby Lobby.   The place is pretty huge actually! Wall to wall chalkboard menus displayed their beer selection and the upcoming events. There's a back smoking section past the pool table. The place had quiet a few picnic tables and ample bar seats.   You can tell this establishment makes a major name for itself selling tshirts, stickers and growlers in several different sizes. We settled on the 64 oz growler which holds 4 pints I believe.   Service was a little off to me. The server kept asking what I wanted and what was I having, so when I said \"I'll just have some water\", I was a little surprised when she handed me a glass and said \"serve yourself over there\" and pointed to the water jug. She became super friendly after I told her I was on a detox though.   This place comes prepared with a board game library. We found boggle in the mix. I love that game to pieces so we played a few rounds before settling on a beer to fill the growler and headed home.   We'll definitely be rolling through to catch up on some of the local beers in the future."

                "description": "This place use to be New Orleans Bar. I always loved Big Hops, with their always endless selection of craft beers (not sure if that is good or bad for my liver, haha). The service is always top notch and the bartenders are knowledgeable.   They also have a outside patio which is great when weather is nice.   There are plenty tvs inside to catch a game. I was here watching the Warriors/Spurs G2 and they also had free pizza, which is great.   I can't wait to come back!"

We got a couple dozen tamales and order Gin drinks for the ladies and guys got the straight whiskey.  The gin drinks were priced at the craft drink price of $9.50, while the straight whiskey was $14.  Thought the whiskey was a little high in price, so next time I'll stick with a craft cocktail.  Liked the outside patio area as we sipped our drinks and ate spicy pork and been and cheese tamales."

They have a good range of martinis to choose from. They also have beer available.   I had the old fashioned. It decided to keep it simple and do the traditional. It was not bad. It didn't come with the orange peel like I'm used to, but you could definitely taste the citrus.   They have inside and outside seating.   The night we went, they only had one bartender, so it did take a while to order and receive drinks."

                "description": "My girlfriend and I both lived in Las Vegas and have a special connection to a hotel called The Artisan. She also loves chandeliers, so when I saw there was a place called Artisan Distillery with chandeliers, I knew we would have to go on our vacation to San Antonio.  Because we were there midweek and it was Covid times, we were the only ones there except for the owner Nick. That was fine with me as I wasn't trying to pick up this stupid disease. Nick was very welcoming to us and our dog, and we promptly ordered happy hour drinks for herself and a dog cocktail. Yes, they have dog cocktails!  Nick was very hands-on in explaining his process and we end up getting two cocktails each because the first round were so good. Actually, my girlfriend wanted to have a third! But we hadn't even eaten dinner so we pay our bill after two rounds.  Nick said they're on the move soon so I imagine the space will be even better after that. But he was a great host and I would love to go back if I was ever in San Antonio."

Everything is fresh and as much as I hate strong drinks, these martinis are dangerous because they're so smooth.. be careful because they'll catch up to you! They have a new venue with lots of seating and a stage, we enjoyed the drag show that was put on that Friday night. Nick was there working the bar and he's just a great host as ever. So glad we're locals now and we get a chance to visit anytime we want!"

Comfy chairs and couches to lounge on, and they have a nice little patio.    The tour of the distillery is very informative.  The owner explains all the magic that goes into making the perfect vodka.  Unfortunately, the good ends there.  I'm not a liquor aficionado by any means, but every time drink \"A\" or drink \"B\" was ordered, it was an entirely different taste and even a different color (it just depends on who you order it from).  At one point, I ordered the Hillbilly Moonshine, and the bartender asked me where I saw that one.  I had to show the menu and the ingredients to him.  What???  The \"consistent inconsistency\" with the drinks causes them to lose 3 full stars."

I won't lie I was a hard corn fan of Tito's Vodka till I got to try Texas Pride Vodka, no comparison at all! You can just taste the smoothies of Texas pride.  Also got to try the white chocolate martini  loved! Husband had the Spicy cucumber Martini he enjoyed it also. But what blew me away was the Chamoy shot  I will definitely eat coming back for that and the cherry bombs   Nice spot to enjoy some fantastic drinks and listen to music. Or just come here to pregame before heading out to the clubs.  Thank you so much Nick for the very informal tour! I can really tell you put you heart and soul into making that Vodka."

It might not look like it on the outside but you'll be whisked into a place that takes pride on their drinks as they are not only a bar but a full distillery.  The happy hour prices can't be beat and their drinks are so so good. You really have to take advantage of the back room for a fun mixer or event for friends/family. We did a white elephant exchange and the room was perfect.  You have to come check this place out. If you're heading there right now, have an extra martini for me please."

It was entertaining and informative.  At the end you get to sample some product and see how it is made.  Finally you can bottle and label your own bottle to take home for $12 which the master distiller will autograph for you.  Then you can hang out at the bar and drink.  They seem to have a local following at have delicious mixed drinks made with fresh fruit.  A very fun thing to do on an afternoon in San Antonio."

However, it was nice to sit back and enjoy the scenery, the photographers at work, bartenders at work and models at work.  I found it kind of weird there were kids there but whatever. There is also a patio area where you can sit outside and it was a beautiful night.  I had a lemon drop martini and because it was happy hour it was only $5.00. It was the bartenders first day and he did a fantastic job!!! I like this place and would definitely come back if I were in the mood for some vodka."

It's a small distillery but the atmosphere is good for cocktails and they have a section to have a private party with a crystal chandelier. They make unique cocktails made with their vodka made in-house a Texas vodka and a Spike one made with a cactus. The vodka's are smooth! You can buy bottles directly there and what's cool is that you can fill your bottle!   So happy we toured Artisan and will come back when we visit back."

                "description": "I admit that I was confused and thought the nearby restaurant was open for dinner, but we had walked here from our Airbnb and went with it. It's actually a really fun concept. The beer selection was great. We sat at the metal table section and just enjoyed the evening, there is a picnic table area also that was very cute. My son was happy as can be with a slice of cheese pizza. My husband and I ordered hot dogs, which were actually pretty good. We liked the sauce options. Another couple rolled up on bikes with a toddler. So if you feel weird about dragging your kid along, don't! The guy running the place was friendly and quickly served us. I imagine if you wanted to talk his face off about beers, he would welcome that. I just really enjoy a chill place with good beers!"

                "description": "This place is great and has so much potential.  It's a novel idea but needs a little tweaking. It's a great place to gather with friends and comfortable outside dining . The problem is the dining... where is the food?  They only have pizza and often \"run out\".I noticed many people bringing their own food.  It's seems like this business would be way more lucrative if they could serve the many people wanting something to eat too."

                "description": "Got there late around 9:30pm on the night I flew into town.  Wanted to check out a local watering spot for a drink and this place seemed like the perfect fit.  A stones throw away from the BnB I was staying at it was a bit tight inside of what seemed to be a former gas station.  There is seating outside but was cold about 45 degrees so opted for the cramped interior.  Had a really good selection craft beers where I enjoyed a Belgian Triple.  The place closed down around 10pm on this early off peak weekday so had to walk a few doors down to find an open kitchen for late dinner."

I'm not in love with the pizza, but there's so many options that it's a minor roadblock.   My favorite meals: - Turkey Pesto Sandwich - Soup of the Day and Pesto Pasta Salad  The staff there is quick and friendly; what more could you ask for? Side note - their website is not regularly updated so the prices at the counter may be a tid bit more than what is listed.   TIP: Order ahead for pick-up. The line to order can be pretty lengthy, but if you have a take out order, you can skip ahead!"

                "description": "The Filling Station Tap Room is like some brew gateway before you hit the main hubs like Blue Star or The Friendly Spot. Though small, it has lots of charm. Inside it fits the brew keep and no more than 6 people at any given time. There is a chalkboard that has the brews on tap, mostly and mainly IPA's. Along the walls are the remnants of tap handles of long gone kegs for example Sierra Nevada, Guadalupe Brewing Co., Firestone etc.                   The brew keep serves you your selection. Music from a college station radio cast is piping on the stereo. It's small and on a winter night after work, extremely cozy. But above all and I would be re missed if I did not overstate this, the brews are beyond El Cheapo! Some or most of these brews go for 7 bucks just down the road.. Here the beers typically range from 2 bucks to 6. That is so cool, especially in the bourgie King William District where you are charged just for looking at anything.            I do like this place but I do have a few issues with it.    1.) I don't get the whole plastic cup thing. I know you are getting a brew at a substantial discount but some of these brews are noble and sit and drink better in glass. Bud is meant for a plastic cup but not a Brooklyn Chocolate Stout! It deserves a better place than in some arbitrary Dixie cup to showcase it's masterpiece of flavor!   2). I noticed on their Facebook that they seldom update their brew selections. They should do this weekly. The Growler and The Friendly Spot do this regularly. Just one quick pic of their brew selections on the chalkboard, put it on their page and then vamonos. I know they have a twitter account now, which is helpful. They  typically get a crowd, from the looks of it bike riders that probably goes there on a daily basis. And buys on a whim. But what about your untypical patron? You have a great selection of brews why not showcase them?  3.)   The third issue, and I believe the most important is what really sets the brewpubs from places that just tap brew for you. The server served us our beer and did not say anything instead choosing to play with his phone. Places like The Busted Sandal and The Ten Eleven are hosts by proxy, and will talk your ear out about their brews or in most cases beer in general. I like that and as a rule of thumb most brew lovers appreciate that touch. A simple, \"how's it going\", \"if you need anything let me know\" or \"what brings you here today\" goes a long way. We don't have to be best friends. Just fake it. But acknowledge we are there and be on with your business.       Given these things I like this place. The brews are cheap. I like the intimate vibe, cozy space. And I definitely will be coming back. If you want an alternative to The Friendly Spot, whose brews can be pricey or just want to go to a place to chill check this place out. On cold winter nights they have wood burning outside at no extra charge..."

Food next door in co-owned Station Cafe - cheap and good, deli type place,  has hot toasted sandwiches for $6. Plastic cups cuz seating is outdoors, and it's only the inside bartender working - nobody to take care of glassware... Only 4 stars cuz SoTex is too hot to have to sit outside (I'm Denverite, so YMMV)."

After I ordered, two of the beers we wanted weren't available, but he couldn't be bothered to tell us, just didn't serve us those beers.  Oh, and the credit card machine is through a cellphone.

If you find yourself south of downtown then Filling station tap room is your best bet for dozens of beers taps on a constant rotation.   I also challenge someone to find a better price on craft beers on tap. Most beers pour for $4.50 and less. I'm not talking your old man's miller lite. I'm talking great big bold, high abv beers from some of America's best breweries.  Only reason they get 4 stars instead of 5 is because they are closed Sunday. What ever happened to Sunday funday?   Ps. Mainly outdoor seating, if the weather is not great find somewhere else."

                "description": "What's not to like. The owner has preserved a piece of history by converting an old Texaco Filling Station into draft brew house. The barkeep let me taste everything I was interested in. They have 4 or 5 seats inside, a covered patio area with tables, and a couple of tables in the old horseshoe driveway.  There's not much to say except this is a fantastic neighborhood concept blending and keeping history in the local community while invigorating the economy.  And a bigger plus... if you live nearby, you can walk or stagger instead of risking a DUI or causing injury to a pedestrian.  Also while there is technically no good at the Filling Station, the owner owns the Station Cafe next door.  Cons, you can't leave an open tab at the Filling Station and use the same credit card next door for food. Pros, you can bring your beer from the Filling Station into the Station Cafe.  Can't wait until I'm back in San Antonio... I will be back!"

I'm so thankful to have this place within walking distance of my apartment.. Easy place to swing through for a cold one or 2... Or 5.  The two bartenders I've had so far are pretty friendly, but you have to tease the conversation out of them. Overall cool guys who seem to know what they're talking about in terms of the beer.  Another plus is that they play sports games on their tv outside.  Two suggestions:  extend your hours.  Both for the bar and for the food.  I think the demand is there to support it.  Next suggestion, maybe consider increasing the size of the TV.  The small one tucked up in the window is charming, but I feel a larger tv with better sound could attract a bigger crowd.  Very cool spot with great beers and a super chill vibe.  One of my favorite King William hang outs.  Will be a regular here for sure.  Cheers!"

Very low key hipsterish, lots of bicyclist and soccer fans (outside TV) .  This place has a tiny little indoor bar with a lot of great beer. They have an extensive outdoor seating area between the bar building and their sister restaurant which has some super affordable, super delicious food. The pizza is good, the sandwiches are grand. I have never had a bad sandwich but I have regretted when I didn't get something with aoli knowing that I could have enjoyed that deliciousness. Dog friendly. Big bonus for me is that they always have my favorite local (if Blanco counts as local) beer, Devil's Backbone, I don't think there should be a bar in SA that doesn't carry this delicious, reasonably priced gem."

We finally made it there on our Friday night date night after hearing they had tapped a keg of Real Ale Sisyphus that had been sitting over a year.  Um, Yes please!!!    We were delighted to find it was true and received our pour.  The place is very tiny but there is outdoor seating.  It was pretty packed when we got there and most outdoor seating was taken.  We stood off to the side and within a minute two guys waived us over and said we could sit with them -- cool people, yes!  We enjoyed our beers and made some new friends.     We heard the restaurant side is outstanding and makes some pretty good grub.  You can take the food over to the bar side and we saw some sandwiches/pizza that did look appetizing.   However, it was all about our Sisyphus on this night.  Thank you Filling Station for surprising us with one of our favorite beers out of no where!  That is some good beer management there!   We would be back more if they were open on weekends but we will get what we can take.  We definitely return."

This is Cured and you came here for that exact thing.  And if you stay, you'll enjoy every minute of your time here. From delicious dishes to exceptional service, Cured does not miss.  All I wanted for my 34th birthday was charcuterie. Gimme some meat and cheese to ring in my next revolution around the sun, and I'll be happy (provided I don't get gout). I wasn't a fan of one of the meat options being offered on the charcuterie and both the server and chef were able to provide me with an alternative choice to replace the original meat.  The cheeses on the cheese plate were absolute perfection and when paired with the black pepper toast, divine.  Not only was the food out of this world but so were the drinks. Hands down, the best dirty martini I've had in a long time, if not ever. I also tried the Rose Quartz, a gin drink with cardamom, pineapple, lemon, and beets. It was very tough not to order 4 more of those.  We ordered the bread pudding for dessert and it was brought out with candles in celebration. When I say the service from each person working was top notch, I truly mean it. Everyone did everything they could to ensure that we were happy.  If you like cured meats, this is seriously the place to be. A fantastic lunch served by a fantastic group of people."

We also got the reseve charcuterie board, which was probably the best charcuterie I've had.  - whole duck breast with duck heart dirty rice - cured foie gras - duck egg creme brulee - reseve charcuterie plate: 9 month pork belly, 60 day salami, Spanish chorizo, chicken liver mousse, smoked duck ham, apple jalapeño pork rillettes - heritage hog poutine"

                "description": "Review Edit: Cured's manager Winnie went out of her way to made it right with me! She was also incredibly professional and invited me to come back for a better experience. Apparently, my previous experience is not the norm so I gladly accept the invite and place to re-visit Cured in the near future. (Will further update review).  Bottom line up front: I can't believe they have the gall to charge what they do for disappointing and inedible dishes. DO NOT ORDER the charcuterie board.   Probably the ugliest bunless burger you'll ever see, and it is accompanied with really weird tasting and textured American cheese. For an upscale place like Cured where we paid over $100 for LUNCH, you'd think it would come with gourmet cheeses instead of standard cheap American cheese but I wanted to trust the chef and so I (regretfully) ordered it anyway. The patty was small and overcooked. To come with no fixings and no condiments other than ketchup, is bold and confident, however unfortunately so at a major disappoinment. The confidence lacks self awareness. Just like the charcuterie board. A handful pieces of decent, not mind blowing, meats . Of the two jams was extremely bitter and inedible, to include one of the two mustard seeds, and the ginger infused pickles. So 50% of the board meh and the other 50% down right bitter and unappetizing. I couldn't believe the price they were charging for that junk. My spouse got the lamb, which was fine but the snap peas were soooo oily and way over seasoned! We couldn't even finish it. And the polenta was straight up bland. What is going on here?!  Anyway, if I have anything positive to say it's that the service was great."

                "description": "We went here for the first time for Happy Hour so this review is for our Happy Hour Experience.    The drinks special were creative and delicious and only $5. We  ordered fried Quail legs from the Happy Hour menu which was crispy and well seasoned.  We also had charcuterie board as a starter and everything on the board were paired together for maximum tasting experience.  For dinner we had Sunday supper fried chicken dinner.  The chicken was moist, tender, and super tasty.  It came with grits, cornbread, and collards which made the meal a total southern comfort food experience.  Our server took great care of our party ensuring our drinks were refreshed and returned to check on us to make sure we had everything we needed.  Overall we enjoyed ourselves here while visiting from Charlotte NC."

                "description": "Just had a terrific dining experience at Cured! I'm really not sure what they could do to not earn 5 stars! We started with the reserve charcuterie plate. Among the favorites were pork butter, smoked duck ham, jalapeño pork rillettes, and 30 day bresaola. For an entree, we shared the 30 day dry aged ribeye. We ordered it medium and it was cooked to perfection.   After dinner (and with very little room left in my stomach) we order the bread pudding. It was delicious. I've had lots of bread pudding in my lifetime and this easily ranked towards the top of the list.   The service was wonderful and we made friends at the table next to us. The manager saw us having a good time and came by to pour our combined group a round of complimentary wine. That really helped solidify a wonderful experience."

                "description": "The Pearl is one of those great places with a variety of restaurants, shops, coffee spots and wine bars. Unfortunately, they are hit or miss. I guess the feeling is the area sells itself and, it does, but the food should decidedly be a part of that sell. This was the case for Cured.  I really wanted to like Cured. It was a different concept and had some interesting looking plates. The location, as mentioned, was outstanding and the restaurant itself had plenty of seating. But that was all it had to offer. The happy hour was minute, and they only offered quail legs as a HH food. These were .50c during happy hour, so the price was not bad at all, but that was the only happy hour food offering, which is quite meager for a HH menu.  As a meal, my friends and I shared the Cheese Plate for $30. This was already too pricey for a platter with only three cheese selections. We had to add their Foie Gras and Summer Sausage for $8.00 each to have some meats in the platter. At the waiter's recommendation, we included an order of four HH quail legs and two bottles of their punch special for $20 each.  Overall, service was pretty good. The waiter was attentive and kept the drink servings going, so the issue was never the service. But, other than location, that is all that Cured had to offer. The prices were too high and the food underwhelming. The pate was tasteless, and I was not impressed with the summer sausage. I did like the quail legs, but I wish they were meatier. Even the punch got cloyingly sweet after the first glass.  I know that charcuterie plates tend to be pricey, but with only three cheese selections, more cheese was needed, at least, more charcuterie board selections. Ultimately, I felt that Cured was not worth it and, quite frankly, there are too many places in the Pearl that can give them a run for their money."

                "description": "Disclaimer: I can only speak to the happy hour menu (which surprisingly also happens on saturdays!)  The patio punch is a rum-based drink with lemonade and blueberry flavoring and was delicious! The cost was $20 and could be shared well with 4 people. The drink wasn't overpowered with the taste of the rum and I'd definitely return for this drink again.  The quail legs were amazing. The meat was tender and the outside breading was very tasteful. The legs were topped with honey and rosemary and came at 50 cents a piece. They are an amazing light snack and I'd highly recommend you give them a try."

We also got the boudin empanadas which really tasted more like pulled pork instead of the Cajun flavor I'm used to. The bartender was great! We had a couple of drinks off the menu then I had her create something based on things I love. Would definitely visit again, especially to try the meat plate!"

                "description": "Came here for brunch on a Sunday. The ambiance is nice, as you are greeted with a display of smoked and cured meats. We opted for the cheese and meat board combo, which was presented beautifully to us. The accoutrements were lovely as well - pickles, mustard seed, honeycomb, savory and sweet jam, peppers. It came with toasted baguette slices. I loved the 3 cheeses, particularly the water buffalo. The 3 meats were good as well - fave was the duck rillette, which was smoked. The mussels in the tin were a bit underwhelming, as they were gritty. The menu does mark a section as \"Tins\" but it's written pretty small, so we were surprised when the tin arrived. The sides of bacon, grits, and cat head biscuits were good. I would say the bacon was the least impressive of the 3, and the biscuits the most impressive, as they were doused with butter and honey. Their welcoming amuse bouche was a great way to start the experience. Lovely ambiance, and there are areas where you can look through a glass floor and see plants or stones beneath. Service was kind and appropriately attentive."

The mussels are delicious and the poutine which also useful leftover to spice up eggs or something like that from home.   The cocktails are special and they make really great ice cream sandwiches.  They also have meat which I'm not an expert on but I strongly recommend googling the menu and go give it a try.  It is also a nice atmosphere at historic Pearl and great outdoor seating pet friendly."

This place is the type of place that will encourage you to try things out of your comfort zone and you'll be glad you did.   The charcuterie boards are unmatched. They are authentic and not the trends we've seen lately. Wedge salad was good, blue cheese was a bit strong for my taste, but my date enjoyed it. The fried oyster sandwich is something I've never seen before, it was however delicious! Drinks are strong, so you'll get your moneys worth.   Great place to have dinner at the pearl, perfect for a date!"

We started off with a charcuterie board and two entrees. The charcuterie board was good but it wasn't really what I was expecting. Very fancy for sure but the different spreadable meats were kind of odd. I think I prefer a more standard charcuterie board with regular meats cheeses and crackers/bread. We got the burger and the BOT. Both were terrific. The burger was a little small but very tasty and fried oysters were very good! I really did enjoy the experience it just seemed a little pricey especially the charcuterie board and the kitchen seemed under staffed or something bc it took a long time to get the food. Our waitress was terrific so it was still a terrific experience.   Overall: 4.41 stars"

Excellent vibes for small group dinner or grabbing drinks for a date. The staff is very friendly and helpful at explaining the menu. We opted for some cocktails, although they have an excellent beer list too. We decided to try the two charcuterie boards, both the meat and cheese platter. Everything was excellent and it was fun for our group to try new things. Note that you can ask for additional bread free of charge :) We absolutely loved this place and the area is cool too.

There are a number of places in that area, and Callum's caught my eye in my Yelp search.  I'd heard enough about them through a FB group, so we decided to give them a try.  Man, what a good decision!  My wife ordered the San Antonio hot sandwich, and I got a large order of the boneless San Antonio hot.  I also ordered the cheese fries.  The heat of the chicken is no joke, but the flavours are fanTAStic.  And the portions are filling - my wife couldn't quite finish the sandwich, and I chose to take a good amount of the boneless home, since I knew that would travel better than the fries, so I finished the fries there.  It was a little pricey, but over-sizing my boneless order didn't help.  And again, everything was so good, and I've got some to eat later at home, so it all works out.  You have a number of choices in the St Mary's area, but you should make a point of hitting this place."

I had the Honey Butter Chicken Biscuit with Crispy Fried Egg.   She said the wings were good and the livers were probably the best she had ever had.   My biscuit sandwich was good, the biscuit was great the, egg was great and the chicken was pretty good but not great.  We both said we would quite happily eat here again if we were in this area of town."

                "description": "The reason for 3 stars is mainly the pricing. I think it's a bit much to pay ~$20 for 6 wings that were good... but not that good. If they changed their pricing, then this place is pretty decent and worth checking out. It's small inside but they do offer outdoor seating which is nice. You do order your food at the front and they bring your food out to you.   We had ordered Tyme fries, San Antonio hot wings, and their chicken sandwich. The fries were crispy and full of flavor. Wings were pretty spicy in my opinion so I didn't enjoy it very much; it was also on the oily side due to the spices. Their chicken sandwich was very tasty and cooked to perfection. Their Gucci ranch is pretty good (and I would get this if you're ordering their hot wings... you'll need it).   They don't have a private parking lot so it's mainly street parking which wasn't so bad since it wasn't super busy."

                "description": "Wow. What a creative menu! And so many beers on tap!   We sampled the deviled eggs (super chilled and super creamy, might have been a tad improved with some salt), the OG chicken (a stunningly good sammich) and the vegan chicken (a slab of fried gold -- tofu, that is). Both sammiches were slathered with neon sauce, which was some bright green poppyseed deliciousness. We ate outside at the white picnic tables and had a lovely alfresco dinner. There are many things left to try; we will be back!"

                "description": "Lived up to the hype! Been on my list since day 1. Went with the Brown Bag Fried Chicken and the OG Chicken Sando.    No frills kind of spot. Just quirky, delicious and they do what they do very, very well.. Folks order up at the counter or order ahead and they bring the food out to you. There's a cute patio dining area and more places to sit inside.   The chicken itself is remarkable and the sandwich was perfectly done. The balance of crunch and juice was perfect. It was maybe the messiest, most crunchiest, 5 mins I've had this year. The fried egg was clutch!   We chose the Garlic and Thyme for the Brown Bag Fried Chicken and Fries   Was hoping for more chicken but what we had was actually some of THE best fried chicken we've ever had.    GET YOUR HANDS ON THIS CHICKEN!   Been here before? What did you get?"

We got the Girls Thyme Fries, bologna sandwich, and the wings. The fries were so good and crispy, great flavor! I'd get an order for each person because the large was still a little small for 2. The wings are spicy!! Very good but prepared for spicy. Ranch sauce is a must with fries or wings. The bologna sandwich was good but wish the bread was different or toasty.   Overall, it's a good spot and a nice place for a bit to east anytime but night is the best vibe."

                "description": "I've been here a few times and have mixed reviews as a result. The first time was great but my most recent experience was not so much. I had the same thing both times, the OG chicken sandwich. The most recent time the chicken was fried so long it was tough. This made it hard to eat as a sandwich. I finally submitted and tried to use the spork they gave me but that was worse. It would bend each time I tried to stab the chicken. We wanted to sit outside because it was a nice day but the flies were literally swarming us. It was a constant struggle to keep them away. I know this is a natural consequence to sitting outside but there was also a large trash can in the immediate area that wasn't helping the situation."

I was in fact at my destination of choice! I decided to go with a safe bet; the OG chicken. I mean, if it's not broken, don't fix it! I'm happy to report there's nothing to fix here. Besides a little too much coleslaw, the sandwich was crafted to perfection! Juice, crispy, etc. The good food along side the good beer ensures you're gonna have an immaculate time when feasting at this hidden gem!"

Like jumping into the deep end and remembering you can't swim style...in over my head! Like I don't really remember anything 10 minutes before or after I ate it type of hot! I don't blame Cullum's or the sandwich, I blame my wimpy-ass mouth for failing me! Lots of foods say they are hot and I never even give it a second thought, but this one is pretty damn spicy...GOOD but you are gonna feel it for a bit.  The Buffalo Chicken is more for people with sensitive to extreme heat...like me, sadly. It is really good. I got a bite of one just as my tongue came back to life after the San Antonio Hot and it was about as tasty a chicken sammich as you're gonna find. Look at the pic! The damn thing is beautiful!  Get over there an check them out for anything chicken.  See more on IG @cheatday_SA"

Sit back with a craft and enjoy the wait. It's worth it.  Nashville hot chicken is ligit and very spicy. The spice is from the frying oil and the seasoning - the true way. Most try to make it spicy with a sauce- not here. The freshly cut fries with thyme and garlic are enough to make you come here.  RIP Jim."

                "description": "Atta YES! I love this place. They are known for their chicken and have a tiny menu, but they have one veganish entree. It's called the vegan-ish job and it is AWESOME. It's fried tofu on a bun, and it is straight up delicious. I think the bun has honey on it, so it's not really vegan, hence the name. And the last time we were here, my bf added a fried egg to his veganish job, which made it even less vegan, but it was a very nice addition. I do recommend that combo. All the sides we have tried here have been winners as well - disco fries, creamed corn, and their gucci goat salad. Yummy! They also have a nice little variety of craft beers on tap. And the workers are very friendly. But the best part of this place is the veganish job. I don't often advocate for places with only one vegetarian option, but this one is too good to pass up. It's a small spot with indoor and outdoor seating, but totally worth the stop. And they know that they don't have a sign. Come in and grab a sandwich and beer and have a great food experience."

We knew in that moment we would be regulars here. The atmosphere is very chill and neighborly. The bartenders are absolutely amazing. There are 2 pool tables and they also have 2 dart boards which I love to play. A great selection of beer, booze, and seltzers ( you can also find yourself a good ol' shot of Malort here) It's a great place to bring friends and family if your looking to have a few drinks, play some games, have awesome conversations, and meet great people. If you like to watch sport and have a brewski they are always playing all the games and if you don't see yours just ask! They have been very accommodating when ever we ask for the Cubs or Bears game  Love this bar"

                "description": "I have sort of followed this place off yelp since it first opened but never actually made it out because of the reviews. We were invited out so we gave it a shot.   First you walk in and the first thing that hits you is the smell of old stale beer Oh you know the smell- it's that sour, no one has cleaned the bar mats correctly kinda smell. Then your eyes adjust and you are like hmmm,  for a place that is fairly new and in the outskirts of Helotes this place is really run down. Not like shabby cool- just like cardboard boxes on top of an open area., close to the ceiling - may be a fire hazard - but more like scary walk to the restroom kinda place. I actually saw a staff member clean the wood top table with Fabuloso and the stench permeated for some time- just what  I want when trying l to enjoy a drink...... when you look around you see the obligatory beer signs but then you also note that there are a bunch of advertisements for upcoming events. Like too too many that it makes the walls look littered.   With the word \"stout\" in the name of the place one expects to have lots of different kinds of microbrews. Sure they have one descheutes stout and one elisyan and maybe 2-3  but other taps are your big corp, beer (bud, Miller, etc).  They do have full bar options. Moscow mules served in copper mugs though ginger beer was flat.   There is no food in the joint but I saw several patrons walk in with pizza boxes from the place next door.   The crowd was loud, obnoxiously loud. Not sure how many decibels this places hits but it must be ridiculously high- my ears were buzzing.    Crowd- A little to old to be taking shots at 6pm but hey whatever. Appeared that highs school football parents and grandparents were getting ready for the season. The cont shrieking if one patron was enough to push is out of the place.   That was our experience, so now how about sharing yours?"

Loved the atmosphere. Would have given 5 stars but after the guy got off shift a girl went on shift and she had the worst attitude. Super rude to us and told us we needed to be careful how much we drank. We had only had the one drink a piece and babied it for a good while. I understand not over serving... but she was just ridiculous and barely gave us a beer. So because she had such an attitude we didn't even finish our beer we just left."

                "description": "I loveeeeeee Stout House!!!!  Although I'm not a beer drinker it is to my knowledge that their selection of stouts is very welcoming. Their quick service and kind words have always made me feel important and cherished by the crew that mans the bar. Their music is ran by a jukebox, but thank Jesus the people who attend there have stellar taste in music so you'll groove all night long. An outdoor patio greets you warmly and their specials are consistent too. Easy place to chill for hours.   **The girl bartender was rude once a while back without justification, but to avoid any negative feelings about Stout House I ask for drinks from the guys behind the bar."

A variety of beers on tap that I rarely see elsewhere as well as great daily drink specials. Nights get pretty crazy but during happy hour it is a chill vibe at this bar.

                "description": "Met up with a group of girlfriends here on a Saturday night to catch up and it was perfect. Our bartendress was awesome, the drinks were quick and the environment was chill. There were lots of open seats; I don't know how to explain it - inside setup looks like picnic-type high bar tables everywhere, Lol! Forgive me, I don't even know if that's typical. Just something I've seen for the first time. There is also a patio outside.   Location is great! There is a pizza place next door, cupcake shop close by and a Silverado movie theater within walking distance. No issues with parking. A great hangout spot to stop by before or after a movie, shoot some darts, play beer pong and get a few drinks.  Only downsides are I had a Long Island and a Pineapple Rum and didn't get a buzz (usually I'm good with just a Long Island), and they don't serve any food/appetizers (NADA). So, great hangout place, but not for strong drinks or snacking ;)"

I do love the remodel they did and how there is a ton more space, but that does not supersede the management and service you will receive.  This last visit was the last time I will be going to Bar America. I had some friends in town and I wanted them to enjoy a nice Sunday Funday while avoiding the Texas heat. Every other time except this last time, minors have been allowed. We were trying to be responsible and we brought a 20 yr old that does not/ will not drink, to hang out and drive us all home safely. Well the 'manager' came over and let us know that we will have to go because \"they do not allow anyone in the bar that is 18, 19 or 20 because of they could be drinking and its a TABC violation\".  I could go on and on about the other times that have been similarly awful, but I will sum it up to.... rude management/ staff and there a ton of other better places to go.

It's a perfect spot to watch the games since they have multiple screens.   You have to stand in line to order, not like other bars where you can stand anywhere to order so just keep that in mind if you haven't been. Theres the rooftop view as well with some nice photo ops.   The music and vibe is spot on and the service is pretty good, well rounded spot you make have to wait a little longer on game days but that's everywhere."

There's enough illness going around these days without this noAside from the fact that they were PORTA POTTIES (!!!) they were porta potties that were almost filled to the brim. At least at fiesta you know what you're getting into and they keep them maintained for the most part. If a bar cannot have proper bathrooms, then it shouldn't be open to the public. Get your crap together, Bar America! No pun intended.   Chorizo tater tots were bomb tho.  Update: Bar America whined to yelp and got my photo of their DISGUSTING porta potty removed, so you'll have to use your imagination. Picture a big blood clot on top of a pile of urine saturated toilet paper surrounded by turds."

They have inside and outside seating with a cool upstairs area where you have a good view of the tower.  The bartenders are fast. They have many drink options.  We rented an area for a birthday party and everything went as planned. FYI if you are bringing a gift, make sure it is not alcohol because they won't let you take it in.  Parking can be a pain.

                "description": "I really enjoy it here! Been twice.. once on a random night of the week. Decent crowd, super friendly bar staff both times. The second visit was on a Sunday for brunch and to watch football. Again. Super friendly bar staff, and they are super quick and efficient. Probably the fastest moving bar staff I've seen in a while, considering the amount of people they're serving.   My friend got me hooked onto their pickle and chamoy shots! Holy guacamole, my mouth is watering just thinking about them!   On Sunday's they open at noon, and they do have a brunch menu which includes wings, chicken and waffles, brisket migas, breakfast sandwich and my favorite the chorizo and cheese tots! The price point is excellent. The tots are big enough to share. There was 2 of us and we shared brisket migas and the tots. And it was plenty of food. The tots were LOADED with chorizo, and it was god quality chorizo, and the tots were fried crisp! Not soggy or soft at all! It was perfect!   They offer $10 mimosa set ups, too! A bottle of champs and either cranberry, orange or pineapple juice. There are a lot of drink specials offered daily, even during Sunday brunch. There is a patio, and a rooftop bar as well. Ample amounts of tables and bar stools all over the bar, plenty of TVs. And on Sunday, after the game, there was a DJ! So it's the perfect spot for a Sunday funday.   Parking can be hard, but you can park right down, less than a 5 minute walk in the school district parking lot, behind Batallion.   Definitely going to have to come back for their brunch!!"

                "description": "Went here on Sunday to watch the Brazil vs. Switzerland game.  Got there just as they opened (shocked they didn't open for the earlier Mexico vs. Germany game, which would have been a better view of the TV over Francis Bogside).  We got 4 chairs at the bar and enjoyed the food selection and the $2 Modelo drafts and $3 well tequila shots.   Atmosphere - Relaxed open space that has a number of tables and benches with tons of TV's around the outside wall.  DJ Tony Phoenix (https://www.facebook.com/DJTonyPhx/) was spinning some great tunes as the crowd enjoyed their Sunday afternoon.  Place was packed and I was told it was like that most Sundays.    Food/Drinks - The drink specials are great here as I saw a number of Mimosa sets going out of the bar.  Our party got the fish tacos and the chorizo with taters that was plenty of food.  Next time I am going with the chicken and waffle option that seemed to be the most popular item ordered.    Service -All food and drinks are ordered at the bar, so they are attentive and make sure everyone has food and drinks.  Kept the bar clean and highly enjoyed our bartenders that were nice and spent time chatting with us.  They work really hard.  Overall - Check this place out.  Good food and drinks, great service, and perfect location off the River Walk."

                "description": "***Delete if not allowed*** I know this place serves food, but we have never been there for it. After last night it is doubtful we ever will be.   We took a Lyft from the Pearl, 9 of us, to go to Bar America last night. Previously we have had a lot of fun and the DJ was good when we were there. We arrived before half our party and paid $20 for 4 of is to get in. Apparently they have a cover charge now, no big deal we are used to that in Chicago.   We go order drinks and wait for the rest to arrive. They are immediately turned away at the door, not because they are busy, but because one friend is 24. Yes, twenty four. We asked to speak with a manager and are told that just last night they started implementing a 25 and up rule. Why? Because of the shooting they had outside the bar in September? I'm sorry but you are just now implementing this????  We decided we werent staying and maybe had been there all of 10 minutes, including the time spent talking to the manager. Because of this new found rule we asked for our cover charge back. I didn't think it was too much to ask given we had just arrived. The manager refused. We paid $20 to hear a crappy DJ play one song.  Now, I get that the shooting most definitely had a negative impact on their business. But if you are going to alienate your biggest clientele (21-24) you probably shouldn't be operating as a bar. Stick to food and close at 11 like other restaurants. Don't advertise that you have a DJ and turn people away at the door. People who are of legal drinking age. As you can see the place was dead at 10:30 last night.   But good came out of it. We went right down the road to Jokesters. Never heard of the place before but after taking a Lyft across town we wanted something close. The doorman laughed when we asked if we were too young, apparently they were aware of the new rule and were getting all the clientele Bar America wouldn't let in. They were packed, service was fast and the DJ was awesome. He played current and all of the 80s and 90s favorites. We definitely will go back there."

Newly renovated exposed brick and finished hardwood interior and rooftop deck are classy and awesome, and a good selection of reasonably-priced spirits, beers, and cocktails to choose from.  Haven't tried the food, but I heard it's pretty good.  There was a hip DJ there last night, and they brought back the pool table thank God!  It's just about the only pool table in Southtown when you're looking to satisfy the need for a clean break, some neat clicks, and feel the gratification of a fine shot dropping into the pocket.  Back patio is currently being finished up at the time of posting (Feb '20) in conjunction with another welcomed coffee shop establishment.  Undoubtedly will be fantastic once it's fully open to everyone's enjoyment.  View from the rooftop to the downtown skyline should be spectacular!"

By the time you find the bottom, you're problems will seem further away. The pickle chips are crisp, well battered, and savory. The pretzel was a little heavy on the salt, but the beer cheese is perfectly balanced to bring out the creaminess of the cheese and the sweet malt of the beer.   Dog friendly patio is a nice touch. The service was good and I get the prices were fair for the massive drink portion size you receive."

                "description": "Stopping by.  Now I have not been into this establishment yet but I plan on it since I am new to the area and it looks super cute, I often browse Yelp to find great places to try out. I stumbled upon this place and went to read my first review. Someone made a review about this place regarding a bartender touching her hair in the bathroom, and how another waiter was talking over there food on their table. I just want to say *because I'm totally irked by those comments* if you choose to dine out at a public establishment - that is your choice. Confronting someone in the bathroom about them adjusting their features (which is definitely \"an invasion of space\" but lets talk about social distancing, right? LOL) These workers are working to provide a great experience for you as the customer. If you are scared of being out in public and someone coming to close of contact with your food (even though you're out in public ordering food at a public restaurant that has to be cooked by other people, assorted by other people, and served by other people) then you should order takeout! If your main goal is to go out to eat and criticize normal human beings for being themselves and trying their best to show up everyday, then hit the road, JACK!   Anyway, I can't wait to stop by this place as it looks very cool. Peace!"

We got there and the parking lot was full so naturally being social butterfly that I am I'm like shit!  So we walk in and it's dead should have taken that as a red flag. So we sat down had some pretty decent service at first my kid ordered the kids burger and she barely touched so I took a bite after while of her not touching it and figured out why it was flavorless so no more mystery there. The wife and I ordered some beers we wanted to try and everything we wanted was out which was a bummer but we settled on one and it was cold and did the trick for the time being, and then we decided to order the cheese and sausage board and when it showed up we weren't impressed it looked like the cheese had been sitting out for a few hours and the sausage was cold, and from one peace to the other it tasted all the same they just tried to present it nicely, I wished I had taken a picture but my bad. So to make a long story endless the good was the beer was cold the bad was everything else. We won't be back."

                "description": "The Quarry Hofbrau and Beer Garten is a great place to rendezvous with family and friends. It has a spacy outside area; the drinks and food are favorable, and the service was excellent. The location also can't be beat. It is across from the Quarry and a couple of blocks away from pretty Alamo Heights, which is definite plus. All in all, a perfect place to sit and enjoy, especially with the cooler weather upon us.  We all ordered the Wurst plate which comes with three types of sausage, a bit of sauerkraut, and two choices of sides. In my case, I ordered the sweet potato fries and grilled veggies. Everything on the plate was well-prepared and the portion was large enough for a second meal of leftovers. Our young waitress was new but handled the service like a pro and was very attentive.  This is a place that I could visit and have, over and over. It is not too pricy, comfortable atmosphere, tasty food/drinks and awesome service. It hits all marks. Really, there isn't much not to like in this place. Absolutely recommend it for an after-Quarry visit."

We told the waiter and he just apologized but didn't try to make it right. When I said well that's not our fault he half heartedly told me I could talk to a manager. We won't be back. Manager came by and apologized but still didn't make it right. I know it's two bucks but it's the point."

                "description": "It has the potential of a 5 star rating.  It really deserves a 2 star rating but here's why I gave it 3... they still have the best variety and best Dos-A-Ritas in San Antonio.  One of the best outdoor beer gardens in SA.  But, last night was our first visit since the renovation (If I remember right I had given them a 4 star review prior to their Reno).  Here is why it was a 2: Boiled down to customer service.  The hostess was not even close to being pleasant.  We were on a date night and I asked to be seated outside so we can enjoy the music and some drinks near the stage.  So she tries to sit me as a far away as possible in the corner area with a peekaboo view of life.  I did tell her [again] I would prefer to be seated near the stage and pointed out all the empty tables.    Our waiter was great, friendly, and his bright personality made up for the poor experience we had received so far.  The margaritas were still as amazing as I remembered them.  We ordered appetizers.  My wife loves the fried pickles from here and they didn't disappoint.  I normally would order their Cheese and Sausage board but I ordered the Wurtzel by mistake.  When the Wurtzel came it actually Looked really good so I kept it.  First bite in and the middle of the pretzel was cold as was the sausage (so gross).  Not to mention the lady who brought them over plopped them on the table and left (another grumpy employee).  Here's the thing, it wasn't even that busy.  Makes you wonder why... since they have one of the nicest outdoor seating areas with a stage and live music in that area.  The weather was beautiful and not as hot as it typically gets during this time of year.  Back to my point, it wasn't busy so why was the overall service so poor?   Even though the band sounded great, a couple of mosquito bites into the evening we decided to leave and try somewhere else.  Shout out to the Nathan Lugo Band! We only stayed as long as we did because y'all sounded great.  After their renovation it offers much more of a family vibe with an outdoor play area for kids, relaxed seating areas, and just gorgeous patio and beer garden.   We used to absolutely love coming here it was one of our favorite spots for a date night and to bring friends/family for large groups.  Hopefully the owners select a competent manager and take a hard look at their customer service."

They have a nice large patio that sometimes have live music as well. It's good for large group gatherings. Personally, I've never found anything I love on the menu. I don't mind their appetizers - normally I get the queso. I find their margaritas are a little too sweet for my preference."

                "description": "This was the second time here for supper.  We were with San Antonio Roses for a group meeting, about 30 people.   Took awhile before we could order food and appetizers.  The waitress was a little overwhelmed with the crowd. I ordered my margarita before sitting down, but the two waters never showed up. We ordered fried pickles and a Reuben sandwich with sweet potato fries.  Wife ordered a glass of Pinot Noir.  The fried pickles were great, hot and crispy, but need more ranch on the side.  The Reuben was okay, but the sweet potato fries were cold.  We had to ask for napkins, silverware, and ketchup.  The wine was a small pour, smelled, and didn't taste right.   We returned it.  I tried to use their website \"Toast\" to critique the dinner, but it was blocking me!  Tara earned her automatic 20%, but we won't be back."

The Irish Drop Shot and the Reverse Irish Drop Shot. The Irish Drop Shot was a delicious drink with some sweetness to it. It's the perfect amount of sweetnes. The Reverse Irish Drop Shot wasn't as sweet. I will recommend the Irish Drop Shot. The service was great. I never felt neglected. I will be back again."

It tasted like something pre-packaged from a grocery store. We waited over an hour to get our food and the waiter wasn't very apologetic about that. Their drinks are fantastic. The staff needs to step up their game, they weren't very friendly. I would go there again based on a couple of the dishes and drinks. I felt like the staff just happened to be having a bad day the day we were there."

For our third try, we went on February 26th for a 9 pm dinner.   We order the following:  Share: shrimp campechana Salad: traditional Greek salad  Savor mako's bacon cheeseburger and creole fried chicken.  Signature cocktails: cucumber mako-Rita and whiskey sour.   All I can say is everything was amazingly delicious. The server was terrific. She had great recommendations and knew the menu well. She made sure things got filled in a timely matter. I still can't stop thinking about the food! They also have delicious fermented red jalapeños made in-house. OMGosh! I'm obsessed! I can not wait to go again."

                "description": "The service and the food should have been way better for the prices they charge.   Salmon appetizer was the saving grace of the night.  Seafood Paella was a bowl of grease soaked rice with a few bites of seafood and some shrimp.  Pork shoulder had some weird sour flavor to it.  Tried to save it with a chocolate cheesecake at the end but nope. It was a chocolate brownie, nowhere close to tasting like a cheesecake, it was dense and dry, also had some strange flavor that we were trying to guess but couldn't figure out what it was."

Last night my experience was awesome sitting in the bar. Our server was Paul, the bartender, who was extremely friendly and quirky.  Makos will definitely be my go to for higher end cuisine moving forward. I recommend everyone check them out!"

                "description": "So this is my first time here, to make a reservation online was easy but I did pick a time that I knew wasn't going to be busy to have a great experience. The food was amazing however the menu is very limited but during Covid I have seen that restaurant menu have become limited. I enjoyed the wedge salad added shrimp, I know salad uhh but nope it was amazing they had croutons that were bacon omg it was yummy. The started was a shrimp campechana with some tostada, the size is a little small but it was great because I got to finish my whole entree. The only complaint I would say was our waitress, at first I did give her a benefit of the doubt, but as she countined to get tables it just felt that she ignored me more and more. The reason I put three star was because the food was amazing, the servers who were not our server were helpful wish I could have tip them instead. She just seem to avoid the table, said she would be back and just took a while. At the end she did completely forget about us which left me upset, I did wait a few days because I wanted to clear my head before writing a review. The food was so amazing that I might be back but might do take out next time which is sad because it's a nice environment to enjoy a meal I just don't want to experience that kind of service again. Placed the new menu on here because it does seem like the stuff on yelp are older. The waitress did stated that everything on yelp was old so here something to help. Wishing the restaurant the best, maybe it was just bad timing for me, we'll see on my next visit"

                "description": "First off, the place is a very relaxed atmosphere. The hostess/waitress was super nice.  The place looked clean inside and the outside patio too. Don't expect to see or hear the creek though it's kind of a ways away. We went during brunch hours and we had the place to ourselves considering it was already 2pm. Brunch ends at 3 and dinner starts at 4pm. I had the oyster mushroom omelet and the lentil soup. I wish they served bread for the table. It would go great with my lentil soup. The soup was perfect! The roasted potatoes could've been a little less roasted. My omelet was a little bit over fried. I'm not sure if that's the way they always do it. The waitress mentioned a happy hour from 3-6pm during the week with some $5 drink specials. I would return to try their  dinner menu."

                "description": "I chose to dine alone this evening. I used the Yelp app to help me decide, and Mako's ended up being the perfect location. I made a reservation; it wasn't needed, but I wanted to be on the safe side. I was seated quickly at a high top near the bar where I could still enjoy the peace of dining alone, with the background noise of quiet conversation from others and ESPN playing above the bar.   I'd made it just in time for the Happy Hour specials and decided on a $5 old fashioned and the $5 Gouda ranch wedge ($1 with grilled shrimp1). I added the butternut squash bisque after placing my initial order, and it was the right choice. The funny thing is I can't quite describe what made it tasty, but I cleaned the bowl! The salad was pure perfection...seriously...you canNOT go wrong. I'm not sure if it was the tangy pickled onion, the smoky lardon bacon,  or the perfectly grilled shrimp that made the salad so scrumptious, but I'm already planning my next visit for that one item alone.   Since I wasn't stuffed from my satisfying meal, I decided to indulge in dessert. I chose the poached pear with the Portofino wine reduction and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It was delicious, but SUPER sweet. So, if you're not into that, pass on this dessert. Even though it's a small dessert, it's perfect to share because it's probably too rich for one person (except me!).   This will not be my last time enjoying happy hour here; I've already text a friend to suggest this as a new monthly get together spot! Next time I'll sit outside!   Side Note: I definitely recommend the \"Smoked\" old fashioned made with star of anise, juniper berry, and mesquite chips. Ask to see a demonstration to add to the overall experience. It was a pure delight. It somehow took a simple $5 cocktail to the next level."

The food is exceptional and the chef is talented. We loved the bartender and our servers. Highlights were the burger, salmon tartare and the delicious market salad. Thanks for having us!"

                "description": "We found this new trendy spot in Cibolo, Texas. The host was very accommodating when we arrived, if you wanted to wear a mask then they wore mask and if you were comfortable and not wearing a mask then they would not wear a mask.  He sat us all down as we were still waiting for three people from our party. Once our full party had arrived, we had to wait. Unfortunately the waitress took over 10 minutes to come to our table to at least offer some water.  Overall our experience was very great! Unfortunately I did not take a lot of pictures because it was my sisters birthday. But I did manage to sneak in a picture of my cheeseburger which was very light. And I don't mean light in a bad way I mean it as in a satisfying way. Must try!   Their cocktails are also very delicious. I had the cucumber margarita cocktail if I'm not mistaken, and it was very light and subtle at the same time. But boozy!   The only part that I was not super happy with was that the waitress mentioned to us that she had ordered a special surprise for my sister which was their almond cake. As a gift from her. So to me that means that the dessert is on them. But surprisingly when I received the ticket the almond cake was on there. I did not feel like I really wanted to argue over the almond cake but as I stated the way she mentioned it to me is that she was covering the cake. So for that reason I did remove one star.  Something that I really liked about this place was the bathroom. As a first time Mama i've noticed that many restaurants don't have a baby changing table. Or if they have a baby changing table it's very dirty. This place had a very awesome baby changing station. They had diapers, they had wipes, they had waste bags. You think of it and they had it!  Thanks To their management for this!   Great place to eat! Enjoy!"

                "description": "Mako's is a really nice restaurant! The staff was very friendly, the restaurant was nicely decorated and had great ambiance. The food and drinks we ordered were delicious. One of the previous reviews mentioned the Aunt Bees Knees being delicious so I decided to try it and it was really good. My wife got the salmon and I ordered the Pork Shoulder. The salmon was delicious (probably not worth $30 but it did taste very good) and the pork shoulder was also very good as well. One thing I will caution in regards to the pork shoulder is that it is very fatty. There was a lot of fat on the sides of the lean pork that added flavor for sure but wasn't very healthy. We also ordered the Brussels sprouts as an appetizer and they were delicious. A lot of good flavor.   We enjoyed our time at Mako especially since the staff was so nice. However, the price was really not worth it. I'm going to give it 5 stars bc there isn't a 4.5 star option and the experience was worth more than a 4 but I don't think I'd be coming back mainly because of the price of the food. It was good though; so if you don't mind paying extra then this is a good spot for date night or to enjoy a nice evening dinner.   Overall: 4.5 stars"

                "description": "If you're looking for fine dining , a place to celebrate something special, or just want fantastic food and feel extra special them look no further than Mako's!  We celebrated our anniversary and wanted to experience a place we hadn't been to.  Walking in we were immediately seated.  Wait staff was jovial and attentive.   Our appetizers were very good and filling (we should have only ordered one but couldn't decide between the two) fried Brussels and Levantine trio. Our entrees were equally difficult to choose but ultimately my husband ordered the 1855 beef coulotte, medium rare.  It was cooked exactly how he wanted with red on the center and juices running in every bite.  You could even taste the hint of coffee spice.  The turnips and carrots were prepared in a Marchand de vin sauce, complimented it nicely.  My entree was the chickpea crusted salmon.  I loved every bite!  It had a slight char on the outside but very moist on the inside.  The tomato and eggplant stew it came with also delicious.   Easily a five star restaurant that I'd recommend and plan on returning to."

The servers were on top of it as we were changing seats, walking around, it was definitely professional.  The booking and reserving was so easy too.  Everyone enjoyed their food, my paella was awesome. I also tried their steak and their fried chicken...I would order it all if I could afford it. There is no competition with flavor and quality of their ingredients.  I thank the restaurant and we all enjoyed our time."

                "description": "I don't usually leave bad reviews, but unfortunately I feel compelled to in this case.  We ordered the butternut squash bisque, scallops, and paella.  Butternut squash bisque was basically flavored oil with some seeds... there was literally a layer of oil on the top when it came out... I still pressed on and gave it a chance though... it tasted ok at best... In general I'm a human vacuum cleaner so I ate the entire thing, but I would not recommend it if you're looking for an actual bisque/soup.  The scallops were tiny and it only came with 3.... The bed of risotto that the scallops were on had a very odd taste... not like an old taste, or like the food was rotten, it was just seasoned horribly. Again I stomached the entire thing, but the portion size was so small that I was done with the entire plate in literally 3-4 bites.... Total rip-off for the $34 price point.   The Paella.... my mom sent it back.. i tried it before she did though and I wouldn't have been able to stomach it. It was absolutely horrible. Terrible flavor, overcooked seafood, odd tasting sausage, and about 1/4 cup of rice... we couldn't even see the rice when the plate first came out because there was so little. Is this shrinkflation or just normal for this place? I have no idea...   I would not normally have even posted this review but.... After we told the server we'd be sending the Paella back, she stopped by the table that the owner was sitting at and let him know... He never came over to talk to us about it.... and when the server came back, she said the kitchen agreed that it was bad LOL. What?   They were nice enough to comp that dish, but again, the owner/manager/whoever never came by to talk to us about it, apologize, ask how everything else was, nothing.... On our way out we walked past the table the owner was sitting at... he said \"sorry about that, have a good one.\" LOL  Never again"

I called from the parking lot and asked the hostess the question \"can you accommodate a party of one,   the hostess said hold on one moment let me check with my manager and see. She came back shortly and said yes we would love to have you, however,  we are extensively busy and there might be a longer wait for your dinner than normal.

                "description": "If you haven't been here, Go!   Pro tip: Where loose, breathable clothing. Your in south TX and this is outside. Be comfortable n dress down. Flip flops, T-shirt n shades. Way down south.   This is the place where I've had one of my top 2 fav burritos of all time, and that Is my fav food y'all.  Look for the red truck with the pulled pork! Mmm mmm expletive!  Secondly, they have some good beers here. They proudly gloated they were one of the few venues in Texas to have Saint Arnold's Pumpkinator - an Imperial pumpkin beer! I've only had 2, and I'm a PRO beer snob. If you haven't had it, you should! Salivate now. https://www.saintarnold.com/seasonal-beers/  Anyway, there's a small playground for kids. The bathrooms are less than desirable but I don't rate bathrooms, unless they are so bad they are worth staying away from.   Another pro tip: if you get there past 6 on a weekend, parking will be rough. Go early, beat crowds. Enjoy a hill country sunset as you walk out not entirely sober as others are just getting there, and smile. Or stay n sober eatin' mo' food truck stuff."

Only issue is parking. Parking an be a B, but we managed that's to my excellent parallel parking skills from NJ ;)  For sure a must try place! We went close to dusk and got to see how the place really glowed at night. Very beautiful."

Bartenders are amazing, food trucks offer a great variety of food, and my kids love the playground. My husband and I don't get much help with our kids so for our 'date night' or to unwind from the week we go here, order a drink, kids play, and RELAX. We love the live music as well. This place is a GEM"

Everything from a full serviced bar to barbecue, turkey legs, burgers, gyros, falafels, taquitos, and everything in between.  I got a delicious (huge) chicken gyro; my husband a burger a fries.  Food was prepared quickly and was delicious.  Loved the setting.  Plenty of food.  Not cheap.  With tip I paid $35 for two of us and we only had a can of soda with the food.  Can't wait to bring my son here when he visits me."

I almost always get the Sang-mosa, a sweet, bubbly mix of house made sangria and Prosecco. We also love the brisket sandwiches, although you'll need a nap after you eat one.

We took a look at the food trucks and we weren't craving anything there and not to mention we literally had gyros for lunch. Not knowing you can't bring outside food or drinks we brought seafood. The manger came up to us rudely while we were eating saying \"you guys can't bring outside food or drinks we're trying to make a living here but I will let y'all finish\" but our family members literally spent 200$ dollars here on food and drinks from the food trucks. I understand if we all would of brought it but it was literally just 2 of us and there was 6 of us at the table.I just thought it was very unprofessional how rude the manager came off.Sorry you guys don't offer more varieties. She could of told us in a more polite way but instead ruined the good time we were having. First and last time here."

If you are not sure what you want to eat today, there is a variety of food trucks to choose from. From Tex-mex to bbq. It is also a cool hangout spot for you and your friends.   I would like to point out a special shop nestled in the park. It is a coffee shop and they have some of the best teas and brews.

Don't make the same mistake if you still haven't been here. The collection of food trucks and shops is purely awesome! @thepointpark consists of @holysmokesa @justthedripsatx @cilantromfft @nygrillexpress @thebackporchbar hosted by @beardxican (Noel Rocks). But I became a fan boy when I was able to chat with owner Denise @eclecticsatx. This boss works her butt off to build something very special on Boerne Stage Rd just minutes from @therimsa. I've been meaning to come by but it was a recent post she made that brought me here. The post has since been taken down (I hope she puts it back up) because of worries that it could offend some patrons but I applauded her for expressing herself and the message in general. See, it seems some people don't understand that this is PRIVATE PROPERTY! It's an operational business like any other establishment yet some folks stroll right in with outside food and drinks and then take a table. Like, what?People, these food trucks and businesses on premises are there to serve you, not watch you support other businesses. This should be common sense, but it's not, and Denise is trying to make sure folks know just remember this. Well, I have no problem saying it, \"STOP THAT SHIT!\".  Support these local businesses and come to eat, drink and enjoy what this spot has to offer. That's what what we did. I When you go you MUST try the Texas Twinkies from holysmokesa...like, holy wow! And make sure to chat with Noel when you grab your drink. You can't miss him@and won't forget him. To all my fellow #YelpElite, GET HERE ASAP!"

                "description": "Maybe you know - why is food truck food typically so expensive? There's no overheard like buildings, leases, servers, bussers, Albanian mobsters...what gives???  A few misses here this day! Patroned around 4 PM on a 95 degree Saturday. Not many folks there and that's likely due to the heat and it being between peak dining times. Lots of shady seating though and thankful that the music they play isn't ear-piercingly loud.   The first truck (Gus' Colombian Cuisine) we wanted to order from was closed. Lights were on, window was open, but no one was home. We stood there for a minute like doofuses since there wasn't a sign saying he was gone or when he'd be back. Strike 1.   So, we decided to try a shrimp and lobster roll from Curb. Informed out of brioche rolls so cannot make that item. Strike 2. Settled on a shrimp and lobster club sandwich or whatever it's called. It was good but $19 good? I don't know about that. Plus, there's no discount for paying with cash instead of cc. The other trucks offer that.  Got an order of 5 egg rolls from the Pho truck for $6. That guy gets around and never disappoints. Rolls were hot and crispy! Great value!  Checked in on Yelp and got a free non-alcoholic drink at the bar - a big glass bottle Coke! There's a cooler on the bar for free water, which was nice. Those were pluses. They have some fans blowing and skeeter spray on some of the tables. The kids liked the play structure and basketball hoop. $4 small lime snocones hurt the wallet, but the kids liked them.   Since they didn't earn a third strike, we'll probably revisit when the weather is cooler and closer to lunch or dinner when all the trucks are open and hopefully fully stocked. If it's sold out, then please indicate that on the menu with a sticker or a magnet. If you're closed, then please put out a sign and say when you'll be back. Easy fixes that keep people informed (and happy) before they try to order."

As far as I know,  Tandem is the only place in town that brews espresso with Dark Matter, or that you can find DM beans to purchase. Happy happy happy!!  In addition to just destination coffee,, Tandem is right on the Mission Reach of the Greenway, near Confluence Park. Convenient stop-off from a bike ride or hound walk for a beer (they have 12ish really nice taps, and a selection of cans too). Huge dog-friendly yard with giant beer pong set up. Across the street from an art school - awesome works for sale on Tandem's walls. Great periodic events listed on their socials.  A half-mile from South BBQ - picking up to-go lunch at South and a coffee at Tandem is my favourite Sunday brunch!"

There's also a few fire pits throughout the grassy area, trash can beer pong and the WiFi reaches the entire patio without an issue.    Haven't tried the food yet and the beer selection is okay.

There was an event going on, which I tabled at, and live music that was super enjoyable both as a vendor and a customer! The snack selection is great and the beer and wine menu is as well but I don't drink so I like that there is coffee there too a lot. The bartenders/baristas are also the best! Cant wait to be back just to hang out and to table there again!"

                "description": "We're visiting from California and found this brewery off the river walk trail. If you're local, what a great date to ride along the trail, stop for a beer and a snack or bring your kids and enjoy a Texas cola in the afternoon and warm cozy drinks in the morning.   They've spaced out their outdoor seating, offering a variety of picnic tables, chairs, and ready to-go fire pits for enjoying your beer or coffee.  We had the vegan frito pie, with a little spice, sliced avocado and queso, empanadas and a couple of local beers.  Come support this local business as capitalism allows the ingenuity of the independent business owner to give us all a unique experience."

Coffee is bomb, and was impressed to find out they have house made syrups. I was little confused about the couches, they seemed very dirty, and one was in front of the refrigerators...The decor needs some TLC and they could have a better Mexican beer selection."

I was there outside with my son and wife, me drinking a beer my wife a coffee and my son an abuelitas hot chocolate with a Tandem twist. Then played the giant beer pong game with my son which he had a blast. The outdoor lights the cool art themed interior makes you feel relaxed to slow life down just a bit to enjoy the the little things in life and watch your family smile! Especially at these not so pleasant times. Ask for Balde he is great brista/ bartender/ musician!"

                "description": "Such a fan of Seersucker Southern Style gin! If you don't like gin, you will like Seersucker Gin! Trust me.   It is an adorable place to hang out any day of the week! The grounds are beautiful, ample amount of parking. There are rocking chairs on the covered porch, picnic tables, plush chairs and ottomons, bean bag toss and bocce ball set up outside with fans.   There are a few tables inside the tasting room, along with the bar, restrooms, merchandise for sale and the distillery. The tasting room is right in the middle of the distillery, so you see all the working parts that go into making the gin and Cinco vodka.  They offer free tours on Saturday's at 3 PM, and request that you RSVP on their website. Trey, the owner, was the one who gave the tour. He is a fun and interactive guy, so you definitely will not be bored. We were able to taste their Cinco Vodka, Gin, Lemon Flavored Gin and Limeaide Gin. Then we each purchased a cocktail to take on the tour with us.   Fun fact - Seersucker was the first gin to be made with real fruit juice, not just flavored. They also have trademarked the \"Southern Style Gin.\" Who knew this little hidden gem was in San Antonio!   Seersucker is pet friendly, as long as your pet is leashed.  They also pop fresh popcorn daily."

Also, plenty of parking. The property is well kept.  Tasted the vodka,  gin, lemon gin, and lime gin.  All of which were very good, but the lemon and lime were my favorites.   The owner was very friendly and knowledgeable. He conducted the tour, which was very interesting and informative.    Would be a fun place for a group event.  Will definitely return."

                "description": "Wow, LOVED this place!   Delicious gin - not a typo, this stuff is the real deal. They specialize in their original creation of southern style gin which is naturally \"flavored\" with citrus varieties.   When you visit this place, you'll feel like you just arrived at someone's chic farm. The design and decor of this distillery are a dream. Charming from the moment you pull in, you'll notice outdoor games, relaxing seating options, and an adorable porch. Perfection is in the details and this placed nailed it. Can't wait to go back!   It's a drive from the city-center but well worth it for the serenity this space has to offer. You don't want to miss it!!!"

I prefer to park my car at the Pearl and simply take a Lyft so I don't have to worry about drinking and driving.   Seersucker Gin currently has three different flavors and they're deemed as a Southern Style Gin. The current flavors are lime, lemon, and neat. They distill everything on-site and they're super passionate about their product.  If you're a newb to gin, Seersucker is a great introduction to the gin world. It's very clean and is a great base for signature cocktails. You gotta try the bees knees. Literally one of the best drinks to have in the Summer.  They have plenty of outdoor seating and the patio is gorgeous. Have a Seersucker drink during the sunset and you'll be set."

My favorite is the limeade which goes great with topochico.  I made my second visit when they let me host my birthday party.  The bartender was awesome and provided a tasting for all of my guests.    The distillery is a cool place to stop in for a bit, and the outdoor area is nice as well.  There are games and tables set up outside to hang out while you enjoy one of their many different drinks.  Make sure to check out their new grapefruit gin.  I think I have a new favorite!"

We have visited the distillery three times now, and have been pleased with the atmosphere, the service, and the gin!  Family owned, this distillery hits the mark with its self-guided tours (guided tours are available by reservation), friendly and knowledgeable mixologists (there's no delayed gratification here... drink while you tour), and casual outdoor spaces.  So, take a leisurely drive outside the city, enjoy a refreshing Seersucker and Soda with lime, and throw out the jack for a friendly game of bocce ball. Cheers"

                "description": "Seersucker provides a really fun, different southern vibe for the San Antonio area! We came here on a Saturday and got here around 5- it was about a 40 minute drive for us from northwest SA. Even on Saturday they close at 7. My husband and I split a flight which included the cinco vodka, seersucker vodka, and the four gin flavors (original, lemon, lime, and grapefruit). They also offer/use topo Chico. Our group then proceeded to try/share a few of the drinks which all were good. You can buy bottles on location- it's $25 for 750ml. They also provide recipe cards which have very feasible/easy recipes for you to make at home. The outside area is cute and probably really enjoyable anytime other than the summer- but we couldn't bring ourselves to stand outside when it's 100 even to enjoy washers, corn hole, hibachi ball, or horseshoes. We plan on coming back sometime and trying out cactus land brewery as well while we are in the area- but they're only open once a month so that takes more coordination. Overall a cute little distillery and addition to SA."

I have not been able to drink gin neat before. Up until now, my favorite had been New Amsterdam. However, this gin was so delicious AND its local! Win - win!  I visited the distillery for the first time yesterday. My boyfriend and I went for a tasting and touring event. I absolutely loved the concept. The distillery is open to the public Thursday - Sunday. The bar is in the middle so you have the view of the whole place. There are lawn games and chairs so you can have fun outside. Rocking chairs on the porch make it feel so southern. It is a bit of a drive but it's worth it! The bartenders as well as the owner were friendly. I will definitely have to go back with friends!  FYI: They also make vodka!!!"

The outside area and inside tasting areas are so cute. When we walked into the tasting area, we were not greeted or welcomed. We kindly asked about recommendations and the bartenders kept cutting their fruit slices and wouldn't even make eye contact. We were the only ones there...

He's great, very attentive and personable, and stays after his shift to make sure our last orders have come to our table.

                "description": "Came for Culinaria 2022!  I ordered the Crab hush puppies, shrimp and \"grits,\" and brownie parfait.  Shrimp and cauliflower grits was by far the favorite. The texture and flavor were both on point. Shrimp was seasoned well and not over cooked.  Crab hush puppies were fresh, crispy, and came with a maple butter.  The brownie crunch parfait was a fun ending to the meal topped with the right amount of whipped cream (is there ever such a thing as too much whipped cream?) Definitely recommend, and I will be coming back to try the other items on their regular menu.  Our server was Mary and she was the bomb! Always on top of the orders and didn't rush our table at all."

                "description": "Well I went back to GP for happy hour last week. Totally opposite experience. I get we're in a pandemic but sheesh. My friend and I both ordered Moscow mules. She asked for a splash of pineapple juice in hers, I did not. We both got pineapple juice anyway. Once we got our check, we learned that we were charged an extra $2.24 per drink, for a splash of pineapple juice. So happy hour was pointless. Not to mention the service wasn't good, despite it not being too busy and there were multiple servers. I should have just asked for the manager but I hate doing that. We stayed patient with the server the whole time and just paid our check to leave. This was last week and I'm still disappointed about the experience."

It was good plain and the seasoning on the shrimp and chicken was good too. Shrimp was a bit overcooked.  Our server was Tommy. He was fabulous. Really nice and had good knowledge of the menu. I normally wouldn't order a salad, but on his recommendation, I did."

                "description": "General Public seems to have been humming along since the conception of the Rim. Its corner location almost blends in too well with the high-class neutral-toned neighborhood. I myself have been guilty of passing right on by towards bigger brighter louder spots, my mistake. As I am the cheapest person I know with a taste for expensive cocktails, I'm not sure why I ever stopped anywhere else nearby.  The Happy Hour is unbeatable if you arrive at 3pm. Every hour the drinks increase by a dollar, so it pays to duck out of work before the 5pm whistle. The food is great too, if you're into that sorta thing."

The indoor and outdoor seating was great and the staff was very nice. Our waitress was Skylar and she was awesome. We ordered two apps and they were both delicious. The hushpuppies and the grilled cheese bites. Happy hour is from 3-6 and is half priced drinks and apps and if you show up at 3 it's only $3 for each app. I recommend this spot for sure!   Overall: 4.7"

Two males barley acknowledged us and took care of us, asked for ketchup and 10 min later he brought it out to us after we were already done with our food. The energy and attitude we got was so unprofessional and I will not be coming back nor recommend due to poor customer service."

The happy hour food menu is plentiful, the drinks are big, and the restaurant is just plain cool. Happy hour here is price of the hour starting at 3PM, which is an insanely good prices. We're usually the 4-5PM crowd, and it's just as good. The grilled cheese bites are the most bang for your buck, HUGE servings for the price and really gooey cheese. Loaded tots are my second go to, and easy to share with a friend. Ranch water a light, but the HH margs here are tall and strong. I have nothing but good words for this place!"

The tacos were large and filled with stuff so I left feeling full. I also got an IPA and that was solid too.  Experience: I went on a Friday around early evening and it wasn't too busy. They have an outdoor space that has a playground and the food truck (where the food comes from) and an inside space with lots of tables and benches. You can order everything at the bar and they'll give you a number so your food can be delivered to you. Service was fast and friendly.  Value: The tacos were $3 per, which is a bit pricey, but worth it given the size. The booze is cheap too! I highly recommend as a spot to get drinks and some good drunchies."

I want to chill at a bar and enjoy people watching and that doesn't include watching other people's children.   Food is available - brisket tends to be over smoked for my taste. The frozen margaritas are a bit too sweet. They do have a brunch buffet on sundays. Live music at times. Parking is a bit limited on site so you have to park across the streets or in the neighborhood.   Felt that the bar was a little understaffed - took a while to get our order even though we were sitting at the bar and even though it wasn't very busy.   But stop by and check it out to see what you think."

                "description": "This is our go to spot most Wednesdays and Sundays. Good place for kids and is a good environment. Have never been to their brunch which i hear is amazing but the line to get in is usually wrapped around the building.  Whats good?  Brisket nachos - very good. Brisket cheese sandwich - awesome. Frozen moscow mule - fiance loves them. Lots of texas beer. There really isnt anything on their food menu that is not good. Would i say this place is better tham Alamo BBQ Co on grayson?  Unfortunately, yes. Even though both places are good. I think the organization of Pig Pen/Smoke Shack is much better. I also believe the quality of the food is WAY better. Price is much better too. If you have never been. Go check them out. Guaranteed a good time."

                "description": "What a gem! Came today for the Sunday brunch and what a treat!  Primarily a bar with indoor picnic seating inside. Outdoor sports another bar, with a large play scape for the kids. More picnic tables and some smaller tables around. Food truck sits in the back and opens after the brunch closes at 2. No kiddos after 9 at night.  So, the buffet....just about any southern classic breakfast item you can imagine. Biscuits, sausage, pancakes, blueberry sausage, eggs, bacon, black eye peas, collard greens, fried catfish, fried chicken, cheesy grits, brisket, blueberry cobbler, etc etc. Everything is outstanding. Delicious well priced mimosas and bloody Mary's.   Since there are instruction signs on what to do when you walk in, here's a hint. As you enter the doors, head to the left to the end of the bar to grab your disposable plate and your choice of beverage. Coffee and juices are included in your buffet price16 pp and 8 for kids.stake out a place to sit(make friends since you will sitting with others). Buffet is to the back wall. Make sure you get a new plate each time you go back for more.   Live blues music was also such a great surprise and really could have sat there mush longer listening to the acoustic music and song. Really will be back!"

                "description": "The Pig Pen is my neighborhood joint. I have been here many times. I would make it my regular hangout but it doesn't carry any beer that my husband likes so we tend to go where he can get a good stout.   They usually have at least one or two IPA's on tap and that makes me happy.  As a hamburger lover, I have to give their hamburger just an average score. It's good but not amazing. Fries are good too.   My favorite menu item is the BBQ brisket nachos. They are OUTSTANDING and HUGE. You can share these for sure.  The BBQ Brisket grilled cheese is yummy too. The wings are pretty good. The tacos are okay. My son enjoys the hot wings and fried pickles.  We have only gone for brunch once before COVID and the brunch selection was pretty massive and everything was pretty tasty. I was pleased with the fried chicken and the brisket. I wasn't pleased with the price. It is expensive.   If you have little ones they have a great outdoor area for seating and a little playscape for the kiddos. And on Tuesday nights they have open mic nite. They have so much to offer.  Service has always been good and everyone is always friendly. I think you will be pleased if you visit The Pig-Pen. I think it is a perfect place during COVID b/c you can order everything outside and eat outside as well. Pay them a visit, please."

                "description": "Had a friend visiting from out of town and all he'd eaten was Mexican or Tex-Mex since he got here on Friday. We definitely had to switch it up today. So we decided to try out Pigpen and omg we were not disappointed. The food was freaking awesome.  When we walked in they were absolutely packed, it was a little chaotic and for being my first time it was slightly overwhelming for a bit since we didn't know where to go or what to do. We stood in a line that was apparently for the food, but we needed to be in the line to pay first, so I slipped out from one line and into the other leaving my dude in the food line so we wouldn't lose our spot.  I paid the bartender, then slipped back in line for the food. It is set up buffet style on Sunday's, hence the line to get food. When we finally got to the food, it looked so good! Eggs, hash brown, silver dollar pancakes, biscuits, tortillas, breakfast sausage links, breakfast sausage patties, grits, Mac and cheese, collard greens, black eyed peas, pulled pork, bacon, brisket, blueberry cobbler, peach cobbler and then all the fixings, coffee, juice, fresh fruit... and everything was freaking amazing! Literally amazing!  The brisket was tender, and had a great flavor. It wasn't the best brisket I've ever had but it was super super good. For a quick comparison, Augie's down the street has better brisket overall. But, this being what it was, a buffet, the brisket was better than expected, so hats off to the cook on that.  The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 was because there is no direction as far as when you arrive. For someone who had never been, It was super Overwhelming and my anxiety level was through the roof. I literally started sweating. I know it sounds crazy but for someone who deals with social anxiety it was almost enough to make me walk out the door. To be fair, there was a sign, telling you \"seat yourself, pay for food and order drinks at the bar\" but the long lines that were literally to the door were a bit perplexing until I was able to figure out what was going on. A host or a quick explanation of the process by an employee would have been welcome. Overall this place was super good but the inside seating can be a bit snug and be prepared to be friendly because it is set up kind of picnic style. Oh and they had live music! You can't beat that. Check this place out, you won't be disappointed."

                "description": "Large portions, slow service and not too friendly. I hadn't been here in over a year and feel that the quality of the food has gone down. The quantity is a bit overwhelming, but I suppose it matches the price. The brisket grilled cheese was okay, a little over salted. The fries were like grease sponges that seemed like they had been sitting out for awhile and then flash fried them again. There was very little potato and a whole lot of grease. This used to be a good spot. Will not be rushing  back anytime soon."

                "description": "Ok, first of all I would have never guessed this place would have turned into what it has. It is nestled back behind the smoke shack off broadway in the Alamo heights area. It's a little neighborhood bar that has a pretty interesting souther brunch on sundays. All of their food is catered by the smoke shake and it looks like that have some pretty awesome drinks to pair.   You walk in and buy your plate (buffet at $16 per person) and I'm sure you can take it from there. They have a very southern variety of foods such as collard creams, pinto beans, biscuits and gravy and grits. They also have pancakes, eggs, bacon, brisket Mac n cheese and sausage. But not just any sausage, they have a link STUFFED WITH BLUEBERRY PRESERVES. It was very good and I loved how unique it was. The service was really great and friendly and really just had a great small community vibe to it. Definitely a local hit spot.   I would probably return. The price is high but the food really was good. The only thing I'd change is since it's buffet style, it's hard to keep the food hot or even warm. Other than that though super solid southern take on brunch!"

The brunch is about $16 and has a nice assortment of breakfast foods and barbecue. I tried a bit of everything and I have to say the mac n cheese and collard greens really stood out! The brisket and pulled pork were pretty good for a buffet. There was live music inside and the bar was open to order drinks/buckets. Overall, solid food and a great atmosphere. Looking forward to coming back for another Sunday brunch!"

                "description": "Solid food, but foodtruck-slow service.  Dropped into The Pigpen at a Monday noon start due to the Smoke Shack's being closed for a Food Network shoot.  No worries, as The Pigpen still offered the transcendental brisket grilled cheese.  Unfortunately, it's only life-changing if you can get the sandwich before your lunch hour is up.  Brisket grilled cheese was surprisingly light for a sandwich made of meat, cheese, and an unhealthy helping of fried butter.  The bread gave way with a light crunch, and the cheese must have been detuned/desalted as to not overpower the soft, juicy brisket that retained a subtle smoky punch - though not as smoke rich as the burnt ends of the artist formerly known as Oklahoma Joe's in KCMO.  Fried onion rings similarly featured a light batter, not the breaded mummification found at lesser joints.  Unfortunately, the grilled cheese took a half hour to reach the table despite my being the second table to order for lunch service.  By 12:30, quoted food times stretched to an hour, and out-of-town guests looking for Smoke Shack offerings began to trickle out the door, unsatisfied.  Next time, will visit the Smoke Shack for Smoke Shack meats."

                "description": "This is an amazing brunch!   After seeing so many good reviews about this place for brunch I was finally able to come here with some out of town friends and my husband. Everyone loved it! (That includes my husband who doesn't love brunch the way that I do.) The bbq (brisket and pulled pork) was definitely the unanimous favorites by everyone.   My first round, I took a little of everything that looked good to me to try a bite of each. My favorites that I got a bigger portion of on round 2 was the pulled pork, brisket, bacon, mac and cheese and biscuit/gravy (the fresh biscuits had just come out). Even saying that, everything else I had round 1 was good (sausage, eggs, hashbrowns, fried catfish).  I'd say for first timers, if you want to try something and it's low, just wait for your 2nd time through the line. They are constantly replenishing the food.  Great food and a relaxing way to do brunch with some friends. Our friends stayed for 2+ hours, we were there for just over an hour."

                "description": "My hubby and I only had a limited time to enjoy a quick bite to eat without the kids so I didn't have a chance to look up reviews before picking a place. If I had seen the reviews, I definitely would have chosen a different place!My hubby wanted to enjoy some cold beer on tap with our meal so we decided to check this place out since we were nearby.   We dined outside since it was such a beautiful day. There were no actual menus so we had to scan the QR code to check out the menu on our phones. We were greeted in a timely manner, the waitress was very pleasant. My hubby ordered a beer and I ordered a Southtown Mule to start off with and for our meals we went with a salad with chicken tenders and a turkey melt.  I was surprised that the beer selection wasn't better with it being a brewery and all. As far as the cocktails, all are made with beer since this establishment only has a beer and wine license so keep that in mind if you prefer cocktails with liquor. My Southtown Mule was just okay. It was a bit too sour for me and reminded me of a cheap sport's bar drink.   The turkey melt was a bit disappointing to put it nicely. The turkey was dry and they forgot the tomatoes. At least the bread was perfectly toasted and the fries were homemade and were actually good. I was STARVING so I didn't feel like waiting for the order to be corrected. I asked the waitress for ranch Dressing which definitely saved the sandwich and made it somewhat enjoyable. The salad had 2 super large core/butt end chunks in it. I don't know about you but I don't really enjoy having that in my salad. It just shows pure laziness, that says a lot about the care that they put into their food. The chicken tenders were average, not bad but not exactly good. Again, ranch Dressing saved yet another food item.   The only reason that I'm being generous with the three stars is because the homemade fries were good and so was the ranch Dressing. The ranch definitely salvaged our meals! We left feeling disappointed. When you have kids and you FINALLY get some adult time for a quick date, it's extremely frustrating when everything is sub par. Sadly, we won't be returning."

I tried both of their sours and they were some of the better sours I've had in Texas so far. Unfortunately, when I asked for a taster it was brought out to me in those little paper cups that you put ketchups in at McDonald's.   What kind of brewery gives out tasters like that? I would hope that there would be a little more pride in their product than to present it like pills at a nursing home.   Similarly, service was...questionable. Our server didn't just seem new but discombobulated. He couldn't answer questions about their beers but I had to point out what I was talking about on the menu.   Their beers are good, they are but it doesn't reflect it in so many ways."

We walked in, received a hello and water immediately! Great start! We then sat for OVER a half an hour before ANYONE acknowledged us again and that was after we went to the bar and inquired if we could order any time soon. So... 45 minutes in we were asked what we would like to order... two burgers, fries, one with garlic fries, prickly pear margarita and ice for our water.   15 minutes later we got the margarita and we again asked for ice.   15 minutes later we got our burgers.   His burger was great! The bacon was crispy and thick and the burger was tasty. I know because I took a bite (or 2!!) My burger not only had a rancid smell it tasted bad. I could not eat it. They took off the price of the burger, however, said it was fresh today. I was trained in quality control for the HEB meat plant years ago. I know this meat was not good. I don't know why- it just wasn't.   Garlic fries meant two tablespoons of minced garlic dumped on top of fries. I think my breath still stinks a day later even though I tried to scrape it off.  The margaritas were okay. No alcohol because nothing registered!!   Food was served by the same people who cleared the tables. It was just all around a crummy experience. What I do know is restaurants are now all under staffed and going out to eat is a gamble at best. I would not say not to go to Blue Star, maybe we were there on a super bad day, bad moment in time for them.   We won't go back, but if you're into beer and enjoy their atmosphere... enjoy!"

There was nothing too exciting about it: tomato, lettuce, and some sort of falafel like thing. No sauce, seasoning, pickles or anything. I had to ask for ranch.   The french fries were good though! They are 4 star fries.   Service was good.   Outdoor spacing for Covid was okay... not great, but not terrible. Some tables were definitely not 6 feet apart, the guy sitting behind me was probably only about 3.5 feet away. Some tables were 6 feet though.  Take out box is styrofoam, which is really unfortunate since they never decompose and can't be recycled."

Service was really slow as well, but was due tim our server as other server seemed on top of things.   Just realize it's hit or miss on service if you go.   And they messed up my bill."

They have a variety of beers and margaritas you can drink.   As a self-claimed margarita Connoisseur,  I was a little let down by how sour they were. My colleagues were really able to enjoy it fully but it was a pretty good size. If you're a beer person, this is your spot. Next time I'll try the food, this was just a Saturday evening stop for me today."

                "description": "Hubby had the wings. Ordered lemon pepper but got the Thai chili. 8 small wings for 15 bucks. Nope. Not worth it. I had the loaded nachos with brisket. Stale chips. Congealed cheese spread. Brisket is dry but tasted. Nope. Not worth it.   On a brighter note the IPA and sour were very good.   Come for the beers but seriously skip the food. Nope.  Not worth it!   We have had such better food at other breweries. I'm so disappointed.  If I were giving stars foe the food they would barely get a 1. The beer would get a 4. I'm being generous with a 3 for both the stuff they call food and the beer together."

                "description": "DO BETTER! You would think with such a beautiful location, they would take more pride in their food and beverage.  The beers my wife and I got were warm...both times. The bacon cheddar burger I ordered was cold and raw in the middle, my wife's turkey BLT was bland and literally just two slices of toast with freezer cold turkey, avocado and bacon in the middle. The cup of chili soup we ordered had the look and texture of dog food.  The only good part about our food were the fries.   I went to the bathroom at one point and the floor was sticky, urinals were filthy, there was no toilet paper, and no soap to wash your hands. And this was on at Monday at about noon.. how do y'all not even have the proper standards to even clean the bathrooms?   This place has soo much potential and I really hope management sees this and decides to make some changes, until then we probably will not be back."

The beer isn't to our liking or the food and the wait staff is either over burdened or inattentive. We've supported this place over the years because it is local and we would love to see them succeed, but after several unfortunate experiences we will move our business to the breweries a few blocks off the river. Still local and a much better experience...you can see a few of my other reviews for breweries close by."

What used to be a source of great food and decent craft beer is sadly only a ghost of its former self. Tasted beers thst are from their standard line up thst across the board were mere suggestions of the quality ales they used to produce. The food also was really sad, US Foods Frozen Products reheated... should have noted the poor state of affairs in the kitchen on our way in... pretty shabby and disorganized - I ha e t seen a kitchen in this much disarray since the last time I watched Jon Tapper on TV. Having been a Craft Beer Connisseur for over 30 years now. This place has all the signs of a dying brewery struggling to gasp its last breath. Good Brewhouse and some great fixtures soon to be bought cheap at auction unless a miracle in the form of an investor with a great chef and a great brewer shows up soon. Save your money - San Antonio has a lot of WONDERFUL Independent Craft Beer and exceptional food out there, why waste it here. Very Sad."

If you'd like to take some of their beer home, you can do so by purchasing one of their growlers. Their growlers are pretty affordable and definitely worth it.   Food: This is where things get a little 3-star ish for me. I've been coming here multiple times, and their food is never consistent. Sometimes it can be excellent and other times way below average. I also think their food prices can be a bit overpriced to what they are actually serving.  Service: If you sit in the bar, you'll definitely get a 5-star service, but outside of the bar gets a little flaky. I've had some pretty horrible service at Blue Star, but it seems that they staff is always changing and every time I come back I see someone new."

Blue star brewing has a lot or space and is in a great location in Southtown, so we decided to try them out.   I got the Turkey BLT and Southtown Mule. I specifically asked for no bacon and asked if I could have extra avacado, but the server forgot and he never came back after we ordered our food. Also the sandwich itself was two buttered pieces of bread with deli chicken, lettuce, avacado, and tomatoes and lacked a lot of flavor. The Southtown mule was okay, but I could mostly taste the ice and ginger beer.   Positives: great location, indoor and outdoor seating  Negatives: food lacking flavor, okay service, watered down drinks"

Finally, I saw a server and asked. It's self seating. She said take a picture of the bar menu then sit wherever . I asked for a sample of beer but it was warm so that didn't work. I thought for sure I'd be offered some suggestions for beer/drinks since this is a \"brewery\" but nope. I randomly guessed (server wasn't helpful). to snack on, I ordered the garlic and parsley fries. Absolutely the worst. No flavor what so ever. I had to ask for salt. Soggy too.   The atmosphere is nice. I sat outside. If I do come back, I'll just keep my expectations low so I won't be disappointed again. The food isn't pricey at all but I guess it really shouldn't be based on my dry experience ‍"

Good food from a varied menu that has generous portions--and the taste that will knock your socks off (even if you wear sandals).   Depending on your drink preferences and what's in season, you should try what's on tap. You have refreshing and traditional, the raspberry geyser and the King William Ale that are San Antonio's best.   Go now!"

                "description": "The Texas Rangers: Facts you may not know     It's the oldest law enforcement agency in North America. Stephen F. Austin organized the 1st group of 10 Texas Rangers in 1823. They were farmers and ranchers.   They became known as \"Los Diablos Tejanos,\" meaning Texas Devils.  In the early days, Rangers would have to dismount their horses to reload their muzzleloaders. In an effort to be more efficient, they began using the 5-shot revolver (invented by Samuel Colt).  There are honorary Texas Rangers: John Wayne, Will Rogers, President George H.W. Bush and Chuck Norris.   In honor of the department's 180th anniversary in 2004, a Texas Ranger badge was carried into space on the Endeavor Space Shuttle Mission by Col. Paul Lockhart.  The first badges came from cutting a star into a Mexican silver coin. This was a way of showing dominance over Mexico. The nickname for the Texas Ranger badge is Cinco Peso.  Ranger Frank Hamer teamed up with local law enforcement from Texas and Louisiana and is responsible for ambushing and killing Bonnie and Clyde.   Texas Rangers Have Prevented at Least One Presidential Assassination, in 1909, when US President William Howard Taft met with Mexican President Porfirio Diaz in El Paso, Texas.   In World War II, the German press mistakenly reported that the Army Rangers were Texas Rangers. This caused some panic among German civilians, due to the fearsome reputation of the Texas Rangers. Finally, the public was told the invaders were \"only\" Army Rangers. The average age of a Texas Ranger is 44."

There is a big bar here, but it was pretty early and we headed to the museum  right of the bat.  There are like 1,000 stuffed taxidermy animals here. It was crazy, but pretty cool I don't know if I would be happy if I paid more than $10 here, but they also have a place of circus freaks and some fun circus oddities, like ledges you can stand on, while they look like they are on diagonal planes, you can still stand straight on them.  Fun little place to spend a half hour walking through and pretty close to the Alamo."

My two cents on the museum.....  I'm glad I didn't pay money to see it.....  While there is an amazing amount taxidermy displays... that's all it is... and while they are impressive. That's all it is. Maybe it's just me but.... Umm no thank you. It's just not what I want to see room after room of stuffed bears and lions and snakes.

I didn't realize you had to order your food at a counter and have the food brought to you. I was on vacation with my family and inlaws and thought it was a full service restaurant. I asked if they wanted to eat somewhere else but they said it was fine. The lady at the counter, Rebecca, was very friendly and funny. The kind of employee that makes your customers feel welcomed. We ordered our food and found a table to sit.  My husband ordered a drink from the bar. We did not go into the museum but the dining area was amazing. Food was pretty good. Our burgers was very moist and tasty. The fries and sweet potatoes fries was excellent. My daughter liked the coconut shrimps. Only disappointment was the calamari. There was more deep fried breading and small amount of calamari inside. We did complain and was immediately given a refund, which is great business.  If you don't mind having to order at a counter, I would recommend coming door lunch here and check it out."

                "description": "I visited April 2 with a 6 year old. We initially came and ate lunch after getting off the Hop off Hop on bus tour. You have to order food at the counter and then find a spot. The food was descent. I had BBQ Brisket which I really enjoyed and my son had a burger which he did not eat. But, it didn't look bad. The restaurant area has a ton of charm, a lot of history and a cool long bar. Bathrooms in the back with some arcade games and good old fashion shooting game.  We were not certain about doing the museum as I did not think my son would like it if it was a bunch of stuffed dead animals. I asked the guy the guy that worked at the restaurant and he said a lot of kids liked it, so why not? We were there. It was a bit pricey, but ended up being worth the cost. It was a pretty large place and doesn't even appear to be that big from the outside. We spent a ton of time inside and didn't even really see anyone else.  They do have a LOT of dead stuffed animals lol. But they also have a lot of interesting historical items such as furniture, guns, etc. It is actually two levels too. Our favorite area was this area of \"show freaks\" as they had shrunken heads, mermaid fish, two headed animals, fleas with clothes, etc. I'm pretty sure one of those shrunken heads looked like my ex-husband, or at least in my dreams it did.  It was really fun. They also have some interactive type exhibits that you can walk in, like tilted rooms. Interesting stuff."

The food was great and you will get a discount on the museum if you eat there. The museum has two main sections. The first part shows all the taxidermied animals, a circus show and mystery town exhibit. The lower level shows the Texas Ranger museum with a mini replica of a town. I personally liked the first part a bit more but both were good. Parking can be hard finding a paid lot so be aware."

Stepping inside, you're immediately welcomed by a huge high-ceiling room with walls covered in taxidermy. As a hunter myself, I thought it was very awesome to see that collection. I couldn't not sit at the bar and grab a delicious local brew (lots of options) while I admired the art. I didn't go into the actually museum but it looked worthwhile.  Yes, the big elephant (which seems to be the centerpiece) is real and is from the 1960's."

                "description": "2019 Yelp 120 Challenge - #100  On our Hop on Hop off tour the Buckhorn Saloon was one of the stops. It said that shortly after opening The Buckhorn Saloon, Albert learned that many folks traveling off the dusty trail didn't have much money. The owner Albert had the great idea to accept horns and antlers in exchange for a free beer or a shot of whiskey from his saloon.   Now the Buckhorn collection has grew to become one of the world's most unique and largest collections of horns and antlers. The impressive horn and antler collection lined every wall and ceiling, which is why it is known as the Buckhorn Hall of Horns. Now different antlers are hung above the entry way to different exhibits.   Cost: You will receive $3 off with a Yelp check-in.  Each ticket is roughly $20 each and you get two exhibits for the price of one.   My husband and I opted out of going into the exhibits and grabbed to cold beers from the bar. It would have been cool if they still accepted antlers or horns in exchange for a local drink from the bar."

There was a blues band setting up while we were resting and the little bit we heard was quite enjoyable.  The beer was $9 but I guess that is riverwalk prices.    As hunters, it was cool to check out all the different mounts as well as all the antlers."

It's only three stars because we had multiple issues while we were bowling. Our balls wouldn't come back to us and the pins would not come back after the fallen pins were cleaned up.   The manager eventually fixed all the issues and gave us extra time for us to bowl. I will bowl there again and see if the service improves. It's $30 an hour to bowl and shoe rentals cost you $6. If you are in the area check them out to see how things goes for you."

We were greeted at the front promptly and escorted to our lane by Sal who introduced us to our server Anthony. Anthony was very attentive and had great suggestions for food and drinks. We enjoyed the pizza I highly recommend it if you like Grimaldis this pizza is way better ! We started with spinach dip and fries that were tasty ! Burgers in a bag were a hit with the kids bacon Mayo is delish. Anthony suggested ranch water for a refreshing drink and it did not disappoint. I highly recommend Bowl And Barrel for the food and service !  Not to mention we had the managers come by twice to check on us we were very pleased. We can't wait to go back !"

Pizza took 2 hours before it was serviced, missing foods from our order.  The worst part is that they bowl by the hours and does not tell you.  They lied and told me I had to pay for an addition hour with the kids bowl promo but then also told us we timed up.  At the end we didn't get to bowl our 2nd game.  What a gimmick! If you want to run a business based one lies, then so be it.  Every dog has its days."

I placed a food order at the beginning of my 1.5h reservation with my waitress who failed to write my order down after attempting to write my order on her hand but her pen didn't work, she had a pocket full of other pens, mind you. I never received my food. I was with a group of people and instead of splitting our bill as requested, the waitress decided to split the tab however the computer did it, not giving anyone an itemized receipt after charging our cards. I had one drink at the bar prior to starting to bowl and was charged $7. I ordered 2 of the same drink while bowling and some how my bill was $27. I'm no math genius but that clearly just doesn't add up. If you want to be charged correctly and to receive good service, this isn't the place for you."

Be warned, the website does not have pricing, and the bottles (no by-the-glass business) starts at $68ish. They do have 4 pre-selected wines you can taste for $20pp unless you buy 3+ bottles of wine, then the tasting is waived.  We were thinking \"uh-oh\" based on the prices when we arrived but holy dang! Nothing like we've tasted before! Totally brag-worthy! The owner greets you and gives you all the info- his place he built from items from the land, his story (if you want to read it..regarding France) and just his history on wine. A super cool place, super relaxing and QUIET and just amazing! Go inside to look at all his cool collectibles from around the world. He's even teamed up with Jester King! Ask him!  You don't want to miss this place! It's truly delightful, but bring your deep pockets, and they DO take card!  *no kids or pets allowed"

                "description": "What an amazing, hidden gem near Canyon Lake! First, all the wines are made by natural fermentation (aka natural wine) with organic grapes- this winery is even featured in a Natural Wines book. The owner is so friendly and also has the sweetest dog. The decor is unique, interesting, and definitely sets a mood. The wine is delicious- we had a bottle of the \"on-site-only\" Lambrusco Pet-Nat, and we bought a couple others to-go. All the local websites were advertising Dry Comal Creek as the only local winery (and I'm sure it's great), but we stumbled upon La Cruz de Comal because Dry Comal closed at 5 and La Cruz was still open until 6pm. We will DEFINITELY be back for more organic, natural wine!"

So mad when our family members open the paper wrap. The corks on both bottle are soaking wet and cracked. The wines tasted nasty. 1 bottle (supposed to be sweet) taste like nasty medicine. The other one is red wine,  taste like someone opened it for a long time and then put the cork back, we didn't want to drink it anymore even it cost us money. Because it was so nasty. I can't believe it."

The tasting room looks like a little cottage nestled in the French countryside.   The owner/winemaker, Lewis, is a piece of work. One of the most intelligent and yet one of the most obscure and eclectic people I have ever met. A true pleasure to meet and chat with.   Do yourself a favor. Check out the hours and plan to visit this little piece of heaven. You will be thrilled and so glad you did.   I highly recommend!!"

                "description": "On our hunt to visit a unique winery in the hill country of Texas, we found La Cruz de Comal. When we drove in, right away we noticed the winery's main building and it felt like we were in France. It is an authentic European building, small and cozy and welcoming!  The owner was there to serve his 100% estate grown grapes which boast of no additional acid, sugar or sulfites to his wine. The owner, who is a retired lawyer, Mr. Dickson, calls his wine, \"real wine.\" We tasted four wines and our favorite was the port, it had a smooth and delightful finish. There also is a sweet winery dog who loves to visit with the customers...we had a relaxing time there and would recommend it to anyone who wants to taste \"Real wine.\""

                "description": "I decided to take a trip and visit this place. I researched all the vineyards nearby but this place not only had the highest reviews, it seemed to have a nice scenery. The interior and exterior has french touches to it and you can tell each piece was well thought out.   Now the wine.... my husband and I FELL IN LOVE. At first the prices seemed to be pricey but once you do the wine tasting, you'll know why. The wine is so pure and has so much grace you have to walk out with at least a bottle (we bought three). I like wine but I'll only drink one glass because I get dizzy but when I went hope my husband and I both finished a bottle. The wine here has no sulfites and you can just taste the purity of the grapes.   Pricing: When you buy three wines the tasting fee is waived for one person ($15). The owner gave us a discount so after one wine tasting fee and 3 bottles of wine we paid around $160.   The interior is just lovely here you can just tell each piece in the room was placed there for a reason. The bathroom outside looked very old so I was very hesitant to use it but one you go in it is so cute and was not uncomfortable at all.   So, overall this place was an excellent experience!"

                "description": "The winery is very nice but the wine is terrible. I have had some wonderful wines all over the states and in other countries. It is very obvious the owner should have stuck to being a lawyer. I understand the all natural thing. But it was awful. I tried to like even one of them or even find something interesting about at least one. With all of the time spent in Napa Valley and in France you would have thought the wines would at least be palatable. The only thing I can figure out is most of the reviewers don't drink wine. And if your thinking about going to see for yourself...I'm being nice in my descriptions."

                "description": "I love everything about this place! It's a hidden gem tucked away in the hills just south of Canyon Lake.  Lewis, the owner, is a former big-time defense attorney in Houston who found his calling to be one with the grapes and wine. Listening to him wax poetically about what he's doing differently at his vineyard gives you insight into what you're about to experience. He's also a hoot!   Instead of using commercial yeast, the wines ferment from wild yeast/bacteria on the grapes and whatever bacteria is in the HillCo air. This gives the wines an obvious farmhouse character (mild funk/horsey, slightly sour). He doesn't filter so the wines are a bit hazy and have some sediment/yeast on the bottom.   Grapes are either grown on-site or purchased from farms in the Hill Country and they don't add sulfites.  If you like traditional wines, you might not enjoy the wines that much but I still think it's worth a visit.  Tasting: $15 for 6 samples Bottles: Range from $25-$60 Times: Tasting room is open on Sat and Sun from 12p-6pm. What we bought: a bottle of Rose.  The tasting room is an adorable limestone building and the vineyard can be seen from the windows.   If you can't make it to the vineyard, Jester King Brewery just started carrying their wines in its taproom! It's a match made in heaven! Wild yeast for everyone!"

The tasting pours were generous and we enjoyed learning about the differences between their preparation methods versus the larger, more commercial vineyards.  I have to assume it's those differences that led to such pleasant flavors.  I've always been a red guy but found the first white I've enjoyed here.  Another first, I could really discern the various ingredients/flavors in each glass of wine, and the reds didn't have that strong bite to them.  I've been to Napa and Senoma, as well as France and Italy, and I just haven't ever enjoyed the taste of wine as much as I did during our trip to this little winery."

                "description": "We just left and I'm SO confused... I don't know how our experience can be so different from all the other Yelp reviews. We just parked, shared a tasting and left in about 15 minutes because we felt kind of unwelcome and found the wines to be awful. And we wanted desperately to love this place, because it is GORGEOUS. I'd have been very easy to please to be able to spend time in this beautiful place. But the owner was kind of frosty, barely spoke to us (but was more vocal with others), didn't tell us anything (not even the names) about any of the wines. I complimented him effusively on the place when we first got there and tried to get him to chat during the tasting, but he didn't thaw. I don't know if we made him mad because we chose to share a tasting?? We would've gotten a glass or two once we found a wine we liked. We felt like we weren't wanted, which when you're sitting at the little wine counter right in front of the guy, is really uncomfortable. I could've ignored all that if one of the wines worked for us, but I hate to say it, we thought all 4 were terrible. We drink a lot of wine, not cheap or sweet ones, and none of these tasted like anything we've ever had before. I'm confused that every other reviewer LOVED them and we had such an opposite reaction. We are at a loss for the experience we just had. The winery is so so beautiful though, it rivals CA wineries. So bummed. :("

It came with a red cabbage slaw that really surprised me at how good it was as that's not a thing I usually like.  Only minus- I'd like to see more microbrews on tap. There are at least 3 breweries in New Braunfels and only one represented here when I went. There's a good selection of German imports but I'd really like to see more Texas beer on tap. If they need to stick with the German theme there's plenty of German style beer from Texas. Fredericksburg is not that far from here."

                "description": "This is a must stop place for us every time we're in New Braunfels! We've been for brunch, lunch, and to enjoy beers and apps. Honestly, my favorite time to come is for brunch, especially when it's nice enough to sit outside. The ambiance is amazing: brews, live music, and great brunch! Our first time here was for a Mother's Day brunch, which we were fortunate enough to enjoy wonderful weather and got to sit outside and hear some live music! Their avocado toast is delicious: kale, sprouts, and eggs however you like them. It's perfect if you like healthier fare. Some of the skillets and schnitzels are more popular, but I'd honestly get the avocado toast again as it was THAT good.   We most recently came here for my brother-in-law's birthday dinner and really enjoyed it! For starters, the service is amazing. We showed up with cakes, cupcakes, and an ice chest full of ice cream. The wait was an hour long, but they sat us quickly when they realized how much stuff we had brought. They kept the cake in the fridge for us and provided candles and a lighter, which was super nice and helpful! The service alone is reason enough to come back: they truly go above and beyond. For dinner, I ordered the grilled salmon and my husband had the TX BBQ shrimp. My salmon was cooked perfectly and I really enjoyed the potatoes! The shrimp was amazing - I wish I'd ordered it! It had a good amount of heat to it as it also has andouille sausage. It's definitely worth ordering!  As a side note, this place can get PACKED on any given weekend and doesn't take reservations. Something to keep in mind during peak hours if you're coming starving. Overall, can't recommend this place enough if you're stopping in New Braunfels. It's truly a must-do!"

Definitely very popular. The outdoor seating is ginormous! You could tell they were busy but still Emilia, the manager , who was acting as hostess and all around hands on, was very sweet accommodating all who came to her. She was very quick to meet everyone's needs.   I sat at the bar, thanks to Emilia (the first waitress I encountered at the bar was very rude and actually told me there was a wait for the bar and I needed to se Emilia... she was wrong, bar's open seating as in all places). Cynthia ended up being my server. She was wonderful and quick to take my order and check on me for drinks, etc.   They were out of the Wiener schnitzel, which was the reason I originally went, so it was very disappointing. While the ambiance and space and food were great, I was a bit disappointed at the fact that they didn't have such a signature dish so early in the day (noon). I ended up getting a jager schnitzel which felt a bit dry / over fried, but the mushroom sauce was delicious! It was tasty but I'll have to go back and see if it was just bad luck. The fingerling potatoes were well seasoned and delicious. I don't eat boiled cabbage or sauerkraut, but I tasted it and seemed pretty authentic.   They did have quite a varied menu of both food and drinks and most of the waiters and waitresses seemed to be very on top of service. I'll definitely be back in hopes of getting a Wiener schnitzel and maybe try a few other items."

Others at table were hit so clearly they did bad job of coordinating the food.  Was so frustrated and hungry just ate it.  How they redeem themselves i future.   Never coming in weekend again."

Mustard is NOT our favorite condiment.  One day (a couple years ago) we took the plunge and went to the German food mostly restaurant.  YUM!!   But good news turns to even better news!  Krause's is also a biergarten and boy can it be fun!  Hop onto krausescafe.com and see what I mean."

BEST sausage we've had in TEXAS!! As a meal we had the spinach apple salad, felt like the salad could've had more apples but all was fresh and ranged beautifully. Steak sandwich was amazing- the bread itself was so tasty, steak cooked to perfection and arugula was fresh!"

                "description": "Was here for spring break and my dad wanted German food. There are lots of advertisements and lots of praise for this establishment. Esthetics is pleasing with a nice outdoor/indoor seating. Our server was less than attentive and clearly did not want to be there. Starters we went for the pretzel, break and cheese sauce was great but there was a film of fried cheese on top. Clearly been under the heat lamp since lunch. My daughter and dad decided to get the schnitzel and I had steak frites. The schnitzel was cold and dry and my steak was clearly spoiled meat! After staring down the server for 30 minutes and waving him over for the chart we was forced to leave a tip per the server due to the credit card machine. It was such a bad experience that my dad didn't even want to try the other German food in the area. Clearly this is just a drinks appetizer establishment."

                "description": "We had to try a German restaurant in New Braunfels and everyone said this is the place to go. They have a huge outdoor Biergarten and even the \"indoor\" Bierhalle is essentially outdoor, with mesh walls and sky high ceilings. Dogs are not only allowed, but encouraged, both in the Biergarten and the Bierhalle. There were several there when we visited and they were all very well behaved.   We ordered a ton of food here, and liked all of it. I'm not usually a fan of shoestring fries, but the ones here were perfectly cooked and seasoned. The broccoli was also prepared perfectly, not over or under cooked. The red cabbage was pickled, making for a unique but very good dish. The Apple fritters were the highlight of the evening. More closely resembling a corn fritter than the Apple fritters you would get at a donut shop, they were crispy on the outside, soft inside and came with a delectable dipping sauce.   A couple of complaints. The live music (a Biergarten staple) was WAY too loud. We had to lean right up to each other's ears to talk to one another. Also, although our main course came surprisingly fast, we had to wait forever for the dessert."

                "description": "This is my second time visiting this restaurant and the rating it has on here fits it well. It is not horrible but not overly fantastic. I can see this as a place to hang out with friends for a beer and finger foods.   The day we went there was a farmer's market so we were occupied while we waited the 45 minutes it took to get a table. I am guessing COVID restrictions play part in this, which is fine. The beers are good! I lived in Germany (Heidelberg, Ketch, and Kaiserslautern) for over 12 years and my husband is French and German, born and raised in Schweinfurt, Germany. Going to German restaurants are a treat for us because we like to compare American German restuarnt to the originals. All American German restuarnat cater to the Bavaria region of Germany and this one does a great job mixing both American and German style foods.   I had the Texas schnitel, which I did not care that much for. My husband had the German meatball which was amazing. The brussel sprouts are some of the best I've tasted since moving here.   In all, this is a fun place to hang out with friends and family. They have live music, which I would have hoped was traditional German, but hey! I do see myself visiting a third time."

We came from SA to have dinner as family and go float lanterns in the river on the anniversary of my mothers death. It was a special day and there was a two hour wait.

The food is amazing, service impeccable and the drinks are great! Thank you again!"

Restaurant is adorable - love the location right by everything - super easy to walk to a bakery or around downtown   3. The food is DELICIOUS. From the rye bread, the schnitzels and sausages, and ESPECIALLY the black forest cake. Seriously, the best I've ever had.    Cons:   1. They run out of the Black Forest cake. Seriously. I went here on my birthday, and they run out of it at the beginning of the week usually. And it's REALLY the best. I hope they start making MOOOOREEE!   2. It's a little pricey, but the portions are huge and sharing is definitely easy."

Picked this place and really enjoyed the service and selection of items!  The rye bread was really great! Then I had garlic soup that was good. The Wife wanted to try the sausage sampler. They had the spicy mustard I like. The only problem I had is, I've never had jalapeño sausage in Germany!! Not my thing.  Then I had the Rinder Goulash that was really great, the Wife had Huhnerbrust Geschnetzeltes. Chicken breast with sautéed spinach with mushrooms that was good as well!  I really like the place. I wish Yelp allowed 3 1/2 stars. Would I go back, you bet!"

Firstly the series's great. The waitress was friendly and the place very clean. Beautiful ambiance perfect for a date or a couples dinner night. The food was good both my girls and husband agree it was yummy. All of our food came correct and hot. The beer was cold and the bread was fresh. Something to note while this is not a dress up place it's easy to feel under dressed. Also, this is a great place to try new things but the price is high and the options limited. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a quiet dinner with good food. As far as the food it was a little salty but flavorful. The sausage mustard was to die for and the red cabbage was absolutely delicious. We left full and satisfied."

The waiter is amazingly, I do appreciate him check on us and food is on the spot ! I am Chef ....   However,  if Chef Ramsay were here. He will said first thing out his mouth is taking away the scents. It's need to remove and allow the smell from the kitchen brew it."

The food and service were wonderful, and much better than many of the other local German haunts.    I HIGHLY suggest trying this one out.    Excellent food, excellent service, and the young man who was playing the accordion around the restaurant was wonderful too!  Get yourself a reservation first, preferably!"

                "description": "This little cottage restaurant has the potential to be a absolutely great German restaurant. However, it has a little house work to do to get there. No doubt it has the charming ambience and Great German food of the best restaurants in the country.   Here is a list of minor items that needs to take care of first.  1. A vase of plastic flowers on the tables needs to have real flowers. 2. The bread needs to be changed to a better hearty German bread instead of the white bread with brown swirls. 3. Do not simply dump a small pile of foil-wrap butter pads, but have a real butter server with the bread. 4. The service on a Sunday afternoon was deplorable. The young man probably was a student from TSU in nearby San Marcos, working on weekends to make a little money for college. He did not repeat the orders from the four of us and therefore our food came all mixed up. He never thought to refill any of our drinks until we finally ask him to. He was a nice of guy  but just not trained to be a true sophisticated food server like this little restaurant deserves.  By the way, having a young singer with real lederhosen amble through the dining rooms singing German songs with his accordion was brilliant. This restaurant is truly a little gem that simply needs to be polished."

                "description": "Always a pleasure to visit the Alpine Haus in New Braunfels.  I lived in Germany over 12 years and the Alpine Haus has some of the best German food I have discovered stateside.  They are short a baker so they are short on desserts especially their Black Forest cake which the time I had a piece it was spectacular.  I have been told if you go during the week they typically have desserts.  If you enjoy authentic prepared and tasting German cuisine then this is your spot.  Ask for Katherine as your server.  She was friendly, attentive and very knowledgeable.  Bon Appetite and Geschmack gut."

                "description": "The food we ordered a sausage plate was decent.  The atmosphere is nice in the restaurant. The reason for two stars is we were charged $7.50 for a split plate charge which normally includes the sides on both plates. Nope we were given a empty plate! The waiter should have advised us of this and told us for a few dollars more we could have ordered the sausage appetizer. I wrote them to seek a reply but they never responded to their form on their webpage."

                "description": "We've always loved Anchor bar, despite the wait. This time was different. We waited for a table even though there was plenty of seating available. But, we understood, staff was probably short. It's happening everywhere. As we were walked to our table the hostess walked to a particular table and just stood there, not saying anything then just simply walked off without acknowledging us.  We had to walk over to her and ask if this was our table. She responded yes. It was just strange. We were greeted promptly by the waiter asking if we were here to eat. I guess that wasnt expected because we weren't sitting at the bar. We thought, well yeah...We ordered and waited a while for drinks and placed our order. The food came out cold. Soon after, we were approached by who we thought was a manager. They offered us a free sampler platter for the wait and asked if the food was okay. We told her the food was cold. They promptly took our food and gave us new hot food.  We were impressed because we didn't complain, but it was like they read our mind. We will definitely return, even if this visit was different than others. Thanks anchor bar!"

                "description": "Visited this past Thursday on St Patty's day around 5:30. Service has definitely gone downhill. The hostess need to be trained to smile and be polite to customers. We weren't greeted when we first walked in. Both of them didn't look up to say anything. We hung out waiting to check in (they weren't attending any customers). They finally checked us in and we requested outside. 5 minutes later, the older hostess walks us outside and tried to seat us on the table under the trees (she said three words the entire time). They were all dusty, dirty, and rusted. Why would she try to seat us there when no one else was sitting in the area and there were other tables available?! We requested a different table. She sat us down without utensils, little plates or napkins. Waitress stopped and service was good from here on.   Thank you Reese and other female waitress that were super nice and engaging."

I said we gotta go in there and off I went!!! I was upset over another incident... (look at my review) Any who I quickly forgot that when I open the doors!!!!  First things first...it's in a strip mall type of area and although it has a lot of space...the parking quickly started to decline because everyone and I do mean EVERYONE in the area was over that this spot having a GREAT TIME!!!....There is a bar in there and loads of table space...if you don't like being social..you won't like this place...its build for the FRIENDLY...if your lonely or in need of some cheering up...GO THERE..someone's going to say hello or at least ask you if you want a drink lol...Unfortunately I wasn't there to stay so I ordered to go BUT I was pleasantly surprised being that It was not on the agenda to stop here. I decided to buy some wings of different variety and a large barbecue pizza. In some areas to include the front. It's a bit dim so it was a little hard for me to see the menu but otherwise it was fine...It a bit noisy BUT again this is a place of joy and happiness so YES, they are taking full advantage of being happy! The wings were nice and hot...tasted pretty good.... pizza was thin crusted and cheeeeeeeeeesy...not overbearing with sauce..just the way I LOVE it! Would I go back? definitely and what the heck...bring an ENTOURAGE of people with you....the more the merrier I always say! thumbs up!"

OMG - this is now my only place for wings.   Ruben the chef was on the floor throughout our meal ensuring we were happy. We were. Service was great despite a small mix-up (we ordered all flats and got mixed) however, the server took responsibility and made it right.   Only critique would be the hostesses. No one acknowledged us when we walked in and we literally stood at the host stand waiting.   Once we found our own seats Westley immediately got us drinks and Noah took our order. Several check backs were done which is a huge plus.   You must try this place!"

You could feel the energy in the establishment. All good, very jovial vibe.    If you find yourself in the area, decide to drop in! You must try the Anchor Bar Dip! Like a mix of queso with blue cheese. Don't try to understand just eat and enjoy.    Drinks were cold and blended with the right amount of alcohol.  So good we had 2 each.     I had the lemon pepper wings. Wow! Loved the crispy lemon pepper wings. Hot and spiced perfectly.  The fries were hot right out of the fryer! I feet compelled to eat all the fries.   Spouse had the Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich. Fresh baked bread, and tasty meat with fresh bell peppers.    The only issue we had was the lack of service. May have been due to the busy night.   Waited awhile for water refills, drinks  and bill.    Overall great place. May return during a slow night."

                "description": "I've been here a few times and every time has been delightful.  Unfortunately, I have only one picture of a Bloody Mary to memorialize or summarize all the great food I've had here.  more pictures needed  The chips and queso are always a winner in my book. The queso pairs well with chips, pizza, tots, and wedges.   The queso isn't super spicy so we like to add more jalapenos to the mix. The wedges were super addictive. Nicely fried and seasoned. I'm sure the tots would have been the same, but I couldn't eat any more potatoes.   The habanero ranch lime wings. Those are amazing. So yummy, I'm practically drooling as I think about them. Again, not too spicy, so if you want the heat you might need to ask them to increase it for you. I also really like the garlic parmesan wings, this is actually my favorite flavor, but I'm fairly certain that the HRL has taken the top spot.   Last night we tried a roast beef sandwich. It was ok. The bread was super salty, almost to the point that I couldn't eat it. However, I noticed it was primarily on top of the bread so I just took it off the bread. I probably wouldn't order that again. I'll stick to the queso, wings, and pizza.   I had the pizza back in January. It was fabulous, especially the next day. I loved the crust and I'm not usually a fan of bready crusts.   For dessert, we took caramel churros back home for later. I can only imagine the bliss of eating them warm on site. Those were some damn good churros. Overflowing with caramel and served with vanilla ice cream and an additional drizzle of caramel. It was dreamy!  Oh yeah and so the Bloody Mary. I never knew I liked pickled green beans until last weekend. Maybe I can get a bowl of them as an appetizer next time I'm there.  Omg I'm a jerk for not mentioning the amazing service. Table service and bar service has always been on point. Everyone there is attentive and honestly they have always gotten our order right. This is important because I've been there with a picky....*ahem* specific orderer. Thank you for being patient and pleasant!"

                "description": "Considering I've eaten at the original location in Buffalo (#1), it admittedly feels strange (yet exciting) to have the option to do so in San Antonio. It is a very different feel but is still a very solid choice for some serious comfort food.  First off, this place is massive. It really doesn't look that big from the outside but there is ample seating and different party rooms. The parking is also abundant and they have a playground right out front for the youngins. This is a place where I would definitely consider hosting a large gathering (#2).  I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised by the food. Everything I ate was a gut bomb, but in the best way. Everything from the burgers, mac and cheese, tater tots, loaded appetizers, and the wings were quite tasty. The portions are excellent and this would be an ideal spot for a very big eater.  The real unfortunate thing is there is a wing shortage, and as a result the prices were a bit on the high side. Nothing's cheap during the pandemic but the quality of the food doesn't necessarily always coincide with the price.  Service is ok but not phenomenal. In dining service seems to be the way to go, even if I'm not entirely sure if the staff is fully masked up. Phone manners were a little suspect in the wait for my take out was a lot longer than I anticipated. In the end, I'm still happy I found this place and look forward to trying it again.  __________ (#1) Where I learned the origin of a \"buffalo wing.\"  (#2) Once the pandemic is over, naturally."

The wings were nice and crisp, but flavorless even with the dry rub that was included on the side.  The wedges, well...those we simply threw away as they were not fully cooked yet were very soggy.  As for the side Ceasar salad...there was no dressing on it and none on the side.  It was also all the yellow leaves and the hard backs.  Nothing in there was green so that too was tossed away.  We've eaten in before and always enjoyed it.  This was a huge disappointment and we will not order from here again."

The flavor choices are plentiful and I no longer have to wait forever at Pluckers for a table and the wings here are not dry!  The pizza is huge and feeds my teens and 2 adults easily!  Wings are really good especially the Ranch rub and garlic parm with blue cheese which isn't the best but the wings make up for that. If you request celery and carrots, just know you only get 2 small carrot pieces and 2 teeny celery pieces The waitress on our last visit was not real good at keeping our drinks filled, we had to ask for refills, boxes but she was very quick to bring the check and cone back to cash it out.  Also, we were asked to sit at the end of the long bar table top instead of an actual table and there were 5 of us. We enjoyed the NBA final game 4 though with 360° views all around! It was awesome My patty melt was perfect too."

                "description": "We visited tonight for our first time this year and had a great time and amazing service. We were seated right away even though it seemed pretty busy. It looked like they have added a ton of outdoor seating, but it was a bit cold tonight. I don't know how authentic this location is to the original, but we went their a few years ago and have an affinity to the brand. Get the blue cheese!  I got a single order(10) hot and my wife got a snack size(5) medium. Both had a good mix of drumettes and flats. I added wedges, she got tots. The wings and potatoes were all nice and crispy and came with carrots and celery with no up charge.   They have a full bar and the beer is either big brand or local craft, with a good selection of draft and bottles/cans. They also had a lot of specialty mixed drinks, but we like beer with wings. The beers were all around $5 or less from what I looked at.   The booths all had extra plexiglass dividers between them, the tables had plastic sheets on plastic stands, and there was a self service temperature scanner by the door, but we didn't see that until on the way out. Each table had a placard with QR codes for the drink and food menus."

                "description": "SECURITY GUARD, FORAN, IS A RACIST PIG.  I have been here a couple times with my friends. It was super chill. But tonight my friend and I went. We were dancing with these random Haitian girls and this RUDE security guard, Foran, walked up and said control your friend or get out. I was trying to understand what was going on. I don't know the girls or what happened before we got there. So I asked him \"what was going on\" and \"what are you talking about?\" All he kept saying was \"control your friend or leave.\" And he told her she had to sit down or get out. There was no explanation or anything. The more I tried to understand the meaner and more aggressive he got.  On my way out, I walked up to him and said \"hey we were just having a good time dancing. I don't know those girls or what happened before I got there but you were very mean and aggressive. You don't have to be a that mean. I was just trying to figure out what was going on and why we couldn't dance\" he said \"I don't go to your job telling you how to work, don't come to mine to tell me.\" And then he told the other guys near him \"don't let them back in.\" Referring to me and my friend I went there with.  I definitely won't return. Foran didn't say a word to the white girls that were also dancing."

It can get crowded, depending on which day you go, which is mainly Saturday night, and that wasn't very pleasant. They do have issues with keeping the soap and paper towels stocked. They have a food truck that usually serves chicken wings, pork chops, and sometimes tacos and egg rolls and sides like green beans, mac and cheese, etc. Overall it is a good time and a nice place to go."

                "description": "This is a pretty dirty looking bar. The Crawfish boils they put on are ridiculous. There were about 80 people here last Sunday for the $15 AYCE deal. Each time you get in line there are no less than 30 people in line. This went on for 3 hrs from the open at 2. By the way they were 45 mins late from the advertised start serving time.  Anyway, they give you one little french fry tray at a time (about 1/2 a lb of actual crawfish). The average grown Louisianan or hungry Texan can eat 5 lbs. That would be 10 trips at this rate.  After 4 trips, I gave up. I actually ate about 2 lbs for the $15. No difference than going to one of the local restaurants. I heard the day before for the Saturday boil, one man ate 23 trays.  I was also mad at the size of the Crawfish they were known as field runs, the tiniest ones with absolute zero tail meat. Besides my very first tray which was hot and delicious all the rest or cold to lukewarm.   I won't be back to this place. This place just seems like an overhyped sloppily run Place with music and DJs. The restrooms were filthy."

                "description": "This is a Crawfish Boil only review. We visited for All You Can Eat Crawfish on Sunday. We got there just before 1:30 PM and it's supposed to start at 2 PM, but it didn't get rolling until after 2:30 PM. It's $15/person (you pick up your wristband at the bar). It's supposed to include sausage, mini corn cobs, and potatoes. The sausage was in 1\" pieces and the potatoes were sliced (not the little whole red potatoes you might expect). There were also bits of pineapple in it, for some reason. It can catch you off guard if you think it's an onion and you're not expecting something sweet. It was really dark inside the bar, so it was hard to tell at first, but there weren't actually any onions, so we figured it out pretty quickly. There isn't any shaded seating outside, which is why we ate inside. The owner indicated that he would be installing a shade awning, so there will be improvement there shortly.  The crawfish was very spicy, which we liked. Every portion I got came out hot, so no issues there. Each person with a wristband has to stand in line. They'll only give you 1 little tray at a time, which you can eat in about a minute, so it was a little annoying to hardly get any crawfish and then have to go stand in line again for 10 minutes to get another little dish of it. They need to get the bigger trays and hand it out in at least 1-2# portions plus the sides.  After our second tray each, they were already out of sausage and they hadn't been serving for very long. I didn't get any potatoes in trays 5-6, but I'm not sure if that's because they were out or I was just unlucky. After our 2nd ear of corn each, we were saying \"no corn,\" so I'm not sure how long those lasted.  We stood in line for what felt like forever on our last trip - they had stopped serving at one point (presumably to take a break). I left my fiance at the front of the line and I went back to the table. I got 2 new cups of water, and I peeled the heads off a tray of crawfish. They weren't providing anything to put your trash in, so it was just piled up in the middle of the tiny table. I had to find a trash can to toss all the trash, then went to the restroom. While I was in there for a whole 2 minutes, someone decided to bus the table - trashing the 2 new cups of water, the tray of crawfish tails, and a tray of corn and potatoes. Who tf does that?? Super frustrating.  After that BS and standing in lines longer than eating crawfish, we decided to leave. We'd been there for 3 hours (half of that was waiting for the thing to start though). We only ended up eating 12 trays total, which was probably 5-6# of crawfish. I got 2 little ears of corn, and the equivalent of about 1 large potato, and maybe 0.25# of sausage. We felt like we at least got what we paid for, but we probably won't go back there. There are places that are better organized for the crowd and they don't run out of sides in the first half hour.  Note: you can also get chicken-on-a-stick for $6, but it's just frozen, breaded chicken fingers that they skewer and cook.They have remoulade for dipping (tastes ok) and Slap Ya Mama seasoning to dump on everything. The Revolver draught beer we were picking was $5 each, but it wasn't as cold as it should have been. We still got 3 of those though!"

                "description": "Beer and Crawfish!  I've never really heard of a crawfish bar, but this place has it going on! With a name like Bentley's, it's not as fancy and pretentious as you'd think it'd be. A name like Bentley's made me picture a place covered in marble serving Grey Poupon and caviar. This place is quite the opposite.  It's a dark bar with loud music inside. Sometimes, they bring in a band to play on a little stage that they have set up. They have a bunch of craft beers, many of which are somewhat hard to find. I don't think they have a single beer on draft- only bottles and cans.  The best feature of this bar is that they are usually serving up crawfish outside on the patio. They've taken over part of the parking lot, and are building permanent shade structures with picnic tables and a crawfish cooker and a large BBQ grill. They serve up all you can eat crawfish on the weekends. I know I can eat a ton of crawfish, especially ones like the ones they serve here- they're small, but spicy. To be honest, I've never signed up for the crawfish deal, but I do enjoy coming here to watch people stuff their faces with them, and then stand in line for some more. Everything on the outdoor patio is slightly sticky and smells like old crustaceans and hot sauce. The place could use an occasional good hosing down after all that crawfish juice.  It's a nice bar, especially on the outside. It's a great place to kick back outdoors with plenty of seating, and good beers."

                "description": "Amazing everything!  Friendly staff, great outdoor ambiance, freakin good food!  We got the Santa Fe and The Alamo wrap, with group beef. The ground beef used it the same for both, so the difference is really the other topping inside. We also got the fully loaded fries... Hands down, best fully loaded version I've had! The fries was prepared well, the toppings were generous. Just typing this out makes my mouth salivate already lol!  I wish we were close to this place, I'd always get their fries!"

                "description": "They took our money and promised food but they weren't open!   The online system took our order and charged our card, but when we went to pick it up, there was absolutely no one there. Everything was dark and shut up tight( even though online it said they were open) with no sign or anything. We have repeatedly phoned them to check but they don't answer. While we figured out what to do, several other cars pulled up to pick up their online order, but of course, no one was there. Very unprofessional of them and disappointing. After I reached out to my community, I found out this is actually a very common thing, so I don't understand how they can remain in business. This is absolutely unacceptable, especially since they charged my card already."

                "description": "If you take 3009 from I-35, as if you're following the signs to the Natural Bridge Caverns, on the right side is a place called Wraptitude, which features amazing burgers, gourmet wraps, seasonal salads and tacos. There's even a kids menu so, just about everyone in your family will be happy.    Wraptitude is a rustic place with most of the tables outside either on a small deck or, fenced yard which includes a playground for the little ones. There's also a small sit down bar inside as well. I had The Maverick burger which includes cheese, avocado, bacon and 1000 island dressing. There's also a Goose burger (are you noticing a theme here?), Viper Tacos and so much more.  This is not a fancy place so, don't get all gussied-up but, it's a nice family place to bring the kids out, meet up with friends.  The staff are extremely friendly and polite.   I hope you have a chance to enjoy this very casual place and with the weather beginning to warm up, eating outside will be fun again."

                "description": "Found this gem while treating a Veteran to a lunch on Veterans Day. It's a nice small indoor/large outdoor restaurant. Upon arrival parking was easy and they have plenty of room. You can see a lot of picnic tables and small playground set.   I'm giving 3 stars because the lady who took our order was super rude. I would ask a question and it was met with so much attitude and unwillingness to help. If it wasn't for me treating a friend to lunch I would have completely walked away from this place.   The bright side was that the food turned out really good. We split an order of sweet potato fries bc it's a huge serving. I ordered the Santa Fe wrap which is Pepper Jack, black beans, corn, rice, chipotle spread with avocado (vegetarian option). It was really pleasing, wrap done right. They also have a nice selection room of craft beers."

To me, once they change the buns on the burgers, I want a burger now. I didn't like the buns before, so I started getting the wraps, which are delicious, now I'm hooked on the BLT. Plus this place has a friendly staff, they do get busy, so the wait for food may be awhile, but the beer selection is pretty decent.   One draw back is the bathroom, just one."

They weren't wearing masks or gloves, so keep that in mine when going.  The had a little park thing and a bunch of outside seating, so it's great if you have a family!  We didn't get to try any of the beers.  The Cali club was good, but there was nothing special about it.  The maverick was good but again, there was nothing special about it.  The loaded fries were good, but it wasn't as presentable as I could make it myself at home. It also felt like it had waited out for a while before it got to us.  There was nothing really special about this place, but the food was ok."

                "description": "Came in for a quick lunch with the hubby. The waitress at the bar was nice. We both hd tea and it was good nothing special. My husband had the 46 burger wrap. It was ok. The sauce tasted like thousand island. Nothing made it special. The menu stated it came with fries, but he didn't get any. I ordered the Hollywood taco. The shredded chicken was GREAT. The price for what I got was high. Just a normal sized taco you would make at home. The tortilla tasted like an H‑E‑B tortilla, not bad just ok. The meat was topped with a few kernels of corn and fresh diced jalapeño. The verde sauce was mediocre. Again nothing special. I added fries to my order and they were good, Very crispy. They were out of fried pickles which was a huge let down since it was one of the reasons we chose to give this place a shot, but I'm not holding it against them with the supply shortages going on right now.  Overall everything was ok, but didn't seem worth the drive or the price."

                "description": "So we're heading to the caverns and wanted lunch.  We ARE NOT chic filet kinda people!!  Found this place on yelp and it was along the route we were taking.  OK yes, it is somewhat of a hole in the wall, or for that matter quaint, picturesque, salon, on the side of the road. Walked in and were greeted by Heidi (one of the owners), she told us to pick where we wanted to sit, so we saddled up to the bar.  Yes, small bar, but very adequate, plenty of tables to sit inside, and outside.   Craving a burger, but not wanting the bun, started reviewing the wraps.  My husband and I both ordered wraps and a order of onion rings.   My Santa Fe with ground beef was wonderful, the cheese was creamy, the beef tender with just a hint of spice.  My husband enjoyed the Alamo wrap and it disappeared.  OH, don't let me forget the salsa she gives you with the wrap, I don't remember what it was but it was super with kick!  The onion rings we shared (small order), was the perfect amount for two people, they were fresh and hot!  We are not dippers, so we did not take Heidi up on the sauces she offered for the rings. If ever back in this neck of the woods, we WILL be back!"

                "description": "Came here with the family after doing Natural Bridge Caverns. First, be prepared to sit outside, there's not much room inside, especially during the social distancing times. However, even though it was over 90 degrees outside the shade and breeze kept it cool enough to be pleasant. Kids had a playground to okay on - though it was a bit past it's prime.   The ordering seemed a bit haphazzard, which seemed to be due to only have one employee working front of house despite it being rush hour lunch time. This caused me to have to stand at the bar for considerable amounts of time waiting to order or when I went to get a beer. Hopefully this was just someone not showing up for a shift and not a perpetual issue.   Now for the food. I had a Santa Fe wrap. Standard Mexican ingredients, but all together tasty. My wife's burger wrap with fries in the wrap looked quite good. Kids chicken strips were solid quality. The fries had good flavor and crunchy outsides. Beer selection was surprisingly good (Blood and Honey automatically  means I'm happy).   Solid, if not spectacular experience."

The entire wrap was rice, it was so hard to eat because of the amount of rice made the wrap so dry. It hardly had any chicken, mine had maybe a 3 little pieces of chicken bits and about 6 black beans. Just a drop of sauce and no cheese or corn. I should have taken a pic but I had to open mine up to remove the big glob of rice. Same with my friends. Our sons loved their burger and grilled cheese. Next time I will try a burger but for being called wraptitude, I was expecting a good wrap."

                "description": "We stopped by after spending the morning at Natural Bridge caverns. We ordered a few burger wraps, chicken strips, and the surf burger from the kids menus. The food was really tasty and fries were delicious. The main issue here was that they seemed to be understaffed and weren't set up very well for social distancing. They have a very small seating area and bar inside and several picnic tables and outdoor seating options. While you can spread out just fine outside, you have to go inside of the crowded small building to place your order. It was a very small space with too many people inside close together. Also, the fountain drinks and cups were self-serve set up right next to where everyone was standing. If they had online or outside ordering so that you could avoid going inside, it would really improve things."

                "description": "This was the 1st meal while in Texas, and we dare say it was superb. The guy running the restaurant was super chill and energetic. The atmosphere was relaxing with the eclectic decor.  The hubs had the burger wrap while I had 3 tacos (pork, asada, and avutarian). We also shared the half-loaded fries.  The fries were amazing! Usually with these types of dishes, the fries become soggy or aren't even crispy to begin with. These had a crunch even to the last few pieces. And not to mention, it was loaded with a lot of beef and bacon pieces. What a value for the amount of meat that's in it.  His burger wrap was seriously da bomb. All the 46 sauce and ingredients stuffed inside the wrap was just oozing outwards. The wrap consisted of beef, bacon bits, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and onions -- pretty much what a burger is. Biting into this was a wowing moment. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  My tacos were okay. They weren't superb (standard lettuce, cheese, lime, and tomatillo salsa). I wouldn't rec it as this place isn't known for their tacos:  * Asada: The avocados were creamy. This was prob the freshest and tastiest of the 3 tacos. * Avutarian: The flavors were faint at most. There wasn't much wow or anything that made this taco look nor taste diff. * Pork: The flavors were lacking, and the pork looked super bland (see the only close-up pic worth taking).  Everything about this experience was 5 stars minus my taco choices. The loaded fries and burger wrap were just mind-blowing delicious and at a great price.  Though there were limited parking spaces in the front, the back had plenty of nooks and crannies you could squeeze your car into."

                "description": "Great first time experience at Down on Grayson. We came in on a busy Thursday night and although we were told there would be a 20-30 minute wait, we were seated in 5 mins for a party of two.   When eating out somewhere new I like to order an app, salad and entree to get a good idea of a restaurant's menu. It's very rare for me to visit a restaurant where every dish I order is delicious as typically one dish is good and the rest is meh. Well surprisingly that was not the case at Grayson. I don't drink alcohol so even my unsweetened iced tea was good.   I ordered the Thai steak salad which had a light citrus dressing that wasn't overly oily or heavy. The meat was tender, the greens were chopped for ease of eating, and there was a nice mix of toppings consisting of cooked soft noodles, crunchy almonds, and mangoes and onions. So overall tasty and nice texture wise.   For my entree I went with the grouper Veracruz. No complaints here. I enjoyed the side of petite carrots drenched in honey butter.   My favorite were definitely the Parmesan fries. I'm not a fan of ordering fries at restaurants as they tend to be too thick and starchy but decided to try the fries here nonetheless. Their Parmesan fries were slim, delicious, and crispy and weren't heavily coated just topped with soft grated Parmesan (not the Kraft variety either). It almost tasted like there was a hint of truffle oil and it paired well with their chunky garlic aioli.   Definitely coming back here again for the salad, fries, and dessert which I have yet to try."

                "description": "You have to get the Parmesan Fries! I keep coming back to this restaurant because the food is so so GOOD! I'm going to tell you everything you need to order. First, like I said, the Parmesan Fries. These are some of the best fries I've ever had! That shredded parmesan, roasted minced garlic, and parsley on fries is addictive! And in my opinion, they have the best burger in Texas. It's called the Char King, and I always get mine cooked medium, and ADDING BACON is a must! Even though it's $3 extra, it's worth every penny. If you want something on the lighter side, their Brussel Sprouts are phenomenal! Tonight I tried the Meatball appetizer for the first time, and those were remarkable too! And the Strawberry Frozen Marg, with sugar around the rim is perfection!   The service here has always been great. Tonight our waiter was Clayton, and he was super nice and super attentive. I would catch him glancing at us occasionally to see if we were ok, and I thought: Aw! How nice! He kept saying things like: Let's get \"our\" appetizers out here. And: What can I get \"us\" to drink? And I thought: Aw! it's like he's eating with us!  I also really like the vibe of the restaurant. I would say it's rustic, hip, and chill. The entrance is beautiful because you have to walk through the outdoor patio to get inside the restaurant. There's these beautiful lights on the trees, outdoor heaters and fire pits. It's really quite romantic. There's also an outside patio bar seating that faces the interstate, and a nice long indoor bar. I think if you're going on a date, meeting up with friends, taking someone out from out of town, this place would be a great option."

                "description": "Stopped by Down on Grayson for lunch yesterday.  Great atmosphere and friendly staff with the best outdoor dining at the Pearl.  Started with a wedge salad with bacon and tasty blue cheese dressing...excellent.   The roasted brussel sprouts with house made sirracha sauce didn't disappoint - perfect and a nice changeThe beef in the sliders was full of flavor and juicy.  My favorite is the jalapeño pimento cheese - creamy and crazy good.  I love a   good pimento cheese!  The watermelon daiquiri was the best!   Fresh muddled watermelon and Bacardi without the grainy fruit taste!  Great hangout for a Saturday afternoon!"

The indoor seating was very nice, but the out door areas were what brought us in, as they welcome dogs Very large outdoor areas with lots of tables  Savanah was our server, she was very sweet and accommodating  It was late so we both opted for tomato soup and amazing grilled cheese...i couldn't finish mine, so filling but so good! They do offer some vegan options Very clean Slightly pricey but not crazy"

                "description": "In town for business and walked to the Pearl brewery along the river walk...Grayson is set in a nice area and it's a really nice walk if you're inclined.   The atmosphere at Grayson is nice and has a trendy feel.   I ordered the crispy fish and a spicy margarita.  I will say the title of the crispy fish dish doesn't do it justice.  It was an amazing pan fried snapper that had a very unique flavor.    I didn't really enjoy the spicy margarita, and would recommend trying a different cocktail  The outdoor seating area was really neat with  plenty of seating and fire pits to sit by.  I recommend trying this place out"

                "description": "Came for dinner on a Sunday evening with friends. We walked in around 7:45 PM and had a party of 5 and had to wait about 45-50 minutes for a table. Once we were seated, it took a while for food to come out.   Crispy Brussels: really good! Super crispy and comes with a yummy sauce. Great savory app for sharing.  Lavender lemonade: pretty solid cocktail. It tasted more like lemonade than lavender but it's sweet and refreshing.  Chicken and kale salad: heavy on the kale. The chicken, avocado, and cashews are chopped up and mixed in and the kale is also chopped and marinated in the dressing so it's not tough to chew. The dressing is light, which I appreciate. The chicken pieces are small but kind of tough and dry. It's a pretty big salad and very filling.  Everyone agreed their food was pretty average and nothing to rave about, plus it's kind of pricey as expected of the location. The restaurant itself has a nice vibe with a cool bar and TVs. But the average food combined with such a long wait only warrants 3 stars from me."

                "description": "This was a HUGE disappointment. We came because we were given a gift card. Evidently they don't take reservations, so we ended up with an hour and a half wait on a WEDNESDAY. It was my birthday, however, so we made do.   In their favor, the building is quite pretty, parking was not hard, and their outside space was really lovely. We passed the wait time fairly pleasantly outdoors with some pretty good drinks. Still, for a Wednesday...   As for the food, I didn't care for the Caesar salad. I got the top sirloin, and he the skirt steak. I found the sear on mine to be simply too hard and crusty, and it made for a poor experience eating. His steak tasted good and was well cooked, but we were again mutually disappointed in the chimichurri- the taste was fairly good, but the texture was simply off. The herbs were chopped in such a way that they were absolutely the perfect size to get stuck in your teeth. I've actually considered using the word \"unpleasant\" 3-4 times during this review and, with the exception of the drinks, I'm afraid that generally describes my experience here.   Okay, so here's the last part, which I have debated over and over writing. Please note that there is NO PROOF this is true, but merely reflective of my personal experience: I believe I got food poisoning there. I am not a medical professional and I can't be sure, but Down on Grayson was all I'd eaten that day that could have reasonably done it. I suspect my Caesar salad, but to be honest I don't care. I was completely miserable the day after. So take this how you will."

                "description": "Whenever we've come here, the food has not disappointed!! Everything we have tried, down to the drinks, has been delightful!!!  This time, we had a shorter visit. I had the Reuben Sandwich. I definitely recommend it if youre into Reubens. It has garlic toasted bread, crispy while still remaining soft. The corned beef was on point and the I really enjoyed the sauerkraut, it had a balanced flavor, sometimes saurkraut can be too intense for me and I don't enjoy it, but I loved it on this sandwich and the thousand islands dressing went perfectly with the sandwich.  My boyfriend devoured the Char King!!   The reason I do not give this place 5 stars is because the service here has been hit or miss. We have gotten excellent service at times and have also had times when it has not been good. One specific time, our server took an extremely long time to come take our order, did not check in when we wanted to order drinks the first time nor to order more drinks, and was frankly just apathetic overall.  I still come back for great food, beautiful atmosphere, and usually good service, and would definitely recommend.  PARKING***This restaurant has its own section in the parking structure designated to its patrons. The parking area is right in front of the restaurant Josephine Street, and on the intersection between Ave A and East Jospehine St."

There was no wait during the week for dinner, and they have a nice indoor and outdoor space.   The fish tacos were fantastic and fresh, I would 100% order them again. I got the grouper sandwich the second trip, it was good but I wouldn't order them again.   The spicy margarita was great, I ordered it both times that I was there."

It's located at the Pearl for one and as the sun goes down the lights are lit up which is very romantic and just sets the mood for any occasion. Who wouldn't enjoy such delicious entrées, beautiful presentation of cocktails, and refreshing ambiance. The atmosphere is absolutely beautiful and lively. Such an all rounded place, perfect after a long day at the office and a great end to a long work week."

                "description": "A steady standby of the Pearl area and a reasonable place to get a beer outdoors, but the food has gotten reliably \"passable.\" A plate of nachos arrived tonight with a baker's dozen chips covered in congealed shredded cheddar. An extra $8 gets you guac and a greasy ladling of ground beef. No salsa or sour cream. There were some chopped carrots though. You could also go with the crisp Brussel sprouts. Most of the other dishes are whelming at best.  You could probably do better with your $16, but you can't beat the location I guess."

                "description": "Such a cute place.  Such a great location.  Such incredible potential. Such a missed opportunity.  Having visited Down on Grayson several times I have always found myself feeling underwhemled when all is said and done.   There is plenty of parking to be found in the area so we've never had an issue getting to Down on Grayson.  They do have a beautiful outdoor space, which we've sat at as well as ample indoor seating, which we've also sat at.  Indoor is fine but outdoor is where ya wanna be....weather permitting.  Service has always been acceptable.  Nothing stand-out or to praise but also nothing terrible or warranting any sort of negative attention.  I guess, for me, where Down on Grayson falls short is the food.  The onion rings are good but greasy and a little goes a long way with those.  The Crispy Brussels are fine and the salads I've tried, acceptable.  The \"El Moderno\" Nachos claim to be an \"authentic version of this south of the border favorite\" but if that's auténtico then gimmie the cheap, knock-off version any day.  Meh. At. Best.    Now look-obviously, I am in the minority here and maybe where they shine is their meat-based menu offerings that this vegetarian doesn't eat, so take my opinion with a grain of salt if you're more on the carnivore end of the spectrum. For me, this isn't a place I suggest nor is it a place I must take people.  It's mostly a really pretty patio to grab a drink and then head elsewhere for dinner.  That's my ideal Down on Grayson experience."

                "description": "I've passed Down on Grayson many times while at the Pearl and was finally able to dine here for a late lunch/early dinner. Covered reserved parking (for this restaurant only) is available just a few steps away from the entrance. Since it was an off hour (3:30pm), there was no wait for a table. We chose to sit inside, but there is seating outdoors as well. They are also dog-friendly (outdoor seating only).  I started off with a Ranch Water, which has dulce vida blanco tequila, fresh lime juice, and topo chico. The Topo Chico was a bit flat, but the drink aesthetics was on point. Not really worth the $12 price tag in my opinion, but I had to try it since I've never officially tried ranch water before.  The Shishito Peppers ($12) appetizer was definitely a great surprise. The portion size of the peppers was way bigger than I expected, and the peppers themselves were cooked very nicely with a slightly blistered skin. The accompanying sriracha mayo balanced the heat of the peppers.  For the main, I got Fish Tacos ($16). They were one of the best fish tacos I've ever had! The large filets of fish were perfectly cooked and juicy, and the spiciness of the seasoning paired well with the fixin's (i.e. cole slaw, avocado, tomato, red onion, salsa, lime juice, cilantro) on top. It's a must-try item!  Service was also great from beginning to end. Our waitress was prompt and very friendly but didn't overdo it with checking up on us. Even the hostess seated us with a smile, which many restaurant hosts/hostesses fail to do.  Definitely a great place to grab delicious food and drinks!  [An added bonus is the decor in the women's restroom--cute, framed paintings of dogs!]"

                "description": "Decided to stop by for an early dinner after returning some golf shorts that were SEE THROUGH at Nike. Was not expecting much even though it has pretty solid reviews but to my surprise everything was great!   I started off with the Grayhound cocktail which was basically grapefruit juice and vodka. If you like grapefruit, you have got to get this drink. Super refreshing after a nice walk from the parking lot in the 100 degree weather!   For the appetizer I decided to try out the Shishito peppers and they were pretty good. Perfectly charred and it also came with a light dipping sauce that did not take away from the natural flavors of the pepper.   The main attraction for me was the fire roasted chicken. Tuesday afternoon means we must choose healthier options so of course I had to go with a chicken breast. The chicken breast was huge and was attached to the bone with a nice fire roasted skin on top. The breast itself was nice and tender but not too tender. I'd say it was a perfectly grilled/fire roasted chicken breast. It was also lightly sauced with a honey sauce which complimented the corn well because the corn had just a little heat to it. The corn was sweet and fresh and you could tell that it comes from the cob instead of a frozen bag.   Our waitress was cool too and was very friendly and the service was great. Overall this is a great spot to hang out at because they have good food and a wide variety of drinks!"

                "description": "This place is a delight. We came on Halloween evening after an adventurous weekend. Charming neighborhood and SUCH a beautiful building. We got a little lost exiting after dinner, and ended up inadvertently exploring the various dining areas. It's really impressive and spacious and each room is interesting with its own style. It's startlingly cool - but do I belong here? Do you? We both do! How? It's welcoming in addition to the impressive physical environment. Really lovely staff. FANTASTIC music. Somebody's got exquisite taste in there. I was frustrated for a millisecond when a table of empty-nesters sat down nearby and their chatter drowned out the playlist, but then the eavesdropping was great too. So I'm going to go ahead and credit Liberty Bar with that portion of my experience as well: I appreciate the acoustics! - Perfect for fun conversation with your table companion OR listening in on another group of people trying not to insult their own children too much. Ach. Those children - they were so lazy... but had the biggest hearts!  So you don't care about this? What? Okay - the food: DELICIOUS. We had the fish taco appetizer, a salad with asparagus and portobello mushrooms, and a really, really fabulous lamb burger (medium: perfection). The fries were crispy-perfect. Oh yeah - some chocolate cake with ice cream for dessert. So good. I never get dessert at restaurants, but if you do or if you don't - consider getting it here.  We came to San Antonio for a little birthday / long-weekend getaway and had a blast. The Liberty Bar was one of the highlights. If I move[d] here, I'd want to find a place as close as possible to the Liberty Bar so I could become a regular. Good gawd, it's life-affirming."

                "description": "Our food was delicious. The baked bread and fried chick peas were very good. We had The chicken achiote, fettuccine and falafel pita and we all enjoyed our meals. On a bad note and why we don't give it 5 stars is that we waited over an hour for our food and the overall service was slow. We were seated at a table that the floor vibrated (not sure if this is the case throughout the whole restaurant) but to be honest it was annoying. The restaurant is charming and unique. The food is delicious and worth a try."

                "description": "Great place for a last minute brunch! We were actually in line for Guenther House, but couldn't wait two hours.  Instead, we decided to check out Liberty Bar.  There were seating availabilities and a staff to get us seated right away.  It did take a little extra time for us to get our drink orders in, but no complaints. Food came out in a timely manner compared to time to order and everything was delicious.  I recommend the eggs Benedict which comes with extra thin and crunchy fries that are my favorite!  Also, can't go wrong with the french toast that was soaked for 48 hours!  We felt like fatties, but well worth it.  I definitely recommend brunch here with the quiet ambience and great food."

                "description": "Awesome Environment and very creative food. Watch the address close because it's not obvious this is the right location, as it looks like an old Convent which is exactly what it is. Painted bright pink concrete walls will greet you. Being a Sunday at late lunch only the upstairs was open but there is ample seating downstairs for busier times. Nice long bar with just about any kind of alcohol you can imagine and a very fun creative menu. Grab a book and sit down to read if you liked as there are plenty in book shelves on the walls. The only reason why I didn't rate it a perfect five was due to the service. It really wasn't very busy but we had a hard time finding our waiter when we needed him. He seemed to be tired and didn't make any suggestions about the menu or seemed excited to be there. Other than that it was a great experience and we definitely will be back."

Currently, they are only offering outdoor dining but they have a great outdoor area with numerous tables, palm trees, and string lights which makes for a nice ambiance. While the service was a bit slow on a Saturday night, the waiters were friendly and kept us updated. We started with the bread assortment which must have had 4 or 5 different types of bread, all of which were good. I had the falafel sandwich as my main and it was a very large portion. I really enjoyed the dish and came with an option of a side salad or fries."

                "description": "Where to eat on a busy Saturday night out during the peak in the pandemic? Outside! In the cold! We stumbled into Liberty Bar because we were specifically looking to eat in South Town and eat outside. Unfortunately for us, Liberty Bar's owner has refused to buy outdoor heating- we were told outdoor dining is only because of the pandemic. Well, we decided to eat and run- bad decision, here's why: the cost is exorbitant for the food!  My burger was small and the sourdough bun was greasy as hell. The side salad had a dressing that also tasted like oil. The good news was the plate suggested by the waiter- beef tips, was a hit. Our margaritas had tequila but were served in super small glasses. I was floored by the cost of our meal- 90 dollars. Bank robbery for the food- with the cost so high... buy a few outdoor heaters! Two stars for the amazing waitstaff but the food, atmosphere and price results in  'Stay Away!!'"

It seems as though they are still figuring that all out. We went over this past weekend and got on the waitlist but their systems are off as they don't seem to have a host/hostess and their waitstaff are left to figure out who gets seated, when and where. Of course, we will always be patient with wait staff these days as they are figuring out how to work in this new environment.   There drinks are phenomenal, we got the mimosas and bloody Maria's. I highly recommend the bloody Maria's!"

Donna and I shared the margarita flight while Donna's Dad tried the thirsty goat. The passion fruit was balanced but the mixed berry was uber sweet. Dad and I shared the fish and chips, which was decent. I think I've been spoiled with Rosey's big fish. Donna's Dad also had the fish and chips and Donna had the pizza - half triple meat and half prosciutto and arugula. I had a slice of the triple meat and the sausage was on the salty side.

                "description": "The place is small and intimate inside with a nice open patio outside. The atmosphere and its patrons were very chill and fun. People were laughing and enjoying each others company. There aren't servers so you have to go to the bar to order food and drinks. The menu is small for food (bar food) but there was a wealth of beers on tap. Bonus: two different types of Yuengling but no Black and Tan. Texas may have to wait a while longer for that one to get here.   The female bartender was a little (a lot) lost. Each time I said an item I wanted she said, \"is that it?\" which made me think that she wasn't taught the art up upselling yet but that's another story. I ordered food and my drink and then my husband ordered his food and drink. He offered a card and she said she \"didn't think she needed that\" but then put our order as to-go. ??? We went back to our table and realized that other tables had table tents so I went back and asked if I needed a number and they were like, oh yea! How about this number? And handed me a table tent. We waited about 40 minutes for wings and meatballs.   The Yuengling on tap - not warm but not cold. Meh.  The wine - La Crema Pinot noir. I ask the female bartender if they had Pinot Noir and she said, \"oh this?\" with a very confused look on her face and showed me a bottle of Chardonnay. Um, no.   Anyway, our food was finally brought out. The wings had a decent flavor but they weren't hot and they were slimy and gummy. Yuck. He asked for blue cheese and he got ranch and one empty and dirty ramekin??? The meatballs were previously frozen, in my opinion, but weren't too bad. But they weren't hot either.  In the middle of waiting on our food, the female bartender came up and tried to had us a very watered down drink I had noticed at the bar when ordering twenty minutes prior. She asked if we ordered this drink and when we said no, she continued to ask around to find the right person.   The piece de resistance was our bill. Everything was of a normal price but my glass of wine...was TEN DOLLARS. La Crema normally sells for about 12-15 for a bottle. I get a mark up to make a profit, but dude. That's just rude.    This place truly has potential but they need to step it up a notch on hot food and maybe a once around from the bartender to check on patrons and to bus some tables. I say this because a gentleman next to us very jokingly but vocally said, \"pardon me while I bus my table\" as he went back and forth 3 times to empty his table of empty glasses and dishes from the people at his table.   On the pulse side, everyone was very cordial and had great attitudes.  Over all, I give it a 6.1."

                "description": "My all women's volunteer organization hosted a fund raiser trivia night at this bar.  When I got there, I was worried we wouldn't have enough room or tables for the group, but we ended up being fine. It's a small place for a large group, but they were attentive and accommodating. There seemed to be a limited staff working (maybe 3?) but the service was good.   Food menu is small but has some good looking options. It's not on the overhead electronic screens (drinks only) but there are laminated menus around. And pictures posted on the business' Yelp page.  They also have a water cooler (like the kind you have at football games) so you can get water whenever you want.   This is a fun little bar in a strip of other businesses. It may get looked over but if you are in the area, it would be a good place to check out.   The fun: Lots of drink choices with a wide variety of IPAs. All 4 people at our table enjoyed what they had. The Purple Haze was a hit with another at our table. I enjoyed the Crackberry cider. It was a little more tart than I usualoy like, but I thought it was a decent cider. Also some canned and bottled beverages. Max was behind the bar for our event, and he was very friendly. He also handled our large group well.   The less than ideal: The electronic menu keeps changing what is shown on the screen. There are 2 screens. There are 2 pages for the drink menu. However, the part of the menu displayed on each screen changes when the circle at the bottom fills up. It's not really enough time to read everything on one screen before it changes and you have to try to find your place again on the other screen. And some of the drink listed online aren't on the screen (specifically the 1 of 2 tap ciders I saw online). Oh, and there is only 1 women's restroom."

Claude Hoppers is pretty far out of my way but it's still a grand time when I get to go. They have a nice selection of beer, on par with your local Big Hops, and a mix of high and low seating, as well as a nice outdoor patio.  I had a first date here and when he went to the bathroom, the bartender was eavesdropping a bit and excitedly ran up to me to squeal, \"Is this a first date!? He's SO hot, where did you find him!?\" So that was pretty adorable.  Pub Trivia is always a blast here, too. It's hosted by Geeks Who Drink, whose format I absolutely love. Build up a team, have a pint, and spend an evening at Claude Hoppers!"

                "description": "Went here the other day to grab some drinks. Overall, walking in the place has a cool vibe. They play primarily reggae music and have about 50 beers on tap that is listed on a screen with the price and alcohol percentage.   The downside of this place is their cleanliness, service, and beer knowledge. We went there and everyone ordered the Ballast Point Grunion Pale Ale. When we drank it though, we knew it wasn't the actual beer and the bartender insisted that it was. Lucky for us, we were with a Ballast Point distributor so he looked at the tap and confirmed that it in fact wasn't the beer we had requested.   The service was highly lacking. There was one lady working and maybe 10 at most people in the place. But it was fairly calm, yet she didn't walk around to ask us if we need more after our empty glasses sat there for over 15 minutes. As for cleanliness, the toilet paper and paper towels were empty in the restroom. Also, there was a pile of looks like swept up trash just sitting on the ground near a table. Sadly, I wish this place was better, but I don't see myself coming back."

Owned by a family, they continues to take customer input and have variety of beers, wine, shots and drink! Love to visit whenever I get a chance to relax! Highly recommend this place."

It took 20 minutes to get out first drink and were never asked again if we needed service. We left after waiting an additional hour. Dustin cared more about socializing with his friends at the bar than trying to help anyone. There were only 6 people here and I see why. Will not be returning."

                "description": "Before I dig into this review, I'd like to say I've been to numerous growler stations and think I've developed a pretty good basis of comparison/ expectations.   This place is super far from San Antonio.  Okay I got that out the way.  There's plenty of parking and indoor/outdoor seating.  The outdoor patio is set up kind of like a beer garden, but there's no walk-up window service.  There is wait staff though, so that's cool.  Immediately I was impressed with the selection of beers.  Not sure how often they change them, but for a first timer it was a change for sure.  The indoor area has booths, high-tops, bar seating and a little cove in the back.  Liking that.  The staff was cool too.  The food is better than bar food.  I mean they offer humus and pulled pork tacos.  Whaaaaaat?!   Some things I really didn't care for were no  1/2 pours, flights and condiment taster cups.  If I'm willing to commit to paying a little extra for craft beer, then I'm definitely not okay with plastic taster cups.  Every other craft beer spot offers glass tasters.   I understand they offer flights now, since my visit about 3 weeks ago.  Pros: Beer selection FOOD (Most growler spots don't have food) Parking Growler prices Drink growlers on premises   Cons: No Flights No  1/2 pours (must commit to full 16oz) Distance Plastic taster cups No designated tap handles"

                "description": "So, I was able to score a Groupon for this particular place awhile back and wanted to get a really good deal on a growler fill. First off could this place be any further from the city?!! It was like I could see the Eiffel Tower on the next block! Secondly I was anticipating a much bigger space, as all the pictures I saw of it gave me that impression. However, what I've learned as I Yelp is that the disparity between perception and actual experience can be great.  As you enter here a really cool iron fence with ornate lighting opens up the patio, with ample seating and tables to match. By comparison the taproom is relatively small. The interior itself is both sleek and cozy. A small bar area with a few high chairs/ tables gives me the impression the intent of the owner was to create an intimate experience. In contrast it is a refreshing departure from the noise and bustle of other tap rooms. But then again there are people that gravitate toward a busy, crowded bar.  The growler/tap station itself is a small counter space with a healthy beer selection alongside a wall. In addition a small screen displays beers by name, price and alcohol content. Since this location is in Stone Oak prices are in fitting with this area. For example a simple pour of the Real Ale's, \"Mysterium Verum Kraken\" a rare tap, will set you back $12. Definitely expect to pay a little more than the typical taproom you might frequent, if you choose to come here.  In terms of service the tapmaster was very professional. I like how she moved from patron to patron, able to take orders and fill pours. She knew customers on a first name basis but more importantly knew their drink of choice; which speaks volumes of this establishment. In my tattered slip-on Vans I collected my growler of Karbach's \"Krunkin Pumkin\" and headed on out.   My only critiques of this spot would be I wish they would post on their page the prices for their beers. And the distance. If this was in the Deco District area I would probably hit this place up more frequently. Still Claude Hopper's is a really cool tap/growler station with a sleek layout. The vibe is laid back, the beer selection is good, the patio is perfect for conversation and the service is excellent. And I think a Friday night after work is the optimal time to get \"Krunkin!\""

They've really upped their game with their food- With more than just \"bar snacks\", you can now say it's a dinner destination place.  On the menu are Phillys, gyros (with all the trimmings),  pizza with cauliflower crust and other goodness.  Also, watch their calendar because they host A LOT of great musicians and bands every week without fail.  Not to miss are 80's Night and German Night in the fall ...and jazz on Wednesdays."

                "description": "The coziest wine bar in the area. The vibe is extremely laid back and casual. It almost feels like you're at a friends house, and I mean that in the best way possible. We went on a Wednesday which meant a live jazz band. They were great and included some Sinatra which i appreciated. The main room was a little too loud for our taste given the live music so we opted for the side room which was perfect as we were able to enjoy the music and conversation simultaneously.  We sat and got comfortable just in time to have a glass during happy hour and we ordered the house Cabernet for two. It was decent. Next, the Artezin Zinfandel which was peppery and bold and absolutely lovely. Then, an overwhelmingly smokey Zinfandel that I unfortunately didn't get the name of. That one was my favorite but I'm partial to oaky/smokey notes in my wine.   For food, we ordered the pretzel which was everything you could ever hope for in a soft pretzel. Doughy, salty, and two types of mustard to accompany each bite. We also got the herb cheese dip on the side. For dinner, the prosciutto pizzas. A little overpriced for what it is- very thin crust, personal size, and not much prosciutto for $18. Still good but not worth it in my opinion. Minus one star for that. Lastly, we ordered the salted Caramel brownie and, wow, my mind was blown. The brownie was warm and gooey, had a salty pretzel type of crust, topped with vanilla ice cream, syrups, and whipped cream. Oh my. I would return just for my smokey Zin and the brownie. Overall, I would absolutely recommend this place. A great spot for decently priced wine, live music, and great conversations."

                "description": "Cute little spot nestled in the heart of \"downtown\" Bulverde. It's very spacious spot with a vibe to suit everyone from a beer garden with a large screen tv, to a relaxing porch, bar seating, lounge area with couches, or a more traditional restaurant seating style area. If you happen to be there on a Friday or Saturday evening you'll be in luck for live music as well.  The wine menu is very extensive but I was little bummed to see they only offer wine flights during the week and not the weekend :( . We had several different waitresses checking on our table and unfortunately none were very well versed In wine recommendations so be advised that you may have to just choose blindly and hope for the best.   No wine drinking outing is complete without having a variety of meats and cheeses to accompany your beverage so my friend and I split the meat and cheese board. Their is a short menu of reasonably priced tapas and pizzas that you can choose from as well. The waitress delivered the meat and cheese board with no explanation of what was on the board-so again just kind of jumped in blindly and figured it out as we went.  All in all, I enjoyed a pleasant evening drinking wine on the porch of Wine 101 but I'm not sure I'd make the drive from San Antonio to Bulverde just to go this place alone. If you're already in the area it's worth stopping in for a glass or two."

                "description": "Well if your team has to play Pieper Ranch, then I think this is a must stop before the game. :) it's 8 minutes away and it is absolutely adorable.  I wanted to sit everywhere! They have a fabulous bar, a cool chill biergarten, some covered patio tables (my choice), a living roomish area, and some nice tables in the back back that could be used for a restaurant area or a party or a tasting menu.  And lining the walls of the back room are the personalized glasses of the regular patrons.  I even saw some glasses with paper in them, which makes me think they leave each other notes (or free drinks). SO CUTE!   I ordered a fight of wine and the meat and cheese tray.  Let me start by saying that I love Cru. The flight was fine, but all tastings were the same vineyard.  None were particularly fantastic. The meat and cheese tray was HUGE, but... quantity over quality. Also, I have no idea if the selections were local or from the HEB, bc they didn't provide a card or any info about the choices.  This would be a great chance to pair with some local cheese or sausage makers (IMO) but none (except what I think may have been capicollo) were particularly amazing.  Not judging, but it seems more geared toward some \"manly men\" that come in with their gals, than a \"wine\" board.  I would definitely choose from their hot menu, when I return.  It was good. Just not fancy-pants.  (No stinky cheese! Lol). My bill was 45$ for the flight, the board and one more glass of wine.  I felt like that was a little high for the quality, but the experience (and quantity of food) made up for it. They def have some cheaper options (especially during happy hour) that I didn't take advantage of.  Everyone that worked there was super polite, I didn't ask many questions so idk if they were particularly knowledgeable, but they sure have a bunch of different wines!  Regardless of my criticisms, I really enjoyed myself, and my experience and I would absolutely return when I'm in the area again."

                "description": "My friend/neighbor and I stopped in last Saturday to check out this place. It it located right in downtown Bulverde very close to where we live. What a little Gem. The wine bar is in a old house that was built sometime in the early 1900's, very rustic and quaint.   We walked into the bar area and were greeted by friendly staff. We told them it was our first time there. We were told to look around and sit anywhere we liked. My friend and I sat in the back part of the house where they had comfortable couches and tables here and there and the walls were lined with hundreds of different kinds of wine. Our waitress was awesome very knowledgeable about the wine. Lucky for us it was happy hour. Happy hour is 4pm to 6:30 daily. Choice wines are $5.00 per glass.   They also serve tapas , appetizers and their version of pizza. We tried their meat and cheese board and their chocolate truffles. Great food to drink with while sipping wine and chatting.   I will definitely be back to try other wines and bring back some of our friends and neighbors. Would highly recommend checking it out, get there early so you can get a good spot to sit, chat and drink wine."

                "description": "I came here with my mom for a girl's night. We each ordered a glass of wine and decided to split the cheese and meat plate. The wines were pretty good and the cheese plate was huge. It had several different types of cheese, each of which came in several chunks. While we did enjoy the amount of food, we thought slight improvements could be made. The plate came with hummus, pita, and crackers. There was a ton of pita for the hummus, but only a few crackers for a ton of cheese. It would have been better if the ratios were switched.   The staff was friendly and they have several rooms for indoor and outdoor seating. I would definitely recommend this spot of a date night or girl's night, especially when the weather is nice."

                "description": "This is an essential must visit place after a day of being out in the sun and river. It has an amazing menu where everything sounds delicious and lots of drinks to choose from. Not just beer! They also have unique cocktails like a frozen strawberry mule which we enjoyed very much sitting at the bar. They have indoor and outdoor dining seating.  Although this place is big and it does get packed, our service was excellent and the food came out fairly quickly and hot. They definitely have a system down. The queso dip we tried was a perfect start to our meal. Of course we tried the fussy five dip which has everything in it, even corn. So good!  We decided on sharing a burger since they are pretty big. With so many unique and delicious choices on the menu it was hard to pick. We went with the Diablo burger which was absolutely delightful. Pickled onions, spicy ranch, jalapeño bacon AND a jalapeño fritter make this burger a great savory experience. Their sweet potato fries were crispy and perfectly salted and were a nice side item to have.  Overall a 10/10 experience and I cannot wait to come back and try more things at this place next time I am in New Braunfels."

                "description": "While visiting family in Canyon Lake, we decided to go out to lunch which meant driving 30+ minutes to find food. So we chose Muck and Fuss.  We got there around 1 on a Tuesday and soon realized that parking was going to be an issue. Being that I have an injured knee, we weren't wanting to walk very far. We drove around a few times and finally found a spot on the road across the street. The parking was the only issue we faced though.  There were 3 of us and a baby and we were sat immediately. Out server was Don. He was very nice, patient, and informative. My cousin got the Great Southern Burger with a side of fries. My sister had the Crab Cake Sandwich with a side salad. I had the Crab Cake Appetizer with a small side of Poutine Fries. Don informed us that they have a scratch kitchen and you can customize your order. The food was delicious. We were so glad that we chose to eat here and didn't even mind that it was a 45 minute drive from the house. They have specialty drinks that they're known for and apparently they also have delicious shakes. I didn't try one, but I kind of wish I would have.  All in all, I'd say definitely try this place if you're in/near New Braunfels. They have seating both indoors and outdoors, and a pleasant ambiance. If you don't mind walking a bit for parking... or driving around until someone leaves lol, then this is a place you should try."

We sat outside in the patio since it was nice weather out. They have seating both inside and out.   We ordered the chips and queso as an appetizer along with the cocktail flight. The drinks were really good although I'd wish they have a few more options  on the menu cause there are only 5 to choose from. The mucks cow mule was my fav. For food we ordered the all American classic burger and the born and raised tacos with Mac and cheese. Both were delicious and did not lack flavor.   We already wanna go back to try something different ok then menu."

                "description": "This in my opinion was one of the better meals I have had in a long time. We were a large party of 8 and all had different meals. They were all so unique and different packed full of flavor and fun. Our waitress Carson was extra sweet and seemed to make it a priority to make great small talk.   I had the Diablo burger and paid extra for a premium side. They make their own tater tots and they were filled with jalapeños, cheddar cheese and cream cheese. They had a little extra crunch to them but were like nothing I had before.   We shared the apple pie cheesecake which was also good. I would not call it great and a must have but I also think that is because I may have overeaten my meal because it was so divine."

                "description": "This place was amazing!!   I loved the cocktail flight, you get to choose which cocktails you sample and we chose the Sangria, the Mule, the Marg, and the Sipper. Our favorites were the Sangria and their signature frozen Mule.  The sausage dip was okay, not the best I've ever tasted but it wasn't bad by any means.  My bf got the Born and Raised tacos with elote on top. These tacos blew our mind lol. They were so juicy and just everything we did not expect from a ground beef taco. I'm really glad we got these. The Mac and cheese he got as a side was great as well. It had pimento cheese so it had a slightly different taste than we are used to but we liked it!   I had the Havarti Jam burger. I thought the burger was okay, as I've had a bacon jam burger before elsewhere, but it was still enjoyable though. Their beef here is perfectly cooked and tastes amazing. If you love caramelized onions and Havarti cheese, and you don't mind a hint of sweetness from the jam, this burger is perfect for you!   We will definitely be back to try some of their tempura- fried shrimp dishes."

They definitely have different things that make you explore and try new things! I was iffy with my Diablo burger but man it was the best combination of sweet, spicy, and meaty! The chips with queso was ok, the chips were a little stale and queso was clumpy. The service was amazing, friendly, and swift. Everyone was happy to help and knew their menus pretty well. Our server was also very experienced when it came to draft and crafted beers along with spirits and fund drinks! I would most definitely come back!

Wait staff was friendly and efficient.   We stopped here on our way up to Austin to celebrate our anniversary. I went with the Mexican Street Food Burger, I think that was the name? ‍ Anyways it was a burger that had a bunch of things on it including Mexican Street Corn. It came with fries which I upgraded to Poutine Fries because why wouldn't I on our anniversary it's time to celebrate. Wifey got Shrimp Tacos with pickled onions on top and I believe some kind of Asian style seasoning. Her meal came with fries as well which she said were good but once she tried my poutine fries she quickly wished she upgraded. We shared my fries because hey it was our anniversary and I'm a nice guy (sometimes).   Overall a good dinning experience. Would reccomend and would return."

That's why we are continuing to take precautionary measures to ensure proper sanitization and minimal contact for all your orders.\"  Given this statement it seemed odd that no one in the place (except for me) was wearing masks, and the tables weren't spaced far apart. I would be very uncomfortable dining in here. But my order was for pickup.   I ordered a Caesar salad. The online menu says there's a balsamic reduction, but it was nowhere to be found. That's unfortunate. The salad was a decent size. The dressing was good. It seemed like it was yogurt based. It needed something. Maybe more garlic, or some salt.  The Parmesan crisps were a nice touch, and weren't mentioned on the menu, so maybe they took the place of the balsamic reduction. It's a fair trade off.   I'm on a low fat diet due to some recent health issues, so I think the rest of their menu is off limits for me."

Great outdoor space, but it was thunderstorming while we were there.   $17 for a burger and fries is pretty steep though. I got the Scape Goat and the thin beef patty didn't even come close to covering the bottom bun. Disappointing for a burger at that price point. It was flavorful though. Parmesan aioli fries were an up charge; they were pretty delicious.   Basic cheeseburger was deliciously messy and the side salad was beautiful!   We tried the Muck Mule, Peach Sangria, and I had a sample of the Flamingo Fruit beer. All were very good.   Give this New Braunfels gem a try when you're visiting or just passing through!"

Arrived right at five and seated very quickly on the cute patio. Service was quick, and my mouthwatering burger arrived promptly. Definitely lived up to the hype, stuffed with creamy pimiento cheese and stacked high with all the good, non-healthy stuff. Just the right amount of spice too, more about flavor than intense heat. I devoured it quickly because the bun could barely hold it all and I just couldn't resist. So tasty.  Also, the service here was so amazing. My sweet waitress came out to tell me they were fixing my order to get me the sweet potato fries I ordered instead of regular fries. I hadn't even noticed the mistake! I ended up with both sets of fries, and then they didn't charge me for either to make up for their mistake. Superb customer service that sealed the deal for me. Going to recommend this place highly to everyone I know. Hoping to try another burger here soon!"

                "description": "Definitely this is a spot to come visit when you want to hangout, lounge around, or pre-game before going to the brewery next door. Either way, this is a cool, low key joint. Best part is that they serve both wine AND coffee! They are the same company as Wicked Voodoo Coffee, and its super interesting that they have a wine and coffee bar. I love it! The concept and the place is so unique. They also have legit charcuterie boards. The staff here is also extremely sweet and nice. Great customer service, amazing ambience, and a great place to bring friends. They also have a private seating area if you wanted to reserve for a large party. If wine and coffee are your jam, this is a perfect place for you!"

I really can't explain how detail oriented they are towards picking the right blend of foods that go so well with their wine offerings.  The bartender/host Stuart was AMAZING. She helped us navigate our flight of wines and has almost perfect recommendations.  I would come here everyday if I could. Being right next to I-35 makes it a short drive for me when commuting, and there was plenty of spots to park even though it was busy."

Then there is Melinda, who was primarily taking care of us.  She was subbing in from one of their drive-thru locations due to being short-staffed, and she was flat-out nails!  Great personality, extremely helpful, and just a lot of fun to talk with. My wife did have the munchies and ordered the bacon donuts, not really reading the description...obviously missing the 'mountain' in the title.  This is enough to feed Joey Chestnut...a huge pile of freshly made rings, topped with bacon and a sticky-sweet glaze...with a side of healthy fresh berries.  My wife has breakfast for the next few days. Great wine selection...coffee smelled great, but did not have any (got a bag of beans to go), and truly outstanding people... We will go out of our way to visit again, for these experiences, even in today's climate, are rare. You will not be disappointed."

It was flavorful, savory, and cooked to perfection. The mac and cheese was moist and the portion was large.  They also offer a fairly large variety of oysters. Their cocktails are handcrafted and worth every drop.   Also there was only kudos heard at the table about the chicken so I would definitely recommend."

                "description": "Our first time trying Southerleigh at the Rim was back in November of last year (2021) The food was amazing which prompted my family to revisit, and the second visit was still amazing.   Our server tonight was amazing and provided us exceptional service, as always. He gets 5 stars! seriously such a kind guy as well as the manager on duty. Both made mine and my boyfriend's third visit back a great one.   I am placing 3 stars because the quality of the food has completely changed. We loved the original biscuit recipe and were served a biscuit that was great in size but did not compare nearly to the original. The Mac and cheese was also subpar and tasted generic and did not compare to the original recipe. I ordered the hot chicken sandwich and the bread used originally has now been changed. I understand why that might be because the bread bun prior was a lot thinner and the sandwich would become messy but in my opinion that's what made it so much fun to eat ( you'll understand if you're a fellow foodie ) The meat of my sandwich kind of grossed me out because of the gristle. I noticed it was a lot smaller cut of chicken from my previous visit. The chicken also seemed to be a cheaper cut as it was not all white meat chicken like before. It was 80% gristle dark meat and 10% white meat.   I hope that Southerleigh at the rim can go back to its original recipes that we fell in love with. The quality of the food will not allow me to revisit. But the great service and friendliness of the staff will!"

By all means I am not basing this off the staff nor the waitresses but the food absolutely is horrible now. When we come we never order less than 5-10 items; I have a large family but I am absolutely appalled. My last 3 visits have been very... regretful. I am sad to say this I just hope you all can improved and revive the food being offered as it once was. Both previous visits the managers took our food back at their own discretion and offered is free items to go to compensate. Just sad..   I'm giving 2 starts because I know the waitresses are giving it their all. I recognize one from little ems and still received the impeccable service I did there but she just can't uphold the same standard."

It won't work and they will not accept them because of the issues on Open Table's end. It's not their fault. Open Table messed up.   They have excellent customer service. They took care of me when they were having issues with my Open Table reward card. I tried the biscuit eggs in a basket brunch dish. It was a fried biscuit with eggs ,bacon and cheese in the middle of it sitting on a bunch of fries. It was just okay to me. The biscuit should have been a bit bigger with more in the middle. You do get a lot of fries. It could have been better in my opinion.   The dessert was a completely different story. The fried pecan pie with soft serve was delicious. I love pecan pie and it definitely hit the spot. I highly recommend trying their fried pies when you are eating there. You will be very happy.   The customer service and dessert made it a very nice experience for me. I will be back."

The fried chicken is awesome, and it is, without a doubt, the most tender fried chicken I've ever had. It manages a lovely, yummy breading with an incredibly tender and moist chicken underneath.   For those who have read my other reviews, you may be wondering what the drinks are like. They're great! Well.... The exactly one I have tried is. I can't bring myself to try anything but the watermelon fishbowl with my husband. So yes, my review is based on one dish and one drink....  But I absolutely stand by it.   Oh, and the bartenders are super friendly, haven't met one I didn't like!"

                "description": "Came here with girlfriends to celebrate friendships and girls night out!   This location is perfect as you get to enjoy dinner, drinks and a lot of entertainment around you or just sit and people watch.  Reservations were a breeze on open table and we were seated right on time.   What I - the menu, the prices, the choices, clean restaurant. The TVs at the bar and the patio seating just makes this a restaurant with a lot of potential to be a favorite.  Our food experience however was not the best. I think the branding dish here is the fried chicken and we all hit the spicy chicken. The girls added Mac and cheese and I chose the greens as a side. The honey biscuit was of course delicious as you can't go around with fried dipped in honey ...yummy!  The chicken was  nothing special at all. I was expecting this incredible memorable bite full of crunch and flavor...meh. Max wine dive restaurant chicken left me with this response not this place. I also wasn't spicy not very hot in temp.  The greens also were luke warm and loaded with bacon. I love the southern touch but I personally would ask for a little more green than meat. I'm glad I didn't get the Mac n cheese as this was not very creamy, hot or impressive either. Pretty much it was a lackluster eating experience.  I don't now how my gumbo went to terribly wrong but it did leading to 3 failed tries. All I asked for was gumbo (super hot) with no rice. 1st cup comes out borderline cold. 2nd cup comes out thick warmed up full of sticky rice. Last cup was what I presume kitchen making a quick roux and throwing in sausages and that's what I got. I gave up after this. The manager was available, attentive and at least listened to my issue and resolved my taking off the gumbo. But Southerleigh all I needed you to do was just warm up the first cup. Throw it in a sauce pot or microwave and heat it up. I would have been a happy customer. I really wanted to experience the gumbo.  Drinks were superbly made. At least we did enjoy this and had wonderful toast to the night.   Overall there is a lot of things to try on this menu to come back but in my two visits the Luke warm food is one of the biggest opportunities."

                "description": "This is our second or third time here. We had lunch here this part Friday at 11.I actually think we were the first ones in here. I ordered the hush puppies for an app, which after we placed the order we didn't see our server until it came out. Hush puppies were very chewy. My husband ordered the 1/4 fried chicken and shrimp boil: he really enjoyed his meal. I ordered the Meatloaf Pie. I'm a sucker for meatloaf and rice and gravy. I wasn't sure where the \"pie\" factored in, but I was intrigued. It turned out to be their meat pie on a bed of rice and gravy. The meat pie crust was over-fried, hard to chew. What is going on in the kitchen??!. I just scraped the meat out. My meal was sooo disappointing. Oh, and it took an extremely long time for our meal to come out. Again, we were one of the first people in here.  While we were waiting, I noticed the partition next to us (with the bird cage wire) was extremely dusty. While the overall place may appear tidy, it's clearly not clean. Our server was nice. The three stars are for her and the fact that my husband at least enjoyed his meal. This visit solidified it for me that we won't be coming back here when we're on this side of town. DO NOT waste your money on the Meatloaf Pie."

                "description": "Shared the rotisserie half bird: Delicious. Biscuits: also delicious. Fries were a mistake. They were cold and weren't worth it. Try a different side, hopefully it will live up to the reputation of the chicken.  Fishbowl cocktail was also a mistake. It was an intense amount of sugar. Struggled so hard to finish it. Honestly I would have left it there after a few sips, but I'm not a quitter. It would have been a better tasting drink if I had ordered it in a smaller size. Gluttony got me that afternoon.  The restaurant itself is very large.. Seems so small from the outside. Super clean. Friendly staff. They have both indoor and outdoor patio seating. TVs surrounded the bar, so no need to skip the sports games."

The Haute tea was a delicious cocktail too! This was my second time and I came back for the honey biscuits and was disappointed that they changed. Bring the honey biscuits back please! The new biscuit was good if you like a traditional southern biscuit but that honey biscuit you had before one was a standout for sure!  The waiter said you have had mixed reviews on the biscuit so maybe have both to choose from, the haute honey biscuit or traditional biscuit."

I've been here before and my Daddy loves their fried chicken. My Uncle ordered the Oyster BLT. He had never heard of an Oyster BLT. He said it sounds so simple but funny he has never had it before and he is turning 53 at the end of the month. My Uncle loved his Oyster BLT so I wanted to write a review. If you like Oysters, order Southerleigh Haute South's Oyster BLT, you won't be upset."

The Bad: the Chicken and Shrimp gumbo WASN'T...there were NO SHRIMP and we got Chicken skin...if they relabeled it Sausage and Okra Gumbo then you would have something!!! We had to request our Honey Biscuits that were included with our meals...we asked the manager if the Biscuits were made from scratch and he said they are, but they look and taste suspiciously like the were popped from a can.  We both had the 1/4 Chicken w/ Fries...the Chicken didn't standout good or bad...the fries...naw  The Ugly: We noticed the couple behind us get up and leave because they were seated and forgotten...afterwards a Server walked by their table and saluted the table to \"the Customers gone forever\"!!!  This isn't a bad place, but I didn't have pleasurable dining experience and nothing to compel me back...I hope they tighten up because they have potential...just too many stumbles for me...Good Luck!!!"

Nice , bright and clean like an upscale kitchen. I had the 1/4 fried chicken spicy with a side of collard greens and from what the waitress stated the chicken can vary with heat from day to day. You can get it just fried with no spice if the heat isn't your thing. Crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside. There is a lot to choose from on the menu so I'll be going back."

                "description": "I think it's hard to dislike any food tour, even if the food is OK, and not that special.  I think they have kind of a \"built-in\" advantage over other types of tours for that reason.   I'm speaking from experience as we've taken one now each place we travel to (if they have one) for the last 6 years, which is when it seems many good ones began to get started (US).  I noticed the reviews so far are all from people in San Antonio. Nothing wrong with that - I live here too.  However, none mention having taken other food tours they've taken so as to compare it.  When you do, I find this tour a bit pricey and not balanced. I know it's a about the food for the most part and was the main reason we took it despite the cost.  Yet, I was hoping for a true overall cultural experience like the best food tours we've done.  That way you walk away satisfied gastronomically but also feel like you'd received a real \"taste\" of the city's culture you're visiting while allow your palate to rest while \"digesting\" things other than food.  As I stated above, most food tours get good reviews, so I believe this is what helps separate the stand-outs from the average."

It is such a great idea for tourists that do not  have enough time to try all the hot spots or for locals that want to try something different. Our guide was knowledgable about the places we went and the ingredients used in our food. We had a food and beverage sampling at several popular restaurants. Every place we went had our table ready for us and hot food out within minutes. I am a vegetarian and each place had something for me. At the end of the evening  we were stuffed. The next day we made reservations to return to our favorite place on the tour (Bliss). If you are visiting San Antonio this tour should not be missed."

It is a divey place right on the Riverwalk north of downtown and the beer prices are cheap but it wasn't as funky or cool as I had hoped.  They were holding their Halloween party so some of the patrons were in costume which added to the \"atmosphere\".  The band had one of the worst sound systems I have ever heard - it makes those PA systems on subway systems sound clear.  Overall it is worth the trip out here but not sure it is the five star experience that many claim."

                "description": "Cheap beer... Yes! ... Always cheap beer at VFWs!   Well maybe they don't have the cheapest beer here as this is a little more of a tourist stop being right on the River Walk Museum Reach... but you do get a discount if you are a VFW member, which I am a Lifetimer thanks to my mother signing me up while she was actively involved with the original VFW at Canyon Lake in Satller.  Post 76 is open to the general public and they welcome everyone with a smile... just note, many VFWs are member only posts just to serve our Veterans of Foreign Wars. Please thank them for their service. Freedom is not Free! This post host several events during the year, including Fiesta San Antonio, so keep your eyes and ears open for something in the future. It does get crowed during events tho so just a warning They have a big band stand and beer garden outside along the river. It's really cool place to just hang out. I like it a whole lot better when it's a slow regular night.   VFW Post 76 is the oldest post in Texas, chartered June 26, 1917, by veterans of the Spanish American War. In 1946, They moved their post to this beautiful Victorian house located on the banks of the San Antonio River... and just in this past decade, the River Walk was expanded to what is now known as Museum Reach which makes this such an amazing location.   According to their website: \"There are rumors of two ghosts, which also adds to the houses mystic. Members attest to seeing a girl running up and down the stairs and an old man who likes to move furniture. They both share the name of \"Charley\".\"  This is a MUST DO when seeing Puro San Antonio!"

                "description": "The history alone makes this a great stop in San Antonio adventures, however it's location on the Riverwalk takes this VFW to the next level. My husband and I are both lifetime members and self professed VFW experts. This-location is open to the public. We came by early on a Saturday afternoon with our kids. Drinks are SO cheap. They have karaoke and snacks but no food. Members were friendly which isn't always the case at lots of VFWs unfortunately. My husband is a seasoned combat Veteran from OIF and still has felt unwelcomed at several backwards locations which didn't seem to enjoy or welcome members under 50. I'm female so I rarely feel welcome at Veterans nonprofits. This one was different.  Texas seems to treat female Veterans pretty well. Seems to be cultural. We loved the history and canal view. The yard outside was packed with tourists. We were inside because Texas is HOT! I think they have fun events and concerts here. Too bad they didn't have food though. My kids will enjoy the big yard when weathers better. They have free concerts outside on the weekends."

It's huge and has a lot of great people that are regulars.  Yes, it is for veterans but it is open to the general public.  With that said, drink prices do vary for general public vs if you are active duty or a member.  Some days there are live music which is pretty cool because they perform outside.  Some days they have food for sale..  that may be tacos or something.  I can say, there have been plenty times we have been able to come and just hang out...  for hours... sit and laugh with friends, watch a game or come and dance.  It is on our must hit spots when we are out and about in the beautiful Alamo City.."

The truth is veterans have lived a certain life that people outside the military simply don't understand. This is the perfect place for them to find the support and camaraderie they often need after they get out.  That being said, not being a veteran myself I love this place. It's often calm with good music on the jukebox, and friendly regulars and members. And did I mention the beer is CHEAP?  They often have events going on with live music, and they are right along a part of the Riverwalk.   If you haven't been here yet it is definitely worth checking out!"

                "description": "At this point there is no part of The River walk that hasn't been touched by expansion in some way. But as you walk closer toward the area near The Ten-Eleven or The Luxury you will see one particular spot, untouched by time. The VFW Post 76 is a historic place with a lore all its own. It is a place on any given night, especially on weekends where cold beers, jukebox music is blaring and people are having a good time.        It is an old building reminiscent of the one you will find in the King William area. Outside there are chairs and depending on the event the place is either packed or lightly inhabited. There is ample space on the grounds to walk with your drinks. It serves as a good intermediary between some fancy watering hole and an icehouse.       But mainly the VFW is known when it hosts certain events like the various food truck competitions and the numerous festivals it has here. Patrons that frequent this place can run the gamut from Pearl Brewery Apartment dwellers, bicyclists, hipsters, parents, lounge lizards, professionals, seniors looking for cheap Lone star beer etc. Whenever you go you are never sure what crowd to expect.       There is a very laid back vibe intermixed with a quirkiness to it. On one end of the floor you might see a couple straight out of an Urban Outfitters Catalog and just across the way you will see seniors sporting Lite beers, like it was some dance. At night the VFW takes on a romantic quality accompanied by the lights that guide The Riverwalk way.       In addition the servers and patrons alike are usually a friendly crowd. The beers are cheap and the Selena cover bands are even louder. Contrary to what people have said finding a parking spot can be hairy since The Luxury and The Ten Eleven people park in the same area as well. The later you go the less you are inclined to find a space. It's best to car pool with friends, especially when they have events like The Taco Truck Showdown. Either way there is fun to be had by all here.      The VFW Post 76 is a unique spot. It feels like a place untouched by time but relevant to any generation that goes here. The beers are cheap but it is rich in history and charm.    ps. If you are so inclined check out a video of a local band called, \"Pillow Talk ~ Slip of the Pen\" It was filmed at the VFW and captures the spirit of this place."

                "description": "A place for veterans, a place for families of veterans. Called the \"White House\" the Victorian architecture is a shining example of what's being lost all along the San Antonio river as new buildings begin to become common.  As a veteran I'm proud of my fellow compatriots and here we can share stories and create new memories together.   Currently VFW #76 is going under some maintenance and construction to rehabilitate this old beauty.  Come down and enjoy a few pints and meet the San Antonio veterans."

Being a child of a veteran of Foreign Wars was greeted with such hospitality in this historical building. We enjoyed a couple beers sitting up stairs on the veranda listening to country tunes. They have a memorial room that was emotional for me as we celebrate soldiers life's for our rights and freedom.  Prices are reasonable for this Beer and Wine establishment. Country tunes are the groove. Totally a fun place to hang out!"

Had heard I needed to check it out. It was a Lazy Saturday and not many around other than a couple regulars.  Really loved the casual ambiance.  The venue looked great and next time in town will try to catch some live music at night but what a cool building with great grounds and great location and supports our troops!  5 Stars!"

It was fun people watching if I'm completely honest. They offer family style seating so be prepared to cozy up to someone you may not know. There are lots of seating outside and everyone was friendly. It looked pretty full the day we visited but after asking a few tables for available seats, we found our spot. The beer is cold, music is upbeat and everyone rocks late into the night. Great place to unwind after work with friends. I'll visit again soon!!"

                "description": "VFW post 76 in San Antonio Texas is the oldest functioning post in our state. It's equally great regardless of if you are a veteran or not. All are welcome.  In the hustle and bustle of the Riverwalk it's a great place to stop in, relax, have a cold beverage and enjoy the conversation with any veterans that you are lucky enough to encounter. My husband happens to be a veteran and served in Vietnam. I find that it's very good for him to be around other veterans when we have the opportunity. He doesn't ever share stories about his time overseas. Sadly, it was not only unpopular because of the military aspects of war, but many in our great nation were downright disrespectful to the men and women who served there. Sometimes as they were returning home or being dispatched, drafted or not..... Anyway- This VFW post is in a very well-kept older home and reminds me of a plantation style residence. All beverages are icy cold, and it's a beautiful environment. You can sit and watch barges go by on the river and during the holidays the river is lit with thousands of lights and barges full of caroling children! They also frequently have live music.  It's definitely worth a stop."

On top of the great food and beer selection,  the atmosphere is good too, plenty of TVs for watching of the Sports! The outside patio is well set up and awesome even in the winter, they stoke up the heaters and keep ya toasty.   Y'all kick ass Dog Häus!"

Had the Beyond Brat, tots, and a cocktail each. Ordering was easy. Not too long of a wait for the food. Total was about $50 which seems pretty high; really should have been about half that.   Don't get me wrong - it was pretty tasty. The brat was crispy and juicy, toppings were fresh, tots perfectly golden brown. The ketchup was in little packets, which seems wasteful to me. Cocktail was served in a chilled mug, flavorful and fulfilling. Portions were just right too: filling, but not too much food like most places."

I personally loved their \"Chili Idol\" ( Chili Cheese Dog with onions ), \"Chili the Kid\" ( Chili Cheese dog with White American Cheese, Chipotle Aioli, and Fried Onions ) and their \"Fonz\" ( Sausage Dog with Spicy Italian, Pastrami, and Mozzarella  Cheese ). Chili cheese fries were great too! Definitely a nice addition to the Northside.   FYI: They have a fully stocked bar with all your favorite liquors and at least 50+ craft beers to choose from."

                "description": "My Dad loves hotdogs so I thought to bring him to Dog Haus for both of us to try.  There was an extensive beer menu and also cocktails. You go up to the line to order your food and drinks, they give you a number and bring everything to your table. The big draw was the outdoor seating. There's even a small putting green.  Dad and I split the cowboy hotdog and onion rings. I meant to split the corn dog with him too but he was full. The food came out quick and the food was delicious and fresh. Dad had fountain drinks while I had the Sunset Strip.  Hopefully our experience paying was a one-off issue. We tried 2 different registers and I couldn't pay with my credit card. Ended up paying cash. Thankfully, I had cash with me."

We sat at the indoor/outdoor bar (the outdoor/patio side) which was very pleasant.  Many, many types of beer are available.  Many reviewers suggested their burgers so I tried one.  Very fresh, tasty and flavorful cheese burger although I am not a fan of burgers served on King's Hawaiian buns.  I was not impressed by the fries at all.  I will probably return and try a dog.  They looked tasty."

                "description": "Came here on a Sunday afternoon to try it out!    Dog friendly patio was nice to have available.   Food was all very tasty and happy hour on the weekend was great.   We will be back,  just with some new found awareness.   Ordering at the counter can be confusing because I wasn't brought the beer I ordered,  so not sure what happened with that- had to go to the bar later and ask for it.   Customers on the patio didn't put their trays away so food and trash blew all over the patio.   I went inside to ask if someone could sweep the patio - my dog was trying to eat all the food on the ground.   Was told they were short staffed and she would let someone know.   I offered to sweep it myself and also to clean down the tables if they would let me.   I understand short staffing.  More outdoor patios should have table cleaning wipes for customers to use when the restaurant is busy.    Eventually someone was able to come out and get things swept and cleaned up.   The staff also couldn't figure out how to get the fans to come on outside. It was nearly 90 degrees and the breeze would have been appreciated.  It wasn't for a lack of trying,  3 different employees tried to get them on.   Mostly this patio isn't ideal for San Antonio as it faces west and south,  so full sun in the afternoon.   After sundown might be better.  Maybe some sun awnings eventually.   Will definitely be back,  the Sunday happy hour was good!  And we thoroughly enjoyed the beer and food selections.  Casual easy going for sure."

                "description": "After a morning of fall festivities at the pumpkin patch and corn maze, kiddo and I were looking for something to fill our tummies - so, while we didn't eat there, we did finally grab some Dog Haus to try at home, and the establishment is so funky and pleasant, we definitely want to come back and done in eventually.  I was planning on reviewing four stars and holding off on a rave review until we actually ate inside, but I have to bump up to five right off the bat because my little dude, who can be notoriously picky and outright refuse to eat if someplace is unfamiliar, inhaled his food from here and dipped into mine. And he ate the grilled onions on our food - I don't know if you realize how hard it is to get any vegetable into my four-year-old's mouth without a war breaking out.   We started with the corn dog sliders, and we knew we were in for a good experience because the batter was great and had a perfect crunch to the outside, and was just thick enough. And the actual dog itself? EXCELLENT. Back in California, there was a giant corn dog at a market/fair I used to attend that I loved with a passion, and this made me think of that. In and of itself, the dog really shines in the corn dog.  Moving on the to actual hot dog with toppings, the Cowboy - I have to say I barely got a nibble in of this one, because my son loved it and made sure our plans of splitting everything and making sure he, myself, and grandma got an equal taste of everything went out the window. I sometimes get nervous when I hear \"bacon-wrapped\" about a hot dog because I worry it will be a thick, gross, undercooked bandage of bacon around a hot dog. Not the case here! No squishy bacon here! Great texture especially with the crispy onions and my son was a huge fan of the cheese sauce.  And the Holy Aioli burger on the Hawaiian rolls? Those rolls are a staple in our house and these were nicely toasted through with a great crunch to them that kept the bread from getting soggy. I wish the meat patty were a little meatier but the toppings were so delicious, I can forgive anything. They could've forgotten the meat and served me a sandwich with just the toppings and I would have no qualms paying full price for that, it was so good.  Overall, I am really happy with this place and can't wait until kiddo and I finally make time to eat there! So good!"

This is a cool spot with plenty of TVs to watch sports, a ton of cold beer, and good food, too!   I tried the Big Kahuna Burger which seems to be a limited time offering, but I am  hoping they keep it on the menu.   Served on Hawaiian rolls with onion rings, bacon, peppers, cheese, and sauces, this is a tasty burger! The flavors and textures combine very nicely.   They have fries, tots, and (my favorite) sweet potato fries to accompany the burgers and hot dogs.   A sports bar atmosphere yet very clean and well lit located at 281 and Stone Oak is just what the area needs.   I'll definitely be back.

Not only was our order incorrect, but we were also missing our daughters burger.  When we called to ask for a refund for the item we ordered but did not receive, an employee picked up the phone but did not answer.  You could hear all the ambient noise in the background going on, and we kept saying hello-hello-hello to no avail.  We then hung up and called back and the employee decided to turn on their voicemail system.  The phone would ring once and go to voicemail.  We ended up having to split our dinner amongst the family with the food we did receive, and had to physically drive back to the establishment to ask for a refund for the 12$ burger we did not receive, all while gas prices are through the roof!  We will never frequent this establishment ever again."

They have an ample beer selection and great cocktails to try. The food is good, I don't think I can complain about it. However if you're expecting to be blown away, you will leave disappointed. They are hotdogs with cool toppings. I do think that the toppings get in the way of the quality of the meat and bread. I almost regret getting what I got because the sauces and toppings get in the way of the true quality ingredients. Next time I will try a more classic and basic hotdog."

I was disappointed that they couldn't do a wurst corn dog using Beyond brat. I was also disappointed that they didn't have the impossible sliders.  So, we ended up trying a regular mini corn dog, The old town dog, The beyond brat, chili cheese fries, onion rings, and coleslaw.  The coleslaw was lacking flavor. Of course, you can't mess up fries or onion rings. Those were good. The beyond brat was smaller than expected, but had good flavor. The old town dog was a lot of bread and a little bit of dog.   For drinks, we had a lady in red and the blind melon. The lady in red reminded me of a sangria. The blind melon was sweet.   You order first and then sit down. Someone brings out your food and drinks.  They have inside and outside seating. The outside seating is under a covered patio. They also have a good list of beers. There's a small area where you can play corn hole. Parking is available on site and plentiful."

The food was amazing, the service was good, and the atmosphere was welcoming. I enjoyed the total experience. I appreciate that the menu has options for everyone. As a restricted eater, I hate going to places that only serve pork or beef. This place has pork, beef, chicken and vegetarian options. So it's great for a variety of people. Def can not wait to go back."

                "description": "Five stars for cleanliness, fast service, and friendly staff!  Went here for lunch today and can definitely say nobody there was put in the dog house!  The menu linked to Yelp is not the same menu at this location. I was surprised to find this is a franchised establishment. Several items were the same, but some items were not offered at this location. I've included a picture of this location's food menu.  There was a \"special dog\" poster at the register, a bahn mi type, which will be offered for a limited time. We ordered the Old Town, chili dog, a side order of mini corn dog, and a side of onion rings.  The buns are King Hawaiian mini slider buns. They leave 3 together, slice in the middle, and fill. Made it very convenient to cut into thirds and share.   The beer part of this Biergarten is well stocked. Looked close to as many as the monk's....well, maybe not as many, but darn well had a large selection to choose from. We ordered the Save the World 2 offerings- AngusDei and Fructus Bonam.  I preferred the AD to be paired with the food.   They have a nice pub type menu with a variety of foods and beers. Nice to have a great new eatery so close to home!"

I do think the food is a little overpriced for what it is though. With that being said this isn't my top choice when eating out but we will probably be back to enjoy food while our son runs around."

                "description": "My wife and I have been frequent guests at Jazz TX since it opened, and the experience has always been outstanding!  From the speak easy vibe of going under the Food Hall to find the club through a small door and behind the curtains, through to the music, the drinks and now an outstanding food menu.  Jazz TX doesn't disappoint. The decor, the lighting, the backdrop and the intimacy of the low stage right in front of you - it is everything I wanted for jazz. We always enjoy relaxing with music from Doc Watkins and his band.  There is a never ending parade of quality jazz artists and ensembles that come through to perform, so check the calendar and make a reservation!  My only request is a little more room between the tables - add a foot in each direction around the table for servers, patrons walking and comfort, and maybe some padded chairs?  I can't complain - its jazz music at its very best in a setting that is every bit a cool jazz bar.  Thank you Doc Watkins for a great place!!"

I can't recall the martini i ordered but it has a great light pear taste that wasn't overly sweet. Doc Watkins band is brilliant.

                "description": "Date night!!! Was so excited to take my GF out.  She loves their old fashion.  Food and drinks were great.  Except, I had to eat my tacos cold.    Faviola was our server.  She gave us time to look at the menu.  We ordered pasta, Bruschetta, shrimp tacos to start off. Later we ordered chips and queso, pecan pie and coffee.  Not to mention her three old fashions and my jack and coke.  Bruschetta came out (3 pieces of bread with shrimp).  Delicious!!!  Then my tacos came out and we waited for the pasta. And waited. And waited.  My tacos got cold as we waited for her pasta.  Finally Faviola comes around, we asked about the pasta and she said she didn't hear the order.  PAUSE: no apology or let me make this right, just I'll go place the order.  So now my tacos get colder waiting for the pasta.  Common sense  as a server is to ask to remake the other dish.    Just need to tighten up that customer service.  I even told my GF that it looked like she stereotyped us before  she came to the table.  Other than that the band was great, food tasted good minus the cold tacos. 3 stars for the food and band."

                "description": "In this review I will cover the GOOD, THE BAD, and THE UGLY.  For my wife's birthday, I took my family (6 adults) to the show and had dinner/drinks where I spent around $500 for the show and dinner.  THE GOOD- location, food, the band, service       Located in San Antonio's  Pearl District, with free parking.  Jazz TX is located in the basement under the Pearl's Food Court.  It was a cozy little venue that holds about 60 people.  All tables had great views of the band's stage.       No complaints on the TASTE of the food.       The singer, \"Doc\"  and his band were very entertaining.  Doc kept the audience laughing in between songs. They put on a great show.       The service-  a constant flow of people ensuring your every needs are met.  This was great but also added to THE BAD below.  THE BAD - I guess I was expecting a Dinner and a show.  The kind of place you pay for an over priced meal for a free show.  At Jazz TX you pay to watch the show and also pay for over priced dinner options.       Food Menu - Very limited menu.  They have four large dinner items.  If the large plates are the \"large\" portions, the \"small\"  must be tiny!  I remind you their food was tasty!       Music - Having visited Jazz venues in New Orleans my family's expectations were a little different.  The music at Jazz TX was more \"early Jazz,\" like the \"Big Band Music\" genre.  Not exactly what we wanted but we're willing to take in the show.  Thanks to Doc and the Band we were entertained.  THE UGLY - lack of management!  There was a patron who entered drunk, was constantly criticizing the singer and the band throughout the entire show.  He was so loud that people from three rows of tables away turned their heads.  This drunk even faced time somebody, holding his phone up over his head and yelled in order to communicate with the person he called.  I could not believe the employees totally ignored him.  This was quiet annoying and ruined a good night.  With all the servers constantly walking through the very small venue, why would they not do or say something?  So for the lack of management, and limited menu I give the venue an average score of three.  If you want to spend money and allow the management have drunks run the place, then I highly recommend Jazz TX.  Maybe in between the yelling you might be able to enjoy the show you paid to watch."

                "description": "Finally got the chance to check out Jazz Tx at the Pearl! I was impressed with the atmosphere and the facilities themselves.   The music was great! Friday night is a great time to come out and enjoy the music especially since they do get crowd interaction.   The food: a few different options to wet any palette but still bar food just a little bit more fancy and overpriced. We ordered the burger and shrimp dish which came out hot and picture worthy.   The burger tasted so good and was cooked to perfection. It was bursting with flavor and the onion jam really did set it off and I don't like onions.   The shrimp dish was very good also. Nothing too complicated or special but tasted really  Save your coin and dine somewhere else and then come and enjoy the music. The food is overpriced and you can enjoy great food somewhere else first. Plus the service was not very good at all. Our server was inattentive and only came back for the check."

                "description": "I've noticed every year more and more events are being planned specifically around, \"Dia De Los Muertos.\" There are food, drink and now the city's first river parade to celebrate it. So why not an event named after a local craft beer? Well the Freetail Brewing Co. has been doing one for a decade named after you guessed it, a seasonal beer. It's called \"La Muerta\", a much sought after stout in the craft beer circle.  I have been wanting to do this event for years but like Pat Benatar says, \"Life's what happens when you make other plans.\" Needless to say I bought general admission tickets for $30 bucks and some change. The price includes a sample glass, eight tickets for 8 small pours and a bottle of \"La Muerta.\" Initially when I came I was anticipating a full house. Instead the crowd was at a manageable level, you could freely maneuver through. In keeping with the theme there were artisan's booths, mariachis and people dressed in elaborate costumes.  In the main area where the brewing tanks are stationed a sample pouring table is set up. They had different variants of \"La Muerta\" alongside beers pulled from their cellar. Looking at the sample glass and the size of the pours one assumes if the price merits what's served. However the samples are deceptively strong and sneak up on you. By my fifth pour I was feeling as limber as a ghost. My only critique is in the seating arrangements. There were little to no available tables once it was in full swing. Even the usage of communal  benches limits the spacing of this event. Next year they need to increase possible seating or allow you to bring your own chairs.  In addition whole pours were not being sold if you enjoyed a specific variant. I thought this was kinda lame but not a dealbreaker. I know that a limited supply of barrels are created for the festival. I hope next year they will reconsider allowing you to buy limited snifter sized pours. Having said all these things this festival is still unique. The crowd are all stout- hounds who want to taste a beer that is here from a short time, then is gone. It almost seems like a metaphor for life. Ok I'll stop my Waldo Emerson stylings, at least for now.  If you wanna try something different and you love local craft beer like myself go seek this event. It happens only once a year. Don't forget to leave a drink for your loved ones. Hopefully one day someone will return the sentiment back."

                "description": "When you hear the word BUS one would normally think about a city bus or there like. This is not the case for the Crafty Thirst Beer Bus, no it's a VW van that is being used to serve beer. We were passing by and noticed a sign that said Grand Opening. We stopped to check out this Grand Opening. We were approached by this creepy guy smoking a cigarette as he said do you have ID, we showed our drivers licenses and instead of saying thank you, have a nice day anything he just stared at us. We were reading the list of beers that were offered. It was a little confusing as there was no direction on what the beers were are how much they were. We decided to order at the VW \"BUS\". We were asking what different types of beers were available and how much they were. The guy that was helping us (later found out was the one of the owners) passed us to someone else. We thought that was rude but the lady that served us made up for it. The beers were $7.00 dollars for a 9 ounce or you could get 4 -  7 ounces for $10.00 dollars to me that is extremely high. Most of the places in Canyon Lake have beers for $2.50. The beer we had, had more of a foam head on it and we were not offered to top it off. Another guy was serving mixed drinks one with Pecan Rum. The mixed drinks were $7.00 dollars, high for the area and the amount you get. I will confess that the rum was one of the best I have had. A few times I heard other people saying that the price's were too high. If you can get a beer for $2.50 then why would someone pay $7.00 dollars. The band was the only entertainment and they were amazing. There was suppose to be a raffle for the VW BUS but when I asked about it I was told that it was not going to take place. This was troubling being that I was told by the owner that it was the main giveaway."

ICONIC. kristi waters, kendoll, mehgan dlux, natasha capri, i would die for any of them. honestly  it was my favorite drag brunch of all time. i told kendoll i would die for her and that i'm in love with her and she said it back and gave me a peck. and on the subject of her, my god y'all she's SO GORGEOUS and her outfits... they make me drool. i need her closet. after the show, i was going to the restroom and ran into kendoll and mehgan at the elevator. we actually had an emotional conversation and i absolutely adore them.  i also went to a peep show here and they had an aerial dancer, dessany, and she is beyond beautiful and incredibly talented. so sweet, too! i spoke with her after the show and took a picture with her, and then spoke with kristi waters, also very kind, and got a picture with her as well.  the queens and other performers here are so lively and fun, the drinks are good, the atmosphere is amazing. the whole place is \"instagram worthy\" lol. they make you feel included and they're very interactive. hands down my favorite spot in sa and i recommend it to everyone!"

                "description": "THE TWO STARS ARE NOT FOR THE DRAG PERFORMERS! They get a 10/10. The rest of the experience tanked the review considerably. I have not been here since I had my birthday here in 2016, a private birthday/political party in 2017, and the Möet White party in 2017. What a difference a few years makes! First let me give the drag show its props. The show was absolutely amazing. It energized the crowd, it had me on the edge of my seat, they all gave 150%. I loved them all.   Now for the WHOMP WHOMP part...the food, drinks, and billing. They do not have enough tables to set food/drinks upon. Mimosas were ok because we made them ourselves. These $18 \"specialty\" drinks were underwhelming. The food was very close to being tasteless and there was a hair-thin layer of avocado on the toast, which looked more like the guacamole in a bag from the store than fresh avocado. I pay less for heaps of fresh avocado on fancy toast at brunch restaurants. My friend ordered the charcuterie board and the set-up was unappealing. Paper thin meat slices and cheese slices, a handful of almonds thrown on top, one lone strawberry, and 4 olives. The drink I ordered was all looks and no substance. I never received my last drink, a whiskey Sprite, but I bet I was charged for it because my friend interrupted my itemization with the server, Angie, and told her to charge it all on her card but my card was STILL CHARGED. Not just charged though...overcharged! The server was asking me what was mine, so how could they charge my card anything if they didn't know what I ordered and if my friend then proceeded to pay the whole tab? Plus they do not give you a receipt or anything showing what they charged you for. If this charge posts to my account, I'll have to make a very unpleasant phone call. If you go, just get a bottle of Prosecco and make mimosas and wait to go to real brunch afterward."

                "description": "Ok so I'm sorta confused about this place. Went here a couple years with my husband and it was pretty cool with the exception they wouldn't let him vape outside. So I figured I'd give it a try for valentines weekend (this weekend) since he's no longer vaping. I decided to look at the Instagram for paramour last night and boy was I glad I did.  Based on the photos and videos this place has turned into more of a gay bar and male review joint. I'm absolutely not homophobic in any way but I'm pretty darned sure my husband wouldn't be able to appreciate a bunch of dudes dressed up like ladies and grinding and flipping all over the place while we're trying to have a romantic evening.  I noticed there were hardly any photos of the drag and male review happenings at this place on the yelp but their Instagram is pretty much nothing but those things. Either way, I decided to cancel tonight's reservation and find a place a little more tame since it says there is yet another drag show going on this evening there.  If the owner reads this it would be nice to know what's going on over there and if there are any nights where it's just a bar and restaurant for those not into drag shows or male review. Thanks!"

                "description": "The drag show is amazing! The entertainment is top notch for south Texas and you'll love Kristi Waters! Make sure to arrive early if you're planning on attending the drag brunch so you can sit inside under the industrial size fans otherwise you'll get to experience Texas hell size heat outside.  Bring your friends for an amazing time with the drag show.  Make sure to pre-eat and pre-drink because the food is by far the worst brunch food in SA (sorry not sorry) and the drinks were overpriced and ehhh (unimpressive).  I would have rated a 3 star but for the amazing time we had because of the AMAZING DRAG SHOW!   Come with a group and get there early!"

They have \"mock tails\" but if i paid $20 for a ticket then why do i have to get a drink minimum? Second, my partner has a bad back and wasn't allowed to use the elevator when we wanted to leave so they're not accessible friendly. Third, the drag queen host only talked about s*x and booze. As a local San Antonian, I hate to think this is what tourists experience when they visit."

You have to climb 4 flights of stairs! She made it to the top but couldn't breathe for a bit :( :(     2) under the FAQ section, it clearly says that there is a 15% service charge included in all prices... so \"tipping isn't necessary but welcomed\"..... okay so that justifies the $18 price tag on drinks... WRONG!! When I settled my tab, the waitress asked for a tip?!?! Saying prices don't include tip?!?! Are you kidding me?? 3) not real brunch. There is only like 5 food items :( so get tipsy and walk down 4 flights of stairs!!!   I wish it was better!"

                "description": "Bought tickets for Sunday drag brunch. Got an email that said seating started at 10 when really it started at 11 - conflicting reservation / event messages. Got there and the seating process was extremely disjointed. Since we were early as a party, we expected good seating as it is \"first come first serve\" and they tried to sit our group of 6 on a bench along the wall without any tables. We had to ask to be seated at a table where our group could actually see one another and hang out.   Once we got settled, it was obvious the drinks were ridiculously overpriced. $14 for a mimosa. And they don't have coffee for brunch? Kinda wild. On top of that the menu was extremely limited and for a place that claims they want to emulate luxury and have a dress code, they really don't serve nice food. The avocado toast is basically packaged guac on plain un toasted bread.   The area is nice on the rooftop but honestly not really conducive to a drag show. Depending on where you get sat, you may only see half of the performance.   The queens were great, only good part about the drag brunch."

Aside from the beer, the drinks are somewhat expensive, but I guess you're also paying for the view and the atmosphere. The waiters are very attentive, and the place is just as beautiful on the outside patio as it is in the inside bar/lounge area. We had some of their cocktails as well as beer, and all of it was great. This is definitely a cool place to go and splurge a bit for a date night, or a night out with friends!"

                "description": "Let me start by saying, I've been to many Drag Shows and enjoyed them all....BUT!!!!! this place was the worse experience I've had this far. And friend and I went to their BDSM show the Nighy before Halloween expecting to have a great time..NO MA'AM!. I purchased VIP tickets to the show expecting to have a memorable night only to be denied a seat in the main area. We got there, and was told there were no seat available and were offered 2 lawn type chairs and a wooden bench for a table to sit at, outside. After inquiring about the seating that was open ( mind you, this place is a FIRST COME FIRST SERVE SEATING place), those seat were reserved for larger parties. Of this place is first come first serve we should get the semi-comfortable couches in the building. No, they told us we couldn't sit in these areas. After having a somewhat heated conversation with a so-called manager our night was ruined. Upon asking about a refund since there was no \"seating\" available, we were told we could not get a refund but had to reschedule our visit. He were told we could not pick the night we wanted to reschedule for. WTF is that?!?!?  We asked to sit in a certain area and was told it was I safety hazard. Not 2 seconds later someone was seated exactly where we asked to sit. PLEASE DO BETTER PARAMOUR.  Those of us willing to spend our money should be treated better. Moreover, don't over book your shows and force your customers in uncomfortable positions. I will NOT be back despite the fact that I'm a Kristie Water's fan.. Please step up! To you potential customers, find another place to spend your  funds! Furthermore, spending hours to get into your best  threads to walk up 4 flights of stairs, outside,  just to sweat out your clothes, hair, makeup, lashes, brows hope and dreams to pay $18 for a watered down drink is just enough to wonder...Why Try?!?!????? Please do better."

After watching him serve drinks to everyone around us the group next to us would order water and give it to us. After one hour we left f the show this place sucks and he should be fired.

Then, you go to the bar on the 4th floor and you have to take the stairs all the way up. I was waiting for the dude to say he was kidding. But no... 3 flights of stairs. I got up and then the menu drinks were all about $20 each. The outside chairs were so uncomfortable. They also sit parties together. You and your friends could be sitting on a couch in a circle with chairs and if the chairs are open, a random party will join you. It was just ... strange.  I get the vibes they were trying to give off. The place was semi-cute. But the over priced drinks were killer to me. Upscale restaurants don't even charge that much. I recommend this as a place to stop for one drink during your nightly adventure. Not to stay all night."

A friend of mine ordered the avocado toast and the Chilaquiles. The Chilaquiles is basically HEB corn tortilla chips with an egg on top and some mediocre Ranchero sauce. Not worth as much money as it is on the menu. Also was very cold. Avocado toast wasn't even toasted and see photos. Secondly the performers parking situation is unreal they blocked us in they said it was their parking lot there's no sign that says it's there parking lot there could've been an extreme emergency and no one could get out. And lastly me at the elevator does not work so you have to climb up 5 to 6 flights of stairs just to get to the rooftop. Don't drink too much that could seriously be a traumatic situation quickly. This is supposed to be one of San Antonio's upscale places and I'm just not seeing it here and I'm not afraid to speak the truth. Beautiful atmosphere but need some work."

                "description": "One start is was more then they deserve. Planned a brunch for my friends birthday, purchased tickets online, made reservations, confirmed reservations both via text and on the phone with Angie, explained it was going to be a party of 4 (she claimed to have spoken to my fiend twice) and it was all good to go. Two of us arrive early 10:00am , the people at the door allowed 2 girls in front of us that belong to a party of 16. When we were asked if our group was complete, we explained we are still missing 1 people and we were turned away. The gentleman and the lady at the door stayed if they allowed us is it was going to cause chaos. 2 other people in our group finally arrive only for the lady at the door to say she had no idea we had reservation for a party of more. They wanted to give us a couch and then bring two folding chairs to the section. We decided just to go somewhere else. DONT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS PLACE THAT IS SO ORGANIZED. Didn't even get an apology from the girl at the door."

The servers were their own bartenders.... so they were definitely running around trying their best! Idk if that's how it always is because it was our first time. We will definitely be going back. Can't wait to take our out of town friends!"

                "description": "This is definitely one of my favorite spots here in San Antonio. It's a place that seems inclusive. The staff members were very accommodating to members in the party with disabilities (very appreciative of that). I attended Paramour in the evening for a social event and for the drag show brunch event, which was great to see the change in ambience. The music, furniture, drinks, and staff set a relaxing atmosphere during the evening and exuberance during the drag show. They also have great customer service, so I will definitely return to Paramour in the future. Keep up the great work Paramour staff! :)"

The new owners put a bar, front patio and added some flare.  Love the plates on the ceiling and the choices of draft beer.  Last time we went, it was after Paintballing for a friend's 13 year old son.  So glad to stop in for a cold beer to help the aches and pain of shooting some teenagers!  Amanda was the bartender that day and was great.  She was friendly and talked with us at the bar.  She works weenends and I will be back for her smile.    This is a great bar near us and place every San Antonioian should try at least once."

Tonight was my first day back to this bar since corona and it was really suffering from slow service but it was fine. I must admit the place was full but the bad thing was that an individual physical shoved me out of the bar order area because he wanted to order. I bucked back at him told him I was ordering and if he could just wait until I payed he claimed that that was his bar and next thing u know the bouncers kicked me out. All while he kept claiming and screaming this is my bar. I was respectful and calm while he was aggressive and loud yet I got kicked out. If it was the owner oh well, nice bar I used to love it but I will never be back happy 4th but this vet will find another place."

I'm presuming that your experience will be based on how packed it is and who is in charge that night. If it's really packed, I don't recommend going. However, if it looks like you can make a straight shot to the bar or restrooms, definitely plan on staying for a few hours. The DJ plays music that makes you want to get up and move. That's pretty much all I have to say."

Right away there's some very aggressive rent-a-cops that were being very confrontational and aggressive and  asking if you have weapons or not. I did not go there to get harassed as I'm walking in to entertain two ass clowns. I have had people ask me politely certain questions regarding weapons and and other details but not bulldogging me right as I walk in. This place is a overrated college bar anyway!!

I already felt safer because it's more of an outdoor setting and the tables are plenty spaced out. They also have heaters for the colder nights. The hookah worker they had was beyond nice and helpful. Their bartenders were super friendly going around asking if we needed anything so that we didn't need to go up to the bar. The food truck they have is delicious, I tried their Texas size cheese sticks and they were delicious! DJ had a great mix of music going. Overall the whole night was very enjoyable."

Mostly college students and 20 something year olds, but a chill relaxed atmosphere nonetheless.   Live music is on rotation, and the DJ keeps the mood energized with a good mix of 90s to Top 40 music.   Continued improvements to the plac e as a whole keep it a fun and lively environment. New signage makes great photo ops!   \"Giant\" beer pong played with trash cans and volleyballs is really fun, especially when you've taken advantage of the drink specials a couple times haha  The prices are fairly inexpensive even when not on HH, which adds to the appeal. So Please drink responsibly!"

It felt really good inside lol but it was very loud. Surprisingly all we did was socialize and hardly drank but it was still a great time, just goes to show that you dont always need booze to have fun. The gorgeous and awesome Barkeep Jordan was very nice and had great customer service skills, her and her mini-hers were working hard and looking good. Jordan made sure everyone at the bar was being tended to. They also have a BBQ Truck in the parking lot!!"

When we got to the front we paid $5 each for cover and was escorted to the back outdoor area where we were told to wait for our bartender to come to us... we waited another 50 minutes and no one showed up. So eventually we got tired of waiting to be served and left to find our car broken into. I know that break-in's is not necessarily something that a business can control but I parked in their parking lot where they apparently have security and it still happened. As businesses have to adjust to the new operating expectations, many companies have changed their procedures of service. But in this case we had zero service. One of the guys that cleans tables told us to wait for our bartender after we had already been waiting there for 20 minutes. That's why we kept waiting as long as we did. As long as they continue to operate this way, it's honestly not worth going."

The second time I came here, she remembered my drink. The third time I came here, she had the drink ready for me before I even asked for it. While I was here on my 3rd visit and sitting outside, when she noticed that my drink was low, she already brought me a new one. Hands down best customer service."

                "description": "This bar charges you an extra 1.25 per drink \"to stay open during covid\" this makes NO sense because they serve food anyway. They said you are buying a water bottle when you are charged the extra 1.25 but when I asked for the water bottle they didn't have it to give to me?? Why charge for something you cannot offer. I ordered a double vodka drink, and was charge 1.25 per shot which was 2.50 total for one drink on top of the price of the actual drink. No other bar is doing this. Just raise your prices and be honest- and I would be more than willing to pay more since I know bars have struggled from covid. But charging extra saying you'll get an item(water bottles/chips) that they don't have or won't give you?? What????"

Why not just to the ticket not for every drink crazy. Also I'm gay and I sat down in the middle table of the seating area with my other gay friends and nobody came to serve us just the tables around us, even a freshly seated straight couple got served as soon as they sat down. Raggedy bar with bad table service. The lady bartender was very nice tho!"

We were charged chips and water bottlers we never got and were told that they added it because they need to make up for the beers sold to us to show they are a restaurant so they can remain open!!! My only thought was wow how can you do this to people blindly!  The manager said he would refund $10 of it and apologized stating that the bartenders should have told us that was going to happen! I'm all for bars being open but you can't just add items to someone's bill hoping we wouldn't notice! I can only imagine how many people just sign away and tip without even noticing!!!!!

Although I was not too close to the bar, a server noticed what happened and since my glass was mostly full, she kindly replaced it. What great service!   I always enjoy going to I-10 Icehouse and the great drink specials throughout the week. I haven't had food there but the wings always smell delicious. I also enjoy that they have many activities people can be entertained with such as ping pong, darts, billiards, giant connect four, a basketball game, a big screen projector. Good job, y'all!

The parking area is small and there was a big dip in the spot so I almost stepped in a puddle of water while getting out. It's a moderately clean place with plenty of seating and like I said, a lot of friendly staff. The food is so sub par. I ordered the sample platter of appetizers and it was really meh. Just grease and little actual flavor, yes I understand it's basic bar fare, but the fried mushrooms were not good. I'm not sure they even cleaned them first. Chips and salsa were fine and the cheese quesadilla was actually ok. I had some beer then switched to water which I drank until I realized (as I was leaving) that the glass wasn't all that clean.

They offer different drink specials everyday of the week some are actually really good such as 1.75 beers. Parking is easy during the week but weekends it gets very crowded. They show most MMA matches or boxing matches but they charge covers for those nights.   Service isn't that good here or the food but we usually just come to hang out and drink.

Every experience I've had with her has been so nice, especially after a long day at work.   Today, Vino, the food manager really made my day. I once had a bad experience with the food and never really wanted to risk ordering food again until today. I just so happened to ask Jen if the cook was in a good mood because of said bad experience and it just so happened that Vino over heard. He made sure my Cheese Burger was hot and exactly how I wanted it. It was SO good. It was also nice how considerate and humble he was. I couldn't have had a better service after a really tiring day. I will be back for my Burger and Micheladas soon!!"

We stopped in for an afternoon glass of wine and they did not disappoint.  The menu is pretty extensive with light snacks, charcuterie boards you can mix and match and flatbreads. I would say you will get totally full eating here if you're super hungry but it's a nice spot for brunch, light afternoon meal until dinner.  Hubby and I both enjoyed the wine flight where they pick wines based on you're taste. The waiter did a superb job picking 3 delicious choices for us! Well done.  We picked 4 on the charcuterie board and I added smoked salmon which was an up charge. We will come back as this was a great day date out."

                "description": "Part of the Pearl's charm, are the many great restaurants, coffee places and wine and beer businesses located in it. High Street Wine is one of these locales.   High Street is located on the street section of the Pearl. I came after dinner to meet some friends and loved this wine bar's huge wine selection. I ordered a glass of Garnet, which was very good. Their wine by the glass ranges from $11 upward, so it's definitely not cheap. Bottles can also be purchased and they had some good wine flights.   High Street is ideal as an after dinner hangout, or for a pre-dinner drink/ snack. I did not get to sample the snacks, but I intend to when I return.   I really loved the feel of this place and atmosphere. It's an advantage that it is located at the Pearl, which tends to be very active during summer evenings, especially Saturdays. I've already added High Street to the list of places to which I will return."

                "description": "Last week I visited High Street Wine Co. for the first time since the pandemic started and I had a fabulous experience!  High Street Wine has always been a more intimate wine bar, with only a limited number of sitting space. Due to the pandemic, they've moved most of their tables outdoors which I think is amazing, because their outdoor space is so beautiful and at night you can enjoy the new holiday lights. Another great thing about High Street is that they are located away from the madness of The Pearl's main yard, which made me feel more comfortable and safe. All of their tables have a QR code at the center which you can scan to view their wine and food menu. If you have any issues scanning the code, you can also find the menu on their website. Frankly, I was a little overwhelmed by their menu and decided to just ask our server for his recommendation. He asked us what kind of wine we were looking for and a price range, and his recommendation was on point! Never be afraid of asking for suggestions. The people working here are experts and they will be able to tell you everything you need to know about their selection.   Thank you High Street Wine Co. for a wonderful evening!"

This past Saturday was our second visit, and we had a great time.  My husband had the red flight and I had the rose flight.  The server took his time to explain the different wines and to answer our questions.  We then shared the salmon flatbread and charcuterie board, and we had plenty of food for the two of us.  Overall, it's a great place - could not recommend it more!"

                "description": "This is my first time going here and I feel like I found a gem. My friend suggested this place to get a drink after work. We ordered a platter with cheese, duck, pork, and jam. It was so tasty! I definitely recommend the duck. It was the right amount of salty and just melted in my mouth.   I also ordered the 'Rose all day' flight, while my friend ordered the 'it's all about me' flight. She mostly got red wines, which she allowed me to sample. There was only 1 wine I didn't like, but I'm chalking that up to personal preference. If you're looking for a laid back place to get good wine and snacks, this is the place for you!"

They know how to pair and more importantly how to explain what they are doing.  Some of the most fun I've had exhorting wine.  Good luck on the exam Kelsey!"

Surprisingly, the hostesses were very accommodating, and promised us the outside seating we requested \"in about 20 minutes\".  We were seated in five. Our server, Morgan, a lovely  young woman, a college student at a Texas University,  was impeccable in carrying out her duties, she gave us much better service one might expect on such a busy night as this was.  Everything was perfect, from the seating, to the food - onion rings, tortilla soup, the bronze catfish and the baby back ribs were all excellent. It was an amazingly wonderful experience made so by a diligent and attentive wait staff. Totally recommend the Gristmill River Restaurant"

Great surroundings/shopping to walk off all the food.   Food: As we reviewed the menu, our server couldn't tell us too much about certain entrees secondary to his own eating restrictions (which I understand) HOWEVER, does kinda put a damper on things as I was hoping to narrow down my thought options....chicken, steak, burger or what???  I settled on the Bacon wrapped filet because I know that almost anything wrapped in BACON has potential but, I wasn't WOW'd by it. Bacon wasn't cooked all the way, steak was really tender but a little more red, than I like, for a medium well preparation. They also put gravy on my mashed when I clearly said, gravy on the side. Assuming he forgot that part??? No biggie...moving on....  One friend ordered the Trout, really good, seasoned well.  Another friend ordered the chopped steak, really good and the cheese on top totally set it off.  Overall, I wouldn't mind eating here again with friends on another beautiful weekend day!  Just keep in mind, NO AC, just ceiling fans."

She was so funny, kind, and really made our experience phenomenal.  The restaurant itself is HUGE and beautiful. Definitely a great place for a date, friends and family hangout, just something for everyone and every occasion.  Food is great, I really see what all the hype is about. They pack their sandwiches FULL of meat. We could not believe the portions we were served and for the price? Absolutely worth it. Wait for a Sunday afternoon wasn't too bad at a little over an hour. Gives you time to hangout around town and enjoy the shops. If you can snag an outside table, I would highly recommend it, like I said the views from the restaurant are great.  10/10 recommend"

They are currently redoing the back so all of the seating was inside.. they had a nice warm fire going.. great views of the river inside.  It did get pretty toasty inside thankfully one of the waitresses came over and opened up the windows..   I ordered the steak salad and my friend ordered the chicken salad sandwich..  The steak salad was good, there was a handful of the lettuce that should have been tossed out not tossed into the salad which is why this isn't 5 stars.. The steak was good super tender!  We both loved the chicken salad sandwich.. it's not sweet which made it different and even more delicious!  I almost forgot the onion rings! I would absolutely order those again! Only able to eat one so I'd order the small but sooo good and not very oily at all!"

Ours appetizer finally arrived and then our meals 1-2 minutes later.   Good thing the onion rings were amazing. I had the chicken fried chicken and it was cooked perfectly and had a nice seasoning. The flat potato fries were a pleasant surprise with the perfect amount of seasoning salt."

It is as average as going to Jim's/IHOP (please don't be offended if you are a fan). But the price you have to pay for a side of onion rings (picture below), it was $11.99. Honestly, they were genuinely crazy prices for the quality and quantity.   The customer service is extremely bad. We were walked into our seated area. No one greeted us at a table until about 30-40 minutes in, and that's after we tried to get their attention. No one ever came back to check on us after the food was delivered, and we were even having a hard time to get the check. I personally wouldn't go back again."

I have been here many times and give the place 5 always because of location and ambiance and the he have had to -1 for food with the comment that sometimes the food is a five and other times it's a 3.   But I come back because it's a really cool place and when there's live music it's even more cool, yea more better.   I don't recommend the jalapeño margarita as it makes my lips hurt but I do recommend the jalapeño poppers because even tho they are hot the taste is so good you would eat them if they were shooting flames.

                "description": "Just ok. By no way can I see a four star restaurant. We walked in for what you can consider as aperitif time or early dinner. We had dinner plans already but felt peckish so we had a couple of drinks and some nibbles. Our server Taj was great he was five stars. We opted on first available and were seated in the outside picnic tables. Our first table was next to the area where there is a waiter station but the smell was very off putting and asked to be seated at an adjacent table which was allowed. As we walked by we are several almost uneaten sides being pushed to the side and later picked up for disposal. We saw another table being waited on by a different server that was audibly and visibly upset that their food had yet to come out. We order precisely what we were planning to have a margarita and a sangria. Both were fine. We had the chips and artichoke dip and the half rack. All descent. Not phenomenal but descent. Everything was lukewarm. Our food came out quite quickly even before the steaks from our disgruntled diners. And it's was falling off the bone but lukewarm at most. This restaurant has loads of patrons and they hire a lot of personnel but I think they need to dedicate themselves as well to the kitchen. The coleslaw was not homemade and just about to turn which you can taste and even notice from the bubbly juices of the slaw. Would I return...No just not a four star experience with the quality and taste of their food."

                "description": "Must see! Everyone that comes to Gruene has been to the Gristmill. It is located right next to Gruene Hall and the water tower. This building is historic and used to be the cotton gin. I enjoy looking at the building every time I come here. I included a bunch of pictures so you can see the charm of this place.  I got seated right away but if you are coming on a weekend be prepared for a little bit of a wait. They do not do reservations so plan ahead. The good thing is that they have a ton of shaded outdoor seating if you have to wait. For an added bonus you can often hear the music from Gruene Hall.  I ordered the club with fries and it was great. Their fries are the best and I have never had a bad experience here. My wife also got the club sandwich and she loved it.   I have also done work events here and you can rent a room in the back. The service is always great which is nice being this is a tourist attraction.  If you haven't been here before then you have to put this on your itinerary while in Gruene. You won't regret it!"

                "description": "This was probably the coolest restaurant that I went to while around San Antonio area.  This was actually previously a factory of some sort many moons ago.  It looked as if not much was changed from the original, or they just made it look that way.  I have to say, if you like AC while eating then it's best to find another restaurant.  They have fans and shade.  So when you walk in, it's right in the town of Gruene (pronounced Green), you can easily park in the little towns parking lot and just walk (if you're able).  My aunt informed me to NEVER come on the weekend or you'll be waiting a very long time because it's a hot spot.  Off to the side of the building there are countless benches that have mist oscillating fans so you don't have to pass out while waiting in the heat.  They do have live bands that come for entertainment, and an outside bar to order drinks while you wait.  I mean, if you have all that in the waiting area then it really must be worth it.  Luckily we sat right down on the week day.  We were given the option to choose inside or outside.  We went for outside. Now this restaurant has so many levels and stairs that lead you to the back of the building.   The waiter was fantastic, the food was incredible.  All-in-all it was a good experience.  I didn't talk too much about the food because you're more so going there for the atmosphere, and Gristmill definitely wins."

                "description": "This restaurant used to be good. The amount of food you got was huge. They were known for their chicken fried steak. Well not anymore, it was tasteless.  The meat and gravy had no flavor. The green beans were good after you added the seasoned salt that was on the table.  It's a shame that the prices go up, portions go down and the quality goes down. The service was very slow. I found out the waitress was new and overwhelmed. We still gave her about a 30% tip because she was new.  I will say that the queso was good after we added pico to it.  Probably won't go back. So many other places are better for chicken fried steak."

                "description": "Took my wife here for her birthday today 3/1/2021. What a great old building and we felt totally safe with lots of distance. The rooms were all wonderful with the large fireplaces.   Our server was Chloe and see was very efficient and kind. My wife loved her fish but was did not love the round fries as much because she thought they were a little soggy. The crispy one were great. I ordered the chicken fried steak and it was perfect. The sauce on the side was great. The mash potatoes were very tasty but could have been hotter. I love hot food. It is a issue I have with all restaurants.   This is a beautiful building and we will definitely come back and enjoy the river once COVID is over. I bet the outdoor band areas are great in the summer. All in all much more to love about this place than minor little things."

The coffee was very good and I even ordered a delicious sandwich. My friend ordered a Mac n cheese and she told me it was very good.  I definitely want to come here again and try more from the menu. Also, this place isn't far from downtown so if you are either a local or a visitor you will definitely have to come check this place out.  Great for groups too!"

                "description": "\"It is so bad I want to give you a zero but that's not possible so I give you a one.\"  Never tried this spot before but it looked inviting so I gave it a shot. As soon as you go in you can order your food and drinks at the bar. I ordered my food immediately because the host sort of rushed me to. (Did not feel welcome to ask questions over the food.) I ended up getting an Egg Sandwich and a Long Island Iced Coffee. They never brought me my beverage so I went up to check on it on my own and the response I got was they called my name once. My coffee by then had watered down - So it tasted terrible! Then I waited for my sandwich with high hopes. While waiting, I opened my utensils up to find the fork was washed incorrectly with left over food still stuck to it. Swapped out my utensils then my food finally came. The presentation of the food could have been WAY better. They just simply place your food in the middle of a silver tray. Then I bit into my food.   I could have made a better sandwich at home. My side of potatoes were hard and cold! The cheese in the sandwich was stale and gross. And this may be reaching but the music they played was also annoying - matrix lo-fi beats??   Will not come again but hey their esthetic is cute to study at.   Way too expensive for what you get!"

                "description": "I've always enjoyed the Halcyon coffee shops in Austin for years. My friend and I were visiting Sam Antonio and wanted to get brunch. Even though she said the last time she went (years ago) to the SA Halcyon, she didn't have a good experience, we decided to give the place another shot.  I called in an order (only a waffle with fruit and a latte. I was told it would be ready in 10-15 minutes. I had brought my dog to get her out and let her hang with me on the patio; but she is a rescue who sometimes gets nervous in public places, especially if I'm not right next to her. Since my friend was taking a while to arrive, I was forced to leave my dog out on the patio by herself. She started shaking as soon as I walked away. I thought, \"I'm just gonna grab my food and should be back in under a couple of minutes. No biggie.\" WRONG.   There was a group of 3 people together ordering when I walked up and 2 other ladies behind them. I'm thinking \"5 minutes tops\"...Nope. The woman behind the register (though nice) was taking her sweet time and it took literally 15 minutes for her to take the first 3 people's orders. The 2 other ladies in front of me gave up and left. I didn't know if it was the customers who were so rudely slow or what was going on. Of course, I had the added stress of wanting to get back to my dog (no one's fault but my own); but the line got so long due to the slowness that it was curved almost to the side of the building by the time it was finally my turn!   After 15 minutes (and multiple people in line looking at each other annoyed and even making comments to each other about it), the 3 people finally walked away and it was my turn. I realized very quickly that the lady behind the register (a redhead with black glasses) was the issue. Again, I don't mean this as a personal attack because she was friendly; but my goodness, she does not need to be behind the register at all, let alone when the place is slammed.  There needs to be a separate place where someone is just picking up a to go order and wants to pay and bounce. By the time I finally got my food, my latte wasn't ready. So I went back to my dog and starting to eat. The waffle was totally soggy (from sitting there so long) and they put maybe 6 little slices of strawberries on the large Belgian waffle and maybe 6 thin slices of cantaloupe (I was told it would be strawberries and blueberries) when I asked and not only do I not like cantaloupe but also it's not a good fruit to put on a waffle anyway).  I was told to come back in \"2 minutes\" for my latte. I gave it 5 mins, walked in, nothing. Came back a few minutes later and he had finished making it (no other drinks were waiting at the bar); but somehow the latte was only lukewarm. My total for a soggy waffle with a few pieces of fruit and a latte came out to just under $19. Yowza.   I will continue to support the Austin Halcyon location but will certainly never go back to this one again. The guy behind me in line said the same thing.  I gave it 2 stars (instead of 1) simply because the two employees I interacted with were nice."

                "description": "I was über excited to try out this spot after yoga on a Sunday morning as I was a little peckish. I ordered a vanilla latte with chicken and waffles: I received the food way before I received the coffee and it was downhill from there. It took about 25 minutes to receive my coffee and that's after me inquiring about the status of it. The chicken was slightly overcooked, bacon was harder than cement and the waffles were decent but were room temperature when I received them. It's a cool spot but for the time I had to wait, the price and the food being subpar it wasn't worth it."

                "description": "I came here even through it was less than 4 stars because I know sometimes people can be tough on restaurants but I should have gone with all the averages reviews and not came.  To start of the Benedict's English muffins were not cooked and they were smothered with cold butter, yuke .  Then my wife avocado toast to and out and it wasn't toasted and sent it back and waited almost 30mins and had to remind the person who brought out the food.  Lastly, my son's omelette was over cooked and smelled of it.  Listen, I'm a big foodie and appreciate quality food and don't mind paying more and in fact prefer but maybe what they need is to deliver quality food and not focus on just serving a long line.  Hopefully this doesn't fall on deaf ears, you've been warned.  Quick update my wife toast came out and still wasn't fixed and only half of it was toasted.  What the hell is going on here? Here is a pic to show proof"

                "description": "I was excited to try this spot but I was disappointed and don't think I am likely to return. I met a friend for brunch and the restaurant was busy but not crazy busy. We were seated quickly and our drink order was taken. We quickly decided on meal options and ordered  when our drinks arrived. Waited a reasonable time for food. Then we never saw waitress again. I understand many restaurants are short staffed so we were patient. Biggest issue is  food was bland. I ordered a veggie skillet and it look extremely appetizing but it was really bland. I requested some Hollandaise sauce to attempt to add a little flavor and that was a huge fail. The Hollandaise sauce was thick, bland like a side of whipped butter and bland mayonaise combined, unlike any Hollandaise sauce I have ever had and I love hollandaise sauce. My friend ordered the chorizo blanco migas skillet and said it seemed bland except for the chorizo in it. She felt like it lacked flavor despite having so many other ingredients. The overnight french toast had an overload of sugary sweetness but lacked other flavors. It really is more like a dessert.  All in all, I am reluctant to come back."

Indoor and outdoor seating available which is nice. My only quarrel is that there were A LOT of flies inside. They were buzzing all around and even though inside was nice it didn't feel very clean at all. But my main issue was with the flies, I was kind of shocked with how many there were. It is a nice spot though and the coffee was actually really good so I think it still earns four stars in my book.   Pro tip: get the latte of the week it's usually something dope!    Overall: 3.93 stars"

Although there was a kid's menu online, they didn't offer it in store. They were quick to help me find something full size for my kiddos to share though. The staff was all very nice.

The place is hot. I work up a sweat in about 10 minutes just from sitting. I had trouble connecting my laptop to the wifi and was told to join a server (by an employee) which did not seem to work at all. I ordered an iced London Fog and a Turkey Brie sandwich. I got a hot London Fog (in August??), my sandwich and a different bag of chips from what I ordered. There are also a bunch of flies in the eating areas. This place is so cute and has the best vibe, I've just been sad my last two visits. :("

                "description": "Super long wait and you can't make reservations. They seem to be severely understaffed so we did our best to be understanding about the crazy slowness, especially considering they had hiring positions on the front door.   They used to have $1 champagne flute mimosas and $2 wine glass mimosas. Maybe due to COVID it is now $3 and $6, which is still better than every other brunch place especially considering they give you 90+% champagne with a splash of juice, the way it should be :p i hope when the world \"gets back to normal\", they'll bring those back.  We got lavender mimosa and the grapefruit mimosa. The lavender one was too sweet for my taste, and the grapefruit one was alright.   I got the goat cheese arugula toast, and it was delicious. My boyfriend got the southwestern skillet because he was \"suckered into ordering it because of the sweet potatoes\", but sadly noted he couldn't even taste any sweet potato. The dish was too greasy and everything in it just tasted like grease.   We got the overnight french toast per a review recommendation, as a celebration for his birthday. The top half was delicious and rich, but the bottom half was literally burnt (pictured)!! I can't believe they would serve something so obviously BLACK and burnt. If i made that I'd cut it off and most definitely would not give it to a guest."

Stopped by to get a coffee while waiting for brunch in the area. Not busy at all, COVID measures were taken, masks required and work by staff. Social distancing was enforced as well.

                "description": "I probably had the worst experience I've ever had at a food establishment right here at Halcyon. I came with my business partners for a meeting, we ordered 2 coffee drinks, and 3 food items. The food we ordered was - 2 egg sandwiches, and then a brisket rice bowl. Sit down start our business meeting, 45 minutes go by with no food. We go and ask about it, and they say it will be promptly out. Another 20 minutes go by and still nothing. After about an hour and 20 minutes we decide that this is ridiculous and we want a refund. They apologized to us and let us know they are short staffed. I was completely blown away. Over an hour for small food items, and to be told they were short staffed AFTER we ordered was very unprofessional and unorganized. I understand there are staffing shortages everywhere , but the person taking the orders should let the customer know \"Hey we're short staffed. Food is on average taking an hour to get out\" then there are no surprises. But this was a huge surprise. We were so so so upset, and I guess a ton of other people are too since you can't review them on Yelp right now, so here I am. I would stay away at all cost , there's a ton of great coffee shops, bars, restaurants and sandwhich shops in the area that will take care of you in a reasonable time. And if they can't, they will let you know when you order!"

Instead of grabbing a tray she decides making 5 trips with a few things at a time is better. I'm now waiting an additional 10 minutes just watching them work, granted they were doing stuff but there wasn't enough staff and the lack of efficiency was killing me. The table is clean so I think she'll come back for orders since now the line is out the door and she starts rolling silverware.  I left without any coffee and I was first in line but I figured at the pace they were moving it would be another 30 minutes. This is the second time I've come at around noon and have waited too long for coffee."

                "description": "I finally got to try out this place for the first time. If I could give it 3.5 stars, I would, but 3 is too low.   Drinks- Hurricane was just right and so was the French Quarter Margarita  Food: Ordered the seafood fondue appetizer to start off. The flavor was perfect. For something that should contain seafood in it, it did not have enough to be worth $16. I also ordered the Sea Bass entree. That was also very well made, but not worth the $40 in my opinion.  Ended the night with a slice of cheesecake. It was good, but not great. The crust was too soft.   Service: our waiter was great! Checked on us quite often and ensured we were taken care of.   Will I be back? Maybe"

                "description": "Not so bad, not so good. Well, maybe a little more bad than good.  Sunday lunch and an almost empty place.   Their menu is very average for a seafood restaurant here in San Antonio for which there is plenty of competition.   They completely fail with their ambience, which I consider as important as their food. You have to have both in the stiff  competition of the San Antonio seafood restaurant scene.    The place is like eating in an empty church. Dark and dreary with the worst lighting I have seen in a daytime restaurant. Dim lighting overwhelmed by glaring  large-window brightness, making it uncomfortable on your eyes no matter where you sit.  Their background music is so low that you have to stop and listen for a faint chord you might pick up ever so often.   This is supposed to be a festive new Orleans seafood kitchen instead of a quiet room for meditation in a church.  They had better change their trajectory and fast."

                "description": "This local gem has been around a while. I'm not sure how long it's been here but we came here for an early Mother's Day celebration. We like coming here on special occasions. They sat us in the vey back. I imagine because we had the kids with us. We used their QR code to check the menu on the table. I ordered the Chilean sea bass. My husband ordered the Diablo plate and for my kids I ordered them each a kids burger plate. I loved that when we got our plates they were all hot. I hate getting anything cold. Server seemed busy but always very attentive. Food was taken out by the manager so it assured an extra level of attentiveness. I liked that.  Kids plates came out first: both large in size and tasty, so even a teen would feel satisfied with the size of the meal. When I finally got my Chilean Sea Bass, the fish was so meaty, juicy and delicious, just reached another level of perfection. Couldn't stop complimenting the flavors from it, lol. The capers blended the flavors of the fish (and I don't usually like capers) together with the Julienned vegetables, paired with a the sauce made for what looked like spaghetti underneath the fish, made for an exquisite meal! I enjoyed it so much with my Cabernet. Couldn't stop gloating over my food, lol! Just Wow, amazing perfection! I tasted the Diablo plate and was very spicy. Not for the faint of heart, but still amazingly delicious. We left extremely happy. There was a line of people waiting at the door to be seated still... This place is so popular! I recommend it to anyone who loves seafood! Best Mother's Day dinner, thank you!!!"

                "description": "NICOLAS MAHI MAHI FISH with garlic spinach, mushroom and oysters and shrimp in a sherry butter sauce with white rice.  ($27.99 btw)  Long time residents of the area, we've been going to Bourbon Street Seafood Kitchen since it's opening and this is the first review I felt compelled to write.  We celebrated our 39th Anniversary by having dinner at our favorite seafood restaurant, Bourbon Street.  Unfortunately it was a far cry from the prior times we've eaten there.    We were happy to see the place seem to be doing quite well, despite the rainy weather.  There were a few groups ahead of us but we were seated in about 15 minutes.  Not bad.  We were promptly served warm bread and oil and ordered our drinks.  Our waiter was genial but we'd like to point out that the restaurant is noisy and it's difficult to hear which is made worse by having the waiter/servers wear a mask.  Noisy restaurants seem to be a thing nowadays. But I digress. Along with speaking up, please explain the specials louder and clearer. Oh, and before I forget, PLEASE provide coasters for drinks. Personal pet peeve but I'm not fond of sweaty glasses that drip on you, your food, the table....you get the idea...I mean, it IS Texas.  Do sweaty glasses bother anyone else?  Back on track.  My wife order the Seafood Cobb Salad:  SEAFOOD COBB SALAD Shrimp, crabmeat, blue cheese, tomatoes, avocado,  bacon and boiled egg tossed with raspberry dressing ($17.99)  It's a favorite of hers and she felt it was good, but not as good as she remembers it being. Definitely worth boxing up and taking the leftovers home! It's a large salad.   Unfortunately, my order was waaayyyy worse than what we, (me), expected. The plating was pleasant and looked appetizing. I guess the problem is in the execution.    The Mahi Mahi was extremely dry and overcooked. I mean seriously overcooked.  I tried a couple of bites and it was not good.  Was not moist, not flaky at all and well, seriously overcooked.  Which brings us to the sauce. I had to double check, but I wasn't able to find any recipes that added mozzarella cheese to the sauce.  Parmesan crusted, yes, but not in the sauce.  If the sauce was liquid or even a thick liquid, it would have made the fish easier to get down.  As it was, every forkful was like eating a slice of pizza with the cheese thick and gooey and that you have to stretch the piece of pizza till the cheese separates from the pie.  That's good for pizza, not so good for a sherry butter sauce. As a matter of fact I couldn't readily find a sherry butter sauce that has cheese in it. Not saying there isn't or that there is only one place that does use it, (Bourbon Street) but it was NOT a good idea. It made the sauce a gelatinous mess.  The flavor was ok, plenty of spinach and garlic but that's about it.  The menu says \"mushroom and oysters and shrimp\". I think they meant \"mushroomS, oyster (1) and shrimp (2)\". I don't believe the addition of another couple of oysterS and shrimp would have been enough to save the dish though.  Plenty of white rice. Too much I think. It easily dominated the plating. A wild rice or even brown rice would have been a nicer balance to the relatively bland dish.  I will confess, I did eat the 2 shrimp and the one oyster. Tried two bites of the Mahi Mahi and had to give up or swear off Mahi Mahi forever.   When the waiter, 8 Gabe J, eventually came by, my wife had finished her salad and asked for a take home container.  When I was asked if I wanted a container too, I explained to him what the problem was and that I was done eating it. After a moment of silence, he asked if I would like it to be remade.  Hmmm.....not sure what that entailed, reheating or entirely new, but I wasn't brave enough to push my luck.    Normally, when it rarely happens that we get a bad meal, a manager will inquire as to the service and food and why it was sent back.  Didn't happen. Normally, if a meal is sent back, it's taken off the ticket. Didn't happen. Occasionally you may be offered a dessert.  Didn't happen. Normally we refuse both, when offered. Didn't get a chance.  On our way out, I stopped a busy looking guy with lots of pens in his pocket and asked if he was the manager. He said he was.  I explained my problems to him and asked if it was normal to add cheese to the sherry butter sauce.  Both he and the waiter said that they thought they did. If so, so be it.   Lot longer than I expected to share, but hey, when you're on a roll.....  My wife and I both feel that when a place excels at what they do, it should be recognized and we do.  If there's criticism of the service or food or whatever, it should be recognized.  Obviously we do that too.  I'm sure we'll return.....one bad experience doesn't outweigh all the positive ones we've had dining there; I just hope it doesn't take another pandemic or 39 years to return!

                "description": "I really enjoyed the food here, I love Cajun food so when my friend mentioned this place I was excited to check it out.   I was really craving some oysters so I ended up getting the oyster sampler, which had three or maybe 4 different types of oysters on there, so that was pretty good and filling. I also then got the crab cake that was on the appetizer menu. It was soooooo good! It was actually a pretty good size the sauce on it was so flavorful. I loved my meal.   The one thing I'd say though is it's a pretty pricey place. I had these two appetizers and a drink and it was almost $40+   So definitely not a place I'd go on the regular, but worth a special occasion or a treat yourself type of night."

                "description": "Oh my heavens. We came here for our anniversary. It is the best food I've had in a good long while. I think the prices are very fair for the food and portion sizes. We've paid more in NOLA at our favorite seafood restaurant, Superior Seafood Company. I had the Eggplant bayou and my husband had the seared scallops. The scallops were perfectly prepared, and, honestly, that's why you leave it to the experts! The eggplant bayou comes with a saffron cream sauce that I could eat as a soup on it's own, it's that good. The service was prompt and the server so friendly. They still have reduced capacity and wear masks, although it seems optional for the patrons. I see they have crepes on the lunch menu, so I see many more visits in my future. This is right at the Redland exit on 1604.  I just wish I had a picture of the dinner. We finished with the pecan bread pudding with bourbon sauce, vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. Oh and fresh whipped cream."

                "description": "It was empty. We used to come here we lived 10 minutes away, 8 years ago and it was always packed. We were wondering if we were too early, if traffic was that bad, etc... Got our food and figured out why. The quality of the food had dropped considerably from before. Now it wasn't bad, just not as good as it used to be.  The specialty drinks were great. The gumbos were good, we liked them.  The Po Boy was ok, nothing special but not bad, just average. Although the baked oysters $36 of garbage. Pretty much inedible. The crab topping was off, it tasted like it was on the verge of gone; the bacon overwhelmed the oysters, and the cheese was so thick on all of them that it needed to be halved and it still would have been too much. Too bad, we used to like this place."

                "description": "There was no one at the hostess stand when we arrived, so we had to wait a few minutes before the manager showed up to seat us.  We seriously thought about grabbing our own table for a couple of minutes because nobody acknowledged that we were standing there.  I was afraid this was going to set the tone for service, etc. but luckily, it didn't.  Once we were seated, the service was VERY professional and efficient.   The food: The jambalaya ($18.99) had PLENTY of chicken and sausage - the chicken was chicken breast and was very moist - not dried out, which is easy to do with chicken breast.  However, the jambalaya demi-glaze sauce and rice, seriously was no better than one of those instant mixes out of a box or a bag like Zatarans, etc. the sausage tasted very similar to the local SA brand Kiolbassa.  I just wasn't impressed with this dish, based on the $18.99 price tag it flaunted. Who charges $18.99 for jambalaya???   The Pontchartrain Redfish entree ($31.99) is pan seared, served with mushrooms, crab meat, and shrimp in a brown butter sauce, served with dirty rice on the side.       Glasses of wine range from $8 to $15.  Beer (Abita Amber) is $4.75 for a 12 oz bottle.   Substitutions are frowned upon here. The redfish entree includes two shrimp, but we asked if we could substitute scallops for the shrimp.  The cost was going to be an additional 4.99 for the first scallop, and 5.99 for each additional one after that - but we were assured they were large scallops.  We took a hard pass on the substitution and ordered it with the default of two shrimp.  This dish was better than the jambalaya entree.  The fish was cooked perfectly - not too dry and a good flavor.  Although the service was great, and the food wasn't too bad, it will be a while before I return.  It's just too pricey for the quality and ambiance.  There's a handful of other places that I would rather drop this amount of cash on."

If you want to sit outside, you will have a nice view of the river. They sometimes have a band playing jazz music on the weekend.   The food here is fantastic, the Red Fish Diablo is one of the best meals I have had in San Antonio. It's similar to the Pontchartrain Red Fish, but with an additional kick to it.   I highly recommend this place if you are a seafood lover."

Oil with herbs were thick and fresh. More like a pesto than just oil with a few herbs like I'm accustomed to...I had the chaulk board special.  It was called Diablo... something,  scallops,  shrimp in a butter sauce. While I cannot remember the name of the dish! OMG!! It was beyond amazing!!! It felt like a true culinary orgasm! I can't remember ever having such a perfect combination of flavors.  I didn't think to ask about where the scallops came from but they seemed to have been fresh and never frozen! They were perfectly seared and tender!   A classic martini is not as easy to make as one might imagine,  that being said... mine was probably the worst I've ever had.  Having such a perfect meal with such an awful cocktail  would seem to ruin the meal... but that Diablo dish was superb and absolutely nothing could have ruined it! I definitely recommend the food! But perhaps stick with"

I've seen the neon sign quite a bit but never knew where those pics were taken. I think it's a perfect little bar for a quiet low key date night. I ordered a simple drink, staff was very friendly. The neon sign is very instagrammable. Worth the visit."

We're professionals in our 30s, no gang colors/ tats, etc. Dude- it's 80 fucking degrees out! No explanation either- \"my boss tells me not to let in people with uhhhh... (gestures to feet). \"Oh is there a concern my feet might get stepped on, like if there is dancing?\" \"I dont know they just say not to let them in\". The bar was less than 1/8 full, plenty of standing room with a 6' cushion between everyone.   \"Cool bro, I'll just spend my money elsewhere, have fun with your not full bar.\" Save your time and money, don't go. Let the cauliflower ear \"door man\" enjoy the 5 patrons inside."

                "description": "I'm not sure how long this bar has been around, but it reminds me of  old school bars where you could enjoy a night out without breaking the bank. I'm sure at one point that's what it was. They do have daily specials, but drinks can get pricy.   The front of the bar looks a little run down. Once inside, you have your typical bar feel. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by the bar staff. It was during the day, so the inside of the bar wasn't busy, but the back patio was. They had a dj playing popular tejano, Cumbias, bachata.  They also had a food truck on site which made it perfect for Sunday brunch.   We took advantage of their mimosa set up. It included a bottle of champagne, orange juice, grapefruit juice and mixed fruit. I also wanted to try their $4 tecate light with Tony topper special. I'm glad I did. The tecate can is topped with tamarindo rim, a slice of pickle and Chinese candy. It does make for a good combination.   Staff was always around to take your order.   The only con is that the bathrooms were out of order and they had Porta Potty's. They were so gross. I held it and made it home, but that only meant that I had to limit my liquid consumption.   Parking is street parking."

                "description": "I'll be upfront. I'd usually never walk in here. It's just not on my side of town, but I was lured by la Fonda de Jaime's trompo negro. Let me just say...that was an experience in itself. But I will say. Even without the trompo I would have been glad I walked in here. While I did think the prices were a little high for the area, what do I know about running a bar? Perhaps there's a special some day I don't know about. What I do know. These margaritas SLAP (as the kids say). Oh yes. A properly made marg? Now that's rarely found. Check it out, and while you're at it, try a house shot. They're probably 30% abv, but once you taste them you'll use them as a chaser rather than a shot. Thank me later."

I've been here a couple of times now and I can fully say that this is the place to be if you're looking for a great time. Bartenders are super friendly and can rim a drink properly. Selection of liquors is surprisingly good. The music is always on point. Djs and live music are a weekly occurrence. They've also secured a legit taco food truck with amazing mini tacos! So do yourself a favor and just go. You can thank me later."

They wouldn't let a friend come in because of his shoes (he was wearing slides) because it would be dangerous for glass....literally 75% of the bar is in sandals/slides/open toed shoes. If you want to have a dress code, it should be posted (online this place is described as \"casual\") and at least give a reasonable explanation (somehow slides are dangerous but sandals are not) and it should be enforced for all guests. Just so happened our friend was the only African American guy and wasn't allowed in....but white people in sandals are fine. Really disappointed by this place."

                "description": "Listen, don't come to Tony's expecting anything but a family owned dive bar. That being said, do come with plenty of cash because they are a cash only establishment with affordable beer and wine and you'll end up staying a lot longer than originally planned. I don't come to Tony's nearly enough as I should, because this place just reeks of nostalgia to me. From the iron made Tower of Americas outside to the handwritten signs peppered throughout, this is a place my grandfather and his compas would hang out at.  Their micheladas are always affordable and come in a big frosty mug. Their micheladas are simple and to the point, clamato with no frills. You can tabasco to your own liking and they sell chili candy to add to your drink if you feel so inclined. This is a domestics/imports only bar, you won't find any craft beer here. And as a craft beer lover, this is just fine by me.   Tony is the owner/bartender and he's as sweet as can be. Every time I've come in he's asked me what channel I want the TV on and will change it. No real wait for the drinks because they're all pretty simple. They have great bar snacks at an affordable price too.   I couldn't agree more with another Yelper who described Tony's as the quintessential ice house.  tl;dr: Cash only, cheap drinks, friendly atmosphere, puro San Antonio, come here often!"

                "description": "The reviews of this place piqued my interest and I knew I would have to visit. So we walked over from the Alamo brewery (or whatever it is called). Now, that walk was an adventure in and of itself but we made it. The sign out front said \"Open for Beer\". Yes, please.  So, wow. This place. This is a proper, off the beaten path dive. It was super dark inside. There are tables, a bar at the back (very small), a stage off to the left, and TVs on the wall. A pool table was in there too. Apparently, this is a Cowboys bar too. Good for them. Anyway, there were two people inside when we rolled up...and one of them was Tony. Cold, and I mean fucking cold, Miller Lite in the bottle and he provided us coozies to use as well. Cash only (I think). We drank our cold beer and decided to play the jukebox. It is full of Latin music, but not the Latin music that is filling up my iPod. More old school Latin but we played the fuck out of it like we knew what was going on. Oh, and some random George Strait.  As we sat there drinking all of a sudden a round of beers materialized from the other patron in the bar that wasn't Tony. So we shot the shit with him. Then another person came in and another round materialized for us. Very nice although not necessary. We enjoyed the front patio tables a little bit too. But in the end it was getting dark and we had somewhere else we needed to be so we rolled out into the night and bid Tony a fond farewell.  This place is a legit dive. LEGIT. No frills, just cold beer, football, and a chill time."

They welcome newcomers. Beer is reasonably priced. Usually at least one female bartender there, I believe his daughter. Another I've seen a handful of times, Usually wearing some Buddy Holly style glasses. Both good sense of humor, quick witted, The best kind of smart asses around, but always welcoming and friendly. Never rude. Beer only, cash only. Bring your own liquor. They sell the mixers to make drinks.And I believe I've seen them cook out for big events. Family owned and operated, they make a great team. I look forward to this bar continuing to grow and flourish"

                "description": "I was attracted to this bar for several reasons. One was the fact that Tony's is a mere quarter-mile from work, and the other - there is a miniature Tower of the Americas erected outside.  The inside of Tony's Bar is half-sports bar, half-lounge, and kind of reminds me of Cheers... but the Mexican version. ;)  You have a small bar area for about 6-8 people, and the rest of the place is old-school tables and red neon diner-style chairs.    The big screen is usually on sports (a.k.a. Cowboys) and when it's not, count on ESPN or ABC.    The drinks are that of a no-frills bar - you have all the basic beers plus some Mexican bottles and a few mini-wine bottles.  Alas, no Heineken.  The prices are great, though.  $2.50 domestic, $2.75 import, and $3 Smirnoff and those little Barefoot wine bottles. Tony even sells snacks like chips, crackers, queso, etc.  Apparently, there is live music performed at Tony's often but I haven't seen any yet.  So that's when the big jukebox in the right corner comes in handy.  Outside are a few wooden benches and, again, that cool replica of the Tower made out of steel.    Tony Lopez is a very down-to-earth guy, and his family are usually with him in the bar at night.  He always tells his patrons to drive safely, even me after only downing a Dos XX and a Smirnoff. But I like this place... it's very friendly... and cheap... and the parking is free in the lot or on the street!    They're open Tue-Fri and on Sundays when \"games\" are on... I assume that means Cowboys... ;)"

Drinks: I ordered the flight (cucumber, strawberry, and pineapple) and omg they were so strong although my friend didn't think so. I am a light weight so I wasn't able to finish the flight but I did enjoy them.  Food:  The food was good but it reminded me of La Gloria where the portions were small. The quesadillas are kind of like empanadas. It's basically a stuffed chicken corn tortilla. The flavors were amazing but It wasn't enough to fill me up.  We also ordered papas bravas and it was also a small portion.  Maybe the other food options are a full plate? But I wouldn't know.  I ended up leaving hungry.  I would come back for the drinks if I'm around the neighborhood."

                "description": "This place is SPECTACULAR! Our server was Victor and made our dinner extra special. Here's what we ordered and highly recommend:   - Drinks: Pineapple Mezcal Rita. Las Fresas was also great but a bit sweet. La Sofisticada is everything the name says - even has edible glitter in it. El Cenizo was delightful for any mezcal lover.   - Botanas: Fundido de Frutas (my fave) , Sweet Plantains Mole Tamil (his fave). Chicharrón de Ribeye was just ok.   - Ceviche: ORDER THE PULPO CHILE AJO   We can't wait to come back!"

                "description": "We came to dinner here with some friends on a weeknight, the restaurant was mostly empty and the dinner menu was very small. We ordered a few rounds of cocktails which were very good, but we were disappointed by the menu items and execution. For an appetizer we ordered one of the ceviche items and the fish was very tough and the corn kernels around the fish were dry and inedible. For entrees we ordered the mushroom quesadillas which were tasty and shared the carne asada plate. The beef needed a bit more flavor, but was not bad.   Originally we were eyeing the lunch menu not knowing it was only for lunch, which sounded a bit more up our ally, so maybe we'll have to give it another shot and come back for lunch. Overall, I was disappointed by our dinner experience here."

They have some infused tequila drinks, I ordered the pepino and it was refreshing and very tasty. About the food, we ordered: The quesos appetizer. It was ok, different. Just too sweet for my taste.  The carne en su jugo was not good, it was a small portion, the sauce was slimmy (because it  had nopalitos, but still no excuse) and the meat was over cooked. The chicken tinga quesadillas were ok. Nothing special. The place has a lot of potential because it has great atmosphere, they just need to step up their game on their food."

Came with out of town friends and was disappointed that many items off the small menu were unavailable and restaurant was closing early on a Saturday night due to staffing shortage.  Came few weekends later to retrieve my friends expensive eyeglasses (which they could no longer find ) and decided to stay and eat. More then half of the small menu was unavailable at 8 p.m. There are 2 HEBs within a short distance from restaurant  that an employee could have gone to for the basics that were out. Manager never even came by our table to offer an excuse or apology. Food and drinks are good but unfortunately I will never return."

There was a wide variety of Margaritas, juices, and dishes to choose from that it was a little overwhelming at first.   I ended up going with the Las Fresas Fruteria Infusion Margarita. My husband ordered Los Pepinos and then the Caipiripina. All of their drinks are inspired by flavors found in Mexican Fruterias. The drinks were not too sweet and not too boozy- simply refreshing and flavorful! We also had an order of the guacamole and chips. The chips were freshly made, and I could not stop eating them even though I wasn't even hungry. My husband wanted to try their carne asada and queso tacos. These little tacos were amazing! I was sad that I wasn't more hungry, because I would have wanted to eat an entire order for myself!   The staff was attentive and friendly, and we all enjoyed a relaxing afternoon of chatting over a few cocktails and snacks. Definitely coming back on a future visit!"

                "description": "My wife was the one to find this place online, particularly because I had been looking for a good torta place in San Antonio (which I have yet to find) and she knew how much I love eating tortas. So we made the 30 min plus drive to pick up food here. Seems like they are practicing COVID-19 guidelines here when I picked up the food. I had two tortas: the bistec and al pastor. The pastor meat itself was really clean and nicely cut for the torta. There was also pineapple in the torta. Overall the pastor was alright. The bistec torta was much better. Quite savory and the cheese complemented the bistec meat nicely.  The prices were definitely high for the quality of torta. The house made chips were good too. While not the best tortas I have had, this place is at least good enough to try again in the future."

                "description": "Another great lunch at The Fruteria - Botanero! Today it was the Torta de Bistek: chopped tender steak with grilled onions, creamy queso Oaxaca, avocado, lettuce, and tomatoes. The lightly seasoned beef and salty Oaxaca were a nice pairing as they complimented each other. The bolillo itself was soft but sturdy with a nice crunchy crust. Great vessel to hold the fillings.  The housemade potato chips were an excellent side - crunchy, lightly salted, and not too greasy. Proof that something simple can be expertly made.  Only issue was the service, it started strong but flatlined once served our food. We were checked on once towards the end of the meal as the server disappeared. Empty cups and a need for more salsa (tiny bowl for 3 grown men) were a theme. I would sit at the bar next time to avoid service issues."

What a view to look at, especially if you appreciate what mother  nature has to offer.   At the moment they have karaoke on Thursday and live music on Sunday's. I enjoyed my visit here as it allowed me to wind down from the city life. The patrons are very friendly and the waitress was friendly and helpful as well.   The food was not bad at all, the full order of nachos was quite a treat, enough to feed a group of 4. The burger was not bad at all.   My only set back which kept me from givIng this place 5 stars is that it's a smokers paradise In here. By the end of the night there was a pretty good cloud of cigarette smoke lingering above us. As a matterr  if fact if you are not a smoker you will definitely be bothered by the smoke. All in all the  view from the back patio is what I loved the most here."

It took over 30 minutes for food to arrive, even though no other couples there. It was such a disappointment because it was so good the first time.

This was just an outstanding joint (warning they smoke inside) in the middle of nowhere with a really cool vibe (think Grateful Dead), an outstanding patio with a view of the Medina Lake and dam.  Nice menu and we ordered the batter fried mushrooms and nachos, beef on the side.  The mushrooms did not look batter fried, but no matter! Because by god these were chicken fried and fantastic! They obviously used slightly older mushrooms that had a perfectly concentrated earthy flavor excellently balanced with a crunchy tasty crust..I mean I could happily eat 63 baskets of this stuff ..and want more. Coupled with an Anchor porter, this was heaven. Nachos were just nachos, but the beef was well flavored with a touch of cumin and warming heat that made for tasty eating.  They have a pretty nice selection of beers for such an out of the way place. Add friendly service, and this is going on my out of the way place rotation!!"

So we left and my better half said let just drive up Culebra Rd and see where it will take us and I told her Medina Lake so she said well the first bar we see we'll stop and have a beer there and if it sucks we'll move on that's when we came across the Dancing Bear Bar and my first thought was wow look at all these trucks and Bikers parked here we should have brought my truck and worn my boots cause I was wearing my Sperrys at the time and didn't want to feel out of place,but screw it let's go in and check it out anyways. We see what look like locals sitting at the bar having some beer conversation and people did check us out but no uncomfortable long stares,we ordered our beers and went out into the patio and that's when we knew we came here at a perfect time cause the sun was setting and you can see the beautiful view of Medina Lake with the sun rays dancing on the water very nice and then with a cold beer come on!what more do you want spoke to soon cause that's when the band started their first song Copper Head Road I started thinking to my self glad we came here and never knew about this place even though I use to hang out at Medina Lake like every weekend back in my twenties and watching the sun rays dancing on the lake brought back memories and smiles. At first I felt little out place cause we was like the only Hispanics there LOL and top of that it was St Patrick's Day,but no rudeness here.

                "description": "Great burger. Nice beer selection. Nice outdoor patio and view. Friendly staff and good service. BIG downside is the smoking inside and out that you can't escape.  I had the burger with bacon, delicious! Fries were perfect, hot and crispy. German beer was one of many that I wanted to try (if I didn't have to drive I would have tried more!). The view of the lake from the patio was great, very relaxing. The staff were attentive and courteous.   We are glad we stopped here. It was a completely spur of the moment stop. The first impression was bad because of the smoking inside but then we saw the patio and went outside. The smoke actually blew out from the inside of the restaurant towards us and more people came and sat outside and smoked too. Our clothes and car now smell like smoke.  The staff were VERY friendly so we decided to give it a chance. It turned out to be a good choice for all the reasons mentioned above. Will definitely go back  in spite of the smoking."

                "description": "Not my place... I love to go to sports bars, restaurants, and other hangout spots prior to any events or sports games. I was heading to a Spurs game later that night and thought I'd kill some time on the Riverwalk beforehand. But I wasn't really impressed with what came with this place. Not too much to talk about, but I'll try my best.  They have several drink selections, most of which aren't really that good. The only really good beer they had was Crawford Bock, and they don't really have any of their signature city beers from the brewery; only plain old domestics that I can get anytime at a dive bar. On top of that, I was wanting to try a cocktail or mixed drink of some sort, but I got a recommendation not to because they're limited on their supply, and don't really have any good selections. Oh well, I can always try another good cocktail bar elsewhere.  Another complaint is that the music is WAY too loud. It was blasting when I walked in, and I didn't mind it at first, but it can get annoying at times. So, I let it slide, but if it's not for you, don't bother sitting down inside. The outside seating is spacious though on a good day, so I would suggest that if you want to try this place.  I've been to better sports bars in my life, and I don't think I'll be back. But the staff was friendly, and able to provide me with good locations along the Riverwalk for some dinner before a show or game. But I'd say it's not worth my time."

                "description": "We stopped into Agave Bar for a quick bite while walking on the River Walk on a Saturday afternoon.  Even though it was a little chilly outside I wanted to sit outside and admire the River Walk.  The hostess happily got me a blanket and turned the warmers on around us.  My boyfriend and I decided to split the 60 oz margarita because why not?!  Their chips and salsa were pretty standard... nothing to rave about.  We decided to get an order of queso and split a chicken quesadilla.  The queso reminded me of when we make velveta with rotel at home... it was good but not the delicious white queso I was hoping for.  The chicken quesadilla came out hot from the kitchen.  The chunks of chicken were pretty large on the quesadilla... I almost wish it was shredded.  The bathrooms were very clean and smelled good.  I didn't expect much from Agave Bar.... let's be real it's a tourist trap on the River Walk.  Our service and food were good.  Would I go back... probably not.  But it served it's purpose to get us a quick bite that afternoon."

After being seated we waited about 15 minutes to place our order (the server was rude from the beginning). When our drinks finally arrived they were already melted ( which we didn't complain about). However when the nachos we ordered finally arrived, after taking a couple of bites we noticed a hair it. We then called the server over and informed her of the situation and she did not say a word, she just rudely picked up the plate and left. We waited for her to come back for about 30 minutes and she never said anything about the food. So we finally asked for the check as we were reading it over the server said \"I didn't charge you for it\" with an attitude. I do not usually write negative reviews but this place was overpriced and no ever apologized about the situation or try to make it better."

                "description": "My wife and I stopped here for a quick drink before dinner. Today we sat outside because it was beautiful!! We had a white wine and a bourbon. If you are ever in the Pearl Area of San Antonio, you should stop at the Sternewirth Bar inside the Hotel Emma. The hotel lobby and bar are both beautiful. Very ornate and a feast for the eyes.   The only suggestion I have is for them to expand their drink selections. The wine selection was limited."

                "description": "Great Craft Cocktails; Tried a Whiskey sour (on point), Mr.Rogers (obscure flavor and very unique), The Musician and the Pepo (would order again; amazing flavor)  Great selection of top shelf spirits: Knob Creek, WhistlePig, Basil Hayden's, etc. Great service everyone very attentive even during a busy weekend. The atmosphere is chill indoor and outdoor. Open seating."

                "description": "Stopped at The Pearl District, for dinner but was early. We decided to check out Hotel Emma. Inside Hotel Emma was an entrance for this place. I think it's mostly drinks and appetizers. We saw another entrance from the other side if walking around the courtyard area. Love the dim lights and cozy feel if you can find a place to sit. After about 5 minutes of walking looking for somewhere to sit,  some ladies got up from one of the couches and told us they were leaving. We got our drinks and relaxed. Glad that we found this place to enjoy and actually went into the restaurant we were going to to see if we could change our reservations 30 minutes later so we could still enjoy our drinks. If you want a place for a date night, for drinks, I would recommend this place."

                "description": "Came here on a Saturday night after dinner as a walk in. Tried the Three Emmas (pearl beer and rose cordial, sherry, gin) and Ciudad del Sol (mezcal, xtabentun, vermouth, chartreuse), which were both excellent. The ambiance is great, and there are tables, couches and chairs, but it can get very crowded. We were hoping to sit upstairs, but it was reserved already. There is table service when you sit down, but I had initially placed my order at the bar. The drinks were elegant and out of the ordinary. Def recommend!"

The bartenders are awesome.  They remembered us and knew what we dink which is great.  That's why the bartenders are incredible. The atmosphere is spectacular.  Great place to meet with friends and family.  The drinks are great.  I usually have pearl beer which is good.  Again.... Sternewirth Bar is a destination place I in San Antonio.  FYI.  It does get busy so you might need to wait.  Plus there is free parking in the garage."

                "description": "Food 5/5 Service 5/5 Atmosphere 5/5  Definitely the classiest bar I've been to in San Antonio. And of course, it is part of the nicest hotel in the area- Hotel Emma. This bar has been closed off for awhile and only open to hotel guests during the pandemic, but it has recently opened to everyone.  I came here with a friend on Friday at 5pm and we got the last two seats in the entire bar. I was shocked that it was this crowded so early! The space is large and has high ceilings, but the ambiance is still very cozy and classy. The lighting is dim and the colors are darker. Definitely didn't feel like I was in San Antonio. Guests are spaced out well to follow social distancing guidelines.  We ordered two cocktails: Kingfishers Catch Fire and People of the Sun. Drinks are pricey but worth every penny. Both cocktails were on par with those found in a NYC speakeasy. We didn't try any appetizers, but I would definitely be interested during my next visit."

                "description": "Went on a Sunday night and it was pretty dead. I did not step inside but there were plenty of seating outside. We had the Salami and Brie Cheese Plate and the drink is called Lucile's Day Out. The cheese and meat plate was perfect for sharing if you're not looking for a meal. All the cheese and meats were good and the jam included was very complimentary. The drink was very delicious. It has bourbon, banana liqueur, amontillado sherry, orange, lemon. I'm not a big drinker but it was so good, I could've easily had 2 or 3. The waitress said that the drinks get rotated every quarter or so, so you should stop on by soon as I think it's only available another month.   We also had a cute regular lurking nearby.  Will be returning for the food, drinks and cat."

                "description": "Been here more than a few times but it's my first review for this place! And all those times not one has been nothing but ordinary. The ingredients for this place:good ambiance,mix of different ages,good drinks and good looking women equals a pretty cool place to have a few drinks or lots. The wine selections is minimum but they do have a decent selection of bourbons and whisky. Their cocktails are pretty good especially the Sazerac and my favorite the old fashion among other cocktails which they make potent and that's alright cause that's what most of us are there for right?Like any Hotel bar the drinks can add up so keep that in mind. Waitresses are very attentive as long as your nice to them and tip them cause they seem to stay with the tippers and it's beats waiting in line on a busy night. On cold nights you can take your drink outside and sit besides the nice fireplace or check out the lobby it's original and unique. The crowd is a mix of wealthy, blue and white collars,young,middle and older crowd but for the most part not much drama just good cocktails and laughter.The restrooms are attentive and clean and are located outside the bar there's also a family restroom but don't take your date in there. Lol."

I specifically asked for recommendations and the server got me a rum based sweet cocktail. It was so yum and just the perfect sweetness for me! Not too bitter, not too sweet. We also got appetisers. The cauliflower with caramel popcorn - who would have thought of such a combination? It was phenomenal! Loved every bit. I hope to go again soon - maybe the coming weekend again!"

                "description": "What a wonderful little gem at the Hotel Emma.  Several friends and I stopped by after dinner in the Pearl complex for after-dinner drinks.  Sternewirth Bar is an inviting lounge with comfortable seating and some great drinks.  Spicy(!) peanuts are served and there is a menu for other munchables.    This place seems to be known for their whiskey cocktails and has a signature drink called the Three Emmas.  I know there is a story to that, but I did not hear what it was.  Ask your server and they'll be happy to fill you in.  I had an Irish Coffee that was oh so yummy and just the thing for a breezy afternoon in December.  If you're staying at Hotel Emma, make sure you stop in.  If you're dining in the Pearl Complex, make sure you make this your final stop of the evening."

Like most of Chad's establishments, their service here is like angry teenagers who feel like they have to rebel against their parents. Slow.... Argumentative... Indifferent... Angry if questioned.  Every visit to this location (and his others) which numbers above thirty over the years, the service is consistently bad on purpose. Their staff are seemingly taught to be this way. So the only assumption is that they learn it from Chad who wants it that way."

We came on a Monday evening and the pizza was only $10 for 3 toppings - what a great deal! My only complaint is our waitress. I don't understand how she went from being so attentive to so non-existent. We could see her attending to other customers next to us yet she did not check on us for roughly an hour while we waited for our pizza.

                "description": "Bárbaro this one is a tough review because I've come here in the past and would recommend the menu and establishment to any one that loves pizza. However our recent visit was a bit of a disappointment and I do give grace to the complexity of the pandemic and impacts on restaurants.  We were immediately seated and the menu had a good selection. This spot has a a lot of options for meat eaters not so much for heavy pescatarian or vegan eaters. The wine and cocktail selection is good. We tried the peach mule and margaritas during the night happy hour, both well made.   Check out the late night menu for pizza by the slice and $5 cocktails which can save you money.   The calamari gets 5. The breading, fried peppers and jalapeños in the mix sets this apart. Loved that it was super hot and we could tell it was fresh made.   The lighting is very dark inside so if you are looking for a bright, large and active place this may not be it especially at night.   The pizza which should be the star is where this experience was subpar. We ordered the Sicilian and a regular pizza came out. So we waited for them to fix another which want a bad wait time and when it came out then we notice they are using regular black olives vs kalamata olives which is in the menu and what asked for. You can't just replace a kalamata with black olive chef they are totally different with a very different flavor. The dough was thick as advertised but the pizza overall did not wow us. It lacked something, flavor. We picked off the olives and ate around it and we didn't want to wait for something else.  I appreciated them comp'ing the pizza but I didn't have a full satisfying meal. We wanted a good night out and this is 40 min ride for us. Last recommendation is to see if you can add in more seafood, or shrimp to put on pizza"

Service can be a little slow because it's such a small place I think they may have to balance less staff size to manage more of an area. Aside from that food is always fresh and tasty. I have yet to try something that I haven't enjoyed"

                "description": "Waited over an hour for pizza.   Favor runner said she arrived, placed the order, and was waiting on the pizza at the location. When they finally handed it to her she headed our way. We don't live too far from the place, but decided \"why not order in.\"  When we FINALLY got it delivered it was literally cold pizza. Looked like it had been sitting out for a good while. If the favor runner was there and the pizza had come out and was handed over to her in a timely fashion and we received it hot like we and anyone else would have expected this MIGHT have been worth it but at this point everything with this order tonight was just a waste.  When we called about the pizza being cold we were told the warmer was broken but the favor runner said she'd ordered it fresh and was waiting there for the order so if it was made fresh like the box it came in suggested then it'd still be hot to moderately warm once it traveled the FOUR (4) minutes to get it here.   To top it off they gave us the wrong cheesecake.   $40+ for a medium sized pizza and the wrong cheesecake. Ridiculously overpriced, cold, AND wrong. Disappointed and a WASTE $40+.   Definitely wouldn't suggest ordering."

                "description": "I would give them 5 stars because the food and drinks were tasty, perfectly made, and reasonably priced. The price for brunch's \"keep it coming\" mimosos and bloody of $15 is excellent!!Unfortunately, I  knocked them one star due to the wait time it took for our food to arrive.  It took a little over an hour to get our food. They forgot one order from our party of 7, and took about 30-45minutes to bring that meal out. They were kind enough to remove the charges for the forgotten meal, apologized, and kept the drinks coming. Because of that I will return and hopefully the wait and forgotten meal was a one off."

                "description": "We came across this place after trying a near by restaurant that had a two hour wait. We were able to be sat right away even though it was busy inside and out. We came during their brunch hours on a Sunday, but only saw their lunch/dinner menu.   We split a medium pizza, which was enough to bring some home. We got pepperoni on the whole thing and anchovies on one side and kalamata olives on the other side. They were very generous with the anchovies. The olives were finely diced, which made it easy to have some in every bite.   We got a side of giardiniera. The portion size was nice and you could tell it was made fresh. The vegetables were crisp and it wasn't overly pickled.   I'm not sure what the parking situation is here. We parked on a side street and walked a couple of blocks."

Happiness seems to float through the air and people just seem like they're in another world, relaxed and enjoying themselves.  This pizza..is absolutely my favorite in SA, chewy crust, perfect foldable slices, hot and crispy where it needs it. Just perfect.  We also normally opt for the pickle juice and Aquavit shots which are strangely delicious, we're hooked."

I have had many calzones in my time, and I have to say that this was the absolute best calzone I've ever had. It's not even close. It's so smart how the make it with just the ingredients and out the sauce on the side.  Makes a huge difference!  Believe me, the food here is completely satisfying.  I want more!!!"

Barbaro showed us not only can they deliver a delicious, mouthwatering pie, but an atmosphere that makes you feel like you can stay all night. My only complaint is that the ranch dressing is not up to my standards The be fair, the pizza itself is so good you don't even need it!"

I've been here about 4 times and each time it takes at LEAST 15 to be acknowledged by a single server. 10 extra minutes waiting on our drinks-- 40 mins to an hour waiting for food (which wouldn't be a problem if I had good service from to jump). I really love this place but it needs better server management. FYI; if you're a server please make sure you have money on your card because they don't take cash."

                "description": "Let's start with service. Excellence. My girlfriend and I walked in on a Thursday night greeted courteously by Austin, manager and host . No table were available inside, but he offered us a seat at the bar or outside. We chose the bar because it was full service. My girlfriend wanted to order drinks while eating so it was the perfect option.   The bar tender was very attentive to everyone at the bar with drinks. His Old Fashion and Lemon Martini were incredible. Sabra and Steven were our bartenders for the night. INCREDIBLE!   Aside from the amazing drinks, the food came out hot. The flavor (Egg Plant Parmigiana and Spaghetti) was terrific. Prices of food, in my opinion, were very reasonable. As well as the drinks. I didn't have any interaction with the rest of the staff but they very busy helping the other patrons. However by observation I would say they were very attentive.   Bottom line- highly recommend this place for lunch and dinner is"

Stayed durning Christmas - ended up at MDB everyday - simply because that it was open later than most other places around that area and it was FUN to hang.  Waitresses are friendly and work super hard, they were constantly moving fill orders.   our regular waitress was Faith - Love Her !  The food is decent - we had cottage pie, cheeseburger and hot cracklings (basically warmed up pork rinds - they were really good). It's everything you would expect from a British type pub,   If you're in the area looking for decent food and a fun time head over to Mad Dogs.  Cheers"

                "description": "How to describe this experience?  We went straight in and was seated right away. Service was friendly bit slow. Food was good. They were short-staffed for Christmas Eve night which is understandable. We had run down and get our own silverware so we could eat before our food got cold. Our server did check on us periodically and was running her tail off so we didn't take it personally. Now, the price was a little high but that could be because I ordered a $40 glass of Johnnie Walker Blue. Glad I did before going out and spending $175 to try this whiskey. Definitely not worth the money for this whiskey. All and all, this was a pretty darn good restaurant."

Containing 2 patties, loads of bacon, and a fried egg made my taste buds feel an array of textures. The special touch for me to the burger was the bacon jam, which added a sweet and savory touch to it. I recommend eating it with two hands at all times, because it may or may not slip from your grip. Overall, a good experience."

Mad Dog has a nice patio good shade, so we sat on the patio. Greeted by the hostess and our waitress very good service. They do have a good indoor sitting area with a large bar if want air-conditioning. When it is very hot, I would go inside.  The food is British pub fare I went with the fish and chips. The fish was fried well a very big piece of white meat fish. Not heavily battered fish very good flavor I would get it again. The chips or fries were good the coleslaw was prepped very well. I love tartar sauce with my fish and Mad Dog had some very good tater sauce. I asked for more because the fish was so large.  It was Sunday and they have drink specials we had a couple of mimosa with our meal. We had a nice time at Mad Dog great location for sitting and people watching on the river."

They even recommend good beer for one of our accompany. They were nice and prompt, which was what we need at that time.   Place: It was a good vibes, even outside or inside of the restaurant. The interior was amazing that feels like you go back to a specific time.  Food: The food was good, there's some that not much really worthy but the egg appetizer was good and fish and dips. The crusty bread with meat and egg on top and meat below, they were the same aside from the top. It's not that good for me. The spinach dip was really good but you can taste the chips was from a bag and kind of stale a little. The beer was amazing especially the one they recommended but for food, it's only few we liked.   We loved the environment and service!"

I came here on my last day in San Antonio. I was a little off kilter because of a variety of events that made me feel stressed. Shortly after being shown my seat for lunch I get this panicky call from work just as Helayna, my waitress, came to greet me. I feel horrid because I have to shake my head and gesture I can't talk right at that moment because panicky work call. I get that resolved and apologize for my rudeness but I feel sprawled out with the work backpack and cords and the whole nine yards.   I feel like an absolute mess.   But Helayna seemed completely unfazed. She smiled at me happily and told me not to worry. She was an excellent waitress checking in on me frequently and making sure that I had what I needed.   I ordered the fish and chips after finding out they were allergy safe. I recall being in London and I will admit this is more classically a UK fish and chips than ones we are here in the US. I can't say it was the most flavorful that I have had, but I still thought the fillet was good and those fries were very easy to eat. The cocktails, too, were very good. I am happy that this was the last place I had lunch."

                "description": "This was a surprise win. We were just walking down the riverwalk, looking for something to eat. I'm a vegetarian, so we always have to scope out the menu before we pick a place. And we were surprised to see a few items I could eat, mostly since this was \"pub food\". I think we got one of the best tables in the house, it was outside, on the top level, and was on the river side.   We didn't see mimosas on the menu, but we asked for them, and I got one. Our server also offered a manmosa, which honestly, we weren't listening when she said the ingredients. And it was a little strange. I recommend sticking with a regular mimosa.   And then there was the food!! We got an order of buffalo cauliflower and both ordered the portobello sandwich. The cauliflower was thick and flakey and soft and covered in soft and it was soo delicious. The portobello was amazing! It popped with flavor. The grilled peppers, shroom and cheese is a winning combination.   Our server was super nice and we even got our picture taken by a rotating photographer on the river."

                "description": "I'll preface this review by saying you pretty much get what you expect with twin peaks. Ifyou're coming here for happy hour, they have great food /drink deals. M-F 2-7 happy hour.  $4 mozzarella bites, queso, or fried pickles. The mozzarella bites are always solid. Good drink specials. I'm majorly disappointed in the cost cutbacks they've made regarding food. I used to be a huge fan of the chicken Cobb salad that was LOADED with blue cheese, chicken, eggs, cabbage, carrots, and bacon. This time when I got it it was majority lettuce. I didn't find any blue cheese or bacon in the salad at all. Our friends always got the appetizer platter as their meal and they cut back on the size for that as well. So if you're coming for drinks/to watch a game it's great. Otherwise it's meh."

Pre-covid, I was travelling for work, and I would try to visit locations throughout the country whenever I could. San Antonio has 3 locations. I visted one SA location 3 years ago. This is visit number 2, to a different location in SA. I got seated right away, and the person who sat me was also my server. She was really nice and attentive. The place was busy. Employees were wearing masks and they had divders placed in between certain tables and I think at the bar. Started off with some chips and salsa. Peaks and Chuy's have the best chips. Maybe the same provider? My main meal was the Southern Fried Chicken Sandwich, minus tomatoes. The sandwhich came out nice and hot, same with the fries. It was cooked and prepared perfectly. I highly recommend."

                "description": "So the food at this place is relatively good. The billionaire bacon and the burger that features this bacon happens to be one of the best burgers I've ever tasted. From the seasoning to the toppings, the burger gives you a perfect bite from beginning to end.  I decided to order wings and I feel like Dr. Nowzaradan from my 600lb life was shaking his head with disapproval. Maybe that's why they were red beneath the surface. Yep. I received wings that were undercooked and paid for it royally. Special shout-out to the Pepto Gods for the special stomach coating that shielded me from further harm or danger.   I'm hoping Yelp leaves this up because this is the absolute truth.   Case in point, don't be greedy. The food is good but don't go overboard. I'd rather order takeout because I'm not there to scantily clad women. I'm in it for a good burger and the scrumptious bacon. But for the wings this place would have 4-5 stars."

                "description": "Okay so lets face it not many men or women to a certain extent go to places like this for the food. Beautiful women, drink specials and saturation of Sports and music coming from every corner does make a meet up or after work winddown especially inviting. So I met my buddy there looking forward to a meal I actually enjoy here The Chicken and Waffles only to find out thwy no longer serve them. Saddness and disappointment. But that's alright.  Our welcoming cute Pixie server Vida informed us they were still only using online menus. I always thought that was cool unless you didn't have a cellphone, then well therescan awkward moment of havi g to look over at other tables to see your options.  I opted for the chicken and shrimp with a side of Mac and cheese ( the best part of the plate) the chicken strips were tiny and the grilled \" blackened\" shrimp were light on flavor and sparce. I was a little disappointed in the portions as it looked more like it came off the kids menu. Fortunately they have a decent dessert menu. I ordered the apple turn overs. Vida informed me they were her personal favorite, she had to cut back on ( slight eye roll in the vain of absolute forbidden deliciousness) she was on point they were good, really good. I only wish the rest of my meal was at that calibre. I do enjoy going there, I don't drink and realized a long time ago that the women are beautiful but it's there job and they do it well. So I'm left with gsthering with my buds for a couple of hours of comroderery, maybe some binle study ( just kidding) and the food. As far as that goes, TP you need to bring your game back up because your slacking. If the food was as good as the service that would be fine with me."

The server, Sabrina, however was quick to tell us she was behind on service and she had to take care of a big party first. We gave her our drink orders and she didn't bring them back for 10 minutes.  We ordered chips and salsa and the chips came out before the drinks. However, the chips were covered in oil from the fryer, but were cold.  We didn't get to order our actual meals for 15 minutes and they when they came out, it was really disappointing for my son after his game. The fries were thrown on the plate, burger looked smashed down, and didn't have any if the sides in it. He was too hungry to send it back.  Never coming back. I have been let down by this location for the last time. Get better management. I'll make the trip to the other location in town, but they're not great either."

                "description": "Horrible experience. We sat down I had 2 shots of patron while my buddies had a shot of patron and beer. Right away waiters Litzy our waiters informed us that she was informed we would be cut off if he had too much drinks in a short period of time. We explained that we took an Uber and we have a plan to drink responsibly. We also made small conversation and when I asked for a 3rd shot and refills for my buddies, one of them decided to add a shot of patron to take with me....mind you I had to explain myself that I am on a low carb diet and that's is why I'm doing liquor only at this time and that is why I'm not drinking beer. She was hesitant and she said she had to check...after a short while she came back and said she could fulfill my patron shot but could not get my buddy both. She proceeded to specifically target by buddy. At this time we asked her to close the check. She was very apologetic and said she is just doing her job as instructed. At the time of the interaction 3 managers (2 females and 1 male) were peering job interviews on a corner round table and proceeded to stare until we paid and left. We felt target as plenty of individuals around the bar were drinking hard liquor and had plenty of more drinks than us. We had a multi-racial group ( one Mexican American, African American and Caucasian)...the one she targeted was the Caucasian buddy from having both shot of patron and Miller Light after just one drink. We came to Hooters instead. Don't go to this place!!!"

                "description": "I normally don't bother going to poorly rated places but gave this one a try. I am a chicken wing lover and had never tried these. Ordered them to-go and the girl working there was completely clueless saying things like \"uhhhh I think so\" when asking if we could order as many flavors as we want. Typically we get to pick 2 and didn't trust her so we picked lemon pepper and garlic Parmesan. The wings came out with no flavor. Hardly any seasoning and the garlic parmasean just tasted like garlic.   Post-stay-at-home wings were disgusting and slimy. I don't know if they are just using old inventory to make up for lost revenue but they were some of the worst, flavorless wings I've ever had plus they forgot our side order of fried pickles. They did not seem to be respecting the required 6' social distancing as the parking lot and lobby were full of people.  If I could rate 0 stars, I would. I don't care too much for going somewhere to eat for girls, at least get the food right...garbage of an establishment."

Hailey greeted me and took me straight for my table I had Savanna as a server and she had my drinks ready before I had the menu fully read through, the pretzel are to die for as an appetizer and the food nonetheless.

The wait staff is attentive and really takes care of their customers. My go-to is the sparkling sangria (it's not too sweet and very refreshing) and a flatbread. I love their margherita flatbread but have enjoyed all the ones I've tried. You also can't go wrong with any of the apps. The fried calamari and Brussels sprouts are both delicious as well!"

                "description": "Met my parent here for dinner tonight! Loved the atmosphere and set up of the restaurant! We got mozzarella sticks for an appetizer and I will say they had some marinara sauce that had a little kick to it. The crust on the mozzarella sticks and a lot of seasoning as well, but if you are one who likes that then definitely order these! I split the lobster Mac and cheese with my mom and we both loved it! Tried some of my dad's steak as well as the green beans and I was very impressed. There were parts of the steak that weren't as tender than other parts of the steak, but I still really liked it! I am typically not a fan of green beans, but I'm assuming they were cooked differently with different seasonings and I thought they were so good! Definitely want to come back here again!"

                "description": "This place has been very consistent in service and food. Today I tried their deviled eggs w bacon and paprika and I've had their steak on my previous visit. I had a zombie last time and it was a great treat if you like rum. Definitely consistent on flavor and made with love.  They have many options for all types of cravings and hunger levels. I tried their peanut butter old fashioned this visit and this is a delicious, unique twist on the old fashioned I will return for. The atmosphere is classy and laid back at the same time. Definitely, my type of environment. The customers were mostly dressed up with some in casual wear. I like that the bar wraps around so you have the option to sit inside or outside. I chose outside since it was a nice day in the 70's with good cloud coverage. The attentiveness of the bartender (long dark hair lady ,Taylor I believe ) was perfect. I can tell she reads her clients. She didn't forget about me, but she left me alone enough to enjoy my food and entertainment. Great spot and never disappoints."

                "description": "Ehhh, this place was just ok. The appetizer we ordered they were out of one of the items so we substituted more wings which was fine. Nothing other than the wings on the appetizer was really good anyway so glad we got extra wings! I ordered an old fashioned and it was made with regular ice vs 1 large cube so it watered down VERY quickly which was a bummer. Entrées were so so, Nothing great but nothing terrible either. The place was pretty dead for a Saturday so I'm assuming this wasn't a fluke for the subpar food and drinks. Service was ok, again nothing outstanding but not bad either. In a large city there are so many better places to eat and grab a drink so I don't think we would return sadly."

                "description": "I had a incident tonight on 02-06-2022 where I was dining in and had my waitress leave for the night and leave me waiting without a replacement server in the middle of her shift with no one communicating to me that she had left.I waited over 30 minutes with no one checking up on me and had to finally get up and walk over to the other side of the restaurant to get their attention shortly before last call to order before close.I had be the one to request and new server who wouldn't have put it in on-time before close had I got up and said something.The new waitress who took my order was nice and rushed my food out to me .I then quickly rushed to eat and asked to speak to the head manager after to tell him how I felt about them not providing me the service of what their prices should hold them up to and that I was not going to be tipping tonight and was I surprised by how unprofessional and rude his responses were.He basically told me that if I'm not satisfied to go eat elsewhere and to not come back.I than went to the front to pay my waitress and asked to pay with Apple Pay as I told her i did there the last time i dined in last week and she seemed confused as to how to complete my transaction with me using my phone to pay and called for him over again the general manager to help her because she didn't know how to do it and he acted as if he did not know how to process apple payments as well.He told me that \"You should know you have been here before\"I then told him that \"You are the manager you should know I'm the customer\"He quickly told me to shut the f***up.I told him then \"Ok I'm really tempted on just walking out now and having this be on the house for really bad service tonight.\"He then replied \"Than get the f*** out of here mother****** and don't come back.I then proceeded to walk toward the exit to leave and he followed me and out of no where when my back was turned at the front exit before exiting the door in the hallway he kicks me really hard in my back lower section just over my buttocks in spine .I then head to my car in unbelief and shock thinking to myself what just happened and instead of driving off I head back into the restaurant with an Adrenaline rush and tell him\"You better put this house the now that you just  kicked me\"He then says\"It's doesn't matter what you say we have proof you didn't pay and walked out and have your license plate.I quickly called 911 and they sent officer tayler badge id 0358 and he hears my side of the story and then goes in and talks to this manager who is a Spanish guy and a few of his employees and they of coarse have a different story.Saying I was unwilling to pay and that they have closed my tap and calling it theft on my end even though I was still on site trying to pay them before leaving and was kicked out before getting the chance to complete the transaction and was actually assaulted.He told me they are saying there are no cameras out at the front door to see anything and that I did theft by not paying and that a investigative detective will call me tomorrow to get further details of the incident to see if legal action will follow from either side .So fast forward to this moment,I'm now  at the hospital at 1:08 am hours after the incident experiencing severe back pain from the kick that has me in pain and needing medical attention.I didn't realize how hard he actually kicked me till the adrenaline wore off.I'm so disappointed that a after a hard long week of working 60 hours and just going out for a few drinks and burger this is the result.Such a disappointment being that I really like this restaurant and love how nice it is there.This incident will be forwarded to the Fox News tomorrow and will be made public on several local radio stations.I hope situations like this never happens to any customers in the future.I'm still in shock that this happened to me .I'm a 31 year old Mormon guy who has never been in trouble with the law and has a clean record and this here shows that evil does exist. I have never experienced anything like this before."

I got to try several different menu items such as their pork chops, ribs, meatballs, pretzels, and deviled eggs. Everything I tried was freaking incredible.  The inside of the restaurant is nice, clean, and sleek and the service is impeccable. They have several screen TV's throughout the establishment and they are strictly enforcing social distancing rules during these Covid times.   I recommend to all of my fellow yelpers to stop by and enjoy some tasty ribs, their Mac and cheese burger or any of their other menu items. You're going to love it."

                "description": "For this Saturday night takeout adventure I wanted to try a new restaurant so I decided on this place. I placed my order through GrubHub. I orderd Guiness onion soup,  druken pork chop with mac and cheese and the crispy brussel sprouts. The food was packed very well in plastic containers and still hot when it arrived. The soup had a good flavor which was perfect for a rainy day. The pork chop was a bit overcooked so it was tough to cut but it had great flavor and marinade so I powered through. The brussel sprouts were cooked well but lacked seasoning. Once I added some salt they were fine. The same for the mac and cheese,  no salt at all. Once I added salt and pepper the mac and cheese tasted much better. Overall I wouldnt be opposed to give this restaurant a try again. That pork chop sauce was really good. I am not sure if the offer bread when you dine in (didn't see it on the menu) but that would have gone great with my delivery order."

Very much a don't care attitude, didn't listen to our table request. Threw menus on the table 2x, because she forgot that she put them down already. I honestly considered leaving because it was very uninviting. Waitress had a better attitude, but was clearly in no rush. For as slow as it was our beers took way too long show up (10-15 min). The food service was ok, although we never got our dressing for our mozzarella sticks and my bison burger was slightly overcooked. Overall, was nice place to try but definitely not going back due to attitude and price."

I tried to order 3 different things off of their menu and they were out of all of them. I settled for some absolutely disgusting Brussels sprouts that had an even worse mayo type dip that went with them. My husband ordered a burger that was good except for the bacon that he paid extra for was nasty.  My two children had okish meals. We paid $100 and left disappointed and hungry. Our waitress was very nice though.  Save yourself the time, money, and energy and go elsewhere."

Coffee and Cigarettes is like the best cocktail that I've had in a while and trust me my blood is probably made of 90% cocktails.   All drinks are hand crafted, well made, and you can taste the love and care they put into these confidence boosters. Don't let the prices scare you, they put enough booze to get you buzzing through the night and into your Uber or Lyft.   Hit up this place during happy hour, which is from 4pm till 8pm. Try all the drinks you can handle, and have yourself a nice pre-game.  deuces."

I met a couple of locals in San Antonio and this is their favorite place. It's small and they give out free chips. The drink were decent. It's certainly not a place you go to impress anyone. But it's a hometown bar where literally everyone knows your name."

                "description": "TBA is one of those spots that steers away from the hustle and bustle of St. Mary's. Keep in mind TBA has been around before the recent resurgence of hipsters and bar traffic this (once) low-key street is now getting.  Their cocktails here are great and I love the intimacy of this bar. They always have clever names and the cocktail selection is great here. It's a great spot to grab a few drinks and catch up with friends.   As a fan of Rye and Mezcal you'll see some stellar cocktails and some of them are even featured in their happy hour menu.   For those of y'all who are adamant about patio seating don't worry they got you covered. Literally since it's underneath a porch.   I'm always game for their bar food and trust me this isn't your average bar food whatsoever. They know their stuff and you'll be chomping down like the character in Mario. Whether you're hangry or have the drunchies you'll be in pure bliss.  Make sure not to blink while driving here or you'll miss it."

                "description": "Meh. It's ok. Nothing wrong. Nothing stellar either. I guess I'm in the minority on Yelp. That's ok. I don't venture over to the St Mary's strip too often, so take this review with a grain of salt.  Went here for a date. The place is nice. They have parking in the back and lots of room to sit, although my friend says it gets crowded. It was fairly tame on a Wednesday night.  So the place has a menu of \"signature\" cocktails. They all seem good but a lot of them seem to be mezcal based and I just don't like mezcal. I had a South Flores which was light and refreshing. It was also pink. But I'm secure in my manhood enough to enjoy a pink cocktail--tho I didn't order a second.  I switched to scotch after my initial drink. They have my current fav Glenlivet 12. That's a plus.  My friend had a Rye N Gosling which gets bonus points for the wordplay. She seemed to enjoy the two she had.   So yeah everything was cool. I like the music. It was a mix of 90s alt rock which was perfect. The crowd was definitely on the younger side--like early to mid 20s young. I'm not sure if that's usual but I did feel my age a bit. But everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.   Prices were fine for the area. I didn't notice what beers they had on tap but a quick survey of the crowd and PBR cans seemed to be the go to.  It's a nice place to take a tinder date for a drink or to catch up with friends. I'll likely not be back but I suspect they won't mind as I don't think I'm their target demo."

What would you like to drink?\" Each look at each other with the words, \"Whatever you would like.\"  He looks into her eyes, she looks into his. They converse about everything. EVERYTHING. They compare notes some of the difficulties of their respective occupations.  Yeah. Not my story.  Anyway . . . Back to reality.  Little bar. Dim. Good cocktails if you get right bartender. Lucky for me, the dude manning the bar remembers me from Boiler House (where he used to work at-he doesn't remember occassion or the year/occasion-it's all good since i dont remember him either).  Their recently added food offerings are good.  Their Caprese Grilled cheese stands out, especially when you combine it with the pickled cauliflower. Yes. Damn good. The Westsider - we do not know what was in there but it was good. So yes, their late night eats fill that void in your stomach but wish their drinks were slightly more consistent.  P.s. This place could use a cigarette smoker or two to make it great for some free second hand cancer and more ambiance."

Plus, it is off of St. Mary's street so parking is pretty easy to find.  It can get pretty busy depending on day and time but it is definitely worth it. Last weekend I walked up to the bartender and asked him to just make me something and I told him the type of liquor I like and he made an awesome drink.  We were sitting outside and one guy was getting a little rowdy, but he calmed down."

I was just thankful she found something she liked. She was thankful that they kept the doubles coming. She's got problems.   I explained to her that this is where you come when you want a good cocktail. She then proceeds to ask the bartender to make her another drink right after his first drag from his cigarette. He followed her request with a gracious sense of confusion. Now that she knows what's up, she'll come back with or without me. That bartender better be ready."

I wasn't nearly as impressed with this place as pretty much everyone else that has written about TBA so I'd take my review with at least one healthy grain of salt especially given that I've only been here one time.  That said, the cocktails weren't very interesting and weren't balanced very well to boot.  The crowd oscillated between completely barren to moderately lively during my two hour visit.  Bartenders were kind of standoffish without traversing fully into the category of rude.  The most interesting part of this bar was the artwork and the horrible movie I intermittently turned my attention to when my friend would leave for the bathroom.    What would potentially bring me back here is its close proximity to Tacos El Regio and some other above average bars and restaurants.  But standing alone, it wasn't my favorite experience."

Featuring an adventurous cocktail menu and bartenders like Danielle, I'd challenge anyone to find a request unfilled. On weekends it is packed in with locals...weekdays you can get a seat at the bar and pick the bartender's brain. Either way the quality is always top notch. Personally I like to start up at Cullum's Attagirl for great beers and chicken before hitting up TBA on a pub crawl; it never disappoints."

Wear comfortable shoes and watch the little ones, there aren't any guard rails, and depending on the time of day and season, there may be some drunky drunks wobbling around.  The same goes for the elderly, not a smooth walk if they use walkers or need assistance walking but anything is possible just go early in the day when it is not crowded or too dark.  Nice experience, I am really happy I got to go! Take the river tour trust me ;)  Enjoy!"

Something about blending in with other visitors and tourists made me feel like I belonged here. A very unnecessary amount of hotels with views of the riverwalk, bars and restaurants to grabs drinks or eat lunch/dinner with a view, and lots of weddings related activities. There's never a dull moment here. Feel free to take a boat tour also. The most popular areas is around the horseshoe bend, the other areas of the river walk is essentially dead. There's a section that leads to the RiverCenter Mall, which is worth visiting and another that leads to Hemisfair Park, also worth the hike."

It's super cute and the town does a great job of decorating with with pretty lights and making it an all around visual spectacle. The cruise down the river is so lovely especially at night when all these lights can be seen.  It seems that there are cool places all over the river walk and I'm sure I've only taken in a small portion of them. I just wish that it wasn't like 98% food and drink. Once you eat dinner there isn't a ton to do. And the bars on the river walk don't strike me as bars where you can just hang out and pass the time but instead like bar and restaurants. But it is a very beautiful and unique space that makes San Antonio worth a visit."

                "description": "This is one of the coolest and neatest places I've ever been too. I honestly had no idea this existed when I came here for an event.  I honestly was just looking for a place to eat lunch. But as I walked outside, I first noticed the Alamo. Then, I heard some water fountains across the street and so I preceded to go downstairs only to find there to be more fountains and more water, leading me to the Hyatt hotel, and then this magnificent place that reminded me of a place called Venice that I saw pictures of before with restaurants, shops, hotels, condos or apartments surrounding this long path of water -- It was remarkably beautiful! Needless to say, I forgot about lunch... So after an hour walking along this path, I then realized there was a mall / shopping center here, which I decided to stop into and wander around for awhile. I then finally got lunch. But man, am I glad I got to come here, it was really cool; and I'll have to come again here some time."

Is it something that I'm going to be doing every time I'm there, probably not- but if you haven't  done it I highly suggest that you do. I forgot the girls name but our tour guide was hilarious she had us laughing from start to finish. You should definitely come if you're a Selena fan, it's a really sweet and romantic place. It doesn't have to be Valentine's Day for anyone to do a spontaneous romantic trip any day is perfect for this. Celebrate culture, history and love all on one boat ride."

                "description": "River Walk, that's the big deal here and so I wanted to make sure that I visited it on my second time to San Antonio. Fortunately, I met up with my friend at the Alamo and it was an easy walk to the it.   So, after having walked it, I guess it's ok. It's a nice little walk-especially when it was so hot topside. You can tell that walk has seen some better days, it reminded me of those log flume rides at amusement parks, everything seemed wet and some of the maps clearly needed some refurbishment.  The restaurants along the section I was at was mostly very tourist heavy, lot of chain restaurants, nothing that really made me want to stop by.   I think we ended up walking it for about 20 minutes, mostly because I thought I saw someone I knew from back in the day on the other side and we had to find a crossing to double back."

                "description": "Sightseeing, shopping, food and fun. All on a world-renowned 15-mile urban waterway. The River Walk, or Paseo del Rio, is a San Antonio treasure and the largest urban ecosystem in the nation. Tucked quietly below street level and only steps from the Alamo, it provides a serene and pleasant way to navigate the city. Explore by foot along the river's walking path or jump aboard a river barge for a ride and guided tour.  Just grab dinner in one of the restaurants on the river walk and enjoy the Vibe.   Pros: ----------- Best Attraction in the city Crowdy yet Peaceful in its own way Boat Rides( $13.50 Per Person) Lots of Restaurants Good place for a Date night Good spot for Photoshoots Boat ride covers a lot of spots"

                "description": "While in San Antonio, a visit to the River Walk is a \"Must Do\"  We spent most of the afternoon walking along the River Walk.  It was cool because we got in some much needed exercise.  There are many shops and restaurants along the River Walk.  So there is a lot to explore on your own if you wish to do that.  I recommend taking the River Cruise if you want to learn a little more about San Antonio and the River Walk.  We did that too.  Not only was it informative, but we saw more sights compared to just walking.  Hey, we had limited time so it helped a lot!  Enjoy your time at San Antonio River Walk and drink responsibly!"

                "description": "We visited San Antonio. Texas and the RiverWalk is one of the premier things to go see there. It is located in downtown San Antonio and goes on throughout downtown. It is on the lower level of the city street and can't be missed. There are entrances and exits for the Riverwalk throughout town. It stretches on for quite aways. There are a number of bars, outdoor dining restaurants, shops, hotels, apartment complexes. It was during Christmas, so the RiverWalk was lite up and very festive.  It was very clean and well kept and had security throughout.  I would recommend this as part of the trip to San Antonio. It is must!"

                "description": "The River Walk is amazing! Not sure about parking as we parked at a meter close to the Alamo and walked over.  You need to experience the River Walk at different times. It's much less busy during the day. It was such a nice walk and we really enjoyed walking along the water while checking out all the restaurant options and shops. We got pretzels and had a nice rest at a German bar with seating outside.  You can take a River boat cruise that run up and down the River Walk. We didn't do the tour, but it was interesting hearing some of the stories as the boats passed us by throughout the day.  Later we came back at night and it was packed, but you could still walk around. All the outdoor seating was full of people eating and enjoying themselves. We made reservations and had a nice dinner near the Wedding tree.   I recommend making reservations.  There seemed to be a lot of seating up and down the River Walk. It's nice just to sit and people watch. We even saw the place Miss Congeniality was filmed, which we gleaned from a passing tour.  I love our canal in Indy, but the River Walk in San Antonio is amazing! I think it would be fun to stay at one of the many hotels on the River Walk for easy access."

                "description": "It's not what I remember.  It's trendy.  I went 20 years ago and then 10 years ago to the river walk.  We tried to go as a family with two kids this evening about 5pm and that was not like I remember with the crowds.  The river walk is extremely over crowded and not good for families in the evenings.  Every place we tried to eat at had a two hour wait time minimum.  The idea is wonderful.  The reality with a family now, is a nightmare.  I don't know what I was thinking.  Not good for small/grade school age at night.  I will say the Pizzarita's restaurant above the river walk saved our asses for dinner and the long wait times.  We will attempt a carriage ride.  More to come....  Yellow rose horse rides a must!  Great for kids and helps to avoid the crowds of the river walk!  The life right above the river walk is where the real fun for families is!"

                "description": "When I was planning a trip to San Antonio, everyone I talked to mentioned the River Walk-I knew this was a destination not to be missed. The 20-something mile winding river is surrounded by fun local restaurants as well as shopping. It is well maintained with plants, trees and flowers-I noticed several maintenance boats floating the river early in the morning carrying gardening supplies. This may be a future career aspiration of mine.  If you don't prefer crowds, morning is the best time to visit. I noticed that the attendance started picking up around lunch time and got busier as the day went on. But 9:30 in the morning? Very few people in sight.  The food options are great-lots to choose from, and every place we went had patio dining available. What's more romantic than eating on the water? Well, taking the boat tour would be, although we skipped that due to other plans.  If you're in town, it's well worth a visit to a least walk a few blocks down below the hustle and bustle of the main streets to the beautiful river walk area."

Always a fun walk with so many bars and places to eat. From cheap joints to upscale spots. One of my faves to dine at is Beaudro's which has terrific guacamole. A fun spot to drink is Durty Nellie's for its piano bar atmosphere.  You can also charter a dinner cruise down the river. See live entertainment. Shop. Lots to see and do. Or just enjoy a stroll at night when it's all lit up. Can get pretty crowded and touristy."

                "description": "My husband and I went here for drinks tonight for the first time.   We arrived between 7:30 and 8:00 on a Saturday which can be busy. There was a bartender and a bar-back working plus a few other employees in the bar area.   We found a couple seats at the bar and a friendly manager greeted us, and got us waters and menus. A little while later another manager took our drink orders and prepared them. We decided to order an appetizer to share and a waitress took our order. She was friendly and knowledgeable. That was the only time I saw her behind the bar so I don't believe she was a bartender tonight.   After a while it seemed like a long time to wait for fries, so we asked the same manager who made our drinks if she could check on them. Shortly afterwards she brought them out, they weren't exactly how we had ordered them but they tasted good.   My husband finished his drink and set it toward the inner edge of the bar with his straw wrapper in it. The bar back and bartender passed us many times without acknowledging his empty drink or even making eye contact.   Finally when the manager walked through again she made my husband another drink.   We decided to get the check because and had to flag down the bar back. He told us our total and ran our card. I asked to see our receipt because the total seemed off. Apparently getting a printed check is difficult because he had to ask the bartender and she had to ask the manager. The total was off because they comped our appetizer since it had never been rung in.   During our entire experience, the bartender and bar back never spoke to us, made eye contact, or acknowledged us in any way until we had to request our check. We could see them talking and chatting with other guests though. They served guests to our right and left but just walked past us every time. They didn't seem to be in the weeds or overwhelmed.   I appreciated the service from the managers and that they comped the appetizer without us saying anything about it.   Next time we go out at the Rim, we'll head to a different bar."

The fish was flavorless, oily, and pretty much crumbled when we went to eat it. It was also incredibly overpriced for 16.99 and you barely got any \"chips\". At first glance, you wouldn't even realize that there were any in the bottom of the container. The coleslaw had no dressing/ flavoring on it and the sauce it came with ended up just being ketchup.  The shepherds pie was the saving grace, it was hot and flavorful to say the least. The green beans were also okay, they were cold and had zero flavor.  The staff was friendly though so that's great. Maybe we just went on an off day, hopefully it will be better next time we decide to try in the future."

                "description": "We took a chance at this bar, and I am SO glad we did! This bar took me back to my college years!! The crowd was a great mixture of ages and races and I LOVED every bit about that! I am ALL about diversity. We went on a Friday night and they had a live DJ. They even have a small space to dance (which we totally did) and people eagerly followed because the music was awesome. Despite the amount of people (it was totally packed), the service was great. The staff was friendly and very attentive. We ordered the fish and chips, tuna melt, and ham and cheese sandwich. The plates are huge and can definitely be shared. The ham and cheese comes with mayonnaise and it wasn't advertised on the description, so I would just make sure to ask what sauces are on each plate before ordering. The food was better than the average pub food. We also found ourselves here during the day. The scene was completely different. It was very calm, they had no DJ, and there were way less people. They had all the TVs showing March Madness, and tennis, and the service again was great. The only issue I had was they ran out of a lot of things. One friend tried to order three different ciders on our Friday night visit, and they had run out of all of them. On our day time visit, they also were out of several liquors. I still recommend this place. If you're looking for a fun night with great music, but don't want to get overly dressed up, this is your spot! If you want a daytime chill place to watch sports, this is your place also."

I'm really disappointed tho because I came again for dinner tonight and the french fries changed and I'm not liking the new ones. Please keep the chicken diablo bites and the fried mushrooms!!! They are beyond my favorite and what I come to dinner for. I would also love it if they added the fried mushrooms to the late night menu please!!! Please bring back the other fries and we will be golden. I also love that they added Truly wild berry on tap! WOW!!! and the manager Omar is so awesome and friendly."

It's as if the host told our waitress not to help us, so the kitchen wouldn't be upset. A manager came and spoke with us and another server to say they'd get us help and stilly en minutes later, NOTHING. No one helped us until 10:50 and then they said it was too late to order food. What kinda general manager walks by a table that hasn't been helped and never returns?????? The girls are cute, if they're lazy, okay whatever at least their cute, but this 40 Something year old man brings nothing to the company, but service and problem solving, AND FAILED. It seemed like he was drinking with a guest as well! They really failed!"

                "description": "I came for the Scotch egg and it was very good.  The sausage had a lot of flavor and the breading was cooked to a nice golden brown. I also enjoyed the sauces provided on the side.  We also had the Shepherds Pie, which had a nice flavor.  The Bangers and Mash was okay with the best part being the mashed potatoes.  For dessert we had the toffee pudding.  That was a huge disappointment.  It was far too sweet and could have used nuts or something to break up the sweetness.  The worst part is my husband and I were sharing it, so you can imagine my surprise when I am about to complain how cold it is he says it's burning his mouth.  Sure enough his side was scorching hot.  I guess they microwaved it unevenly.  I don't ever order dessert, so I was disappointed.  A lot of the beers we wanted were out.  I ordered a flight and it sits on a circular carrier, so the girl didn't know which was which.  She was pleasant enough, so I wasn't too put out.   My real issue with this place was the ambiance.  It was late evening, but very bright inside.  Everything felt sticky and the staff uniforms were tacky.  We felt this place seemed more like a chain restaurant (which we avoid) than a hip place at the Rim.  There are better choices."

                "description": "This was an impromptu lunch date, and the second time we've visited Dough; it did not disappoint. The place was fairly empty, and our server (didn't catch his name and no name tag) was super attentive and helpful with explaining some items on the menu.   I tried the Dough's Frizzante Dolce, and it was good but (IMO) not worth the $15 price tag. The house made Italian sodas were good as well, especially the strawberry. My arugula salad was EVERYTHING, and my hubby enjoyed his Caprese salad. We ordered the Amore Di Maiale (Pork Love) and Dough's Margherita pizzas (not the Vera Margherita), and both were delicious especially after we combined some of the toppings from the Amore Di Maiale to the Dough's Margherita. This will probably be our \"go to\" pizza spot whenever we're visiting San Antonio.  Keep up the great jobs guys!"

                "description": "I always forget about Dough because of its low profile location but enjoy it whenever I visit. The pizza is fantastic. Such a light, crispy crust and the toppings are fantastic. I always think \"there's no way I can eat this whole thing\" then down the hatch it goes. It was so funny that our table neighbors ogled our meals just as we had stared down those next to us. Everything is a feast for the eyes. We didn't have the burrata because it seemed like too much food but our table neighbors raved about it. Only downside was been seated near front door where the cold air rushed in. Great place for dates or families with well behaved kids. It's too small for crying babies or screaming toddlers. Sorry parents, get take out. We've all had to make that sacrifice . Enjoy your visit to Dough."

It was around 2:30 pm on a Tuesday and we had a short 15 minute wait drinking wine at the bar. The place is super cute and swanky. We got the burrata with prosciutto and salami for an appetizer, then their prosciutto crudo pizza and pizza with its house-made sausage. Everything was super fresh and delicious along with great service! Highly recommend!"

                "description": "What can I say. What other words can I utter from my mouth that would surpass absolute perfection, nearly divinity, taste bud tantalizing, maddening obsession for more . . . I CAN-NOT get enough of Dough. It's too much for me. I obsess over my next visit. I have eaten here many many times over the past few years and they never disappoint. They never strike out. The day they do I'm going to cry!  This last time we tried many new menu items and they were all delicious! The warm creamy ricotta smeared on crostini was the fluffy little cheese spread you never knew you needed so much in your life! And with honey?? OMG! My mouth waters every time I think of it!  And the oak roasted olives made no sense. I never knew I was missing the experience of eating super hot, oily olives. They do have the pit so don't just jump into it, but if you have any sense you will put it in your mouth, remove the pit, and when all you have is olive, pair it with a bite of crostini with the warm ricotta spread and you will experience something amazing.  The B.T.B. Pizza (Black Truffle Burrata) was exceptional. Take a pice, spread the burrata all over it, drizzle some of that hot oil from the olives, then pass out. When you awake, repeat until full. I can't even look at these pictures without experiencing it all over again!  Our bucatini came out undercooked the first time, but we informed our waiter (who was fabulous, by the way) and he had them make us a whole new plateful. It was perfect the second time around. The noodles needed to be cooked a few minutes longer and they were. The sauce was delicious, and for the mishap, they took it off our bill. Absolute excellent service. We were so happy with the meal we didn't even care. But it was a very kind gesture.   So visit Dough, they will not disappoint! In all the years I've been eating here I have yet to have a bad experience. I just wish they still had the maple cake with pumpkin seeds! And the panna cotta! PLEASE???!!!"

                "description": "Superb!!!!! I just so happened to be watching Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and it had this restaurant on the show. All the food looked so amazing so I decided to look up the restaurant and couldn't believe I've never heard about this spot. I would definitely classify this place as a hidden gem. There are 2 locations, one downtown and the other off 410/Blanco (the one I went to).   I decided to get the Fontina (Creamy fontina, Extra virgin olive oil, fire roasted onions, oak roasted mushrooms, and balsamic drizzled over it). Hands down, the best pizza I have had in the Inited States. It truly felt like I was in Italy all over again. Phenomenal food and bold tastes.   If you need a pizza fix or better yet an Italian fix.....GO HERE! It is worth it."

My wife did not enjoy it much but I liked it. I would rate 4/5  Calabrian Wings - 1.5/5 I don't recommend this to anyone. Not that great and tasty  12\" Small Margherita Pizza - we enjoyed this the most. Almost 4.5/5 would be our rating.  12\" Small Fontina Pizza - 2/5 The pizza was not that great . I didn't like the taste of the pizza it felt sweeter in taste.  Tiramisu - 1/5 Not all good. It has more baileys in it than it is suppose to.   We don't mind spending money when we get good Food but we felt like we have overspend here with only 1 good pizza and burratas."

                "description": "I rarely, almost never post negative reviews, but Dough has been really excellent in the past, so my experience this weekend was sadly disappointing. First, our burrata was not good, with an overwhelming taste of heavy cream - almost like you were drinking an entire glass of it straight. Absolutely no mozzarella flavor whatsoever. It was also quite overpriced at $25. We also ordered an accompaniment of wild boar meatballs. They were quite undercooked and chewy - almost raw - then excessively seasoned with massive garlic. Love garlic and love rare steak- but not in this combination which failed. Wild Boar is not something you want to undercook... Next was the pizza. Sauce was good as were toppings, however the crust was completely off, chewy, not in a good way - with no crunch or crustiness - almost soggy in consistency. Very inferior to a Mod's or Grimaldi pizza crust. Did have a glass of red wine which was good, but at 5 star restaurant prices of $13 for 6 oz. I'm sure that paid for the bottle. Overall damage was $120 for two - with two appetizers and two pizzas. At $60, I would still have been disappointed. I realize it's difficult to sustain excellence forever, but I would avoid this location going forward. Super disappointed! (Service was good)."

                "description": "We really really looked forward to coming to Dough. We actually decided that we wanted it to be the place that we celebrated our 20th anniversary at. They were closed on the actual day but we waited and celebrated on a Wednesday when they did open. The waitress was very pleasant and we ordered the burrata which we were so excited for! It was just ok, the balsamic reduction was like molasses on the plate. You literally had to scrape it to get anything and the crostini was paper thin like we got the leftovers of the bread. The burrata honestly had a sour milk taste that was undesirable. The plate was ok. We ordered the days special and another pie, I don't like the taste of bell peppers and especially green bellpeppers. When our server came out it had them everywhere. We asked for a reorder and she said of course but when she came back said the chef asked if we could just take the peppers off ourselves bc they are in a can pre mixed. I told her no and cancelled that order but if your paying 22-29 for pizza you should be able to get it how you want it. We had a few errands to Run afterwards but that was cut short after a bit bc of us getting upset stomach's shortly after for the night and next day. I really wish the experience had been better bc we've wanted to try for forever."

Just left. What can I say treated liked crap went elsewhere thank you Grimaldi's (Nicole a Sweetheart).    Management get a clue, get organized and teach your staff (hostess) how to speak to customers who are just trying to spend money."

                "description": "I first learned about Dough from watching either Triple D or Triple G on Food Network and when I learned it was in San Antonio, I knew I had to go. I turned in my final portfolio of graduate school, so I decided to celebrate with some post-portfolio pizza.   The restaurant location is very inviting and has indoor and outdoor seating. I got there around 6pm on a Wednesday and many larger parties had to wait some, so plan accordingly. Additionally, I am not sure if this is every Wednesday, but there were half off certain wines and spirits.   As for my dinner, I appreciated that the virtual menu indicated which dishes had been featured on Food Network, which made my search all the more easy. I decided on a small (12 inch) Pork Love. It was DELICIOUS and the perfect amount for one person. The mozzarella cheese was the ooey-gooey you hope and dream for, while the plethora of pork added the perfect amount of savory and salty. The soppressata salami and speck elevated the dish to *chef's kiss* level and the spicy pork sausage rounded out the dish with a little amount of heat.    I will say my crust had a little more char than I care for and the plethora of pork weighed the slice down some, so I had to break out my trusty fork for assistance. However, these were easily overlooked issues because the taste was well worth it. Lastly, leftovers ate well.   Can't wait to visit again!"

The personal and friendly service from hostess and server sets this one apart from the rest!   The food menu is extensive and there is also a nice kids menu. Everything is made from scratch and is good, the kitchen looks clean and efficient.  Beers?  Just wow.  There is an entire cooler room with windows.  The supply tracks go from this room and across the ceiling and to the countless tappers.  Get a tall!   Oh!  Love LOVE the throwback music videos and music.   I say more?"

                "description": "It was a bit of a slow start but their recovery was spot on. Yard House is one of those places you can usually count on for a solid experience. After a few stumbles, the wings were crispy and hot and at the end of the day that's all I wanted.  I don't come to this location often anymore. The service is unapologetically and consistently slow and honestly unfriendly at the bar. That bothers me. Everyone's allowed an off day but there was a span in 2021 where they just couldn't get it together. I walk in every restaurant making my vibe clear \"I'm happy, I'm hungry and I'm ready to go with the flow\" but they just aren't very personable so I just quit going. I'll probably give them another try one day soon. Hopefully I can upgrade this review because it's bumming me out. Ironically, that's why I stopped going to this Yardhouse ....... they were too."

Since my partner and i started going, we've been treated with the best service especially from our recent waitress, Jackie!  She was very attentive, gave us refills throughout the service, and went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of.  Recently, I had their new avocado chicken sandwich which was amazing! It's a little messy, but has so much flavor. My partner always orders the boneless wings with a side of their truffle fries (which are also amazing!). We've also had their house margarita which is mixed with a very nice balance. Not too strong but also not too light, it's just right. Lastly, one of my favorite sides is the mac and cheese. It's so fresh, and full of flavor.   Overall, the establishment is very clean, and we haven't had to wait the times we've there. We always get seated very quickly! 10/10 recommend."

I decided to try Yard House since I have never been to the chain. The restaurant has lots of bar and table seating and could be a good place for a large party. Unfortunately, my experience wasn't what I had hoped it would be. The service was inattentive and the food was not what I was expecting. Many of their items on the menu were not being served and it took us a while to get our food."

                "description": "Large patio and attentive service, it was busy on a Friday night but there wasn't any wait. A fair amount of regional beers, but the main beer list is pretty uninspiring. This was my first time at a Yard House in a few years and I must say that I was impressed with the food menu updates. I ordered the Korean BBQ cheesesteak which was a great combo of sweet, salty, and a slight spice. I would have liked a little more kimchee, but it was still very good. My friends ordered the poke nachos and a burger which were both delicious."

                "description": "After having an extensive tour of UTSA for my daughter the senior, we opted to have a casual meal at the Rim! The restaurant was packed, but we were seated by the bar in a reasonable time. The dining room was loud but was filled with patrons enjoying the music and the games on TV.        Our party of 6 ordered club sandwiches, salads and edamame. My daughter's double decker BLT was savory. My wife's salad was filled with various vegetables and was very good. My turkey club was flavorful but had soggy bread. The bread should have been toasted to help keep the integrity of the sandwich.  Otherwise, the meal was appropriate for the atmosphere and was quite filling and flavorful.       Ultimately, this establishment is casual, fun and worthy of a visit when you are by UTSA!"

The weather was a bit rainy but we enjoyed sitting outside on the patio where there is an amazing view to people watch and look at the game on tv.  There is something for everyone here and I mean everyone: pescatarian, meat eaters, pizza lovers, vegetarians, vegans, beer lovers... the menu is huge!  I ordered the blackened tuna sashimi and the garlic noodle appetizers as dinner. My husband ordered the fish sandwich. What was advertised vs what was presented was spot on. Presentation, taste, wait time all perfect.   Check out the salted watermelon margarita watermelon  and the smoky old fashioned! Delicious and unique.  Great weekday dinner experience."

That margarita was indeed \"magical\" as it changes colors!   We ordered the onion tower for an appetizer and it was hot and crunchy and came with 2 sauces. Everything was delicious! I got a BBQ chicken pizza and my friends got wings. We came for happy hour so select appetizers and pizzas were half off and drinks were $2 off!   We had a great time and i would definitely recommend coming here for a night out with friends or a lil date!"

We tried the Nashville Hot Chicken and the new Korean Sandwich. These are a MUST try. The Nashville chicken is crispy, well prepared, and not overwhelmingly hot. The korean sandwich had an amazing tasting bread and some pretty good beef. I enjoyed every bit. The chicken lettuce wrap appetizer is a must try also, although I felt it was kind of on my small side for the price."

                "description": "Last weekend, my sister, nieces and I decided to stroll the streets of La Cantera and met up with a friend at the Yard House.  We were longing for a cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory, but refused to wait 2 hours for it.  My sister added our names to the Yard House waiting list and I snuck past the hostess and a line at the Cheesecake and walked my nieces to the dessert window.    We eyed the glass window and peeped at the colorful, fruity, Chocolate and Carmel renditions and lime creations of cheesecake, but eventually choose the 1650 calorie Oreo Cheesecake... Yep that's right I said 1650 (YOLO). The girls were excited with our selection and we strolled past the long line of Cheesecake Goers and were called into the Yard House within 10 minutes.   Paul (AKA Pablo) was our waiter. He explained the menu and brought the nieces some crayons and kiddie menus.  Once the little ones were taken care of, he focused his attention on taking care of us.  Within minutes our table had strawberry lemonade and water and orders into the kitchen. The place was packed, but the staff had Social Distancing in mind. Servers wore mask and I saw sanitary actions between guests. For our dining experience, we ordered the Fish and Chips, the Mac and cheese for the kiddos and the Hot Chicken with sweet potato pancakes.   The atmosphere was festive and the foodies seemed to be enjoying a beautiful day out at the mall. The managers at the Hostess station had on their game faces and kept the flow of foodies orderly and expedited. Or food was amazing and Paul kept the dishes cleared and the glasses full.  He didn't mind when the girls cracked open the cheesecake and kept us as his first concern. I would highly recommend the Fish and Chips as the Cod was fried to perfection. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food and the cheesecake was a perfect end to our meal.  Even with COVID-19 still an issue, I felt safe, enjoyed my meal and appreciated the outing with the family.  Highly recommended ~ Ms. Foodie Aka Da Islandgal29412"

I just ordered the Magic Margarita and not that it came out wrong, but it's just not my cup of tea. I'm going through a bourbon cocktail mood right now so that was just a bad call on my part.   Our bar snacks came out warm and delicious. The pretzel was warm and soft, so we didn't have to fight it. The calamari was a little over cooked but still good to munch on."

The taste is still great, the Korean beef appetizer is enough for a full meal, it's so good! The Korean tacos with vampire cheese tortilla was pretty tasty.. I enjoy the flavors of everything and the ambiance is real chill and we will definitely continue coming... I'll just ask for extra pokè on the side for my nachos"

Service was wonderful even though the bar staff were slammed. Everyone was super attentive and working hard so I really hope their management recognizes that work ethic. They also really know their beers. Super informative and helpful with the suggestions. We ordered the House IPA, Liquid Compass and Belgian White - all delicious! We also ordered the Firecracker Shrimp which came on this deep fried rice cake and it was soooo damn good. Like way better than I expected. It was like bang bang shrimp but with a cajun flavor but not too much cajun, idk, just order it. For entrees we got the Poke Nachos (over rice, per our server's suggestion) with the chips on the side and Spicy Jambalaya. Both were so, so good! The Poke Nachos were spicier than the Jambalaya, to me. It's probably the Serrano peppers but either way, delicious."

                "description": "I have been wanting to stop in the Sandbox for awhile now. It was my friend's birthday and we stopped by to see what they had to offer. When walking in the door guy rushed to the door to welcome us in. (Don't know where he came from.) The seating was very spread out which was great. However, the only place we were recommended to sit, because no other seating was available inside, was by the corner of the DJ booth. The place seemed geared towards a young demographic (not that I'm ancient), it wasn't what I was expecting.   The service was great! The guy that took are order was very friendly, and attentive to what we wanted. The music was good but I could not hear my friend who was sitting right next to me. I had to lean into her ear so we could \"talk.\" The beer on draft was good. The chips and queso order wasn't great- the c was very watery. Again, not what I was expecting.  If you are looking for a place to listen to music and not the company you're with this is the spot for you. Definitely, not what we were looking for."

One of their partners/managers/ employees (he didn't identify his position) reached out to me on my FB foodie page and left a defensive and dismissive comment.   They doubled down and called me a liar by stating i left untrue and invalid accounts of my visit and tried to insult me by stating I'm no Anthony Bourdain (there was only one, may he rest in peace).   Had they been cordial, apologized for the less than great experience, and invited me to return (without compensation, I'm not looking for anything free) then I would of praised them for reaching out and considered returning to give them another chance."

My friend and I got too friendly to where we started hugging and moving to the music which caused suspicion to the security of violence where they decided to grab my friend on the arm with force which caused me to question their involvement due to their street clothes dress code. I tapping the guard to stop touching my friend which caused a altercation in which the guard grabbed my throat pushed me against the glass window smacking my head then dragging me by the arms outside to then pushing me excessively to the ground causing multiple gashes and bruises to the head it's the excessive force that security enforces that makes this place a unsafe place.

                "description": "This place has a promising veneer, but beneath the surface there is a total lack of professionalism. I have given it plenty of chances, because the drinks were priced fair enough and the atmosphere was generally clean with some unique qualities like lots of TVs and a rooftop patio, but every time I've gone to Sandbox the customer service has only gone downhill. Saturday (16 Nov 2019) I sat at a table to join friends. When I arrived my table was already visibly frustrated. Not sure as to why, I shrugged it off while I waited to order a drink. But I waited and waited and WAITED until I had to flag down our server. And I had to do this EVERY time I needed something. Apparently this total lack of attention was happening before I got there, and to make it worse our server seemed annoyed when we kept asking to order stuff. So, when we couldn't get good help from her, we went to the bar: Behind the rounded tile bar there are plenty of bartenders, enough to take care of every approaching patron, but not so shocking at this point, the staff had this bad habit of focusing on each other and not so much on us, the customers. I had to wait multiple times for bar and staff members to finish their conversations before they acknowledged me (or anyone else trying to give them money in exchange for goods or service). And to make it worse: no shame, no sorry, just a \"oh hey bro, whats up?\" All that being said, they could have still got 2 or 3 stars out of me, I'm always generous and forgiving on Yelp. I'm aware this is a college bar with college staff, but one incident Saturday proved they do not care nearly enough: While sitting at my table (surely waiting on our disappearing server), WATER STARTED FALLING ON MY BACK. Now things happen, and I understand this couldn't be predicted, but when we alerted staff that the ceileing was leaking, NO ONE REACTED beyond \"oh, ok.\" My friends and I had to move our table. I had to find a new chair to replace my drenched chair. NO APOLOGIES. NOTHING. Only a yellow sign appeared followed by more bad service. I had to wait AT LEAST twice as long as is typically acceptable for service. I left AT LEAST twice as early as I normally do when attending a bar on a Saturday night. I would guess that Sandbox missed out on AT LEAST half of what I could have added to their revenue stream. I don't see myself going back anytime soon."

The second bar is a cluttered mess and unsightly with a cheap Home Depot water cooler on it and the patio looks like a dumping area for crap that no longer works or broken furniture. Ghetto doesn't capture what this place has become since opening. It can't decide what it wants to be! Are you a pizza spot? A bar? A dance club? What happened to the second floor? It's never open. Skip it. They aren't even trying anymore. Head to The Block down the road or Chicken n Pickle 10 minutes away. In case you were wondering the food isn't great either. At least the staff is friendly... seemingly oblivious to how bad the place has gotten."

Brandy was super accommodating in the reservation process and her husband Matt picked us up the day of at the hotel we were staying at in San Antonio.  He assured us it would be a very different tour from what we're accustomed do and he was right!  He was so knowledgeable that we really enjoyed the tour.    We had shopping time in Fredericksburg and we never felt rushed.  Excellent recovery on their part too when there was a slight hiccup in our reservation and with what was available to tour, he didn't skip a beat.  He  made other arrangements and we continued our tour.  Additionally, I left my iPhone charger in the van and they had it delivered the same day.  One of my girlfriend's left her sunglasses at the Sisters Creek Vineyards and Matt was able to recover the sunglasses and had them mailed the same day.  That's true service!  We would most definitely enjoy doing another tour with Cottonwood Wine Tours in the future and we plan to do so soon."

                "description": "This wine tour was for my niece to celebrate her birthday. I did not expect much but I was not impressed with the timeline, the first winery, the driving, or the mask mandate. To start, we were one of 3 stops and that should have been planned better. One pickup and drop off only. Second, the first winery was not pleasant, friendly, or poured enough wine to have two sips. The second winery was more energy and fun. The driving was a little unsettling. Before ever sipping wine, I felt sick in the van with the disruptive swerving and plowing over bumps. I was uncomfortable with the lack of ventilation as well. While I do not expect a lot for $125 a person, I did expect a fun experience. My recommendation is drive yourself, get a hotel, and not be confined to a timeline, other people, car sickness, or bad wine."

                "description": "What a great tour!  Diane picked our group of six up at our hotel and the adventure began!  We had our first stop at the Saint Tryphon winery, which was the cutest place with an amazingly knowledgeable and friendly staff!! Tres  presented our tastings and was great to talk and listen to.  Our group of six bought several bottles of wine.  We then journeyed to another gorgeous winery with a little less on the customer service.  We gave our feedback immediately to Diane, who said that she would have a discussion with that winery and I believe she will!  Diane then took us into Fredericksburg and pointed out many local establishments.  Throughout the day, Diane provided many facts and tons of information about the area.  She even managed a quick detour to drive by Luckenbach for us!  We chose this company because it is a small business and were very pleased with the personal touches, snack bags, and intimacy of this tour.  We would highly recommend this company for your wine tour adventures!"

                "description": "I met my mom and sister in San Antonio for my mom's 65th birthday.  They came by way of Chicago and I came in from Portland, Oregon.  My sister did all of the research for the trip and found Cottonwood wine tours so we could get out of the city and into the hill country of Texas.  It was a Friday and my mom's actual birthday when Matthew picked us up at the hotel.  Right off the bat he was really cool and laid back.  He had a lot of fun facts about San Antonio as he is from there and the drive out to Sister Creek winery seemed like we were just hanging out with a friend.  Coming from the Willamette valley I have seen plenty of winery's but nothing like this one. It is an old cotton mill turned into a small winery that produces some great Bordeaux varietal blends and even a Pinot Noir!  Matthew was very knowledgeable on the topic of wine and wine making.  After the wine tasting we headed to Luckenbach for some beer and a little live country music. There is a lot of history to this place and we had been there 33 years prior when my sister and I were toddlers.  He told us no rush and let us enjoy this little country music Mecca, he even had the famous song loaded up on his phone when we got back to the car.  We had him take a picture of us that emulated the one that had been taken so many years before.  Next stop was some Texas bbq, like real bbq, he said we couldn't expect any city bbq to be better and I would say he was right!  All in all this tour was awesome, I would have loved to take other tours with Matthew, like the Alamo or some of the other missions but I don't think he offers those yet, maybe an idea?  He was very personable, knowledgeable and friendly.  The type of person you want to be around and I know my mom had a very special birthday because of this tour/guide.  I highly recommend Cottonwood wine tours for any tour they offer in San Antonio, it is run by Matthew, his wife and his mother in-law and I look forward to returning here to see their success!"

We visited two wine vineyards and were able to spend the last hour of the tour walking around Fredericksburg. Overall, the tour was amazing! It was put together well and worth the price! I highly recommend doing this tour if you're in town visiting or live in San Antonio. They also give military discounts"

Matt picked us up and was super friendly and gave us a lot of information about San Antonio, the winery we were headed to, and was just overall really nice and friendly.  At the first winery at Sister Creek, we switched out with Brandy because she was doing the actual tour we booked, Matt was just doing our pick up. Brandy was super fun and every bit as good as Matt. She took us to another winery, let us walk around Fredericksburg (after some great advice on where to eat), then at the end decided she'd take us by a small local liquor distillery that makes some really cool stuff like jalapeno moonshine!  From start to finish, it was amazing. These two are friendly as can be, very knowledgeable, and nothing felt cookie cutter. They make it feel like a personal experience. I definitely recommend giving Cottonwood Wine Tours a try!"

The experience was great and although I am 8 months pregnant we still had a good time and got to purchase some wine to try for after the baby comes.

He was so polite and interesting, genuinely knowledgeable when it came to wine and the Hill Country. After our first winery, we got back into the car to find goody bags with water and snacks waiting for us. He had extra chocolate if we needed it!    I really liked having time to eat and shop in Fredericksburg between drinking. He pointed out suggestions for places to eat or to drink more on Main Street before dropping us off. He even took us to a bonus winery not on the schedule since we were doing so well on time.   I highly recommend Cottonwood. Matt was easy to contact and professional throughout, even when we were all a bit tipsy. He was a very safe driver. Great job."

                "description": "While a seemingly popular destination, I've never actually stepped foot into this bar. I walk by often. I notice the neon blue signage when I wait for an Uber. I have had many fleeting conversations with the legends of Southtown on the patio space. Sadly, I cannot tell you about the drinks, the service, or if they are pet-friendly. I can guess that it's packed on First Friday with art enthusiasts, and despite other reviews, I'm sure the bartender has flair.  Joe's is significant to me all the same.   -  I'm moving to New York City, and \"Review Joe's\" is scribbled on my to-do list among selling all my shit and squeezing in a breakfast taco tour.  Almost a year ago, I met this man through a good friend. Tall, charismatic, polyglot, likeable, a real man of the people. He has this swoopy politician hair that hides beneath an obnoxious hat he's collected somewhere along the way. He speaks in excessive idioms and with conviction like it's written in the damn Constitution. He's worldly - it shows. His everyday canvas footwear has seen better days, but his two cell phones suggest importance and a stacked calendar. He's overflowing with ideas and vision and has the most contagious smile I've ever seen; the kind that makes you completely weak in the knees.  We were friends, who became more than friends, stemming from a shared love for drive-thru cuisine.  His sense of humor is a remix of dry British humour and run of the mill mean girl. Strong notes of sarcasm and self-deprecation with a deadpan delivery. I'd love to meet his childhood English tutor.  One of his first jokes I danced with was \"the review.\" In the spirit of open and honest communication, he chuckled about installing a sexy touchscreen on the wall of his loft to include an emoji survey for data collection, similar to those you find outside airport restrooms. How was your overall experience, Aaleen? Smile, Neutral, Frown.  A handful of tangents later, it evolved to a rideshare innuendo. \"Do I get five stars?\" As a seasoned critic in my thirties, I must consider the stunning orange explosion beating through your windows each morning. However, no signs of coffee. Surely, that will influence my lover's rating.  In an attempt to poke fun at the absurdity of life and dating culture as we know it, he claimed his previous romantic encounters wrote their reviews hidden in plain sight on the Yelp page for the bar downstairs; he lived above Joe's. As such, I was mildly disappointed to find that no one has taken the time to submit their review - trust me, I looked.  Well, here we are: 5 Stars. I don't know what the future holds for this establishment, but I can confidently say my experience has been otherworldly. You are my favorite reminder that life should be lived vibrantly, and to me you are magic. I hope you always feel loved."

It wasn't quite a surprise to see a bartender from the bar we had just left come up to confer with the bartender here about how to make a drink because the downstairs establishment didn't have anyone \"versed\" in that drink.

                "description": "I came to Joe Blue's with high expectations, but the place isn't very impressive. It reminds me more of a strip mall bar than a lounge in a historic arts complex (which is what it is.)    When we were there basketball was on the TV and audio system. It was far more sports bar than lounge.  The bartender was standing outside smoking when we arrived and gave us the kind of look that said \"Damn, guess I have to go to work.\"  I'm not sure I'd call him rude, but he was indifferent--no smile, no chatting, just efficiency.  I asked him a question about food delivered from the brewpub next door and got a grunted answer, which pretty much summed up the bartender's demeanor.  The thing that really turned me off is that at one point he sneezed and he didn't even try to cover his nose and mouth--just sneezed right at the glasses and bottles on the back bar.  With many better options in King William and downtown San Antonio, Joe Blue's will not be on my list for a return visit."

It couldn't have been because he was slammed, more like he just didn't want to be there.   Besides that, it's definitely a beer-drinkers haven with quite a selection. I wish they had at least one cider to go along with all the beers they offer.   With friendlier service and better drink options at La Tuna, 1919, Stella, and Halcyon all in walking distance, it's not my first choice. Unless I have friends playing there, then I'm all in."

                "description": "I like to think of Joe Blues as my little secret.  Though it gets pretty crowded pretty quick on weekend night by those who know its whereabouts, this is a fairly intimate bar tucked unassumingly away behind Blue Star Brewery in the Blue Star Arts Complex.    The bar serves a full lineup of specialty martinis and cocktails. They keep a few beers on tap, including Stella Artois (a favorite of mine) and its always frigid; and a full selection of bottles and cans are available as well as a small but delicious selection of wines.   Patrons of Joe Blues are as varied as the alcohol on tap.  A young hipster crowd mingles with a more swanky uptown crowd and everyone in between seem to roll in and out seamlessly.  I like spots like this were people are just cool and respect each other and bask in their differences.   The last time I was in, Joe Blues had installed a jukebox.  The selections are a bit pricey in my opinion, but there were lots of songs to choose from and everyone in the bar seemed to enjoy taking turns making picks.  It was a good ice breaker.   The bar is small and gets smokey quick so if you're not into secondhand smoke inhalation venture out and sit on the patio and people watch everyone around Blue Star.  Tons of fun had when you venture off the beaten bath!"

We wanted to hear the jukebox but he told us no, we wanted to change one TV to a different game, he told us no.    The beer was warm, awful environment. Wait for this place to go out of business and hopefully something better moves in.   Oh the bartender was a dick."

Yeah, the beer is gonna be a bit pricey (for the area), so I had no major complaints there. The restroom was kinda hard to find (you would know what I was talking about if you've been there). I guess the thing I didn't like was the parking situation. it was really hard to find decent parking."

                "description": "Before we get into anything else... what a jukebox!! We spent half an hour putting money in the machine and just picking gorgeous songs (Mumford and sons FTW). Small, or intimate as you prefer, with nice clean lines and enough move around space for folks to belly up or sit at a table as they like.  Though there was only one bartender on staff, he was incredibly nice. Knowledgeable about the beer selection, which is fabulous and even trying to make the karaoke machine work on the big screen so we could fulfill all of our Celine Dion dreams. Being more of a liquor girl myself, I absolutely appreciated the heavy handed pours. El Rufuso especially liked the white Christmas tree, judging by his romp through the branches.   It was too cold but there's a sweet patio as well. If you're in the area and down for a brew, Blue Star is a great stop... but Joe Blues is where you should end your night."

                "description": "I feel like I should probably spend most of this review covering the nuances of the jukebox, or about how bright the light is in the hallway on en route to the rest room after you've been in here awhile. But I won't do that. What would be the point, really.   Besides, it's much more fun to talk about what Joe Blue's is - a typically late night stopover for the gang from Blue Star (and whoever else may be chatting each other up that day) - there's a solid brew selection present, even a little quirk in that regard, and they remember you (well, they often remember me, but that's probably 'cause I tend to make my way in when Krys directs, and when you're with folks in the know, that doesn't hurt).   You'll occasionally find live music, but you'll often find good cheer. And that's worth a little something, too, I'd say."

                "description": "Looking to experience great Hill Country wines and barbecue - we had both taking Winding Road Wine Tours Salt Lick Sunday Wine Tour.  The tour picked us up in Gruene in a new luxury bus at 10:30. We were greeted by the tour owner Billy Martin.  The bus was very comfortable with a u shaped seating arrangement and a table in the aisle.  Should seat around 12 people comfortably. The bus has a great sound system that is Bluetooth enabled - Billy played whatever we wanted from sources such as Pandora and Napster music service. First stop was Driftwood Estate Winery. Driftwood has perhaps the best winery views in the Hill Country.  I really enjoyed the reds and came away with a bottle of Longhorn Red to enjoy at our next stop Salt Lick Barbecue. Yes, Salt Lick is byob. It was beginning to rain and Billy dropped us off near the check in stand. He's thought of his customer's needs providing us large golf umbrellas. It was busy with people waiting to be seated. However, he got us seated right away. Our final two wineries were Fall Creek right across the street from Salt Lick and then Wimberley Valley Winery. Fall Creek has solid wines and the service for our group was outstanding. Wimberley Valley Winery was an unexpected pleasure. Their tasting room is roomy and comfortable with plenty room at the tasting bars and a comfortable seating area facing a large stone fireplace. They have a variety of wines bottled on site along with other wines from around the world. The grounds were spectacular with numerous large shaded decks to enjoy a glass or bottle as you wrap up your tour.  What a great Sunday drinking Texas wines, eating Texas barbecue and meeting new friends!"

Billy (great guy) is well known at the vineyards and ensures you get great service and a great spot at the tasting bar.

                "description": "Driving home after some business in the downtown area I hit some construction on Broadway that had detours that led me to Alamo Street and area I had never noticed before. I saw a couple of beer joints and then I noticed La Roca Cantina so I decided to wait out traffic and stop in for happy hour.  The place wasn't packed and so I got a spot at the bar. The inside has a U-shaped long bar you can post up at or several tables and sofas you can sit at in a separate room across the bar. It has more of a cocktail bar vibe than a beer joint and that is what I was looking for.  The bartender, Roel, asked what I would like so I started off with my go to, a Bulleit Rye Old fashion.  I watched Roel make it and he made it just the way I like it, test one passed.  As a follow-up, I asked if he could make a Sazerac, and he said yes, then asked what type of Rye I would prefer. I like when I'm given the option so after looking at their selection I went with a Rittenhouse Rye.  When it was served, it looked the part then after a sip, it tasted the part; test two passed.  Roel came over to ask if I liked the drinks and I gave him a thumbs up. He chatted with us for a while and made sure we were taken care of so he gets a thumbs up as well.  Overall, this is a nice off the beaten path cocktail bar that I want to come check out one weekend, Covid permitting."

                "description": "Fantastic Happy Hour at La Roca Cantina!   Sibling location of The Green Latern cocktail bar in Stone Oak, LRC served nicely made cocktails and in-house infused shots.  Strawberry serrano tequila and pineapple-coconut rum were tried on this visit (complimentary shot! from the awesome bartender for my first visit) and both were very smooth and flavorful.   The cucumber martini with a Tajin rim was a great change from my usual bourbon cocktail.   Refreshing and smooth, it makes a great anytime drink."

                "description": "The bartender Toni was amazing and went above and beyond when I requested drinks with egg whites. She made such good drinks that weren't on the menu and that was appreciated.I give Antonia 5 stars but the establishment and the experience at the end gets an overall 2.   I came here on a Thursday night with a few friends and enjoyed some drinks. Its a 360 bar which is nice because there are lots of seats around the bar. Beyond that they have some couches around that you are able to sit at if you'd like. When I'm at a cocktail bar I like to watch the drinks made so I prefer to sit at the bar when there's availability. I love cocktails with egg whites in them so I requested that from the bartender and she made me a few after asking the types of flavors I like. The music was cool and the vibe was low key except for some loud patrons across the bar.   Towards the end of the night it was getting close to closing and a short man who came out of nowhere. We hadn't seen him once all night.He told us that we had 3 minutes to drink your drinks. Then he repeatedly told us every 30 seconds how much time we had left.This was extremely obnoxious and ridiculous to say the very least. He was only doing this to myself and my group of friends, there were a total of three of us.  The bar was still full of about 10 other people not including the staff.So this was uncalled for to say the very least. I understand last call but there are ways to do that and you should treat everybody with respect.   We were paying customers who had spent a decent amount of money and tip very well. I don't appreciate being treated this way. When we were leaving and the bar was STILL full of people this guy changed his tune and was trying to shake our hands and thank us for coming.   My review would have been more starts if it wasn't for this guy. I'm not sure what this mans role was in the bar but he should learn how to treat people with respect and not be rude. The next time I'm in San Antonio I will not be coming back here."

                "description": "This bar plays great music but poor management in regard to security has really killed the vibe of the place. A middle aged (50s) caucasian security guard ranted for 20 minutes about how they were breaking TABC law by letting 80 people into the bar over capacity limits.   This middle aged (mid 50s) caucasian security guard proceeded to let two large groups of 10+ people into the club through the side door.... after a little persuading (a cash tip).  Three guys got fed up of waiting as this middle aged caucasian security guard let in the large groups beyond capacity ahead of the line. When the bar closed this middle aged security guard started handing out life time bans. Apparently the middle aged security guard has an ownership stake in the bar and is able to make business decisions.  Ultimately I give this bar 2 huge thumbs down . When security is taking cash tips and breaking TABC capacity regulations... but handing out lifetime bans to patrons who wait in line but get cut because they are unable to profit the security... something business wise needs to be re-evaluated."

                "description": "Got there around 12:45 Friday night, (yesterday) there was no line so my bf and I are there to meet with my friend and another couple because he was celebrating his celebrating their birthday.  The security at the door said they were at capacity and it was gonna be about a 10-15 wait. We said it's okay we can wait. While we were waiting a group of 6 people arrive and the security tell them to wait behind us, another group of 7 people come and he tells him the same.  A waiter comes outside and says I can take in 6 people, I'm ready to go inside but the people behind my boyfriend and I yell we are 6. And the security let's them in. I tell the security why he did that and he said sorry I have no control over who goes in. At this point I'm upset. So I call my friends inside and tell them what happened, they said they have to get their waiter and give them money so they can let us in. I said okay so we wait, 20 min have gone by and the same waiter comes outside and lets his friend come in with a group of 7 people, skipping us again. This time around I'm LIVID! The security at the door makes a comment saying\" if it gets to 1:30 am I would just leave if I was y'all\" that made me even more upset. I called my friends inside and told them I was leaving, my friends said we were next but there was nobody else in the line.  They have VERY VERY POOR MANAGEMENT as well as a CLOWN as their security. How are you gonna tell me your at capacity when you just let 13 people in before me?!?! I should have called SAPD to check their establishment if that was the case because they were VIOLATING COVID restrictions.   If you don't know the security, a waiter, or a bartender, SONT BORHER TO GO TO THIS PLACE."

Great laid back environment with a huge bar that you can sit all the way around. They've also got regular table and chair setups along with some lounge style areas that are super comfortable...so no matter what style you are looking for, you are sure to be happy here. They've got some great happy hour prices that include $5 cucumber martinis and old fashioned options on there. You can't beat those prices and the drinks are good! Happy hour is typically open until 9. These are the 2 drinks my husband and I prefer and they were good enough we'd definitely come back.   They've also got live music on Friday and Saturday nights...I believe that starts at 10."

This is located right in the downtown area off of Broadway serving up delicious cocktails, that is a well decorated and spacious venue.  Don''t worry parking isn't an issue in this part of downtown.  Looking for that awesome date night? This is the place to be, its dim settings, fireplace, love seating, and drinks make it all the right settings for that excellent night ;)  The drinks, my my, isn't this what you were looking for? These fine artistic mixologist will make you that perfect cocktail.  Not sure what to order? Go ahead ask, For you shy folks, I would recommend a Cucumber or Strawberry Martini for those seeking out something sweeter.  It's a favorite and well known concoction by many who are fans of this bar.    Somewhere this cool isn't quite what I consider a dive bar, in fact, Friday and Saturday nights, you might even find many whom come up dressed up! It's a place where many professionals come to meet and loosen up.  So don't be shy to come in dressed nicely. I would recommend it, as I come in dressed to impress all the time!  Lastly, the drink prices themselves. Don't worry, its quite affordable compared to nearby cocktail lounges.  As I said, its a place where you and your date can enjoy yourselves without having to worry about cost, venue, or drinks. See you there!"

I really wish we'd had more of a crowd here since the seating in the back is straight up boss, but those of us who were in town early chilled at the bar and ended up Uberrushing some Tuckers (omg, so delicious) while I sipped on my old fashioned.  Now again, I almost wish this had been a night event because my drink was hard poured like a motha and that early in a YSB and after flying so many hours I just have not yet built up my tolerance to drink it that stiff. Light weight problems, amiright?  I'm so thankful Mike introduced us to this bar! The bartenders and their play list were awesome and we had a great time! A big thank you to La Roca for having us!

This place is just a win all the way around. I wasn't 100% sure what La Roca was going to be like walking in. I saw an article in The Current talking about a Mexican style lounge, but what is that? Apparently it is a gorgeous bar, a huge space with sofas and lounge chairs, TVs, and probably a lot more stuff that I haven't found yet. Stop in for Happy Hour, it runs til 9pm most nights. Kick back on a sofa or sit at the bar and chat with whoever is working, you can't go wrong either way."

They serve all sorts of coffee as well, and you can pick up high-end culinary creations ( different types of quinoa salads or vegetable medley in different seasonings and sauces). I really wish they would pretty on their menu a charcuterie board, as they have a plethora of cheese and meat options for purchase separately. I ended up buying a container of artichoke hearts and olives in a olive oil dressing to enjoy with some beverages. Had my companion been hungrier, I would have also purchased some brie or other soft cheese and crackers , and possibly salami.

The staff is pretty friendly and it also doubles as a small convenience store (albeit more expensive than your local Valero).  Their lemonade is perfect for a hot day, and the sandwich was super filling. I only managed to eat half before taking the rest home. And the thing I was most excited to eat later? This MASSIVE fudgy brownie. It was one of those perfect brownies that reminded me of a gourmet Little Debbie brownie. Dense. Fudgy. In need of a cigarette and a nap afterward.  Coffee shops are not a revolutionary idea, especially when you're traipsing about at The Pearl. But out of towners (or even staycationers) staying at Hotel Emma can't go wrong picking up a fine brew and treat at Larder."

The beer is the same price as in the hotel Ice box, so don't go out of your way to try to save money. $3 per can of pearl beer.   The store has a combination of dry goods and deli/ pastry items. They sell coffee too. The staff is great.   The big plus is that it is easily accessed through hotel Emma."

It's almost like a Starbuck environment and we stood in line and got our food.  The staff was great and friendly.  The bread was light and fluffy, not sure if it was pretzel or what but it was really good and I am NOT a bread person.  The eggs and cheese were, well eggs and cheese not much you can do with that, but the bacon was the thicker bacon and was super yummy; 9 dollars, not bad for the Pearl."

                "description": "I'm a sucker for beautiful gourmet markets. Larder at Hotel Emma is no exception. The cozy space offers two narrow stories of wines, Texas honeys, desserts, pre-made salads, fresh local juices and more.   Fun fact: this is the first hotel in Texas to boast an in-house journey market (they even sell pre-made picnics!). The fun thing about this location is that it's wedged equidistant between several of the key San Antonio attractions like the Japanese Gardens, Grotto, Alamo and Breckinridge Park. One more note about the in-house market-- it's the old fermenting cellar of Pearl Brewery. DO NOT leave Larder without popping your head into the Hotel Emma lobby. Bring your camera and enjoy."

I can't even do it justice with words. So I just took a bunch of pictures. Wow."

If you didn't pack a picnic and don't have the time or cash for a table service meal, then go to Larder and get a snack. They have grab-and-go juice, yogurt, nuts, crackers, etc. They also brew coffee and prepare food to order. Most restaurants at the Pearl have a higher price point, but you can get a taste-stimulating treat at Larder without too much wallet damage. Enjoy!"

My build your own sandwiches was great. All the sandwiches come with their super tasty chips that I think are fried there.   We had a bottle of rose and some mineral water. They gave us glasses to drink with which was very nice. It's got a great patio are to look out on the green.  I would definitely come here again to eat or get stuff for a picnic."

They also have a build your own oatmeal bar! + Good variety of goods from local beers and coffee to vegan, gluten free, nondairy, etc options for those on specialized diets.  CONS: - Limited pastry items on display, and those that were there were old-looking cookies rather than the breakfast pastries and donuts I'd been recommended. - All coffees served in takeout cups despite dine in service available. Seasonal Dulce de Leche latte was underwhelming, tasted like a regular vanilla latte. - Pricey. You can find several of the local grocery items at other shops in the Pearl area, usually a bit lower in cost."

Greg was so awesome and fun to talk to while we were there. They have growlers and crowlers you can get filled, as well as bring in your own growler for a fill. The inside is dog-friendly.  My only meh about this place is that there are 3-4 taps with Guadalupe Brewing's beer. Don't get my wrong, I love them, but they are right down the road, so to me it doesn't make sense to have that many of theirs on tap, especially since my husband and I frequent local breweries.  Can't wait to see what else they bring in and are excited to go back!"

They do not treat their customers with respect and highly unprofessional   This was our 1st time at the establishment as we were sitting at the table having a good time and decided to get a drink. as I was waiting at the bar to order A bartender working from the fat end shoved me. I was waiting to order a drink from the bar by another bartender. The first time my back was turned as I was having a conversation with the lady next to me. I gave the bartender the benefit of the doubt and thought it was an accident ( even though the bartender pushed me so hard enough to fall into the other client at the bar). When the bartender came back he yelled at me and pushed Again and said you can not be standing in the walkway. The 'bartender was referring to the 'bartender entrance' where I was not blocking as he claims. The incident was so bad the bartender who was serving us who witnessed it immediately bought our drinks to I assume descalate the situation. I later went to the bartender Who pushed me to ask him why he shoved me like that? He said, I said excuse me... (no he didn't! ) and immediately played victim. The bartender told the bouncer 'get them out of here'. I can't make this up... This is crazy no one deserves to be treated this way. Trying to explain the situation the bouncer before I could even finish my sentence he was like if he says you have to go...you have to go. The bartender knows he is wrong!  This situation could have played out very badly had I pushed this bartender back, but I did not touch him. I have never had a man lay hands on me and I and not going to start today. I requested to speak to the owner or manager but they claim he was not there.   Please don't go to this this bar as I was treated poorly and I will follow up with management as this is not right."

Everyone in the bar seemed to be enjoying themselves. I had a glass of wine while my friends sipped cocktails. The bar is upscale and offers a variety of wine, beer, spirits, and cocktails. It reminded me of trendy bars I've visited in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and San Francisco.  To me, they are all very similar. Nice place. Good time."

                "description": "They have an amazing HH that goes til 8 pm!! We stopped in for pre-dinner drinks. Beautiful bar, friendly service, nice outdoor seating area for people watching :)  We ordered a drink that was supposed to be jalapeno driven but didn't taste it at all, which was a bit curious. By mistake, they had also made us a jalapeno tequila drink, which they gave us as a courtesy. As we finished our cocktail, we tried the shot and this tasted exactly as I had hoped our drink would. For our 2nd round, I went to the bartender who had made our shots and asked him to re-create this in the form of a cocktail. Success!! HH drinks are very reasonably priced $6-9. Not quite sure what happened with our 1st round?? Normally, I'd expect the establishment to rectify the situation but they had given us free shots."

This last visit will probably be my last. Came in to watch the Cowboys game and while the drinks were good and the bartender made some attempt at service I felt like I was in a bar in the hood. Blaring gangster rap was all they played....all night!   I'm not anti rap and love hip hop  but  I really don't want to listen to non-stop fuck this and fuck that bitch while I'm trying to enjoy the game. I thought there would be a drive by shooting!"

They have a great wrap around patio with TV's, some outdoor games and toasty fire pits. The staff is always friendly and helpful. The menu is satiating with an assortment of hearty sandwiches (Nashville chicken) and shareable appetizers like fried okra and tin can nachos. Inside you will find a full bar, more TV's, indoor dining and arcade style games. This place doesn't allow kids, so it's a playground for adults who aren't looking for an all out bar situation.   Potential cons: highway noise on patio, no kids allowed, some of the less frequented cocktails may be lacking (not a martini bar)  Summary: Highly recommended for an adults only lunch or evening out."

                "description": "If you want to hang out at a bar for drinks, Lucy Coopers is great! It's loud, hoppin, and has multiple TV's for sports, fights, etc. Outside, there are interactive games, big fans for hot days, and warming fires/heaters for cool nights.   We decided to bring our son here to celebrate a week after his 21st birthday. We understand that the place is strictly 21 and up but it seemed overkill that he was carded when we entered the building, carded by two employees while we were looking for a table, and carded by two more servers as we sat at a table. We laughed about it but it seemed a bit unorganized.  The drinks were great! We ordered a few different mixed drinks followed by beer and seltzers. The food, however was disappointing. We heard great things about some appetizers they have on the menu so we ordered a few. The Clothesline Bacon, the fried Mac-N-Cheese, and the pretzel with queso (and some sort of marmalade but I'm not sure the flavor). Honestly, we didn't really like any of the food :( The bacon was chewy, thick, and had a strange taste and the Mac-N-Cheese bites were extremely greasy and flavorless. The pretzel was okay but a bit dry. We loved all the drinks and the fun atmosphere so we'll definitely be back -but we'll eat before we come next time."

Adult themed so if this is not you type of fun why not take a walk on the wild side. Bingo starts at 8 and they do get packed so If you want a good seat in the front get their early but honestly any seat is a party. Everyone was so nice and the fried green tomato blt and fries I had were amazing. Took my hubby there on the following Friday for their $10 Shrimp boil and we had a great time as well they weren't as packed but the place was still rather busy. Overall go here!! It's a family owned business and they treat you as such."

The service was the absolute worst ever. Went with 2 friends. All 3 of us said the food was WAY too salty. The drinks were 3/4 ice, their drinks had WAY more ice than mine. For the sandwich, fries (that I thought came with the meal and later learned they didn't), and 1 drink, my bill was $34. Eh...probably will not return. Sorry, Lucy."

                "description": "I added this place on my list to try after seeing this on Elder Eats/Texas Eats. I happen to be in the area with my family and decided to try. We wanted a place to sit outside and eat so we thought it was perfect. As we walked up, we saw people staring (probably because it was three black woman walking in). The restaurant was predominantly hispanic and white crowd but we are use to that living in SA. So, as we walked in, it took a minute for anyone to greet us. We honestly never got greeted and didn't even know where we could sit. Then, one of the waitress just said \"you can seat yourself\" so we proceeded to go outside. We waited for a waitress or someone to come and serve us but no one did. Everyone around us was just drinking and chatting. Periodically they would stare at us like we didn't belong. So after about 10 mins of no one helping us, we needed up leaving. Very disappointing because they were advertised on KSAT only for them to not be a welcoming place. I won't fully accuse them of not serving you because you're black, but just be prepared to an outcast if you're not non-black."

                "description": "Listen, ya'll -- that strawberry jalapeño jam was so good that I wanted to drive to a farmers market and find some for myself! We went for brunch on a Sunday and started off with the mini pitcher mimosas (genius btw) and the fried macaroni. They were cooked perfectly: crunchy on the outside, hot deliciousness on the inside with a side of strawberry jalapeño jam.  I had the Biscuit Trio so that I could have a little taste of everything. My favorite one had to be the fried chicken biscuit; the chicken was well cooked and of course, I got to pair it with the strawberry jalapeño jam lol the Chicken and Churro Waffles were delicious too but I would recommend it for someone that has a sweet tooth because the churro waffles taste just like a delicious churro - brown sugar and all. Thanks for the great experience, Cooper's! We'll be back soon."

We have always enjoyed our service (and food) until today.   13 groups of people in 50+ group setting. 5 servers standing around laughing and huddling. Our server Ali was MIA most all of our visit. Ask for Tabasco 3 times before in was provided with no apologies. Ali left with no information about who would take over. Saw her leave to the parking lot and left wondering.  This didn't appear to be an urgent need to leave as her and 3-4 other servicers reviewed tabs etc before she disappeared. A simple ' I'm leaving and this is who will be taking over' would have sufficed.  I'm frustrated with the experience. The food today is terrific as always. Service today is subpar. Very sad."

                "description": "I came here for the Nashville hot chicken sandwich. I heard good things. I also ordered the basket of onion rings. The rings were bulky and fresh and very tasty and crunchy. The Nashville chicken sandwich was excellent. Just the right blend of sweetness and heat. My advice is ask for the cole slaw on the side. The Texas toast gets soaked on one side with the juice from the cole slaw. The drinks are served in unconventional bar ware but it works. For example my old fashioned was in the glass pictured below. Stay away from the house margarita drinks as they are tiny in size. I also advise avoiding during Cowboys football games. That is unless you're one of the fans of Cowboys.  Bartender seemed overworked so bring your patience. She'll eventually get to taking your order."

My sister suggested Lucy Cooper's because she loves their food and outdoor patio is a bonus to her.  We shared the Boss Hogg, Krack fries, Mac and cheese, and I had the Honey Suckle Sangria Popsicle Margarita. Everything was so delicious! The Boss Hogg was loaded with pulled pork, smoked ham, applewood bacon, and smokey sausage, and smothered with Coca-Cola bbq sauce. Yum! We split it because it was too big for one person and we wanted to try a couple of sides. The fries were delicious. I looked on their menu and couldn't find their Mac and cheese but it was so, so good. I hope they didn't take it off the menu.   They have a great drink menu and I decided to try the Suckle Sangria Popsicle Margarita, I'm always down to try new drinks. It was great. We ate out on the patio which has a cool vibe with it's fire pits and chilled vibe. The service was great and the food and drinks were brought out in a timely manner.  All in all it is a great place and I will definitely be back to try more of their unique menu items. I love me some Cajun/Southern food and this place did not disappoint!"

Seems like every time I've come drink service is very slow. I would also order more food if there were more traditional bar foods. It gets a four because of the fun times I've had here.

I got the Nola barbecue shrimp and my husband got the prime rib. The shrimp was a little too sauced for my taste, and it comes with a biscuit sitting on top. I got the blood Orange cider, tall. I didn't realize how tall that is! The one rib sandwich was good, very generous with the meat, it came with au jus, really good. They have a free stouts on tap, which we appreciate. The service was fast and friendly. There is outdoor seating with misters, but you are on the access road, so, I imagine it's noisy. Cute decor, and several tv screens."

                "description": "This Ice House has become one of my top favorite places to dine in San Antonio. I have dined there three times already and never disappointed with the quality of the food or service. The chef is a genuinely sweet soul you can just tell cares about the food.  So much so, that I decided to order their Thanksgiving dinner package and boy was I NOT disappointed!  The package could easily feed a family of 8 or more and had a choice of ham or turkey; we got the ham. It was a large package that included homemade-style baked macaroni and cheese, green bean casserole, mash potatoes and gravy, dressing with cranberry sauce, rolls, sweet potatoes, and a dessert. Y'all I am Southern, from the backwoods of Mississippi and this meal touched my soul!  I am beyond impressed with the quality and seasoning of the food. The dressing was so moist but not in a mushy way; it was cooked the old fashion way like I had growing up in MS. The mac and cheese was cooked by somebody's grandma I'm sure of it cause it was too good. The rolls are out of this world and I hope I can order them anytime.   I am new here in San Antonio and I don't know if this is something they do every year, but it should and everyone should order at least once; you will not be disappointed.   Thank You Lucy Cooper for making my Thanksgiving amazing, The Patrick and Saunya ODwyer"

                "description": "Don't waste your time here - Horrible Management   My brother came into town from out of state, and we had to come to Lucy Coopers due to the amount of people we had. So coming here was not by choice - strictly the only option we had.   I forgot my ID at home and was not aware that you had to be 21 to be on the premises. Not only am I 25 years old, I am with my entire family and PARENTS that are validating my age.   The management told me I had to prove my age and if I had a photo of my ID that would work. Sure enough I had a photo and guess what, they said \"it could be fake\" so no it didn't work. SO WHY EVEN STATE THAT?  I'll admit I don't look my age, but still this is ridiculous. Then they stated if I had a photo of my birth certificate that would work and guess what again? Nope - could be fake even though I had a photo it.   These people are freaking ridiculous - not worth my money. If a cop accepts a photo copy of my ID and insurance a damn bar can too."

The fish was over cooked and the lettuce and tomato were old.  I got the honey chipotle shrimp tacos that were way to spicy for my taste. I would have asked for some sour cream to mild the spice; however our waiter never came to check on us until he brought the bill.  Literally everything we ordered was bad. Makes me sad we wasted a date night here."

                "description": "It was our first time at Fish City Grill and is definitely now on our \"Favorites\" list! We've tried dining here a few times but it's such a busy place, there is usually a very long wait (and we're too hangry to wait- lol). We got lucky on Sunday night and got a table right away.   The restaurant is casual with a lively atmosphere. It's cozy and inviting with a beautiful exposed brick wall featuring a chalkboard menu. The service was great and many menu items were suggested with tempting descriptions. I decided to start with the crab bisque followed by the fish tacos and my husband got a combo platter. Everything was incredibly delicious!  I normally wouldn't order beans and rice but decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I did! They were the most flavorful side I've ever had at a seafood restaurant.  I can't wait to go back, especially for the beans and rice! We also ordered the crème brûlée for dessert and it was absolutely scrumptious!"

                "description": "We've been here a few times and have had a decent experience but today was a miss on several dishes because the chef must have been heavy handed with salting the food. Also, the shrimp linguini which I liked a lot is no longer on the menu.  I had the Citrus Martini to start which seemed to be the only consistent item. My husband had iced tea and my Dad had the rootbeer. i had a cup of the crab bisque, my husband had a side salad and we shared the chargrilled oysters. The oyster I had was quite rubbery. I had the lump crab cake as my entrée and the salad could use some dressing. My husband and Dad shared a pick 3 plate with catfish and 2 orders of the beer battered cod. The cod was decent but the fries were salty.  Unfortunately a disappointing experience."

                "description": "If fried fish is on the menu, I'm trying it out. Being from NOLA I have a very high standard when trying fried catfish. Of course I had my doubts because how you going to have Alabama catfish rather than something local but never the less. The catfish was good. The fries were also a nice grease fried crisp.   The real reason for the 5 star is for the margaritas. Get them. My mother picked it up and expecting a basic marg I was hit was this amazing sweetness with just a hint of tang. Get the margarita.   The gf went with the fish tacos which were. Your basic taco but what really made it nice was the soft tortilla they used to WRAP the taco. I know weird but since the tortilla was so good the fish was just a filler."

It gets better, the girl came back in and they gave it to me.  At this point, I'm hungry.  I'm done waiting and the kitchen staff was amazing.  The hostess was nice and attentive.  I only took it because I saw the person who walked back in and the containers are see through.  Not sure what caused the mix up and I left a tip online when I placed my order.  Food sanitation rules mean they throw out the food but I'm rambling and disappointed.  I'll try them out again if this food tastes good."

They have the freshest seafood west of the Gulf.  The place has a feel of a neighborhood hangout where everyone knows your name.  The staff is friendly and very attentive.  Today when we stopped for dinner, we were celebrating a birthday.  Sarah, our server, was fast, friendly, and fun.  Will probably ask for her next time we stop in.  They have daily \"chalkboard specials\" along with a menu with something for everyone.  I had the scallops and bacon wrapped shrimp. Mom had the bbq salmon tacos.  Both were delicious.  Got the peel and eat shrimp for our appetizer, which come served on crushed ice on a silver platter.   Give it a try!  Well worth the trip."

It is very cozy in my opinion. In the restaurant, a few of the walls are decorated beautifully in the nautical theme. And then you have another wall that makes it feel like you are on an old ship eating seafood. I enjoy everthing there so far. May daughter orders off menu because she mainly likes butter pasta and grilled shrimp. I am not sure why they do not make that dish there, it is super delish! The fish and chips are awesome there. The fish and batter makes it light and not heavy at all. I have had a few of their house special entrees but I am curious about their specials. It was too late at the time when I ordered, that I saw the mussels dish that looked super interesting!  This place is tucked away near the HEB and across from Zios. If you haven't been, I highly suggest you go."

                "description": "This has been one of our favorites for a while. I just never sat down and wrote a review for them. Reasons we like it: great place, good atmosphere, excellent drinks, awesome food.  It's pretty small on the inside, but they just set up tables and chairs on the outside too which is great. Not sure whether they did that for the pandemic or not, but I really liked that change. This last time we were there, it looked like they were running at 100% occupancy which is good for them. My husband really enjoyed the music which was an 80's metal band feel.   We usually have to wait for a while before we are seated, so we were pleasantly surprised to only have to wait a couple minutes. And it was a Saturday night around 6:30, so prime time.   We ordered our usual drinks and appetizers. My husband likes the jalapeño margarita, and I like the Tito's lemonade. Mine wasn't as good this time. Didn't seem like there was any alcohol in it. We always order the oyster nachos WHICH IS A MUST! They are literally the best thing there. We even had to order two because my husband wanted more. We also ordered a cup of crab bisque which is also very good.  So this is one of the reasons I did not give 5 stars. The whole reason I went there was to get the crab legs, but they didn't have them! Sooo bummed, you have no idea! So I ended up ordering the scallops that were on the specials board, and my husband got the shrimp tacos. Both pictured and both excellent. One other dish that I didn't see but if they still have it you must try is the cheesy grits. So good too!  At the end, we ordered the bread pudding to go. For some reason I remember reading or hearing that it was the best dessert there. I was wrong. This was the other reason for the 4 stars instead of 5. We did order it to go, so that might have had something to do with it. Maybe if you stay and eat it in the restaurant, it would taste better. I don't know. It was just dry and the sauce wasn't good.  Again, one of our go to's as far as dining out goes. I guess I need to call next time before we decide to make the drive over there to make sure they have the crab legs."

It was a great performance, the beer was cold, the audience and ambience was terrific, Ive heard a great deal about the Phoenix chili and how its made with sirloin, and have been eager to try it, but the kitchen has such erratic hours, that i cant seem to find out when it's available, even if i call ahead. Definitely an oppty for improved consistency."

                "description": "Neat historic place to eat and have a beer or mixed drink. We are the angus burger with fried green tomatoes and potato wedges. The burger was dry, but that may have been due to the lean meat. The tomatoes and potatoes wedges were absolutely delicious. Have to add that we sat outside on the patio on a sunny day. The table was filthy and sticky. The staff should check outside ones in a while, or leave cleaning wipes for the guests."

This time however was just for lunch on a wonderful rainy afternoon! The hubs went with the chili and cornbread and I went with the chili fries to go!! It was so damn good!! We didn't talk to each other the whole time hahaha I say if you like sour cream get an extra one. Other than that I can't wait to eat there again!!! Love this place!!"

                "description": "A must visit bar and restaurant in downtown New Braunfels. The Phoenix Saloon has a rich history being registered as a Texas Landmark as well as being on a tour of haunted places! They've kept up that 1800's saloon feel, very cool!  That aside, their menu is delicious. Top shelf \"bar food\". But the must have is their homemade chili and cornbread. It's to freaking die for! But be warned, it comes in three levels of heat. The hottest would tear up the toughest of Texas cowpokes! They also have a full bar with a multitude of craft and domestic beers on draught.  The Phoenix is also well known for their showcase of local music talent. From a laidback guy strumming a guitar on the small stage during the afternoon, to full on rock and country bands on the big stage at night on the weekend. That said, the ONLY drawback is the music (during the afternoon) can be too loud at times. Still, add the Phoenix Saloon to your list to visit (or comeback for another visit!) you won't be disappointed."

                "description": "I never give any food/drink place five stars regardless of how good they are.  Also, four stars because it's a little dark in there.  Otherwise a great place to go and be seen without getting talked about, unlike at The Faust.  Nice to visit during the day for lunch and a beverage.  Definitely has a nighttime music vibe.  Very loud, be warned, but you can take your drink outside and sit on the patio and people watch.  I'm not a beer drinker, but I'll order a screwdriver.  I go so rarely and am always amazed that the barkeep knows what I drink!  I'll grab a stool and she'll ask if I want \"the usual.\"  Uncanny!  They could add some modern conveniences like purse hooks by the bar stools, but it's no big deal for me.  It actually keeps me from forgetting my purse if it perches on the bar counter.  I love this place so much that I have the urge to go tomorrow!"

                "description": "The Phoenix Saloon is conveniently located just off the main square on the corner of  San Antonio and Casteel with huge windows to look out to the street. I've been here several times over the years since they have opened. It's always a stop on the pub crawls!   What's not to love...  Long bar along the way for all those bar flies to hold up Lots of seating which is also great for groups Huge band stand for those night with live music Food!... how about that history of chili???  The history according to their website: \"Since 1871, our building has been home to various bars and saloons, most famously the original Phoenix Saloon. It was here in 1894 that William Gebhardt, proprietor of the back room cafe, invented chili powder! Prior to this, chilis had only ever been used fresh, but Gebhardt devised a process for crushing and drying them. Gebhardt brand chili products are still widely available today. The original Phoenix Saloon was reputedly the first bar in Texas to offer service to women. No lady who valued her reputation would dare be seen in a saloon, so the proprietor set up a ladies beer garden with bells in the trees for service. There was a deer pen too, and an alligator pit and badger fights. There was even a parrot on a perch just inside the front door that was taught to say, \"Have you paid your bill!?\" in German! Prohibition put an end to the good times at the Phoenix, which closed its doors on June 26, 1918. The Ludwig Building, as it was then known, was expanded and turned into a department store in 1922. In 1935, by now renamed the Schmidt Building, it was remodeled again. The building was home to a number of retail and service businesses until the Phoenix rose from the ashes, so to speak, on March 5, 2010. Like its mythical namesake, the Phoenix Saloon has been reborn! The new owners relish the building's flavorful past. In bringing the new incarnation to life, they've exposed the original 1871 brick wall, salvaged the old Phoenix Saloon beadboard paneling and re-used various old shutters, sinks and lights. Trying to celebrate all aspects of the building, they also constructed the 40-foot-long bar from the old department store cabinetry, flipped a mirror from the old shoe department upside down behind the bar and relocated a three-way dressing room mirror in the ladies restroom.\"  The Phoenix is also to be reported as being haunted... with such history, this shouldn't be a surprise.... Boo!   So go grab a local beer and some Texas Red with Fritos and a burger on the side... it's time to have a good 'ol time in downtown NB!"

All the tables rest of the tables were labeled with a reserved sign for 7:30.  We were not acknowledged or offered any explanation why there was no seating available.  We felt as if the employees were staring at us waiting for us to leave. And that's what we did.  We walked across the street to KRAUSE's where we were welcomed."

                "description": "Came for the chili and history.  They have 4 heat level chilis. They all start from the same base chili and then peppers are added ranging from jalepenos to ghost chilis. I stopped at habanero. Not blazing but good heat.  The toppings are pricy at $0.75 each for small amounts of onion, cheese, sour cream, etc. it adds up quickly.  The chili flavor is tasty. Large chunks or as they say hunks of browned sirloin (seemed like chuck) are widely dispersed in a thickened chili sauce. I prefer 80% meat with just enough reduced chili stock, theirs is more like 50:50.  Moved on to the blue burger. Menu says stuffed with blue cheese but it is actually mixed in the meat. It was well prepared and tasty.  The atmosphere is super chill and the Night Owls were on stage tonight, I'm impressed! Service is mostly order at the bar.  I'm pretty much a chili snob, I only like my own creation but theirs is pretty good if someone else is making it for you."

When we arrived the blonde bartender was assisting another customer for a hot 5 minutes. When she came over to us we asked to order food and she said the kitchen closed ONE MINUTE BEFORE. But ma'am, we have been standing here for a while... If someone took our order when we arrived, we wouldn't've been in this pickle. The place was not busy (2-3 3 tops max). I understand the kitchen is closed but I'm sure, positive even, that they don't throw out the chili as soon as the second hand hits 12. You could've asked the kitchen to scoop one bowl of chili out in exchange for money, and I bet $100 they would've done it. Why? Because I ask my kitchen guys all the time.   We will not be coming back and my boyfriend would like to speak to management/owners. Thanks."

More contemporary decor, cool looking bar, and well-spaced for social distancing.  Our server was very friendly but service was unreasonably slow. We were almost finished with our chips, salsa and queso by the time our bar drinks made it to the table.  My son really liked his Coco Rita and I really enjoyed the sangria.  However I was almost ready to cancel the drink order due to slow service.  Our table would not recommend the fish tacos. I had the Lisa's special which was great and my daughter liked her puffy tacos.  Clearly the labor shortages is real which impacted our service. That' said I would like to return  because it seems like it might be a better place for happy hour and cocktails."

                "description": "It's not exactly the same animal as the original Rosario's in Southtown, but Rosario's of the north still has a lot to offer. Despite many Tex-Mex eateries in the vicinity, the name here still carries a lot of weight for lunch-goers, tourists, and folks who simply can't resist their queso. (#1) I would probably consider them somewhere around a 3.5 star wise, but rounding up for potential.  This location is pretty convenient for the many locals who don't (ever) feel like venturing toward downtown. One thing that stands out immediately is just how spacious and modern it is compared to its sister location. The decor is on point, with a very free flowing interior, natural lighting all throughout, and excellent ambience. There is also an excellent outdoor space, which makes this venue a versatile one for just about any occasion.  Overall, the food is decent but I've yet to be impressed in the same way as the other location. After multiple visits, I've found the food to be saltier or simply lacking compared to the original spot. That's not to say that there aren't some good choices to be had. The margaritas are definitely killer and they go wonderfully with the griselda's tacos. I still think their fire roasted salsa is some of the best out there and I've enjoyed the pozole from time to time. Their signature queso is still quite good, but I find myself longing for Southtown Rosario's over this one, at least food wise.  The bar / lounge area seems like an ideal spot for happy hour, which I'm pleased to say is excellent for the prices. Even the bathrooms are in tip top shape. Service could probably step it up a bit, but their friendliness outweighs their tendency to be really slow. Whether it's for a date, casual lunch, or a special group outing, Rosario's North is still worth a look.  ________________ (#1) I know I can't be the only one."

We were still charged for everything. If you don't like something, you still pay for it at this location. The other location at South Alamo is worlds better. Such a disappointment. Manager came out said they were sorry and just handed the check over."

Services is very slow and inattentive  2. Chips and salsa order for 4 came with one really small cereal bowl sized bowl of chips.  (They charge for this and I get it) Refill was impossible since server was never at the table 3. Bar drinks took for ever.  This was 8pm on a Saturday night.  If service was quicker we probably would have ordered more!"

                "description": "The staff was extremely rude, fake smiles and a bunch of made-up rules- their dining area wasn't even half full, and they tried to deny us seating because we didn't have our entire party here. You can do that if you've actually got people lined up, but no, not when you don't have enough people to call it \"busy\". They then tried to charge $2 for a basket of chips and salsa, like it's just THAT expensive to provide those for free- you know, like literally every other Mexican restaurant in the state. Overall, it felt like they were trying to act like a fancy restaurant and have only figured out the snooty, expensive part of that experience."

                "description": "Having to take a traffic detour I find myself getting hungry so I look over and see the Northern cousin of one of my favorite South Town locations....serendipity! After a quick look over the menu, I decide on something a little out of my norm but it sounded so delicious based on the menu description (Chiles guajillos and pasillas are the foundation of the delicious sauce that tops 3 queso fresco-filled enchiladas. Served with avocado, cabbage lime slaw, and grilled jalapeno pepper. Topped with fried potatoes, carrots, cilantro, and drizzled with crema Fresca) that I had to try it along with a side of island white rice and boracho beans. When the plate comes out you can see this dark, thick sauce covering the enchiladas and smell the spices rising from the dish. As I take my first bite, the sauce and cheese blend so well together and pack a flavor punch to the palette....pow! I dip all the grilled side veggies provided into the sauce and down they go......bye bye! The side of rice and beans just compliment the meal and also blend well with the \"mole\" type sauce.  Overall, this was a pleasant surprise and I look forward to trying more of the menu."

                "description": "Rosario's is a super adorable Mexican restaurant near the airport with ample parking. The margaritas - not the best, not the worst - glad they were only $6 thanks to Happy Hour (4-7pm Sat). The queso - flavor wise, possibly the blandest queso I've ever had, although the hidden pico helped step it up a bit. That being said, it paired flawlessly with the chicken flautas I ordered, so I have no regrets tacking on an order of Queso Rosario's. My one true fault - I came here with two friends who both ordered the flautas especiales and both of them received food that was visibly burnt. While my food was great, they did not have the same impression. I will also add that our waitress was fabulous! I wish I could remember her name."

                "description": "Rosario's has two locations, I went to their North restaurant for dinner based on a Google search. While, this has the appearance of an upscale Mexican restaurant, the ambiance is not what I would have expected. The dining experience is very loud due to hard surfaces everywhere. Seating is not any better either with hard metal chairs. There were no booths I could see even though the dining area could certainly handle it. We were sat next to a table with a toddler who would let out a piercing scream occasionally.   Here's what's good about Rosario's. The food is very good. I shared the Fiesta Special (for 2, $28.95) with Beef and Shrimp. The food arrived quickly and sizzling hot. For the price I expected a bit larger platter but, it was still enough to share.   I also ordered a Cadillac Margarita which was very good. All total, the bill came to $52.44, making Rosario's moderately priced.  Our server was very nice, walked us through all the Margarita options but, honestly, some of the versions just didn't sound very appealing.  Who puts Sangria in a Margarita or, Coconut for that matter?  I liked Rosario's North for the food and service, just not for the loud environment and uncomfortable seats."

No balance of flavor whatsoever. I ordered pozole and after 1 sip, after adding my dressings, I had to send the plate back. It was so overly salted that I knew there'd be no redeeming the dish. I tried my partner's enchiladas and was grossed out. Ordered a bean and cheese taco on their *store bought* corn tortillas because I was so hungry"

                "description": "So excited for this place to open back up and what a disappointment it was.   The hostess was very friendly,  she seated us right away.  We were just a party of two .   We sat there for about 10 minutes without our waiter saying anything to us.  Another staff member walked over and asked me if I ordered a beer? I said no but, if you could find my waiter I'd love a glass of water.   A gentleman comes over with two glasses and says he's our waiter.  We finally have drinks. We know exactly what we want so we place our order.  My daughter ordered the Lengua and I ordered the griselda tacos.   Our waiter heads off after taking our order not to be seen again.  When we finally do get our food I noticed that we were given only two tortillas.   I looked at my plate and could tell immediately that something wasn't right.  I thought maybe the recipe had changed? Maybe tweaked a little? So I took a bite just to see.   The Griselda tacos have refried beans in them this is why I love that taco.  I flag someone over and told them that this taco should have beans in it. They tell me,  \"no it doesn't\".  I pull out my phone and pull up the menu and I have to show the gentleman exactly what the menu says he then realizes they made a mistake and ordered me the wrong taco. Again, I still haven't seen my waiter.  He pulled a vanishing act.   Such a shame this is always been one of my favorite places to go.   After waiting for 10 minutes to get more tortillas and my meal was replaced, all was good.   My tacos were terrible . It's like they were thrown together. I have to flag someone down to get my check. My waiter finally shows up.   I paid and left. I won't be going back."

They have a couple of local beers on tap, a small wine selection, and then a menu with many classic cocktails plus a couple of their own creations. I went with one of their house libations - emerald dagger. It had both gin and mezcal and I wondered if it would be too much, but it was flavorful and smooth.   Even with all the upscale decor, this place gave me divey feels and I loved that juxtaposition."

                "description": "When I go to a place for the first time I can become nervous and anxious. I would be best served if I just allowed myself to surrender to the moment. A place like Bar Ludivine has a very specific patron in mind. The decor is very simply stated but elegant. The antique velour sofa with pillows with cats. The high tables candle lit. The choice of 90's and an early 2000's mixtape playlist as background music.  Yes it is shabby chic but with a modern flair. This is not a \"Happy Hour at Taco Cabana\" type of bar. Its intended audience is a sophisticated and more mature demographic. A bar certainly meant for date night or someone rummaging through a Schopenhauer book.  But to the mechanics of this bar. It is located in Southtown a few doors down from Taco Haven. The place is really small, intimate and charming. On the drink end they have spirits, wines and beer. The mixologist, who happens to be the principle owner serves up drinks and will take your order from your table. Although they have a small paper menu with signature cocktails he can make you just about anything. Here is where I must interject. If you're expecting a bartender from your corner cantina this is not that place. He serves you and then let's you carry on a conversation with your company. Maybe patrons will confuse that with inattentiveness. I interpreted that as being the utmost professional as a person who takes their craft very seriously.  Two or three things I must implore to you. Since it is on a strip of South Presa that has finite parking I can already forsee this as an issue in the future. Secondly they don't serve any food, which would automatically bump this review to a four and a half stars. And lastly this place is not cheap. I'm a beer drinker and seven dollars even for craft beer not in a restaurant setting is a little pricey. Then again a date night, an opportunity to see live music or even an after dinner cocktail are not casual affairs. Not to say that a suit with matching ascot is the preferred attire here. I might turn my head twice if I saw someone wearing a \"King Diamond\" tshirt and dangling earrings at a table though.  Ludivine, which is a French name that means \"Friend of the people.\" At that capacity it does share those sensibilities. The choice of antiques, the shabby chic decor and the elegant chandelier all say I'm here for a sophisticated experience. From the glassware to the presentation of drinks the cultured, mature patron is definitely kept in mind. Southtown is filled with unique experiences both big and small. If you happen to be in this area and were on a date night, left a Broadway play or had a Hemingway book on hand I would recommend it. The service is excellent, the drinks are made by someone who takes his craft seriously and the ambiance is otherworldly. It is pricey but on a beautiful Friday night you are totally worth it."

The place was empty (it was 6:00pm) and we met Rob the bartender. They have some great signature drinks including some with Mescal.  I have never had a mescal mixed drink so it was fun to try some new combinations.  Rob was great and told us about the bar.  It has just been re-opened under new management and a new name.  We came back after dinner and the placed was packed.  They had local live music.  I highly recommend this place."

                "description": "One of my favourite - likely THE fave - coffee shops in town. LOVE!  Perfect house-roasted beans. They even make syrups, sauces, and caramels in house. Delish!  Doesn't hurt that they added beer (nice selection!) and wine, then went all next-level and actually brought a full-on brewery (Vista) into the gorgeous brick building.  Nice long hours if operation too - I'm not by *any* stretch of the imagination what you would call a \"morning person\", so it's great to have awesome coffee available beyond 3 p.m.  Chefs kiss!"

                "description": "Super trendy coffee spot! It's like in an abandoned warehouse or so it seems! But it really is true it's not always as it seems. We weren't sure what to expect from the outside but the inside was dope. Cool, comfortable seating, chill vibes and good coffee. Priced fairly and good treats if you are in the mood for something sweet to go with your coffee.   Pro tip: get a stroop waffle and place it on top of your coffee cup and it makes it nice and warm"

I came here with my son and it was our first time there so I asked what they would recommend. The question seemed to bother them. I ordered the horchata drink and it wasn't anything worth raving about. Won't be back and wouldn't recommend it."

                "description": "This place is hard to find. There's one sign that says \"drinks and coffee\" on the street level. The entrance does not have a sign, just instructions on how to open the door with the latch.   Staff was really nice and attentive and the inside is a pleasant, wide, open space. My main issue is the roasting process. Before I walked over to the entrance there was a ton of smoke covering the stairs leading up to the door. When I finally walked in I asked if this was the main entrance and it was. Once seated inside I could feel the smoke all around despite the heavy use of fans. I went early morning and now my hair smells like burnt coffee all day long.   Leaving the place also requires instructions and two hands. Not very user friendly when you're walking out with a cup of coffee."

                "description": "Loved, loved, loved the aesthetics of this place!  It was a little hard to locate. You just see a warehouse and have to do a double take to see if you're at the right place. You are!   I parked along side of the building. You walk along the side till you see the drink fresh coffee wall sign. Go up the stairs there to the big metal door. Something else I had to figure out.   Inside is spacious with a modern/rustic vibe. So inviting. There were plenty of tables and some couches to sit. Some wall art, plants and merch. They also have an outside area as well.   I ordered an iced vanilla latte. It was a little stronger than what I usually get from coffee shops but that's by preference. I was in and out due to it being near their closing time but vibes alone I will definitely be going back."

                "description": "Sometimes I amaze myself when I land in a place like San Antonio and you would think I would go straight to one of the fancy tourist destinations to get myself a foo foo $6 coffee drink. No I decide to drive through rain and construction crews through back alleys to an unknown warehouse district that looks to have no life going on but cars wizzing by..  That's what it felt like when I'm walking in the back of this warehouse with an old wooden staircase and rusty industrial metal speakeasy looking entry.  Talk about getting local at the get go...  Once you exit the craziness of SA and enter this place,  immediate things begin to calm to a welcoming environment here.  The welcoming smell of fresh beans roasting, a dude mixing up batches of liquid Chai extract, and a a lady making things tidy  the fear of thinking Yelp let you down start to dissipate.    The baristas here know their coffee and although the menu seemed a bit limiting on first glance, they do have the basics down, with a few items that are unique like having vegan horchata and steamed rice milk. On the other hand they seem to not have a vegan chocolate option so that was a bit of a disappointment.  Their chai also is pre-made with sugar so there is no option to modify that one either so not super Keto friendly unfortunately. But they do make a matcha latte that is made unsweetened and with the rice milk option I was intrigued so went with that.  They also offer almond and oat as alternatives. Note they only do 12 oz latte drinks and they are not cheap when you figure in an alternative milk is going to drive up your drink cost in the 5 plus range.    The drink itself was well executed. They do nice latte art and normally green tea matcha can be a hit or miss if you are adverse to the grass aspect of the matcha powder. Here it's smooth and I really think rice milk works great together with matcha.    Love the atmosphere here.  They play 80's and 90's music in the background which is fun and it's not too loud so you can study and get things done. Also like that they had plenty of indoor spots open as there was rain and so the outside patio was pretty much not useable.  Also like the funky bathroom with the \"shotgun\" theme San Antonio style.  Only in Texas.  Oh and I forgot to mention that you can come here and have a beer too.  I didn't see any taps but they had a cooler of local beers.  Maybe next time will partake.   Glad I ventured off the beaten tracks. Always enjoy the local experiences.  If you to do so too this might be a fun option.  Check it out."

The workers are always super friendly and the atmosphere is great. I was a little confused the first time I came. It looks like an abandoned building and not showy signs.

Great experience again and would come back if i'm ever on the side of the town."

                "description": "Hard to find, as it's hidden in the corner of an old warehouse, but worth the effort. Having just moved to SATX from Portland, Oregon, I would offer my perspective as a pretty savvy coffee connoisseur, and this place could easily have been lifted and shifted from the streets of pretty much anywhere in PDX and dropped in San Antonio. It definitely had the same vibe, both good and bad ... Portland java jockeys can be by turns snooty and chatty, and today we got the more chilly shoulder than has been our SATX experience, but no worries! The java was delicious, and I very much enjoyed the decor. There is clearly talent behind the bar; we'll be back."

                "description": "If I could give 10 stars I would! Major shoutout to this place, it is by far the best coffee shop / roaster I've been too. We were in town visiting family and me being the coffee geek I am started looking up coffee shops / roasters in the area and Shotgun coffee roasters came up and I couldn't be happier for checking them out! We were immediately greeted by the smell of fresh coffee being roasted as we walked in. Super cool to check out the whole process from roast to cup. The Ethiopian V60 my fiance ordered and the cappuccino I ordered were done PERFECTLY! No joke, the barista who made our drinks is a true artist in his craft for sure. I like to consider myself somewhat knowledgeable of the coffee scene but this place reminded me of the amateur I still am, and I still have a LOT of learning to do lol. All the fruity, floral notes of the Ethiopian shined in a way only someone with the right experience in brewing could make happen. And the shots pulled for my cappuccino had absolutely no bitter / sour notes whatsoever. They were all done perfectly! From the woman roasting the coffee when we walked in to the awesome barista who prepared our drinks, seriously Kuddos to you guys! This will be our new go to spot when we land in SA from now on!"

                "description": "I'd like to think I've done my fair share of indulging in beer tastings, festivals, tours and what not. But I've never, ever done a pub crawl. My point of reference has always been the one I have seen during First Friday. You know the one, the one with women in tutus and dudes in, tutus  running down St. Mary's Street. I imagine with all the barhopping from checkpoint to checkpoint sooner or later someone is gonna ralph all over a sidewalk.    However, I was talked into doing the one St. Arnold Brewery had put on recently as a promotional event. Five check in points for a pint glass created specifically for this event. You are given five locations to choose in any order: Stella Public House, Frank's, BandD's, The Friendly Spot and your final destination Alamo Street; a punchout card and roughly three hours to have it all filled. Pretty straightforward, right? Well.  A couple of things happened along the way while checking into places. One issue the flow of pub crawlers was not congruent with stay time. For example the Stella Public House was maxed out to capacity, due to the traffic of participants. I did skip it opting for Frank's a few yards down but nonetheless the results were the same. The thinking is that you had to have a drink at each point, which some people did. I must reiterate you don't have to drink anything at any of the locations to participate, you just have to have your card punched by a rep.  Moving from the direction of the Blue Star Complex towards the area of the Friendly Spot the crowds either tapered off or dissipated. For example BandD's was hours away from the mad rush. And The Friendly Spot had plenty of seating. In my opinion I think the event would've benefited from having locations  spread across Southtown, thus alleviating traffic and creating urgency. Another minor critique is I would've actually liked to have seen St. Arnold's booths of some sort offering their beers on tap or in a can at destinations.  Still in it's totality I enjoyed the experience despite some of its shortcomings. Seeing participants go from spot to to spot with their magic punchout card, as though it were an Olympic Event; was kinda inspiring. And the rad pint glass, my Major Award at the end was a sight to behold. I definitely would like to do one again at some point, I just need to begin training.  ps. I saw some people stumbling at the tail end. Lucky we didn't have to pass some torch or baton of some sort..."

                "description": "Cheers!  St. Arnold's Pub Crawl is so much fun!  The Houston brewery puts these on every year, or more often if you're lucky. Basically, you get a punch card at one of five local bars that are all close to each other. At each pub, you get your St. Arnold's card punched. Get them all punched, and collect a free special edition pint glass! Score! Prost!  St. Arnold's is the oldest independent brewery in Houston, the city's first real microbrewery. They've since moved to a bigger and classier location to churn out the beer! They offer a bunch of favorites, and usually some cool seaonals. Be sure to check out a different St. Arnold's beer at each stop!  You'll be sure to know where the crawl ends- you'll find St. Arnold's Art Car, plastered with St. Arnold's art, in the style of the Houston tradition and infamous Art Car Parade.  Did you know that Saint Arnold is the patron saint of brewers? In order to become a saint, you have to perform some miracles. St. Arnold's was that he and some thirsty worshipers were going on a pilgrimage, and came across an empty house, where they found a single beer, and a mug. They poured the beer into the mug, and started passing the beer around to the thirsty monks- but as they passed it around, it never went empty! The beer kept providing sustenance and booze to the monks until they could drink no more. It was a beer miracle! St. Arnold was canonized, as this beer obviously came straight from Heaven. When I went on the Pub Crawl, it was through Southtown, ending up in the Blue Star area."

My prior visit had me and my daughter missing things in our order and really messed up our way we ate our meals.  No apologies from management or even an explanation.  However our recent visit made up for it this round. Don't get me wrong, the staff has always been nice. Thi recent visit gave me back the confidence in ordering what I want without fear of messing up our order."

This time my avocado egg rolls were disgusting!! They should be embarrassed to sell food this bad! How do you make something burnt mushy?! And who wants to eat rotten avocados?! Absolutely disgusting!! Too expensive to be worse than McDonald's!! Y'all should be ashamed to sell people rotten food that is very obvious to the eye that it's bad! What? Y'all don't care that y'all sell rotten food to customers??!! Very disappointed!!"

                "description": "I had not been to BJ's for quite some time. I arrived around 5:15pm and the place was rather empty. Good for us as we were able to order and get our food rather quick.   There menu is huge and there is definitely something for everyone. It took me back to the days of my children being picky eaters and having to try and find each one something the would eat. Here there is everything from salad, pasta, pizza, sandwiches, soups, chicken, to other amazing dishes.   I was not starving so I went with the Enlightened Asian Chopped Salad. The dressing was tangy but good. I loved the mandarin oranges the really set off your tastebuds! I wound up only eating half and taking the rest home.    I ordered their Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts as an appetizer and they were amazing. I had some of those left over I took home as well.   The restaurant was clean and the staff was friendly from the hostess to the waiter.   By the time we were leaving which was 6:15pm the place was jam packed. This place fills up quick!"

                "description": "Typically we have excellent service at this BJ's  restaurant in north central San Antonio. However, today was horrible. Not sure if they're understaff or the staff that served us had no idea what she was doing. Sadly, the experience was substandard. My salad had old wilted Romaine lettuce. Other ingredients were to be found. Ugh. My husband asked for a second beer that never came. We asked for a meatball on my daughter kid spaghetti that never came either. I hope they get it together quickly, as this is a great place to eat and spend time with family. It was hard not to leave a 20% tip, but barely a 10%."

                "description": "Have been to this location several times, tonight was the worst... Service 2/3 stars Food     2/5 stars Accomodation 3/3 stars Overall 63.6%  The server was very attentive, appologetic, and seemed genuine. The 1rst entree I ordered was unavailable, but no hard feelings there considering my F@* @$$ ordered a pack meant to feed 4. We tried the cheese rolls which were meh...  The 2nd entree I tried to order ended up being sold out, which led to the 2nd appetizer order.but the WTFocado eggrolls were so horrible we did not even consider touching them. They came out with no sense of presentation and the sauce was missing. They were squished and looked like they were double dipped in the bat fryer. Perhaps they were served and the cook tried to re-cook a forgotten order and thought that monstrocity of a plate was presentable. (See picture) The guy who brought out the food just dropped the plate at our table like a passive aggressive ex who got called out by a judge during a divorce preceeding.  My 3rd entree request was finally available, but oh I wish it wasn't. I often order the Jambalaya, but this time what came out was a smaller, burnt, less appealing version like ordering airpods on amazon, but getting some pear brand knock off instead. The Pizookie tasted good, just lacked any presentation which literally is just scooping ice cream onto a warm cookie.     The manager apologized for overall poor food, and the waiter for the trouble the night that ensued. Our meal was mostly comped and all I really paid for was my beer and desert, and decent tip for the poor server."

                "description": "COVID-19 protocol is limited to mask wearing. There's no temperature check at the entrance and lots of customers standing and waiting with no physical distance enforcement. Ordered curbside service but there's no parking enforcement. I also learned this BJ's restaurant has dine-in available. This explains the crowd of customers waiting to get seated. I called from the parking lot. The curbside team was overwhelmed and requested I come in. My curbside delivery order became takeout. After waiting 25 minutes past my 5:30pm pickup time, my order arrived.  This was definitely my worst experience at this BJ's restaurant location. IMO, was the best one in the San Antonio area. Overall rating 1 star. Management needs to focus their efforts on takeout and online orders. The limited dine-in capacity due to COVID-19 does not generate enough business."

                "description": "The food is bland. I order the Fettuccine Alfredo and it tastes like the sauce was water-based. Horrible. Guess I'm going back to Olive Garden.  UPDATE: I just spoke to the manager who seems like an incredible man. Thank you for the kind conversation. The review remains the same though. I told him I'd reorder the same meal in 3 months to see if a change occurred. We'll see.  He agreed, though. THE WAY WE SERVE EACH OTHER IS AN INDICATION OF HOW MUCH WE CARE.  Does BJs Restaurant \"care\" about its customers? I'll tell you in 3 months."

                "description": "Ordered curbside through their website. They improved it greatly since their last major promotion on Veteran's Day that shut it down. The only problem is it doesn't allow you to make remarks on items on your order. It also didn't let me add my promotion even though it said was added. The service was good and fast, so their curbside service was great this time. The food was pretty good, no major complaints there other than they forgot my sauce for my salmon. Considering they are working through COVID, I think they did a good job and would order food their again."

I would not particularly recommend their brussels sprouts as they look ugly in the first place and served at room temperature, making them even worse.It is one of those places that when you ask for a Diet Coke, they quickly ask if Diet Pepsi is OK?   Their horse radish is creamy and it's too mild. Otherwise, the food is quite good.  We definitely will go back there and eat again."

                "description": "Tonight was an adventure for sure. To start off, the managers were great. Now for the rest of the experience... For safety and security of the staff, names will be changed. While I was running late, my buddy had her paw caressed by the waiter (HAROLD) as he was handing her a mijito of sorts. She didn't appreciate this one bit. I arrived to the table and saw that it was happy hour! Those mozzarella sticks looks amazing and just had to have some. We ordered two orders, expecting them to come at happy hour price, only to be fooled, duped, and embarrassed. The happy hour menu items only apply to those ordering from the bar area. How the hell can I get a seat over there!? Why were we seated in the extra expensive seating? Anyways... As the food was arriving, we were graced by the presence of CARL. This kid was delivering food to tables. He had no idea what we ordered. He tried to give my friend a bacon burger when she ordered a brisket burger. Not knowing if it was correct, he put his paw ON THE BUN, lifted it up and proceeded to HAND IT BACK and say \"Well, enjoy!\". The entire table was disgusted and he never looked up to see the obvious error he had made. He couldn't have cared less. One of us got a manager and they offered to fix the situation by getting a new plate and gave my friend a new mojito. Our actual waiter told us that the kid \"was an interesting guy.\". Our pregnant friend ordered a burger well done and received a raw burger. This was also replaced and also attempted to charge for both! Among the events of the night, the booth seat ate another friend's phone. The managers told us that it happens ALL THE TIME. But they struggled to retrieve it even. We eventually retrieved the phone with a different manager. And then it was time to pay. To our complete surprise, we were charged for everything PLUS ITEMS WE DID NOT ORDER. The managers fixed the tickets but it was a struggle to think that only one section of the entire restaurant gets happy hour. The burger that was contaminated by a incompetent worker was charged to the bill. The entire time, our four member party was having a fun and light hearted time about everything that had happened but being charged for everything was an unexpected insult and unprofessional. Thanks for the memories, BJ's but we won't be back for a while. 2 stars for the laughs, -3 for the staff and bills."

It was Sunday and we had came for the prime rib the prime rib is a full course meal so we can get some salad prime rib with two sides and a Pazooki for dessert. We both got the chicken tortilla soup which was bomb fresh avocado and one of the very few places I can say has great tortilla soup. The prime rib was huge and cooked just right I had a side of the honey Sriracha brussels sprouts and white cheddar cheese mashed potatoes so fulfilling I couldn't even finish it all and I and my husband ended with me getting the white macadamia nut  pazooki and him getting the chocolate chip pazooki to go still with a huge cookie and a big cup of ice cream. BJ you definitely hit the spot can't wait to come back from more  prime rib."

Today not only did it taste nasty. It was NOT the same pizza from last weekend. I ordered same pizza and toppings. They left out the pepperoni and and all I got was a flat tasteless pizza. With wayyyyy too much cheese. The crust wasn't fluffy and light. It was flat and the pizza itself is dense and soggy. We go there for the great chicken wings, wedge salad with the Tri Tip and their yummy homemade sodas. I don't think we'll be frequenting anytime soon. Threw it out. They need to have some consistency with the way it's cooked and prepared. Really disappointed as the rest of the meal was pretty good."

They sat my husband and I in the back room where the staff was having a meeting. I thought it  was weird that they sat right next to their meeting, it was a little uncomfortable cause it felt like we were interrupting there meeting. Then they started to bring more costumers to that same room, I stood up thinking they were packed, but what we realized was that they were seating all Hispanics and blacks in the back. We ordered, ate, paid our bill. As we walked out we scanned the whole restaurant and saw that only whites were seating in the main room. That was unbelievable! I thought discriminating people for their color was over! I guess I was wrong. This needs to stop!"

                "description": "Order shown in the picture. This was my first time ordering this meal.  Recommendations/Review:  1. I would request the tri-tip with the BBQ sauce on the side; the sauce was a bit too salty for my taste, so I had to literally wipe it off with a napkin. I can't knock BJs for it, since there was an option to get the sauce on the side. ThT said, BBQ sauce shouldn't be THAT salty (my opinion, of course).  2. I ordered the salad without croutons, mine came with them. This is not a HUGE deal, since they're fairly easy to take out, but sticking to the order should be the goal.  3. The chicken was perfect!  4. The asparagus was tucked into a corner,  VERY soggy, and a little cold upon delivery. However, taste was spot on.  Note: I did NOT order this meal for \"priority delivery\" via Uber Eats; perhaps my meal would have been warmer had I opted for \"priority\" delivery. Do I dare say, though, I shouldn't have to order priority to get warm food. Knowing asparagus does NOT do well in the microwave, I still stuck it in for 25 seconds, not that into cool steak. To the favor of the restaurant, it WAS cold outside and, although I met the delivery person at the door (the food didn't sit outside), I'm sure the weather didn't make it easier to deliver a warm meal.  Ordered: Tri-tip and Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad"

                "description": "I don't know why this place is even active in San Antonio. The quality of food is terrible. I've eaten at taco carts in Mexico where the meats were grilled off an old steel auto wheel. That was amazing. BJ's on the other hand is meant to people who can't taste. Well there you go. COVID has taken the taste and smell from the return customers here. That is the only explanation I can come up with. Plus the place was filthy AF. The Mexican taco cart was immaculate in comparison to this restaurant. One one thing that was on point was our server. I'm sure this cat knew how shitty it was to go eat here that he went above and beyond so that we wouldn't complain. Which we never do because I use to work I. The food service industry and the number one rule is don't F with people who Handel your food.   Bathrooms were disgusting as well. I've peed in back alleys at boys town in Mexico what were in better conditions than this bathroom here."

We each had a nutty brewnette to drink then ordered a spicy pig tavern cut pizza and the spicy peanut chicken soba noodles. Both of us had stomach cramps on the way home and found ourselves puking dinner back up 20 minutes later. We both shared the food so no idea which plate caused the problem.   We'll still go to the Alamo ranch location but the rim is out. Really too bad because the service from the bartenders was really great."

I had the potstickers which had the crispy base and a dumpling sides. The sauce was really good.  I love the tomato mozzarella salad ... covered in olive oil and a balsamic glaze on a bed of arugula.    Service was spot on .. we sat at the bar. TV everywhere ... sports for days!"

                "description": "Overall eating lunch here was a good experience. The kids had many items to choose from and the regular menu is large as well. I really dislike the digital menus, perhaps I should have asked for a regular one.  My club was excellent, however my fries came out after my sandwich. That was strange, I never have had that happen before. My beer was also on the warm side, I'm not sure if it sat on the bar for a while or their coolers are a bit warm.  I would eat here again, but I would probably go for a mixed drink or try a bottled beer.   The other items brought to our table looked excellent too, I tried the tomato-mozzarella salad, and have to say it was incredibly good."

It took 10 minutes to get a Moscow mule with that much else going on at the bar, being that we were just there to relax I wasn't super irritated but let's be honest the bartender was Mia 50% of the time we were at the bar sitting down. We got food to go which we found out when we got home that his order was wrong, asked for jalapeños on the his pizza and they put olives but jalapeños was on the ticket so definitely a kitchen error, overall I would order Togo from here again or do pick up."

Anyway, the food arrived and yes it was good.   I love the deep dish veggie pizza. I just wish it was just out of the oven. It was still good if cold  but if I am going to be eating that much bread the carbs have to be worth it.   The queso dip with hatch green chilis and chips, good!  Fish and chips were delish, fish was fresh amd meaty, not just breading.    Ok BJ's you did good tonight but yall need to get a drone to bring me my food but please make sure the drone has one of those thermal containers to keep my food warm. Thank you BJ's."

It came with 12 scoops of ice cream which was overkill and was $27! The trio is half of the price and half the food, not sure why we were t explained the size and price. But over all the cookie was good and we ate about half. We got peanut butter which is good but would be better without the whole peanuts, cookies and cream, white chocolate macadamia and the sugar which was our favorite flavor"

                "description": "My partner and I are fans of BJ's Brewhouse and decided to eat here for date night. We requested a table outside but the hostess ignored our request and seated us indoors. Not a big deal, however, with COVID-19, I think it's important to honor a guest's request, especially if outdoor tables are available. She also could have let us know that it would be a wait if there weren't tables available. We saw that they had put in plexiglass between the booths and went ahead and sat down in the booth that was offered to us. Something that I did notice were that the tables were not spaced out 6 feet. If you were sitting at a table, you would be back to back with another party and wouldn't be 6 feet away from them.   Our meal was just okay - we ordered the prime rib that is on special on the weekends and a wings appetizer. The appetizer and main entree came out quickly, however, it took some time for our pizookie to arrive. We normally wouldn't order dessert but it came with the prime rib special, so why not? Our server seemed overwhelmed by the amount of tables he was given, however, we still received drink refills and our check in a timely manner. We noticed on our way out that there was a big crowd waiting to be seated and most patrons were not practicing social distancing. We won't be visiting again anytime soon, but I wanted to share my experience in case you were thinking of eating here."

He was there to get our drink order right when we were seated (and he was tending bar too!). He was quick with drink refills and checked on us very often. We were so impressed with how he tended a full bar (people seated at all of the bar stools) and an area of tables in the bar. He was very pleasant and made our lunch even more enjoyable.  Keep up the great work Joseph!"

We came here Sunday at 1, and many of the more popular restaurants at The Rim were over an hour wait time. BJ's was able to sit our party twelve immediately.  I like that BJ's has an extensive menu, so there is a little something for everyone. Since I just did a two hour hike I wanted to treat myself. I ended up getting the Fresh Atlantic Salmon (840 calories) and the BJ's Baked Beignet (630) calories. Both were good.  The service was pretty fast and the waiter did a good job managing a party of our size. There were 40 inch TVs round the restaurant for us to catch the NBA playoffs."

                "description": "Stopped in for lunch. Had never been for lunch before so was interested in trying their lunch menu. So the daily specials we were used to for dinner on certain days are only for dinner, so don't go for lunch hoping to get the ribs on Thursday.   I decided to try the Meat Lovers Piadina, comes with pepperoni, Italian sausage, meatballs, basil and their cheese blend. The waitress explained it as the topping wrapped up in the thin crust, so in my head I'm thinking like a calzone. It comes and it's literally the crust folded over the toppings like a crispy panini. First thought, this is different. Comes with a ramekin of marinara sauce to tip into. First bite, wow. The crispness of the crust and the seasoning of the marinara inside with the toppings, just wow. Loved it! Was torn between this one and the chicken bacon ranch, and I bet that would've been just a great!  Wife got the half California club flatbread and a house salad. Crust was just a amazing and the toppings were fresh! Avocado on top was the perfect green and the tomatoes were just right!"

                "description": "ITALIAN BUTTER CAKE! That's it, that's the whole 5-star rating.   But incase you need more convincing for dining at North Italia I'll add more details. Came in for brunch and totally nixed the brunch food. I headed straight for a hard cocktail and pizza (the love of my life). For the cocktail I ordered the Sicilian margarita and it was very citrus-y, like lip puckering but in a good way because I ordered another round. Lil Mama likes a good margarita.   For my meal I ordered the margherita pizza. I was very thrilled to know it's basically their cheese pizza. It came with red sauce and cheese which was all I wanted. The crust was just right, not too crispy, they even had a lil salt on it because it was salty but paired well with the margarita. Lastly I treated myself to the Italian butter cake-oh what a treat!! Like it's one of those on death row what you want your last meal to be? Serve me up some butter cake.   Outside patio was a great seating option. It was a lil chilly at first so they had the heaters on but as the day warmed up they cut the heaters off and opened up some of the Sun screen to let the air in. Service was attentive and respectful. Overall great experience."

                "description": "This place gets three stars for one reason. Service. I went here for brunch time on a Sunday. I sat with my guest at a table for two outside. There weren't too many people outside but it took forever to get any service. Took 15 minutes to order and get grilled bread and then another 15 min to order our entree. Once we finally got our food (which in my opinion was super good), took 30 min for our server to come back. My guest had asked for Parmesan and red pepper for her pizza and never got it. We also had to give our waiter our credit card without asking for the bill first because we had already been sitting there for 15 min after completing our meal.  The food is high quality so you also expect high quality service and it's just not there yet."

                "description": "If you love delicious food then this place is it but if you dislike waiting a longggggggg time for your food then you better think twice.   My best friend and I stumbled across this place by chance and we're so excited to try it!   We started with a half order of caesar salad that came out pretty quick!   However, when it came to our food we waited a long time. I'm pretty patient and understanding when it comes to restaurants and how busy they can get but this took longer than usual.  I asked a server that happened to walk by to get a manager just to check on the status of our food because our server hadn't checked on us for about 15mins.   When they did finally get someone all the manager did was place the food on the table and walk away.  He did not once acknowledge us or the fact that we had been waiting so long. It was very rude.  Regardless I was hungry so we indulged and the food was delicious! It was luke warm which I'm sure was from the fact that it probably was sitting there before I got someone's attention but nonetheless I will give credit to the good food!   I wish our experience had been different because this place felt like it had it going on!"

                "description": "I got a sneak peak yesterday at North Italia at the RIM. The place is gorgeous! Super nice inside and a lovely patio for those wanting to eat outside when the sun isn't melting your face off.   The Glazed Short Rib Cavatelli is absolutely delicious. The short rib melts in your mouth and the cavatelli is mixed in a sauce of Parmesan cream and fresh horseradish sauce. ( FYI I loathe horseradish sauce and I only ordered it at the insistence of waitress who assured me it was so minimal, it wouldn't effect the dish). Very glad I listened! A must if you go here.   The Chicken pesto was fresh and was aesthetically pleasing! I personally thought the pesto was a little overpowering but my dinner date loved it!   The Chef's Board \"charcuterie\" was tasty and the Sicilian Margarita was great. I wasn't really a fan of the buttercream cake but others may enjoy! All in all, a nice addition to San Antonio's culinary scene. It opens up to the public on June 9th."

                "description": "I'm not usually a fan of Italian restaurants, mainly because having eaten Italian food in Italy, I'm forever ruined on the Americanized  versions of this cuisine. North Italia may have just changed my opinion on that. Their food is absolutely beautiful in both flavor and appearance. I was completely blown away by their pasta. My husband ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, and I have to say that they are probably the best we have ever eaten stateside. The meatballs themselves were absolute perfection. And the sauce...I don't even know where to start. It was thick, rich and complex in flavor, and I haven't had anything that good in a very long time. I couldn't stop sneaking bites from his bowl it was so good! My meal was the diver scallops, and they were equally impressive. Seared beautifully and again, seasoned to perfection.  The service was fantastic and our server DC made sure we enjoyed every minute of our visit.  Highly recommend this restaurant!! For lack of a better word...YUM!!"

                "description": "Came here on a Saturday evening around 5pm. This was our first time dining here. They were pretty busy but we were seated right away. Ambiance is trendy. There were customers of all ages.   Service was good. Ordered the Arancini as an appetizer, per our server's recommendation. We found it a bit bland, wasn't that noteworthy. Ordered the spicy meatball pizza to share. I added crushed red pepper to mine and enjoyed it but my companion didn't add anything and didn't find it spicy on its own. Although not spectacular, I enjoyed the pizza but my companion didn't care for it that much and thought the crust was overdone.   The check came out to $90+ for an appetizer, 2 glasses of wine, and a pizza. Prices are steep but we're willing to give it another go."

We had a delicious Skyfall Cab and started with the White Truffle Garlic Break. Let me just say this bread was AMAZING! We will definitely be ordering it each time we go. The chicken parmigiana was crisp and the breading was flavorful and it was paired with pasta coded in white Alfredo sauce. We will definitely be back to explore the rest of the menu. Great spot for a date night or just a night out with friends."

                "description": "I've been wanting to check this place out for sometime but hadn't had an opportunity until my granddaughter's 18th birthday. She picked it so why not?   Nice ambiance, can be romantic or seat a party of 14 like it did for us. There is no dress code but it's a nice place people make it special. It also has a nice patio outside for those of you who like that vibe.   The drinks were really good I tried the old fashion and would order it again. A ginger margarita and a sangria was also ordered - I forgot to take pictures before we started drinks but everyone said they would definitely order again.   For appetizers we tried the calamari and the white truffle garlic bread both were yummy. With the bread, don't forget to spread the butter with garlic truffle on each piece-not everyone at the table knew to do that.  I ordered the glazed short rib cavatelli it was delicious and the meat was really tender.  The spicy rigatoni vodka, chicken pesto, wagu skirt steak tagliata, chicken Parmesan, strozzapreti and the diver scallops were all ordered at our table and not one person was disappointed- I have to say I did try each one and now need to think about what I want to order when I come back because they were all so good!"

                "description": "I honestly wanted to like the food here, however it wasn't meant to be.   We ordered the #1 and #2 diners favorites listed on the Door Dash menu.   #1  My husband had the chicken parmigiana. It was burnt, dry and lacked flavor. Very little sauce on the chicken and zero sauce on the rigatoni - just boiled noodles.   #2  I ordered the bolognese. I wasn't as disappointed as my husband, but the sauce was as thick as chili and on the salty side.   The non-traditional tiramisu had crunchy chocolate balls on top - which was odd to me. Missed having lady fingers, but overall the flavor was good.  We spent $90 with service fees and tip. That was a lot to spend on what we received. The restaurant was quick to prepare, Door Dash was quick to pick up and drop off, so it had no barring on this situation.   I can see by the other reviews that great experiences are had here. We just weren't as lucky."

                "description": "First time visiting North Italia. I had been wanting to go for the longest time, and finally, I had my chance. It is located at the Rim, next to Lick ice cream and Luxor, Mediterranean food. Both added to my list of places to visit in the Rim.  I went to North Italia to meet a friend and we ordered a cesar salad and a pizza to share. Service was pretty good and the food came out fairly quickly. We ordered the Pig Pizza, which has sopressatta, pepperoni and Italian sausage. It was quite good and is a shareable size. I also liked that our waitress separated the salad into two separate bowls.   The pizza prize was $17, which I felt was reasonable, but the cesar salad at $12 was high for the portion. I also felt that the rest of the prices, especially for some of the pasta plates were extremely high. As an example, the Bolognese pasta was $20 dollars!   So, although the service and food pretty tasty, I don't know that I would return due to prices."

The environment was calming and light and as you walk in you feel and smell the Italian culture surround you. Our waiter was so laid back and did his job perfectly. The food proportions were absolutely on point. The wait was seem less and the food came out right as seemed it was supposed to. This a great place for a date night, as it was for my Wife and I. Take your friends, family and peers here and get ready for incredible experience!"

We were quickly welcomed and seated by the hostess and this is just a beautifully aesthetic restaurant and you can really tell the time they put into the details.   We had Monique and 2 trainees serving us today and they were thorough in walking us through the menu and taking our orders. We ordered everything they recommended - crispy calamari, white truffle garlic bread, their daily pizza and a chicken Cesar salad.   The calamari was light and really offset the white truffle garlic bread - which was super tasty and I love how they incorporated the truffle.  The daily pizza was an Italian sausage with red peppers and olives and paired perfectly with their Cesar salad.  There wasn't any room for dessert so we'll definitely be back for drinks and dessert."

We did have reservations (highly recommend you have reservations as well) and were seated promptly. The young girls that greeted us were very cheerful and welcoming. Definitely the right people at the door!  Our waiter (forgot his name) was great, since it was our first visit, we went with his recommendations and he was spot on from the appetizer to main entrees. Honestly, I wish I could've sampled everything on the menu.   The restaurant was very clean and the kitchen looked very prepared. This place has a very cool outdoor seating area. Definitely a great place for happy hour and meeting up with friends or colleagues after work.   To say the least, this will be our go-to Italian place from now on.   Gray job everyone!"

It wasn't very busy and we were immediately seated in a nice booth that created the illusion of separation. I couldn't see anything behind me! This is a good thing btw!  We ordered some drinks and apps for the table. A couple Old Fashions, Mexican tea, and a drink off the secret menu that was delicious but I can't remember the name. The drinks were beautiful and tasty.  For the table we had the lemony hummus, the charcuterie, the hot Nashville chicken sliders, a cheeseburger, and honey butter chicken biscuit.  The lemony hummus came with fresh, crispy carrots, watermelon radishes, and celery. The hummus was creamy and tangy. It has a lot of dill, but I didn't mind that at all.  The chicken was a tad burned, but it was good the biscuit was soft and yummy, but it could have used a little more honey. I think the cheeseburger was the star. It was perfectly cooked and just hit the spot. The fries were also good. Just what I wanted!  The charcuterie was tiny, but it had some great treats.   And our waiter was phenomenal. He was attentive and super engaging. He gave us lots of information and we had a lot of fun small talk with him too."

Server was nice but food took so long at one point she said it would be here but then It didn't come for another 30 minutes, this was around 4 pm  When it arrived, the scallops had enormous amounts of sausage like ham. Not sprinkled but probably a third of the dish. This was NOT in the menu. It was hard to push aside there were so many and we were afraid to send any food back due to the time it took to arrive. We had 2 orders of scallops around $35 each for only 3 scallops.  We also ordered the special meat loaf, that was good.  Bring a sweater, it is freezing in there and certain booths have the air blowing directly at you.  Interesting place, but too pricey for what you get... not much."

We had the charcuterie and meats that were on the board were extremely thick. We also had the crab cake and it was mediocre. Not bad but not great. During Covid I do wish they had updated their hours and even now on yelp it states they are closed which is not correct. During Covid it stated they were open when they weren't. No one is monitoring the marketing for what it seems. Hostess cared more about being in the phone Vs caring for guests. Such a disappointment when there is so much potential."

                "description": "So this place always comes up on my searches so my husband and I decided to give it a try. When I go to a restaurant I like to evaluate it not only on a basis of food, but also the theme. The servers are in character - they are dressed as if they are mechanics with trucker hats. Nice touch to the restaurant given that it has an overall vintage gas station/industrial look.   Space/layout: Definitely a fun place to go to for brunch. They can accommodate large parties and have a bar. The decor around the restaurant are instgrammable, so if you are into that go ahead and cop yourself a pic.  Food: Not gonna lie, the food we order was a little bit more on the saltier side (Dirty Hash and the Shakshuka). Not sure if it was the cook that day or if the cook over shot the salt, but my husband and I had a difficult time finishing our food since it was a tad bit salty. Portion is great, presentation is amazing, but too salty. I am willing to give this place another try. Other than the saltiness, the food here is really good. But come thru and see how the food taste yourself!   P.S. Order a biscuit, it's really, really good here! Homemade and fresh."

                "description": "We went to the Downtowner (First Timers) on Saturday evening to have dinner before our show at the Brauntex ... 'Elvis' ... And he did deliver ... He paid a Tribute to the King!!  So, when we walked in, there were two hostesses at the front. They asked if we had reservations, which we did not. I told them it was fine, that we could walk next door to Krause's and next time I would make a reservation.  Well, all I can say is that those two hostesses moved heaven and earth to accommodate us! They perused the seating chart and came up with a 'plan' for us. As long as we could be done by 6:30p they had a table for two. We told them that we had to be at the Brauntex at 6:30p, so all was good.  At first, we thought they were just going to sit us in the back room.  LOL  We didn't realize that the restaurant went that far back.  And our waitress (Can't remember her name!) What a hoot. She was a pleasure to have. Answered all of our questions about the menu, etc. She brought water out in this cool bottle ... She told me I could have it ... And then wrestled it out of my arms when I tried to leave ... Just Kidding!! And then our food came. It was delicious!  And we were walking out of the restaurant at 6:30p.  KUDOS to everyone that took care of us!"

My big issues included that when I reached out for more information via email I got no response. Also, they offered a pizza meal and it turned out to be Dominos. No offense to them but I was expecting a sit down inside with something more local. Not even paper plates and napkins.   If you are expecting a tour of a winery,  this not that kind of trip. It is a tour of wine places."

                "description": "So the bus was clean, wifi equipped (though weak), and outlets on the back of each seat to stay charged. Weirdly had no music playing for the majority of the trip, guide blamed it as being unfamiliar with SA radio stations since she had just driven in from Houston.   The tours are supposed to consist of three brewery/winery/distillery visits, I'd assumed it would be all of the same category i.e. all brewery or all winery but we had a two for one perk visiting Ranger Creek Brewing and Distillery in that we were getting to try their beers and whiskeys. We'd anticipated a bit of a story and a tour of the facility but honestly this one went on waY too long. Still, this visit was the high point once we realized we weren't limited in our samples and they were pouring full pints.   Back on the bus to New Braunfels Brewing Co., a brewery known for its sour beers, many made with fruity elements and one spiced pickle beer. These were honestly a trip, we were presented two drink tickets and I sampled a pink beer, sour, and a splash of the pickle beer, spicy and sour. I didn't hate it but I didn't love it, one of the homies running the establishment sounded like Seth Rogen so that was a treat. The majority of the bus seemed to really dislike the visit though and I saw a few people tossing beers into sinks or nearby plants.   Our last stop was the Grapevine, something I was super looking forward to but wound up being the most disappointed.  I was anticipating a couple sweet glasses of wine to wind up the trip but after fighting downtown traffic down a narrow road, we were told we'd get 45 minutes to wander around since that's how long our host figured it'd take the bus to circle back. It was so disorganized, we literally just walked in to what felt like a super crowded gift shop where five or six people poured samples down a long bar. The wine samples offered, while delicious, were barely enough for a SIP. I asked our guide if we were supposed to tell them something to get actual glasses of wine and she told us we had to purchase the drinks, only the samples were free and only three samples at that. Okay, so what was all the money we spent on the tickets actually going towards? We got our tickets at a convention where they were offering a special price, 2 for $100 I think,  then the day of the tour we were told to bring $20 cash for a tasting fee. What the what?  Even after alllllll that, during the drive back to the drop-off point, our guide announces both she and the bus driver work for tips. $70+ at the end of the day and barely caught a buzz."

                "description": "I booked the San Antonio beer bus as a last-minute activity with my husband to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  The owner, Neil, took my reservation over the phone and was awesome about squeezing us in.    We had a blast! We went to three different places - Ranger Creek brewery/distillery, Weathered souls brewery, and Artisan on Alamo (vodka distillery).    Ranger Creek - hands down our favorite.  The guys working there were amazing, they really went above and beyond to make everyone feel welcome and made sure everyone had a good time.  We got three full pint pours plus multiple samples of bourbon.  Lots of variety in the beer options.  We opted to purchase a bottle of bourbon and some bourbon filled chocolates to take home with us.  The brewery seemed to only be open for tours at the time and were able to focus their entire attention on our tour group.  The next top, Weathered souls brewery was very busy.  They were hosting a party at the time, and about 3/4 of the seating area was reserved for the party, forcing our tour group to the patio.  At this brewery, we received two tokens good for a half-pour of 4 pre-selected beers they had on tap.  I chose the only one that wasn't an IPA (IPA isn't my thing), and it tasted like a very strong IPA.  My husband was sweet enough to purchase me one of the non-tour options that the staff insisted was not an IPA, but it tasted identical to what was already in my glass.  Not a lot of variety in the options here, and the options for purchase were very overpriced (growlers, etc).    Artisan on Alamo was our least favorite stop.  The owner came off as rude and bothered when asked questions.  Our guide boasted about mixed drinks, but we discovered when we got there that mixed drinks were only available to purchase, not as part of our samples included in the tour.  They did, however, have a big selection of cocktails available for a  reduced \"tour price\" of $5.  The vodka samples we received were small, and the whole place was a little underwhelming.    Overall, we loved the whole beer bus experience.  Our beer bus guide (who I cannot remember his name, oops) was also amazing.  Snacks and bottled water were offered between stops, and the bus played classic rock on the radio which produced many drunken sing-a-longs.  When we arrived back at our starting point at the Lion and Rose pub, we received a voucher for a free appetizer.  We decided to eat there after checking the Yelp reviews and we were not disappointed.  The food was amazing, the staff was excellent and had our appetizer in our hungry hands within minutes.    Tips:  -Get either an Uber or a Lyft to and from your meeting point. -Bring a bag for your swag! We got a pint glass from each of the places we visited, so we left with 6 total, plus items we purchased. -Eat something before you board the bus - our tour started at 11:30 and ended around 4:30.  Even with the snacks, we were starving by the time we got back to the pub -Wear sunscreen! Two of the three places we went had a patio with limited shade, I was very grateful that I lathered up in sunscreen before we left.    We definitely will be doing a beer bus again!  Would love to do an Austin tour or Dallas if ya'll come up north!"

                "description": "We got tickets to the Texas Beer Bus not knowing exactly what was involved. All we knew was that we got the tickets for $50, and we were promised a day of breweries. We showed up at the appointed spot, the parking lot of The Lion and the Rose. They didn't have any water waiting for us, and had us stand around in the heat of the parking lot while we waited for a MegaBus that was about 20 minutes late. While we stood around waiting for the late bus, we were told that if we actually wanted to drink beer on this Beer Bus tour, we'd have to chip in another $20. I felt ripped off. Why not include that in the fee? When we finally got going, there was no beer on the bus. They said that was illegal (it's not.)  We drove around in circles for about 20 minutes trying to find the first brewery. They didn't know where it was. Apparently, they hadn't been there before.  When we finally arrived, Ranger Creek did a great job of explaining the beer, the whiskey, and the brewing process.  Blue Star didn't seem to be expecting us. They hurriedly poured us a few ounces of beer while we stood around waiting for something. I don't know what. Nobody told us about the place, and we got rushed out of there almost as soon as we got there.  The third brewery cut my brother off for being loud and obnoxious. I don't blame them.  In all, we went to three breweries. Ranger Creek, Blue Star, and Freetail.  I felt ripped off that the beer tasting charge wasn't explained until we were already $50 into it. Plus, they made us fill out these liability waiver forms after they had our money. Don't like the terms of the form? No refunds. What a ripoff. Who's going to take a beer tour and not drink beer?  The tour was poorly planned, terribly executed, and felt like a rip off. Our guide didn't know the first thing about the breweries (didn't even know where they were).   I'm never taking this tour again, and I discourage you from doing it too. There's other brewery tours in town. Better yet, just go on your own."

(They helpfully suggested that we take a $25 Uber ride to get up to their bus. Yeah, thanks.)   Beer tasting is not included in this beer tour! (It's an extra $20 to actually drink beer, paid day of.)   The breweries on the itinerary were Oskar Blues and Austin Beerworks. Both are walking distance from the meeting point.   I am genuinely confused why anyone would pay $125+ pp for this."

                "description": "Don't do it!! Let me lay it out there for you.  I've been on other beer bus tours in other cities so was super excited when my sister in law bought us all tickets last christmas. I don't mean to sound rude but our host needs a new occupation, her monotone voice portrayed the excitement of a funeral or a 0-0 exhibition soccer game. The music on the bus didn't work for over half the ride and it reeked of exhaust the first half of the trip.  The stops were cool but they're independent of the tour co so that makes sense. For the last third of the trip,  we took a 45 min ride through traffic back into town for our host to notify us,  after multiple updates and delays that our third stop wasn't possible. During all this,  we pass a bad wreck which the hosts comments on the intercom and tells us how many people die in car accidents every year. Honestly I cannot convey the level of frustration or dissatisfaction I have with our purchase and this company. #fail"

We enjoy the atmosphere and the easy way we are able to tour the breweries, wineries and distilleries in Texas. We have been to North Houston, Dallas and Austin. Our fourth tour will hopefully be in south Houston. We are able to uber to our meeting site and they provide unlimited chips and water on the bus. We eat a good breakfast before we go and they provide pizza at the second or third stop.  There have been food trucks at each stop to purchase food to absorb the alcohol!

The original bus driver no-showed, when the bus finally showed it was almost two hours late. The first stop was 23 MILES away near Austin Bergstrom-Hi Sign Brewery-decent beer, but nothing special. The second stop was another 17 MILES east To Cedar Creek to a START-UP \"whiskey\" distillery-Armadillo Whiskey Distillery-the whiskey is only \"whiskey\" thanks to a loophole in Texas liquor laws, its moonshine and it's terrible. The owner Matthew Wells spent so much time on the tour that he delayed the bus getting to our third stop. At the third stop-Adelbert's Brewery-we had less than 40 minutes to consume four beers."

                "description": "I started the process of booking a private event through TBB 4 months before the date. We had a great experience with them on a public tour the prior year so figured it would be great for a birthday event. Unfortunately, this was not the case for the private tour. It was $99/person (which does not include tax OR a payment fee) which includes a bus that takes you to 3 different locations (these will not be confirmed until the week prior...) from 12-5, pizza lunch, and a voucher for every attendee to get a free visit at a later date. When making the payments- which can only be made by 1 person, they continued to keep forgetting to include my original deposit towards the payment.. and when I asked if I could pay in person (cash or check) to avoid the payment fee they simply said no. So all in all, I ended up paying close to $200 in JUST this fee alone.  The day of the event, we arrived at our first location and they had no idea that we were coming. So our group of 38 waited for near 10 minutes before knowing what we were doing. Not off to the best start. At our last event, the tour guide told me it was time to leave at 4 pm... which was 1 hour before the agreed end time. After convincing him to try and call his contact from TBB, he finally said we could stay until 4:40.  They never had any of the vouchers to give the guests. The following week I called to speak to someone about my experience. The woman basically said it was the brewery and the guide's fault and took absolutely no responsibility. She ended the conversation with \"we will try harder next time\". She agreed to send emails to each of my guests with the voucher by the end of the week. Well, that week came and when I contacted them they said it was too difficult and asked me do it instead which involved gathering 38 of my guest's emails and emailing each person an individual voucher (they emailed me the 38 different attachments......) In exchange for my trouble they sent me a few extra vouchers. I responded telling them how ridiculous this was for me to spend my time having to do all this. No response.  Long story short, for each person to pay $99 and all the different fees that I had to pay - they were incredibly unorganized, poor customer service, and just flat out not worth it. Definitely NOT recommending them to anyone. I felt like I had to spend WAY too much time trying to help organize and figure out the details of the event which in my opinion, is not my responsibility. There are plenty of other tours out there who will provide a smoother and more enjoyable time."

                "description": "I wish I didn't have to give one star but I do in order to leave a review. We saw a tent for this company at a festival so we purchased four tickets because we thought this would be a fun thing to do for a bachelor party. We were not told it was a public tour or that we had to register online so we thought we had seats on our private tour. We were told we could have the other groomsmen call and pay for a ticket at a later date once we got all the info for the tour which we were supposed to get the next day. After one week of no response to my email, I called two different numbers, both of which had a voicemail that said email, do not leave a voicemail. I've never heard of a company not having a phone you can call and talk to a human being. I sent an email and got no reply. So I tried again two days later, I sent two and after the second one, I got a phone call. I was told at that time, almost two weeks after I was supposed to get the details, that it was a public tour, now there are not enough seats for everyone who wants to go, we had to register online, the ticket is just a reminder you paid for a tour. I explained that we were not told any of that when we purchased the tickets, the woman told me it's all on the receipt, which, we also weren't told when we purchased the tickets on a Square card reader and the receipt gets sent to junk mail, we knew what the cost was so why read the receipt? The woman on the phone agreed to give me a refund for the trouble and not being clear about logistics and having such a hard time dealing with the company. I sent her the receipt, no response. I emailed two more times, I finally got \"it will be processed.\" Nearly two weeks and 7 emails later, still no refund. DO NOT SPEND ANY MONEY WITH THIS \"COMPANY\". You are made to feel like a nuisance once you've paid for the service they are supposed to provide. They have your money, why should they deal with you now?? I do hair and the biggest part of providing a great experience for my clients is customer service. If I ran my business the way these people do, I would have no business! WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED! DO NOT THROW AWAY YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY!!"

                "description": "Sat outside. Lots of fans, so it was pleasant to be out on the patio. There are lots of Servers, so there isn't an unreasonable wait to order.  Our waitress was good. She got to us as soon as we sat down and continued to check on us. The restaurant was busy, but it did not take too long to get our food.  The unsweet tea was good, garlic mashed potatoes were delicious, so were the fries and blueberry cobbler.  The kid cheese pizza was meh. I got the fettucine alfredo and did not like it. The sauce was thick, not creamy and did not have a good flavor. It came with three toasted breads which did not have butter or seasoning, so were flavorless and dry.  I personally did not like it, but my toddler ate some and seemed to like it.   The Big Rock Nachos were good. In the past, I have tried the \"Karat\" Cake, which is also good.  I would return to this location, but would get something else next time."

The atmosphere is great, the food is great and the service is amazing. We always sit in the bar area so we can have Anne wait on us. She's attentive and friendly and a great waitress/bartender.   Everything I've eaten there has been good. The Caesar salad with salmon, the grilled chicken and Poblano mushroom soup are our go to's most of the time. You have to get their Brussel sprouts as an appetizer, amazing!"

I ordered  shrimp tacos,  the shrimp was chopped into such small pieces, there probably wasn't e en 1 shrimp in the 3 tacos! Again , Huntington asked how it was, I told him not good! I asked him to tell the manager! He didn't offer me anything. Manager never came to talk to me. Stone Works should take a lesson from  Cover3! When there was a problem, our waiter immediately did something to make it right and the manager came over, comped our food and offered us dessert.  All restaurants have problems, it's how they  handle them that makes the difference! I won't be returning to Stone Works  anytime  soon!!!"

                "description": "Hadn't been to Stone Werks in over 10 years.  I had very faint memories of the food being average and overpriced - and with Covid-19 I was worried this place would have a limited menu.   I came here with my grandma and we were looking for some healthy options.  Let me tell you, the food was FANTASTIC.  I ordered the Pan-seared Salmon with a vegetable medley and mashed potatoes.   I am very picky about my salmon because it's very easy to overcook it dry.  The fish was light, moist, seasoned extremely well and it cut like butter!! The potatoes were fluffy and flavorful. The vegetables were crisp and fresh.  Our waiter Josh was very attentive and so polite, even when we asked for extra things.   And one unique thing I have to say is that  the booth seats are SO COMFORTABLE! If I'd brought a blanket and pillow I might never leave- Ha!  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the Blanco/Stone Oak area looking for a nice dinner.  This is the perfect spot for a date night or family outing.   Stone Werks has really stepped up their game as far as food and service. I will definitely be coming back."

I gravitate towards laid back, classy, chill vibes and this place has got it.  Every drink I have ordered here has been exceptional. This time I got the Skinny Mojito and it along with the sweet potato fries and turkey burger were fantastic.  The lady at the bar was very friendly and helpful. They have a fire place and heat lamps for chillier days. Today it was perfect weather so no need. I recommend trying this place on a nice day. The patio is so inviting, you will never wanna leave."

                "description": "On every trip we usually take a walking tour and Brent's tour was one of the more in-depth and informative tours we've ever taken. I was impressed with Brent's commitment to learning everyone's name, engaging everyone at an individual level, making sure everyone was comfortable and entertained. It was obvious Brent was passionate about the city, its history, culture and current standing in the world. Comparing the Riverboat tour to Amigo's Walking Tour, the Riverboat Tour felt rushed and kind of unnecessary after the walking tour. The Riverboat Tour had some architecture history that wasn't covered in the walking tour, but still felt very surface level when compared to the Amigo Walking Tour.  Our tour was on the last Saturday of February where the tour guide was forced to compete with a mardi gras boat parade on the river. He did a great job weaving mardi gras references into his stories and really showed what a great guide he is. We have family visiting San Antonio in soon and have insisted they take this walking tour."

Before I took this tour, I did the River Walk boat tour, I took a educators class at the Alamo and took my time after the tour to watch the video and read all the info, I went to Mission San Jose and took the tour there and I also took the Pearl Brewery tour. Then I came to this tour....I had my tour with Brent. Wow talk about having an intimate look at San Antonio. He was full of knowledge. He talked about some of San Antonio's not so well known heroes, but made a but impact in the city. Brent was a great tour guide. Be sure to reserve your spot for the tour and wear walking to running shoes.  On the day I went, it rained in the morning. The rain must of scared some people off.  By the time the tour started it was dry. For my group there was just a handful of us.  The weather in SA is weird. But don't let stop you. Just bring an umbrella and light jacket for the colder months."

He explained the entire history from the beginning of its foundation, and he answered our many questions along the way. The tour was about 2 hours long, and even after walking all day before that, it was definitely worth it for me. He told us the history of the Alamo even up to the present day about the conflict regarding tearing down buildings to rebuild the outer Alamo walls. I would definitely recommend taking this tour if you have the chance."

We did the tour this past Saturday from 6pm-8pm, and our tour guide was Brent. He was by far the best tour guide I've ever encountered. You could tell he was really passionate about San Antonio history, and his energy made the whole tour that much more enjoyable. Even my brother who is is Not a history buff, and was doubtful beforehand enjoyed it very much. Thanks for the amazing walking tour!"

Brent was so full of wonderful stories, recounting historical events...helping us to imagine life as he was describing it.  I loved his different accents he used to help bring the characters he was describing to life!   We took this tour at the beginning of our visit, which helped us get a broader view of the history of San Antonio as were exploring the city. A walking tour is not about the walking - there were plenty of places he offered to stop and rest if we needed it.  If you are headed to San Antonio - don't miss this tour and it's free!  You can tip if you want - no pressure."

Had he not mentioned that, no one would have known. Brent is  knowledgeable, conversational, and engaging. It was great having a San Antonio native as our guide, because he was able to add personal experiences and stories that added depth and even some humor. My friends and I were disappointed that we were leaving that day, because we would have loved to have taken the Downtown Tour as well. Of the several guided tours we took throughout the city, this was by far our favorite! Highly recommend!"

Our tour guide was Brent Salter, and his enthusiasm, humor, and knowledge of San Antonio and its history kept me entertained for the full tour! Today was one of the hottest days of the year, but most of the tour was in the shade, as the sun was setting, or down on the Riverwalk, where the pleasant breeze made it very easy. San Antonio has been my home for almost 30 years, but I learned a lot, and can hardly wait to come back for more!"

They carry all different kinds of alcohol, many you wouldn't expect to find it a small local shop. It's in this quaint little house one block off of St Mary's behind El Mirador Mexican restaurant. Besides just about any kind of alcohol you can imagine, they also sell cute little things. They've got jewelry and there are usually these cute cards that are handmade by local artists. AND they of course have an amazing fiesta medal this year (2018). They love pets and always have a little doggie biscuit for my puppy. And there's a water bowl outside.  So to sum it up, I love this store, support local and buy your booze here, that's what I'm saying!"

They might not have everything but it's a pretty well-balanced selection with both popular items and local stuff.  And because this is the nearest liquor store that doesn't seem shady, I always come here to pick up a bottle of TX whiskey to take home with me.  I will say that being in here 3 times already, the woman who owns the place has both been very friendly and also a little standoffish and borderline rude which I could see some of the negative reviews."

I'm always amazed that there aren't more places in the downtown area to grab a bottle to go. You gotta hike across Caesar Chavez to find this place. It has recently moved around the corner from the old location by the Filling Station to a small house on the other side of the La Villita Hotel.  They have a decent selection of spirits, wines and beers. They sell their stuff clearly marked as to the price, so there's no guessing. When I went, the clerk was on the ball, making recommendations, and was quite helpful. They also sell all kinds of other booze paraphernalia, like wine glasses and bottle openers.  The prices are a bit higher than you'd expect to pay at the big places, but the extra assistance and convenient location makes it absolutely worth it.  Parking can be a bit of a challenge, you gotta park on the street, and that can get busy. I'm as happy as a pig in slop in this place! Weee weee  weeeee!"

It seems to be run by some nice and well-meaning women, but the beer selection is not very different from a 7-eleven...Maybe 20-30 of the most common regional and macros, virtually no bombers, and when I asked if they carry Jester King the reply was 'I think we don't have that IPA'.   To the owners, double your cold beer storage capacity and find someone who can deliver a nicely curated beer list including Jester King and Adelbert's. Given your social media reputation and proximity to downtown, I bet you'd 2x-3x your annual revenue. You have a real opportunity."

                "description": "There is something about Southtown that seems to draw us in, more so the more you frequent it. Surprises and (seemingly) new spots are just around the corner. The trick is to have the patience and open- mindedness to seek them out. Pig Liquors is one of those stores that when you leave it will have made an impression on you.      It's right across the street from another great place, The Filling Station. There is a space or two to park in front of the store. The store itself is really small. Inside there are small displays where bottles of various liquors, wines and select craft brews are placed. The selection I might add is quite excellent and very specific.      In their icebox I saw bombers of La Bestia Aimable by Ranger Creek. A Honey Ale by The Guadalupe Brewing Co. snuggling tightly next to other fine beers. Anderson Valley. Even a six pack of Santa Fe's Java Stout, which was looking for a home and found one with me, are prominent. It's definitely a store that knows its intended market, people with a very specialized taste.  But certainly to not be outdone there are other items that make this store unique.        They sell jewelry such as Frida Kahlo earrings, small gift items and neat knick knacks. In addition a small shopping cart is cleverly placed by their entrance so you can buy cool t-shirts by San Antonio renowned artist, Robert Tatum. It is definitely quirky and charming, kinda like if Mork and Mindy decided to open up a business. It is like a smaller Spec's slash boutique slash Mexican curio shop slash CBGB's all with a style that is uniquely San Antonio. And in fact it's almost felt like Slash was there probably somewhere in the back drinking a cold one.       And not to be outdone by this, the owner is very friendly and personable. She is more like the host of the store than its proprietor. Its like her personality inhabits this space and it lends to the quirky and charming vibe here. The service is excellent and will be one of the reasons why you will come back. I must confess some of the items here are a little pricey but it is for quality items.      Pig Liquors fits perfectly in Southtown. It is small and intimate, but its specialized selection will mean you will leave the store having bought something. The service is excellent. It has a friendly, welcoming vibe. If you are in this location go check this place out.   ps. After seeing the picture of the luchador bottle opener I think I have found another reason to visit this store, maybe this weekend?"

This was the first time we had incorporated a photo tour of the host city in our packed schedule, but it turned out way better than expected!  Melvin was an amazing tour guide! He had all the right facts to share with our group of 20+ event organizers and event suppliers. We saw The Alamo, RIverwalk and so much more within an hour.   Thank you so much for an amazing photo tour. We've heard nothing but positive feedback from our attendees on the photo walk!"

Our tour guide was so friendly and knowledgeable about the Pearl Brewery area and all the places we stopped. We went to Local Coffee, Southerleigh Brewing, Nao, and Lick.   The tour included so much amazing food - you will not leave hungry. San Antonio Detours offers other public tours weekly and I will definitely be checking those out the next time I'm in town. If you want a way to try out some amazing food and get a taste (ha ha) of REAL San Antonio, definitely check them out!"

Michael did a great job, providing enough history of each mission without droning on to the point of boredom.  He kept our group of 10 on schedule which provided ample time at each stop.  See the Alamo first, then take this trip to see what the Alamo can strive to be after the current restoration project."

We hosted a surprise bachelor party and the tour guide played along by not revealing what the tour was until we were underway. The bachelor lives in San Antonio and the tour took us to spots he'd never even heard of before! (And he's a self-proclaimed foodie) The tour guide was extremely accommodating, fun, and knowledgeable. We had the best time. Thanks San Antonio Detours!"

Melvin did a fantastic job sharing information about both the history of the city as well as taking us to some interesting San Antonio locations that I hadn't seen before. I liked his conversational style, and he was able to answer everyone's questions. The tour bus was very well-kept and clean, and I was impressed that the tour started and ended exactly on time.   There was not quite as much walking as I expected, since it was billed as a \"walking tour.\" However, I'm not surprised because we did visit so many locations (a mission, the King William district, and drove through the Pearl) that we had to drive between. Melvin packed a lot of sightseeing and history into two hours! I learned a lot about the areas of San Antonio that I visit frequently, so I am very happy with the tour. I would love to try more San Antonio Detours in the future, especially with Melvin. Two big thumbs up!"

The motorcoach they provided was clean and comfortable, and our tour guide Melvin could not have been more enthusiastic, knowledgeable or sweet. The women were actually wondering if he had been a historian since he knew so much about the city!  I could not recommend this business more highly. A perfect introduction to the city, or a supplement to the trivia you already thought you knew!"

The q trio was good, salsa was better than expected. The brisket sandwich is large and was a little too saucy for my tastes but still good. The winter salad was a little too bitter, however.

                "description": "Oh Q Kitchen Bar thanks for simply being the best!   I stayed at the Hyatt for 19 days and frequently stopped by the Q Bar because the food was tasty, the drinks delicious, and the service fantastic. On Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays live music was played during the evenings which was very pleasant.   They had a menu change while I was there so I'm not sure if everything I ate is still available. I particularly loved the brisket flatbread but the shrimp avocado tacos was where it was at. They were large, flavorful, and quite filling! I found when I wanted a light meal they were absolutely perfect. The avocado caprese salad was good but would have liked more cheese and less avocado. Once the cheese was gone I didn't think the avocado could carry the tomato like the cheese could.   But with any restaurant it was the people working there that made me come back time and time again. Leeza and DJ were super pleasant to talk with - easy going, good listeners, and very responsive. There was another bartender whose name I didn't catch who was also very responsive and noticed when I needed something.   Then there was Ryan who became part of my vacation experience because his knowledge of cocktails and alcohol was astounding. When the evenings were slow he would experiment with ingredients and come up with an array of flavors that were just marvelous. I am quite astounded that a craft cocktail bar hasn't swooped in to steal Ryan away but I am sure the Hyatt realizes how amazing of a bartender there is.   But my shoutout has to go to Isaac. Isaac warmly greeted me when I first came and made me feel like a regular from day one. Not only that - one night when a particular man wouldn't leave me alone despite me telling him I had no interest in what he wanted Isaac stepped in and deftly helped out. I have been in this situation a few times in my life but this is the first that I had someone in the other side of the bar step in and intercede. I don't think if Isaac hadn't that the drunk guy would have left me alone. For that I am especially grateful."

They weren't sure if they should use fettuccini noodles or macaroni noodles so they just used both. Heck, why not. The taste was horribly bland. This tiny little box of pasta cost about 30 bucks after tax. It honestly looked and tasted like they went to random downtown restaurants and asked them to throw any leftover scraps from plates in this box and called it a meal. I don't honestly know how they could possibly serve this.  I wouldn't even serve this to my trash can."

                "description": "Really wish they didn't change the menu every few months! What lured us here isn't even served anymore! We saw the fried quail with waffles and the mudslide dessert and that's all it took for us to want to try them out. Too bad both items are no longer available. Not cool.   The food: the sausage is extremely good here. Ribs have lots of flavor. The brisket is kind of dry but really different and good. The sides were okay. Cole slaw and beans. The bbq sauce is really spicy.   Also the burbon pecan pie had too much burbon in it. Jesus Christ! Also don't be cheap! Use blue bell vanilla ice cream   Atmosphere: great place to have drinks and eat dinner. Also nice place to catch a game. They also validate your parking.   Management why do you all change the menu so much? I really want to try the fried quail and waffles. Can you all add that back to the menu? Thanks"

                "description": "This is definitely a solid lunch spot. It is a little on the pricey side for lunch but, it is within a hotel. That's is to be expected. I always get the Pasta Bar option. You can add your own pasta sauce or mix and match. (I mix the marinara and Alfredo) It's $15 and you get unlimited made to order pasta, salads, and a ton of dessert options. The $15 covers all soft drinks and tea as well. It's a nice spread for sure.  The pasta is pretty delicious but sometimes they can make it a little on the oily side. I recommend asking for light oil, with the pasta chef.  The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable about the offerings.   Overall, if you're willing to spend a few extra bucks it's a great option!"

Way over priced as usual but nice to be able to walk downstairs and get food away from the hustle of the river walk. Burgers and fries are great. Omelets in the morning are well stuffed. And a great bar to just chill in the ac."

                "description": "Q Kitchen did some things really well and others not so well, so the \"A-OK\" rating is appropriate.  We had dinner at Q on a Monday evening.  The dining room area was closed, so we had to sit in the bar.  We had my 7 year old son with us, but the server advised us that children were permitted in the bar area until 9 PM.  We were able to sit in a corner booth that was furthest away from the action, but be aware that this is a bar so depending on how crowded it is you may not want to eat here if you have young children with you.  To start, we had the queso and salsa trio.  These were largely misses.  I would say the verde was the best of the dips, but that is not saying much.  The guac was basically mashed up avocado with a hint of seasoning.  Non tomato, onion, cilantro, peppers, etc.  The queso was too thick and made with processed cheese.  I would not order the dips again.  To eat, I went with the salmon sandwich and housemade potato chips.  The potato chips lacked seasoning and in some spots were not very crunchy.  The sandwich, on the other hand, is the reason for the 3 star review instead of 2.  The salmon was cooked very well.  The BBQ glaze was flavorful and a bit sticky.  The veggies were fresh and the aioli was flavorful as well.  There was quite a bit of excess bread due to the size of the bun, but I just ripped that off.  Very good sandwich, I would order this again.  Service was good throughout, our server was quick with water refills and very friendly.  No issues here.  The beer list wasn't great, but it had some Texas favorites on it.  I was certainly not blown away by our meal at Q, but it definitely had its high points and is a decent enough hotel bar/restaurant."

                "description": "When you stay at the Hyatt, you have to catch drinks and appetizers here.  My last stay we had beers and Diamond Margaritas.  I find that the place goes through furniture identity crisis.  I have seen the place go from semi-comfy sectional furniture, to uncomfortable bar tables and chairs, to oversized chairs with dining tables, to the now deep-seated sofas and very low side chairs with high tables for eating.  I wish they could figure this furniture thing out.  For a bar too, there is harsh bright lighting from the elevator area."

Wine , Queso and Quail and Waffles OMGOOOD! sit back and relax in this nice spot and you will be glad to stopped by. So from the river  you would walk into the Hyatt Hotel and go to the 2nd floor up to the Q Bar Kitchen. Open air bar with large windows you can actually see out to the river. If you are staying at the hotel the lobby check in is on the same floor.   NICE!"

                "description": "This was our favorite place to just go and sit in San Antonio. We ended a few nights here to have a casual drink in their nice bar/lounge area. There's live music on the weekends too. The bar area overlooks a nice indoor river area and you can relax while listening to the water go down the indoor water fall. There's never a wait and it's way less crowded than most of the places on the river walk- although because the all glass facade you still feel like you're dining on the river. The escape from the humidity is an added plus as well.   For our last night in San Antonio, we decided to have dinner here. Great prices and good portion sizes as well. The service (we had Tina several times) was fantastic as well. Certainly recommend this not-your-average hotel bar/restaurant!"

Ryan displayed a deep knowledge of beers and was free in sharing his favorite dishes.   Steak sandwich is good but stick with the fries. Their potato chips were unfortunate.   Hamburger with fries was a good choice.   Nice setting on the Riverwalk and inside the Hyatt hotel."

A good selection local beers and samples were provided to make sure I did not venture down a path of disappointment.  The fries that came with he burger wee actually very good. A pretty chill place to hang out and now the Hyatt maybe my go to in San Antonio. I had two local beers and they were pretty good. See the photos for choices on tap. A good place to take a break on a hot afternoon or late dinner. @kodiak_kuisine"

                "description": "A Yelp event here introduced us to a barely hidden gem on the River Walk that I've overlooked for years. SO glad to have discovered this place. Will be back for dates on future S.A. visits for sure!  Most places along the RW are tourist traps, with food typically ranging from mediocre down to hog feed. It's typically not very good and often downright awful, and you always overpay. Q Kitchen Bar had STELLAR food with personable and cool employees, a good vibe, and primo location.  The honey ribs - YES! Like dessert. Sweet and savory with a little crunch. Fantastic. The quail ... wow, amazing. SO good. I think of quail as lacking enough meat to be worth the effort. This was fantastic and left me wanting more. (The problem with quail: not enough!) And the queso fundido... to even call it queso is a stretch. It was a magical dip, to die for - liquid brisket and cheese and other magical ingredients with the perfect mix of seasoning... I ate waaaay too much. Wifey had to roll me out of the place.  Excellent beer selection. Plenty of local and Texas offerings.  Meeting the chef and chatting with her was the icing on the cake. She was awesome and clearly skilled at her craft. Cool lady for sure.  This place was great. Great food, great staff, cool vibe. Highly recommended!"

The foods have some serious authentic flavors and are cooked in traditional ways.   The guac is made table side, right in front of you. And the chips are fried fresh. I tried the fajitas with a little of everything. The carnitas are fantastic! Huge chunks of pork with crispy edges. Tender and marinated very well...  The chicken and steak were tasty too. Possibly some of the best fajitas I've had. If you're ever in the area I highly recommend."

                "description": "We got a late start on dinner because my son graduated from the Air Force BMT. We were staying at a hotel near by the Riverwalk. This was literally the second place we came across.   We walked in off the Riverwalk it was about 9:15 pm. The hostess greeted us and sent us to dine at the bar level. She never said anything about hours of operation. We went upstairs and sat at a table across from the bar. We had been seated for about 10 minutes, no acknowledgement or greeting... nada.   I decided to go to the bar so the male bartender, with a beard would have to acknowledge me. He's making drinks; not acknowledging my presence.   I finally said \"excuse me sir, I was told we should dine here in the bar. Is that correct?\" The guy didn't even make eye contact with me. It was like I was an interruption.. bad attitude and customer service. He said yes we could eat there but we'd have to go up to the bar and order from him. The guy didn't even offer us menus.   My daughter was able to get some paper menus off the bar and we sat down to decide what to order. We decided to order the skirt steak for two with some guacamole.   The guacamole was great. The tortilla chips were warm. The skirt steak was some of the worst meat I've had in my life. It wasn't grilled it was more like steamed and gray in color. The meat didn't have much flavor to it. The only seasoning I could taste was pepper, it lacked salt. I was highly disappointed, especially for the price.  We would have to keep getting up and down to ask for drinks and every time it felt like a chore. This guy did not want to deal with us and it showed. He was very happy attending to his customers sitting at the bar. Once we got our bill, on the receipt it said Oba. If I was the business owner I would've fired this guy on the spot.   To make matters worse when we decide to leave we go downstairs to the Riverwalk entry. There are two gentlemen down there one of them an average to shorter height Hispanic man. He asked if we were visiting and if we were enjoying our visit. .. then he started asking where we came from and how long we were staying and it would be coming back to the restaurant or not. In the beginning it seemed hospitable. Then all of a sudden the tone changed... he started following us outside to the patio and chased us to the stairs. He kept saying he hope to see us again. As soon as we got down to the Riverwalk walkway he started making cat calls and telling us how beautiful we were very beautiful.  It was very unprofessional and creepy. The whole time I'm praying this guy would slither away. I have never felt so uncomfortable... He should be fired as well for being inappropriate and unprofessional.   Honestly the highlight of this restaurant was the homemade guacamole... Nothing else the service was awful. The food was over priced and poor quality. I would definitely recommend dining with a male friend or large group....If there was no other place to eat. I probably would've had a better experience at Taco Bell"

Acenar is right on the River Walk, so it is easy to take a stroll afterwards and see the lights (during holiday times) or just enjoy the area in general.  The appetizers are extremely good at Acenar and I highly recommend getting the guacamole which is freshly made, as it should be.   The menu is consistently very good, though there are some oddities like white rice instead of spanish, but in general this place is solid for dinner when down at the River Walk."

I ordered a glass of sangria, chips and salsa to start. The tower of chips was impressive and I barely made a dent in them before my three enchilada plate came to the table. The three enchiladas included: queso, mole and verde. The enchiladas were all very flavorful and delicious. The restaurant was quite crowded and service was a little bit slow, but understandably with the number of people. The mariachi band started up and entertained some of the larger parties. It's a beautiful setting on the Riverwalk and it was a nice evening for outdoor dining."

The description with pineapple sounded delicious but it wasn't flavored good and seemed old. My husband got a chicken quesadilla and it was just okay. The best thing about the whole meal was the hot chips. The Piña colada was good. The outdoor seating is facing vacant buildings with knocked out windows so not a great view at all on the riverwalk. I know that's not their fault but the food should make up for that and it just didn't."

The tables around us were served before us and we placed our order pretty soon after we were seated-appetizers and entrees. Waiter took a long time to get us drinks and refills, serve appetizers and bring our meals. I understand it was busy, but we just felt like we were forgotten. I would be willing to give this place another try because of the food and maybe it was an off day with the server..."

                "description": "Worst Mexican Restaurant in 35 years! 4 of us went, every dish was horrible, price was high, ambiance bad, floor felt damp and smelly, furniture somehow spread around, disorderly and pushed wherever. Who puts this restaurant among the best ones in SanAntonio? I have had much better! we went from Houston thinking more authentic restaurant....and to charge the prices they do? I was totally embarrassed as I invited a guest.  The cook should go to a few basic Mexican restaurants in Houston to get some ideas as to how Mexican dishes are made.  The owners must allow a budget to obtain quality ingredients so thMay tge cooks can deliver presentable dishes.  i honestly hope that the reviews are controlled and that society is not paying for false paid reviews like Amazon is fighting now.  BTW we restaurant goers wish then to survive, many of us have gone through mountains of challenges but please that does not mean we should co to use to pay and spend for worst quality but steeper price? it leaves a bad taste and I know that 4 customers, their connections and possibilities of repeat visits are now gone!   Business survival is becomes questionable."

They are delicious. Definitely has a Jalapeño kick. Wife loved the Cucumber in hers.  Next , We ordered Appetizers: Ceviche and Guacamole for 2  -- They make the Guacamole FRESH right before your very eyes !!!! Super Delicious! Then the Ceviche - wife says it's the best she's had in years.  Unfortunately...we were too full for Entree's.  Far and Away the BEST FOOD we've had in SA so far!! A side note, our Waiter was Gomez- Wow !! Ended up being a Great, light, lunch.  Satisfied, but still able to walk the River Walk afterwards.  BTW, there are many delicious sounding Entree's. :-)"

I ordered the 16oz Coconut Margarita which was excellent but not sure it had much Tequila???  I ordered the Seafood Enchiladas for dinner which were great. Little strange to have white rice instead of Spanish Rice but it was good with the sauce on the Enchiladas.    Would love to go back and try some of their other items!"

                "description": "For me, this restaurant put an upscale twist on Mexican food. The salsa was a smoky flavored brownish flavor and look. Like a chipotle flavor type of salsa. They screwed up on our order by putting the sauce on my wife's shrimp tacos and I got cheese enchiladas instead of ground beef. Everything could have been better in my opinion. However, our services was good and server was polite and took food care of us."

Their hot sauce has a smoky flavor. They use for roasted tomatillos.  Their Chalupa's Compuestas are fantastic. I prefer the chicken.  Everything on the menu is great. There's a La Pina your margarita that is also top notch! And you're sitting right on the river. Same owners as Rosario's in San Antonio. Our favorite place in town."

                "description": "I really have to say this restaurant is exceptional. My family knows Mexican food and are pretty tough critics, and all eight of us were very satisfied. They have some traditional dishes done very well, and some new twists that are perfectly executed. The tower of fresh red and yellow corn chips and the tomatillo salsa they come with are great as is, the fresh table side guacamole makes it a perfect start. I had the chicken in chipotle sauce which was excellent, my wife's enchilada verde were just as good. The place was super busy,and we had a big party, but the service was good (everyone is shorthanded these day so we weren't expecting miracles.)  Also: try the Indio beer, it's a dark beer but really refreshing and tasty!"

                "description": "You'd think for the price that you're paying that they would be better able to accommodate modifications. I asked for something with no onions (I'm sensitive to fodmaps), and the server told me that basically every dish had it and everything is premade or premixed by the hour. The server was at least very friendly and attentive.  The food was actually good. The Alambres appetizers are on the chewy, tough side, but they remind me a lot of fajitas. I really liked my molé enchiladas, and I feel like this menu is very faithful to Tex Mex dishes while still being elevated. A lot of upscale Mexican restaurants are more geared towards authentic Mexican food. If you are a tourist wanting to eat something representative of San Antonio cuisine, this is a good spot!"

We had a really large group and they were so accommodating and professional.   The food was also absolutely DELICIOUS. I had to get the enchiladas with mole, and it did NOT disappoint. It was everything you'd hope for--nice flavors with the filling, the rice and beans incredible, and the mole a nice, dark, spicy yet sweet sauce that drove the whole dish home. I wished I could've eaten three or four more but I was pretty full after just one, which was nice on my wallet.   I'll definitely be back whenever I'm in the area, even if only for that mole sauce!"

If you are going to try it for lunch during the week, get there around 11:30 or you will be waiting.  The food was definitely worth the wait and the service was good.    It seemed the at there was a little confusion with the staff and assigned tables at first but it actually made for a better situation as they worked in tandem.  The food was delicious and the outside patio was wonderful.  All sandwiches are served with their homemade chips and a small portion of mango avocado salsa that is the perfect blend."

                "description": "Well spaced, outdoor seating is a must during COVID-19. Reservations are also a good idea...  I showed up at 5 to get a table for 4 adults and 1 kid. I was originally told they were fully booked but then the guy came back and said we could have a table that didn't have a reservation until 7... I was confused as to why it was an issue but not worried about it enough to change places since the rest of our group was driving to meet me.   Like many places, they have replaced menus with small pieces of paper with QR codes on them. It is an easy modification since almost everyone has a smart phone with a camera that can use this kind of technology. There was one for drinks and one for food.   Bread was brought out in a paper bag so it was covered and had minimal hands on it that we could see.   Staff was masked the whole time. And wore the masks correctly (it goes over your nose too).  One waitresses was busy spraying and wiping down surfaces throughout out time there.  There was hand sanitizer by the door inside since you had to go inside for the restroom. Staff were wearing masks inside too.  The food was fantastic and the service was good. Our poor waitresses, we got so caught up in catching up that it took a while to even look at the menus.   Everything was full of flavor and extremely filling. The salsa for the tacos is not for those with faint taste buds.... The Pad Thi looked and smelled amazing. If we get to go back soon, that is what I'm getting...   Tip: want to share a dish? Just ask for an extra plate and divide the food yourself, otherwise there is an up-charge. The transparency from the waitress in regards to this policy was greatly appreciated. The Pad Thi serving is large enough to split this way."

The owner, son-in-law and wait staff are amazingly friendly and make you feel like you're part of the family. They have a large outdoor patio. If it's Friday night or Saturday night you'll need to make a reservation. You won't find a seat in the house. I love that they sell local art. Supporting local artists. Let's get to the food. There are 2 menus Lunch and dinner. Lunch has some out of the box dishes. First off, when you sit down, you're delivered warm focaccia. Baked at the restaurant .. OMG!! Soooo good!! For lunch The sandwiches are so incredibly delicious and most are served up on that bread. Salads are creative and delicious too. The mango pico de gallo is so different and delicious. Dinners menu is also just as creative. The salmon.. on point. The lemon salad dressing that goes on the kale salad. I'm currently salivating. You NEED to try their Enchiladas with an egg on top. Goodness.... My mouth is watering. Lastly... their craft beer and wine selection is totally key to Finishing off the meal. Oh wait, and their made from scratch desserts... goodness gracious... I just can't stop. You've got to make it a point to head on over. Don't expect traditional. Expect creative flare and savory dishes. An atmosphere so inviting.. it'll be your next favorite hang out."

But Pam's handled my crummy attitude with patience and grace and I've gotta say, that made a difference and snapped me back into the reality that everyone is short staffed these days, and while there are some places that are blaming other, Pam's is just rolling up their sleeves and getting it done!  As for the food, this is hands down our favorite restaurant in San Antonio. The takeout is always amazing and filling and the variety leaves no one unfed (three picky kids), but even with this variety, every menu item is spectacular. When we do dine in, this place is so versatile - it can be a fancy date night, a casual lunch, or an evening out with three loud kids. The food is always fresh, creative, and delicious, the service is always on point, and the beer and wine selection has something for everyone.  Thanks for staying open throughout the pandemic, glad we can be customers!"

The ambiance was so delightful, it was a very pleasant singer. Linda, our waitress was so nice and helpful.  Let me tell you, the food was absolutely to die for.   Ordered the shrimp cocktail as an appetizer and it was very fresh and tasty. We also ordered the chicken Tinga nachos...wow! Very very tasty. We shared the chicken saltinbocca, and if I would've been so full I would've eaten it all myself. I thought it was going to be heavy and too much, surprisingly it is not.

                "description": "That Vietnamese sandwich...omg! I've been here a handful of times and this is all I order. It's so good that I honestly can't try anything else. It comes with the most amazing chips and salsa as well.   The sandwich is super packed with flavor and it's messy! I mean, really messy! Don't order this on a first date unless you're cool with it being the last date.   The desserts are also amazing, you really can't go wrong with any of them.   This month is restaurant month so I might just try what they have on that menu. Right now, it's take out and curbside only. Give it a try! The lunch is only $15 for three courses and I believe the dinner is $45?"

I ordered the spinach and tomato on focaccia and it was good-might have been better with a little seasoning, but so glad they were willing to accommodate a vegan diet. The chips and mango/avocado salsa is so amazing! I hear they have a vegan taco option for dinner and looking forward to coming back to try!!"

The food was really good with a variety of interesting menu items. I had the chicken focaccia sandwich which was excellent. Around the table everyone was really happy with their choices. The service was pretty good, but a little slow on the drinks/refills. Otherwise, server was very pleasant."

                "description": "​After a two-year hiatus forced by COVID, we made it back to Dough​.  It was definitely worth the wait!  We went to the downtown SATX location, which is a beautiful space in an historic building, which the Dough crew has transformed into a warm, inviting restaurant.  Try that location, it's an experience in and of itself.  I would be remiss if I did not start off this review by acknowledging our waiter, Christian, who was awesome!  Attentive but not intrusive, just how we like it!  Thank you Christian!  We started with an appetizer of Burrata al Tartufo, which is perhaps the quintessential burrata dish.  Handmade burrata (we watched it being made), mascarpone, ricotta, etc. served with crostini... Heaven on a plate! The Miata salad was equally good, a wonderful blend of mixed greens, olives, wonderful cheese, roasted garlic, toasted croutons, etc.  The perfect segue into the pizza course.  We ordered the Amore di Maiale (\"pork love\") pizza, and it was amazing, as always, including the awesome crust!  The Sugo pizza was available, so we ordered that as our second \"we haven't tried it before\" pizza.  Sausage, roasted mushrooms and red bell peppers, braised prosciutto... oh my!   It was deelish!  The Sugo did not overtake \"pork love\" as our favorite pizza at Dough, but it is definitely a close second.  The wine list at Dough is not extensive, but what it lacks in sheer number of selections, it more than compensates with quality, reasonably priced wines:  all Italian, most Italian varietals are represented.  We ordered the Il Monticello Colli di Lune, a 2020 Vermentino.  It was outstanding!  The perfect compliment to our meal.  Our general observation regarding the entire Dough menu is that it is, by far, superior to any competitor in Central Texas, likely the entire state.  If you haven't been to Dough, put it on your \"pizza bucket list\" and stop by soon.  One last thing... a special shout out to Doug Horn, the owner, who visited with us for quite some time, despite the busy crowd.  He recounted his journey from the CIA New York to \"Texas Pizza Guy.\"  It was a delightful chat.  Doug obviously loves what he's doing, and that's reflected in all of his employees, who are always smiling and laughing, including the folks working the 900 degree oven in the kitchen!  Doug, thank you for a thoroughly enjoyable evening.  We'll be back!!!"

                "description": "I've never had burrata before, but as an absolute sucker for anything with cheese I couldn't resist ordering an entire football's worth. I got the Signature Burrata Al Tartufo, which blew me away with the flavor combination of mascarpone + truffle essence. The burrata comes with a super-generous portion of crostini and flatbread so you can cut and spread your burrata whichever way you like (the flatbread especially has that nice fired oven finish that brings in even more flavor), and the balsamic and tomatoes add the perfect touch of freshness. It's huge and definitely meant to be shared, but the leftovers kept just fine in the fridge so I could finish it the next day.  The coffee is high quality as well; my iced vanilla latte had just the right balance of coffee + sweetness. And the tiramisu we split for dessert can only be described as eating a cloud: light, fluffy, delicious.  I sampled both of the 12\" pizzas at my table - seems impossible to go wrong at this place! Visit at night for relaxing, dim lighting that creates an intimate setting indoors or outdoors. This place is a gem."

Pizzas were really delicious and tasty! I love their crust and how thin they make it, I love when I can eat more slices without it being a ton of bread.  The middle was a bit soggy with the meat pizza so maybe getting it extra crispy is the trick.  Service was good and food was quick to come out. I'll be back!"

                "description": "OK after doing a recent comparison I have to say that Florios in Alamo Heights a little hole in the wall Pizza joint blows Dough away. At Dough you get a 12 inch pie specialty of course for $23 at Florios you get an 18 inch pie for about five bucks less and the flavor is far beyond that of Dough. And as mentioned in my recent review you will see in the photos the look of the pizza it's not as pretty but the flavors are popping the sauce the cheese and the sausage."

I didn't go check their shipping receipts to make sure they were from Italy but they tasted very fresh and I honestly believe them. We had the ricotta al forna and the margarita pizza and both were exceptional. Great cheese and hand pressed dough. Highly recommend checking this place out. Prices were also reasonable considering the quality of the food.   Overall: 4.75 stars   Pro tip: ask for the gargonzola dip, it was very solid"

The wait was 2 hours (!!!!) but they were doing a good job of pivoting to takeout for people who couldn't wait. We had our pizzas in 20 minutes (they're on the small side - grab an extra if you're unsure). They were absolutely delicious, the crust was amazing, the sausage on the pig love pie was really tasty. We got drinks to go and the sweet girl behind the counter had a great attitude, especially for someone who was absolutely slammed with orders. They did seem to have limited seating, but the park nearby had plenty of tables for our to-go order, and kept the kids occupied while we waited."

Like other bread, when it is served hot out of the oven, it is hard to beat. But eat fast, because the enjoyment deteriorates once the pies cool off.

                "description": "I'm a big fan of Dough. I've eaten at the Blanco and downtown locations.  I've never been disappointed by the food or service.  Tonight's experience was different at the downtown location.  After being cheerfully greeted by the hostess and every employee as we were seated at our table the experience changed after being seated. Our server was not cheerful.  It seemed waiting on my sister and I was an imposition.  I am in the service industry.  Had this been my first experience at Dough, I would not have returned.  I'm confused why she checked on the four top with two couples and the table next to us with a couple next to ours numerous times while not giving us the same service.  The burrata sampler was fabulous!  The salad remarkable.  The service a big, fat zero.  On top of that, I ordered the house Pinot noir and my sister, the Pinot Grigio and they were $19 and $17 respectively.  This seems an exorbitant amount for a glass of wine.  Perhaps it was because of the larger glass ordered.  The staff on the way out (three of them) were twice as friendly as our server.  With the state of the economy, I typically tip 30%.  That is what my server would've gotten had she been a better server."

We got the Ricotta al Forno to start and it was so light and creamy on the perfect toasted bread. Then my husband and I shared a large Margherita pizza with half house made sausage. The crust was just how they do it in Italy--so light and perfectly crusted. 5/5 for sure!!  PRO TIP: dip the crust in the ricotta if you have leftover, and ask for a side of the Gorgonzola blue cheese dip (if you're a Ranch dipper!) to dip pizza in but it definitely doesn't need it!!!"

Most of the time we have to get a carry out as it covers the plate.   Lots of covered seating as well. Their open hours can be a small challenge, but no more than other places.  They have a small band play on Thursday nights I think."

The Alamo Burger has the nacho fixins infused into the patty, bacon and spicy ranch dressing all served on homemade sourdough bun. So good! Cora's is a great places, with awesome service and a down home atmosphere.  On Thursdays you can sit outside and listen to live music."

                "description": "Late post... but after living in the area for over 2 years passing by all the time we finally decided to try this place out! Its nestled on a small farm road out by all the fields, it has a play area for kids outside.   Walk in and greeted right away by the sweet ladies that stand at the desk. We always choose to eat in the dining room since there's AC in there!    Service has been great both times we have been, they have a young lady make you a salad of your choice and they nice about piling toppings on if you want them!  The nachos here are just ridiculous!! So good so tasty with all the toppings, I could go back just for those! But we've have fried fish, burgers, CFS, and steak here! All which were great!  We'll definitely become regulars here at Cora's!"

We had the nachos.  They were really good.  Chips were crunch and jalapeños were great.  Cold beers were good.  But that peach cobbler - wow!  It was amazing.  Super sweet but delicious with the ice cream on the side."

                "description": "8/29/2021 the beer battered mushrooms are top notch! I would definitely return for the mushrooms. I also ordered the homemade chicken tenders..sadly the batter did not have any seasoning whatsoever. I went ahead and let the manager know about the lack of seasoning ...the tenders cooked to perfection and very tender..a good thing. i told her...she seemed very offended by me letting her know about the unseasoned chicken tenders i went ahead and added salt and pepper to them...instead of appreciating me letting her know she said \"we haven't had a complaints\"..i told her\" some people don't like to speak up but I'm doing it because that's what I would want for someone to tell if our food wasent seasoned..she rolled her eyes and continue to deny my issue on the matter. She said \"oh our customers let us know\" i told her \"well not today they didn't\"..to top it off she threatened my 75 year old dad and my self that she might have to move us to a smaller table if she had a large group come in which i agreed my did doesn't like boths and all the tables were being used. So we choose to sit in one of the large tables towards the back.... Management was very rude and unprofessional. wasent even asking for them to be remake or a refund the chicken tenders just letting her know..she could have taken the constructive criticism and fixed the issue with there tenders ..simple mistake but she could have handled that a lot better."

I really wanted some tasty Mexican food, I ordered cheese enchiladas. Disappointed when I realized they used American cheese instead of Cheddar and chili sauce instead of red. I will try again and order something more \"diner traditional\". Their posted hours were 5pm-10pm but they actually closed at 9pm. We were surprised when the lights were off and we were still sitting there!"

Nachos came out on an old cafeteria platter (I'm ok w that- kind of goes w the small town vibe) but honestly this was supposed to serve a bunch of people. I'm not even sure there was a full bag of chips thinly spread across the platter. It was meh at best. Service was not good- unless you know the waitstaff- which we did not. We live trying new local places but won't be back. Another one and done for us."

My group ordered the nachos and they were quite tasty.   I had the crispy beef tacos and they were well seasoned and the taco shell was nice and crunchy. My friends had the burgers, fries and onion rings. The burgers were a good size and my friends liked them both. The fries were a miss as they were very greasy but the onion rings were the bomb. Not greasy and very crunchy.  Overall the staff was friendly and the food was good.  I would recommend stopping in if you're on your way into/out of Castroville."

We had cheese nachos(excellent; just American cheese and jalapeños, broiled to perfection), pepper steak was the best out of the group. Also had chicken fried steak (good, but I wish one of the side options was mashed potatoes; instead I opted for baked potato over fries). Salad bar was crisp and cold. Chili taco was meh, a bit of a mess  because it looked like a casserole instead of a taco.  Peach cobbler was a little doughy and wish we had not gotten ice cream smothering it.  All in all I look forward to going back."

Chicken fried steak, great burgers and the nachos are so good too! Some of the dishes come with a salad too. The salad bar is has a pretty good variety. They also have an outdoor play area for the kiddos which makes this place very family friendly. They also have a calendar of events. We have seen a few live performances here and have had a great time. This place really transports you to another time. We really enjoy coming here."

                "description": "I was invited to my girlfriends 35th birthday dinner at Scuzzis. I had been on a egg diet the entire week before her dinner so I was more than ready to go when the time came. I said it once, I'll say it again I absolutely love getting dressed and going out for dinner and drinks it's one of my favorite things to do! Anywho, I arrived and was greeted and I was immediately taken to my gfs dinner party area. Sweet and prompt service I could appreciate. The place had a very intimate setting, dim lighting, a very romantic ambience. My first thoughts were this place is nice for a date night.   My gfs birthday dinner fell on a Sunday. The place was semi packed in the parking lot but once I walked in there was tons of space between patrons and social distancing taking place. My girlfriend had a pretty large party it was about twenty of us, it was 5 tables put together to accommodate her large party. The setting was nice, the tables were adorned with white tablecloths and the waitstaff was impressive. I got there a tab bit late but I didn't notice because my waiter was so attentive to getting my order in, I didn't feel so late like I wasn't eating with the group.   I ordered the Chicken Saltimbocca Dinner and the Lemondrop Martini both in which were exceptional! It was my first time having that dish and it was so good. The wine sauce complimented the chicken and the pasta was soft but still had girth which I liked. It wasn't a flimsy noodle ha! Lol The LemonDrop was perfecto not too sweet or tart, was pretty strong and refreshing. I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner and overall experience. It was so nice catching with all my high school girlfriends with everything going on in the world, I'm so glad we make that time.   I rate my visit 5 stars because of my delicious meal and the fast, attentive service I received. My entire experience was pleasant and I would definitely recommend if your looking for a romantic Italian date night or a sexy girls night or birthday dinner. I would absolutely go back to try another yummy dish. Italian is one of my favorite foods. Hmmm pasta I never can so no to carbs lol  I was tell myself get the pasta girl YOLO lol   Scuzzi's was an awesome dining experience, definitely would go back. Get dressed up and go next time your in the mood for Italian. Thank me Later :)"

                "description": "Good enough food, as good as any good Italian restaurant. But this restaurant proves that there is more to enjoyable dining then good food.  We just had the most boring dining experience in our lives.   The place is dull and lifeless, yes, meaning an almost empty restaurant.. A dimly lit dining room with the lower half being dark brown and the upper half being a medium shade of brown, A really lifeless atmosphere. Setting up a card table in the Sistine chapel would have been more lively.  And on top of this, their menu prices are way too expensive.  I am not sure how much longer this place can drag on like this if something is not changed, but I know that we will never go back there again.  However, I wish all of you would go there at least once to perhaps show me that I am wrong. Although, I have to admit, it would be kind of a waste of your money.

As the server was clearing our plates my 5 year old told the waiter I was 44 and the waiter said with a laugh, \"I don't care.\" I looked at him and said are, \"Are you kidding me?\" He immediately said he was sorry and tried to say he was joking, which he clearly wasn't. I told the manager on the way out what happened and was told he was very sorry about the experience. Never offered to take care of anything. After reading reviews, it is very clear their customer service is lacking and needs to be addressed. Just a suggestion for your first lesson on customer service, How to address kids at the restaurant."

For example when our food came out they offered Parmesan cheese, but it was pre shredded and they just spooned it over the meal. We also ordered 9oz of wine which comes in the little decanter and the waiter immediately poured all of it into the glass. The food was good just not $30 for a plate without any sides. I ordered the Gorgonzola chicken which had Gorgonzola cheese, spinach, olives, and red bell peppers and was served on a bed of spaghetti. My husband ordered the chicken fettuccini and it was pretty standard/nothing special. The restaurant was really beautiful/nice ambiance but just overall our experience fell flat."

                "description": "I like good food and service.  This is the second time we've come here for dinner and both times I have been very happy with everything.  Granted we had reservations on Valentine's Day, which means that they were very busy.  But I didn't mind the time between getting my salad, entrée and dessert.  It gave me extra time to enjoy the food and make room for the next dish.  I left satisfied, not stuffed.  On Valentine's Day they did have a special menu, so from the special menu I chose a Garden Salad, Shrimp Scuzzi and their Italian Cream Cake.  Again everything was delicious and we will be back (I forgot the gift card we had, so it's a good excuse to return for more delicious food )"

                "description": "Met here with girlfriends for a Saturday lunch. The place looks old and tired, and smells funny. Everyone ordered a few appetizers to share...they were your typical Italian fair like bruschetta, spinach dip, and fried calamari. Everything was pretty average and underwhelming. For my main meal I opted for Scuzzi's California salad with pan seared tuna add-on. The salad was just ok...I did the enjoy the pine nuts on it though. The tuna was a little fishy, but thankfully seared properly, although lacking much flavor. The best part of my meal were the 2 glasses of crisp house white, which made me temporarily forget how much I was spending on this super mediocre meal.  With so many other delicious Italian places in the city, I will not be back here."

                "description": "Came here to celebrate the boyfriends birthday as we wanted nice food / ambiance but nothing  too fancy or overpriced. Food was good but nothing wowing us enough to come back. Our server Manny was amazing and took great care of us during our visit and is a big reason for the 3 stars.  Drinks: Had a subpar dirty martini and Moscow mules during our visit. Moscow mules won over the martini as it just wasn't tasty or as clean prepped as I've had at other locations. Moscow mules were on the sweet side and could have used more alcohol but it was nice to sip on.  Food: Started with the fried asparagus and while they were good, we have just had better. If you've never had them before, highly recommend but if you're trying to fill a craving, I don't think these are the ones. Birthday boy had veal Parmesan and loved it. Said it was some of the better veal he had had since living in Texas the past 8 years. I had the Scuzzi shrimp dinner. Thought it was good but it needed more salt and sauce. I would have preferred the coating on the shrimp to be a bit crispier but that's just me. While we didn't order or request a dessert on our own, they provided the birthday boy a mini cannoli with a candle. Loved the thought and appreciation but I later found out they charged me for it. I didn't bring it up bc I understand businesses are trying to recover but I would have preferred the option to decline if I had to pay for it. It definitely put a damper on the experience so we probably won't return anytime soon."

                "description": "Let me start by saying the reason my wife chose this place is because the reviews. Last night, 26 Mar 2022, we had dinner reservations for 700pm to celebrate my 49th birthday, the reason it was a such a big deal other than another celebrated is because I have cancer and lived past my expected lifespan, so every birthday is a big deal. We had our close family, my wife ,our 14 yr old son and my sister-in law. We arrived about 15 mins before 700pm. The place was packed, and smelled just like you'd expect, like a small slice of Italy. After checking in the young lady said they had to get a table ready, she was clearly hustling and very busy, No worries I thought, my wife and her sister can get a drink (I can't drink). After waiting 20 minutes and even more people arriving I got nervous, asked about the table. She said they were very busy and it would be soon, I understood having been a busboy many years ago, and said no worries. We ended up waiting 40 minutes in total to be seated, after one more question to the over tasked young lady at the front desk. Once at our table we settled in talking and looking at the menu, so many delicious choices. Our waiter approached very rushed and was clearly in a hurry. We told him we can order appetizers, dinner, and drinks now to make it easier for him. He expressed how busy they were, then before we could order he said \"I'll bring some water and bread\" and promptly departed. I thought \"did I miss something\" we were trying to be helpful and I didn't think he understood or maybe we had some odd miscommunication, but again I was nervous. 10 mins later waters and two little hot breads came. Our waiter said would you like to order? We replied yes we can give our whole order appetizers, soup, salads, and, dinner and drinks again. This time he scrambled for scrap of paper in his apron, which was odd. We ordered 2x oysters, cup of soup, two salads, our main courses, and then drinks (2 refills of drinks from the bar) and a iced tea. He had a hard time taking our order having to look at the menu himself. I though maybe he's new, then he parted as quickly as he came after collecting the order. In the mean time we talked and laughed about events and family situations until we ran out of water and bread, we still hadn't gotten drinks or the appetizers yet, it had been 20 minutes, however we were talking and laughing so time had moved quickly. We started looking around and hadn't seen our waiter again. Other staff members were rushing around in and out of the back past us. Finally, another waiter (not ours) brought us the salads, we asked about the appetizers and drinks, he said \"oh I'll ask for you\" I was a little put off but ok they are clearly busy. Well the rest of the night was the same, our waiter was hardly present, our food came 30 more minutes later in a confusing way, of main courses first, then oysters which were appitizers and then I had to ask about my soup... and only my tea arrived, no on else got their drinks at dinner. The waiter was clearly overtasked and panicked looking mostly when we saw him. We asked about the drinks he said \"oh they come from the bar', looking to the front, \"they are so busy\". We were all a little put off in the way this evening was unfolding.  Meanwhile, a nice lady refilled our waters, we ate our food it was very delicious. We got our waiter's attention after a couple minutes and ordered some deserts and coffees as another waiter helped box our dinners. Our waiter was frantic looking for some paper in his apron, to write the order down but ours just had repeated it back a couple times and rushed off. Deserts and coffees came a while later, we enjoyed them... my wife was upset saying she had even gotten a call from the restaurant confirming the reservation and that it was my birthday. The person on the phone said they would sing the birthday song, and a little calibration. She said she was sorry the night had went so wrong. I said it's not your fault love, you dont run the restaurant. We got the check and just then happy birthday signing erupted at another table very loudly, first in english, then in what might have been Italian, it was the cherry on top to our evening. I was happy to be leaving after paying the bill, disapointed and very put off. It was the single worst experience I have had at a restaurant of this quality with these reviews. They were terribly disorganized and overwhelmed, our food was great, however we couldn't get it in order or communicate well with our rushed waiter who was seldom there. My birthday celebration ended up being an extremely slowly and out of order delivered meal with drinks on the side and disappointment delivered completely. I gave them two stars because the food was delicious, even as slowly and backwards as it came, however,  birthday dinner was never held really, it was ruined."

                "description": "This is our favorite Italian restaurant in San Antonio.  The food is delicious with large portions.  Enough to share.  And they will split and give extra sides for only $3.   My favorite is the Gorgonzola chicken.  Then today I ordered a different chicken dish with squash and lemon butter sauce and now I can't decide which was better.  Such a hard decision for next time.   Their patio is beautiful and has a wonderful view of the city.  Also a nice breeze.  Try it out."

                "description": "Went to a large Christmas gathering and unfortunately the place was not equipped for a big group even they were aware of the reservation. Chairs were touching one another cause the restaurant crammed everyone together like sardines in a can...no elbow room. Food was lack-luster, bland, frozen Italian food. One waiter working hard, one with an attitude and a brand new bartender that didn't seem to get help from manager or coworkers. He did his best.  And the worse part of the whole Christmas dinner was eating off of paper plates. Sad. Won't be back again."

My food was burnt, we were left out on the cold patio where they only turned on one of the 5 patio heaters available. Employees never so much as refilled our water glasses, and I had to ask for a clean set of silverware multiple times before they decided to give a damn. Some guy claiming to be the owner was so rude and confrontational, I felt physically uncomfortable just being near that place. Never again will I return to this god awful place."

                "description": "Stopped into Scuzzi's today for lunch with a guest.  My guest had the Stracciatella soup and sucked it down.  I had alfredo pasta with grilled scallops and my guest the Rainbow Trout.  We both loved the flavors and the attentive service.  I would have preferred to have the scallops be fresh, but we are land locked in the heart of Texas.  My guest took advantage of the $5 martinis on Thursdays and I had a most excellent old fashion.    I rarely have a bad meal here and I caught myself asking why don't I come here more often?"

Me and my wife actually tried to meet some friends across 1604 at Paesanos  but the wait time was an hour-long and parking was a nightmare so we decided to check out Scuzzi's across the street.   We were definitely satisfied and somewhat impressed. The wine list is good enough for our tastes and everything else was perfect!  Great spot for a busy Saturday"

The service was exceptional, waiter was very attentive and courteous which is why I rate this place at a four star for the most part. The food was moderate, my wife ordered the chicken Parmesan and I order the beef lasagna. The lasagna was soft, cheesy and tomato was ok no too impressed and my wife chicken crusted Parmesan tasted great the noodles and tomato sauce was ok. Overall not too impressed with the food however they do excel at service!"

                "description": "My wife and I just had the WORST experience with the supposed owner of Scuzzi's Italian Grill.  I called the restaurant before we came to be sure that we could be seated, and they said that we could.  As soon as we arrived, they stated that all of their indoor tables were reserved.  We opted to sit outside, which we had done in the past.  Due to it being a bit cold, we asked if we could have the outdoor heater turned on.  When our appetizers came out, approximately ten minutes after we were seated, we asked about the heater again, and were told that they did not have the fuel to turn them on.  We then went inside to sit at the bar, at which time we asked to speak to the manager.  A person came to our table, dressed the same as the servers, and identified himself as the \"owner\".  When asked about the patio heaters, he said that they did not have the fuel, and that we were welcomed to go to Academy or HEB to find some.  I told him that his rudeness was uncalled for, and he then proceeded to tell my wife and I to enjoy what we had on our table and leave.  I asked him if he was really telling us to leave and he said \"yes\" and walked away.  We have frequented this location at Military and 1604 and have NEVER received such poor customer service.  His attitude and rudeness was uncalled for.  I sincerely hope that he was not the owner, because if he was, he truly needs to learn more about hospitality.  I'd like to add that I called Academy (located right behind them) to ask if they had the propane tanks, and they said they had \"plenty\"."

As a foodie great food but I was over charged on my check the manager gave me the hardest time ever. Happy hour was 4-7 we ordered at 620 because our reservation was at 6pm and they rang the check in at 7:04 per what the check stated! He didn't even want to refund me after over charging me. I wish this was a better experience but it wasn't for all my people wanting the best service and food stick to Pompeii! I should have never cheated on my favorite Italian restaurant in San Antonio for this. 4 shrimp for $17.00 ohh hell no!  Please don't ever contact me or any customer for that matter via personal line/text that is just against all ethics to continue to rant about what I said on this site. A customer review is feedback! The thing is I still tipped in cash next time include all the facts!   I really would like to know why wouldn't you offer an opportunity to make it right next time, let the customer know you will always provide superb business. Nope that was not the case! This has now become harassment! It just food people!   Ps I'm not even a food critic! They are much worse!"

See my previous review about the odd parking situation, but non issue this time since we knew the protocol this time. Carlos our server was great-no mask though. A few others we observed were masked up. The place was quite empty which we were happy about. The food just excellent! Wife had the diablo pasta w/ shrimp and lobster bits, I had the pecan crusted tilapia-we enjoyed both! Servings were generous and flavor on point. Let's talk about the bread. Lousy...hard and really no flavor. Recall the bread last visit was also bland. Step up your bread game Bourbon-so many restaurants do this exceptionally well. Again food overall excellent-but real obvious how bad the bread continues to be. I'll look for bread improvements on a future visit.   *Location/Access/Convenience:  3* *Ambiance:  3*  *Cleanliness:  3* *Food Taste/Quality:  4* *Service:  4* *Price/Value:  4*  *Pay Process:  3* *Takeout/Pickup Experience:  NA* *Covid Conscious:  2*  *Likeliness of Returning:  3*  ***Overall Score: 29/9=3.2"

The baked oysters were great and their beet salad is a nice touch. The shrimp and lump looked amazing and came in a pool of butter, it's nice but was annoying to run into little shell pieces when you bite down. Was hoping to redeem the meal with a bread pudding as it was the #1 recommended dessert . Not something I would order again. The texture wasn't soft enough for my taste"

We stayed right by the Alamo on the river walk and all the restaurants had an hour plus wait, we ventured about 15 minutes north in the river walk toward the museum district and found this gem with no wait, with outdoor dining overlooking the river walk and really good seafood.  So many of the river walk restaurants feel like tourist traps with mediocre overpriced food, this place had none of that vibe, and live music to boot.  Everything we ordered was great (shrimp bourbon street appetizer, Diablo pasta, shrimp and lump, and fried shrimp/catfish platter) do yourself a favor and get out of the hustle and bustle and give this place a try."

                "description": "Walked in and was greeted and seated right away. It was a few minutes before our waitress came by but she was running all over. Took our drink order and we ordered an appetizer. Drinks came right out I had an Old Fashioned that was just great, and my wife had a Cucumber Martini that she said was the best she ever had!!  We got complimentary bread and butter and shortly after our Calamari strips arrived. They were so delicious, crunchy, and soft in the center! Even the marinara was great not just tomato sauce!   We both got Redfish, I got the Pontchartrain and my wife the Diablo. The Pontchartrain was cooked perfectly and had great flavor, the Diablo was pretty bland and no spice at all! The dirty rice was average just seemed like it was out of a box...   Would definitely go back and try other dishes."

They don't take reservations but the wait wasn't terrible and we got a drink at the bar while we waited. The service was good considering it was a holiday and everyone goes out for dinner. We started with the alligator for an appetizer which was really good. My husband had the redfish which I tried and it was very delicious. I had the mardi gra pasta which was alright. It lacked salt and was just a little more greasy than I'd have liked. Nevertheless I didn't take any stars away because this is definitely a place I'd come back to and try other dishes."

                "description": "I stayed at the Wyndham hotel connected to the restaurant and I am so glad we put this on our to-do list when visiting SA. The staff was very friendly, personable and definitely made us feel comfortable with the execution of COVID protocols and social distancing. I always know what kind of meal it is going to be early on, and when we were given warm bread and a tasty olive oil dip, I knew we were in for a treat!   I had the Louisiana Lemonade and it was one of the top 5 cocktails I've had so far; my entree was a plate of oysters, shrimp and fries- all fried and it was so obviously fresh and seasoned to perfection. I'm very picky about my seafood and this restaurant is definitely on the top of my list of places to revisit!   Bourbon St. seafood is a must if you're visiting San Antonio!"

                "description": "Bourbon Street is a very nice restaurant with the ambience of the fine dining restaurants in New Orleans. The food is delicious but a tad overpriced and not quite as \"authentic\" as advertised. The dirty rice was more of a darkened rice pilaf than actual Louisiana dirty rice. The group I was with ordered a varied array of dishes and we each enjoyed the food. The order of frig legs that we shared as an appetizer was the BEST part of the meal, they weren't too heavily breaded,  as some restaurants do, and they were fried to perfection and still juicy and moist. I will recommend Bourbon Street Seafood Kitchen for fine dining with a Louisiana  flavor"

                "description": "Pretty great food and awesome service. I ordered takeout from this place because I was craving cheese, shrimp and pasta, so fettucine alfredo it is. This place definitely hit the spot. It came with the softest bread and the most unique cilantro-infused oil that was delicious. The noodles and shrimp were cooked perfectly, with just the right amount of cheesy sauce. The portion was a pretty good amount (enough for 2, but I wanted to be a pig, so I ate the entire darn thing...and I have zero regrets). If getting takeout, the restaurant is sweet and adds a York peppermint patty. I don't really do chocolate and mint, but the gesture was really cute.   Highly recommend for taste and promptness. Totally worth the price."

Best bread oil dip.. never knew that was thing before. It's not the best but it will do.  Things to improve, the cleaning of the fish The waiters not remembering what we ask for  Or the Louisiana hot sauce isn't what I would call La hot sauce it's like a off brand I've never heard of  Fav location out of all of them"

Had to ask for extra bread for it since it was a large helping. Their Pontchartrain Red Fish could have honestly been just about any fish with all the sauce they put on it, but it was so good I thought I would  lick my plate. Staff needs a little training about taking away extra tableware,  etc when the table was set for 4 and there were just 2 of us. They were very friendly though."

After bringing it to their attention, they brought her another cup and it was much better because they made a fresh batch. We requested an inside table due to outside seating was just too breezy. Things got better. Fried frog legs were delicious. Bread and butter and pesto sauce was good. Trout plate and dirty rice good. Pasta seafood plate good. Raw oysters delicious. Waitresses were busy."

Wife ordered the Eggplant Bayous and while I ordered the Seafood Jambalaya. The Eggplant Bayous was good and creamy. I've had Seafood Jambalaya elsewhere before but this had a distinct taste that is different from the others I had before.  Would have given them a 5 star reviews if it were not for the servers forgetting to give us utensils and having that odd taste with the seafood Jambalaya."

The spaghetti vegetables with my husbands dinner were perfectly seasoned. We all tried a bite and were amazed at how good they tasted. My blackened redfish was perfect, and served with dirty rice that was amazing. The others in our party ordered shrimp dishes that were cooked to perfection.   Leave room for dessert. The baked Alaska is big enough to share with several friends. Creme Brûlée is my favorite dessert ever, and it was perfect. I'm not usually a fan of restaurant coffee because it's generally a dark roast, but their coffee was smooth and well suited with the desserts.   Definitely give them a try!"

This was my first time coming here so I knew the prices were high and assumed I was getting small portions. I was wrong. All the meals came out and were great portions.   We got the calamari, lobster bisque, steak, salmon, mashed potatoes, and au gratin potatoes. Steak was a little salty but everything else was awesome.   For dessert, we had a the banana foster.

Staff was so friendly and personable. I love that welcoming feeling the moment you walk into the door. Our waitress really knew the menu and even recommended delicious appetizers like the Calamari.

Other than that, whether you have a celebration or not, Eddie V's has always been my go to. This was my first SA experience. We had oysters- the horseradish is the bomb-2 of us had the Butter fish which was a special and it was fantastic- flaky, tender and flavorful. Our other companion got the Sea Bass that was baked- she liked it but ours was better- if you get Sea Bass, I recommend the one on the menu in soy and steamed. Spinach, Au gratin potatoes and Brussels sprouts were the sides. As always during a celebration,(birthday here) they brought out a complementary dessert of bananas foster with a candle. We also ordered the molten cake- very rich-the very light ice cream couldn't stand with it. If you like a lot of alcohol in your dessert, def go with the foster"

                "description": "I'd like to give this place 4.5 stars simply because their menu survived in tact with a name change. Can we get a relaunch  on the menu?  I decided to make this place for Halloween night because I knew I would be alone so I didn't want to be that guy who shoos away the kids or makes them walk all the way up the walk to get a thing of nerds. So I set 150 pieces of candy on the curb and bolted.   I arrived to the bar and promptly ordered their house special smoked old fashioned   https://youtu.be/d1iEBP9I2Nc  For bar food I ordered mini filet burgers. Center cut filet, blue cheese and onion jam. Very nice.   My entre was Texas Redfish with rice on the side. Perhaps just a hair overdone.   My bartender heard me say nothing was grabbing me from the desert menu so he orders me something custom on the house. I guess he knew once he did that, I'd be ordering a new old fashioned. This is why he's tending bar here and not Buffalo Wild Wings.   By this time I had switched to their standard old fashioned (12 less than 18). I've been annoyed by the lack of Bulleit Rye in San Antonio so I settled for Hayden's. I managed to hunt down two bottles of Bulleit Rye in town. Bartender suggested I covet those.   I always tell young couples looking for a serious date night to come here. It's rare for me to come here without being dragged by the wife.   If you're from MD and you know what real crab cakes are, all I can say is don't do it. No matter how much the staff brags on them, the MD style crab cakes are a forgery. They will disappoint you like accidentally kissing your sister."

                "description": "Eddie Vs is a very nice, romantic, special occasion restaurant. The dim lighting gives the restaurant an elegant, sexy vibe. I was recently there with a client, so no romance for me lol. Our server was Kenya and she was excellent and drives my 5 star review. She has a bright sparkly personality, was very attentive yet not intrusive. I'd say the food is a solid 4 based on this and previous visits. The sashimi was delicious. The crab cake was a bit mushy, but had great flavor. Would have preferred smaller size with more lump crab. I had the filet which wasn't as rare as I'd hoped and this is my second visit where it was too salty. Lesson learned. They are best known for seafood. Chocolate lava cake was same as everywhere. A more creative chocolate desert would be a welcome alternative to compete with the house special, bananas foster. If u want a showstopper dessert get that instead. Oh yes the cocktail was a delight, very unique. I loved it. Another solid visit to Eddie Vs. Highly recommend."

                "description": "My dad and stepmom came to visit my fiancé and I, and they wanted to eat somewhere good while they were here.  Eddie V's was suggested, so I made us a reservation.  I had never been to Eddie V's before, and it definitely did not disappoint.  Their food and service was fantastic.    We had shrimp cocktail for an appetizer, my fiancé had the ribeye, my dad had the South African lobster, I had the scallops, and my stepmom had the sea bass.  We also ordered the crab fried rice, crispy brussel sprouts, and truffle macaroni and cheese for sides.  For dessert, my step mom and dad had berries and cream, and my fiancé and I had the pineapple upside down cake.    The shrimp we had as an appetizer were nice and big, not to mention tasty.  I tired my fiancé's ribeye, which was cooked perfectly to his liking and was full of flavor.  I also tried my dad's lobster tail, it was sweet and very tasty.  I didn't try my step mom's sea bass, but she said it was amazing.  My scallops were sweet and some of the best I've ever had.  The sides were delicious too.  The truffle macaroni and cheese was bursting with flavor and my favorite out of the sides we ordered.  Probably the best macaroni and cheese I've ever had.  The crab fried rice and brussel sprouts were also amazing.    We also had a wonderful waiter.  He was very attentive and professional and even gave us some small samples of an appetizer they offer and a small sample of their bananas foster dessert they have.    My fiancé and I have lived in San Antonio for about two and a half years, and Eddie V's is my favorite restaurant so far.  It is a bit pricey, but the food and service is totally worth it.  If you like good seafood and steak, I definitely recommend Eddie V's.  I promise you will not be disappointed.  I can't wait to go back.  I  am not sure if this is a reservations only restaurant or not, but I did make reservations for us, and I suggest making reservations if you go there."

There were five women, with one celebrating her birthday. He was very complementary of our looks (apparently, he claims women age better than men....I'll take it ). Other than his excellent service, we were also happy with our meals.   For our sides, we had the following:  Crispy Brussel Sprouts - **** Crab Fried Rice- ******  (amazing!)  Starters:  Wedge Salad - ***** Warm Goat Cheese Salad- **** Classic Caesar - ****  Main Entrees:  Norwegian Salmon - ***** Jumbo Gulf Shrimp- ***** Parmesan Sole - *****  Clearly, we were very happy with the food and the service. Icing on the cake was the surprise birthday trio that was presented to the celebrant. The petals on the table was an added and sweet touch to our experience.  So glad that I finally got to experience Eddie V's!"

                "description": "Very elegant restaurant. Polite staff but food was a bit underwhelming.  We ordered a few oysters on the half shell - a bit smushed onto a plate but definitely fresh. Strong horseradish - so be cautious if you don't want to lose the taste of the oysters.  Lobster bisque is poured over a small piece of lobster tableside which is a nice presentation but it does cool the soup a bit IMO. Needed a bit more salt to bring out the flavor. It was ok - nothing stellar - this is generally one of my favorite soups to order but alas this one was just ok  My DD ordered the Halibut which at first we were told was not available and we overheard a different server mention it as a special so we were able to locate ours to double check if it was really available and to change our entree order. It was done really perfectly - definitely would order this again  I was excited to see lobster mashed potatoes - so HAD to order this of course - I have had an excellent rendition of this in SF at Maestro's so was really looking forward to trying this one. Definitely steps and steps below. We ate the lobster on top - ok amount but the potatoes were just warm - not hot and the sauce (not just butter) didn't add to it all and there were chives throughout which really didn't work here. We didn't have much of this and didn't bother taking the leftovers home - which really never happens before - Leaving mashed potatoes is a very strange concept to our family.  Might be worth a second try if we our in the area but I won't be dreaming about coming back....."

                "description": "One of the most beautiful restaurants in San Antonio. I had their Thanksgiving dark turkey meat that was the best I have ever tasted. Stuffing could have used a little more sage seasoning a bit more than 1 tablespoon of cranberry sauce. However, they gave us more of everything when we requested, overall this was no problem.  This is our second visit and both times we found it to be delightful. keep up the good work in the reviews will keep coming in."

                "description": "Five star service from start to finish.  Outstanding job to the manager (Mike I think?) and his team of service staff.  Reservations were relatively easy to grab late in the day on a Saturday.  As some have mentioned it's sort of a loud place but the decor and overall vibe of the place makes up for it.    The hosts were spot on, professional and saw us to our table promptly.  The waiter was very quick to recommend, share quick table conversation and most importantly pace the meal so that we had an experience that was remembered and not just in and out.   Food was above my expectations.  It was presented as described, with an excellent temperature and quality.  Plating, we all understand we eat with our eyes as much as our mouths.  Presentation here was without flaws, the culinary team really executed the meal preparation with professionalism and skill.    Desert was placed to go and we were given a small square sample of the bananas foster to go.  One bite, I'm hooked.  This was the absolute best bananas foster I've ever eaten and giving me a small square in my bag was the smartest thing to do.  Otherwise, I probably would have passed it by and never experienced it.  Seriously, if you like bananas you simply must go for the foster.  I have found my newest favorite desert.    Oh, our to go was chocolate cake which while good, it is really overtaken by how good the foster was.  The team here really put fourth a five star experience and served with passion and heart. My second visit is down, and I look toward many more in the future.  The word on the street here is they have a pretty amazing happy hour.  Definitely something to check out in the future.     Five stars for me my fellow yelpers, I recommend you give them a visit and prepare to elevate your evening."

                "description": "My husband made reservations to celebrate my birthday. Upon arrival, we were greeted and seated immediately. Our table definitely looked different then everyone else - there was a Reserved card and it had fresh rose petals surrounding the centerpiece candle. Al was our server for the evening and he was so sweet and walked us through the specials for the evening and his favorites.  [Not pictures] My drink throughout the evening was The Hope's Diamond - gorgeous looking and delicious; can't taste the alcohol so be careful!  For dinner our entrees were the Lobster (my favorite place for South African Lobster) and the Filet Minon with crab stuffed shrimp.  No dessert for us as much as Al tried but it was a great evening dinner all around. I would highly recommend celebrating birthdays here."

The ambiance from the time you walk in and the reception that you get when greeted started the date off perfectly.    When I made my reservation, I added that we would be celebrating a birthday.  When we were seated, to our surprise, a table of rose petals and a personalized card wishing her a happy birthday was above and beyond what any other restaurant has done.    Nice work Eddie V's!"

The food and drinks were great, probably the best steak I've had, cooked perfectly medium rare just how I ordered. Smoked old fashion had a nice presentation and an even better taste. I popped THE question after dinner, and with some pre planning and discussion with the manager Mike G. for the evening and smooth catering by our waiter Brian C. it was absolutely perfect. I couldn't have asked for a better dinner and proposal dinner!"

The seats are okay for short distance but was very uncomfortable by end of trip. The last trip there was a driver and \"tour guide \".  The tour guide kept chatting up the driver and to my mind this distracted the driver.  This was evident when a wheel barrel blew off a truck in front of us.  In trying to avoid striking the object our driver swerved onto shoulder at fairly high speed but still hit the object. Very scary. On the way back she missed our exit and had to double back. I'm sure I will never get my wife on a bus again."

We had the A/C unit go off in over 105 degree heat. A young girl passed out and was unresponsive. And what did OK TOURS do??  They said let's stop here and let this young girl gather her composure and then we will take off. Well like I said that was over 6 hours ago. No one has offered to put us up in a hotel room...There are elderly folks out here in the elements. There are people asleep on the concrete sidewalks in the parking lot of a Love's. What the fuck is that??!! (Please excuse my language). But I have been more than patient with this sorry ass excuse for a tour bus company.   I am giving them a 1 only because it will not allow me to post if I do not select at least 1 star.   Sorry to some of the coordinators. They tried their best.

I don't remember which company for previous trips, but if I go again, will make sure it is with OK TOURS. The bus was comfortable and the driver made sure we had all information needed. The driver or as I would like to call him, the Captain of our ship, was THE BEST! Captain Mark Cain was definitely the best bus driver ever! His driving skills were evident from the get go and I can honestly say, I felt confident and knew that he would get us there safe and sound (a major consideration for bus travel these days). So take away is: Request Mark Cain for your trips and you will be a happy traveler. And OK TOURS: Mark is deserving of whatever raises he is eligible for. Do whatever you need to do to keep him!! Happy Travels with OK TOURS and Captain Mark Cain!"

So anyways he said he would put the 20 back. In my account but still ain't there. So rules of the bus is you can't have beer or no liquor.. The man that was sitting in the back was drinking beer and whiskey.. Very ignorant and very irritating. We got to the casino well we had to wait like 3 in half hours to get are room we got there at 2..the tour guy Jaime said he would be back at 530 to give us the keys to our room.  Well he was 30 min late we finally went to the room it was the Days Inn it was a dive.. The room was hot AC didn't work.. Carpet was dirty.. So we went back to the casino.. The staff at the casino are rude I had to go to the bar 7 times to get a drink wait staff was no good.. The casino look ghetto.. Stinks real bad.. on the way back the man that was drinking on the bus before well he brought liquor on the bus kept talking to me and my wife I told Jaime he was harassing us and told him he was drunk and drinking he didn't seem to do anything about it. He bought beer at the last stop and brought it on the bus right in front of Jaime and did nothing about it"

We had previously had a bad experience with one of their drivers and requested he not drive our kids on this particular trip.  Yet, this same driver was there on the 2nd leg of our trip home.  His driving continued to get worse as he drove.  Long story short, he was finally arrested and charged with 52 counts of DWI with a minor.  Two years later, the court case is finally over and he's now a convicted felon who will not be driving a bus ever again.  Not once during this time has OK Tours taken any sort of responsibility or returned any payments made even though they did not get us home safely.   We have scouts who will never be able to get on a bus again without checking to see if the driver seems sober.  (Bus on trip to Georgia also broke down leaving us with 50+ scouts stuck in a parking lot.)  OK Tours may be cheaper, but it is not worth the money you will save!"

                "description": "Hmmm. It happens. Stopped in to grab a drink while at swim meet nearby. In my vodka and tonic was a long hair that I didn't see till I was eating my ice. Bartender was serving us and she was unavailable. Saw some lady tucked behind the fountain machine on her cell phone and when I asked for help she said she wasn't on the clock. I'll assume that to be true. Looked outside and saw the bartender having a smoke and putting on makeup. I walked outside to let her know about it and didn't request anything in return. She apologized and offered to reimburse my card (I paid cash prior to my finding and a 30% tip to which I should have taken back, but I did not).   Hope this isn't indicative of their sanitation practices and overall service, but know I won't return as a result of my first experience with this establishment."

                "description": "I went this past Sunday at lunch.  There were maybe three tables sat when we got there.  We ordered the onion rings appetizer.  They were very good except for the ketchup tasted spoiled.  We ordered three burgers where they charge you for the cheese and a different bread if you want it.  I chose the Jalapeno cheese bread.  After waiting about 40 minutes our waitress comes out and says they ran out of hamburgers but rest assured they were making some and ours would be fresh!  My family laughed and said, what had they not ran out would they not be fresh?  Needless to say and hour passed by and our food finally came out.  Trusting the yelp 4 start review I'm ready to eat!  Well my Jalapeno and cheese bun came out and it had no Jalapeno or cheese in it and it was the type that is old and falls apart and was fermented.  I almost asked for my $1.50 back for the upgrade but my family said let's just get out of here and forget about it and not come back.  So for $52 we received an order of onion rings and three burgers and no drinks.  A sign of the situation as well, the table next to us complained of the hot sauce for their tacos being spoiled.  Their 4 star review may have been earned in the past but this place is not something I will ever be looking forward to.  ****Update*****We used my Mastercard here to eat and didn't use the card anywhere else.  I've received two fraudulent charges on the card now.  A girl by the name Jessica used the card to buy pizza in Seguin."

                "description": "This place is hidden in plain sight. I live close by and have always wanted to check it out. It's a smaller restaurant with plenty of seating and a full bar (although pretty simple draft choices).  The prices are good, and the food is great! I had the buffalo chicken sandwich on sourdough. It came out fresh and melted in my mouth. I can't say I have had a chicken burger this fresh and moist...ever! My husband got the Texan which was great as well- not too much bbq sauce and the flavors went together great.  While we didn't have room for anything else other than beer, I would definitely be back. Very dive bar feel with what seemed like 98% \"locals\" or return guests as everyone was mingling with the bartenders a lot. I am happy to say this didn't affect our service since the bartenders were the waitstaff as well.  Definitely check it out! Also karaoke on Saturdays!"

                "description": "This should be your new \"regular\" spot for lunch. The only problem is that it's already the regular spot for a LOT of people so you better start taking lunch breaks early.  I came with a work friend and got a decent table ala \"seat yourself\". Lots of burger options and that's what they are known for. I had the Texas burger on a bun. Usually, it comes on Texas toast (of course). It was ginormous and well done. The pile of bacon on it was - it amazes me to write this - almost too much. I think there was more bacon than beef. Also a couple onion rings and bbq sauce made this an awesome meal.  For a side I had the tater tots which were tasty and well cooked.   I would have liked speedier service, but the three women serving this place were flat out slammed and doing an impressive job of keeping up with the flow. So go, be patient, and don't fill the place up!"

Drawn in by the media buffet above the bar (football, football, football, Simpsons, football, football...something for errbahduh!), we parked it there.  There's a great list of pre-built burgers, but also a long list of carb jacket (definitely go for the jalapeño cheddar! Definitely. ) and topping choices from which to build your own. He orders the Australian burger and I beer, I go for a much more Texan option: chicken fingers and fries basket, white pepper gravy duh, and a sweet tea (Don't judge! We had just spent all afternoon at  brewery, and I hadn't eaten. Adultin' like a mofo!) The waitress was kind enough to suggest that the fries in my basket would be enough for both of us. ..\"*if* I felt sharing\", lol. Well played, ma'am! And much appreciated tip, seriously! ...and indeed they were. A very short few minutes later, a veritable mountain of food was placed in front of  us.  Burger: Super!! Chicken and gravy: Really really good. Fries: Old eff'n Bay!!! Yaaayyyy!  Sweet Tea : holy shit, use the lemon! Super sweet and delicious with it.

Decided to try it out for Mother's Day. NOT for us. Burger was large, but very greasy and lacking in flavor. We asked for extra crispy sweet potato fries, I've had more flavorful and crispy sweet potato fries frozen out of a bag. Menu was a la cart, so we spent way more than we should have for in my opinion, poor quality food.  Customer service (if you can even call it that) was non existent. Will not go back. Pat's Place is definitely much better, unfortunately they're closed on Sunday's.  For the lovely folks letting their small kids scream and fight over the pool table, pool sticks/balls, AND use a stick with no tip on the felt, unsupervised, I'm thinking Chucky Cheese is probably a better choice next time."

                "description": "Today, for 8 hours, I've been thinking about downing a hand-formed, griddled hamburger. Where to go? My criteria: new place, no tips, local, inexpensive, and at least a 1/2 pounder,   There are not many places to get hamburgers over here. There is Smashburger, which has been getting horrible ratings, Chilis (my favorite), Texas Roadhouse, Gruene River Grill, the Phoenix Saloon, and Pat's place. Now, places where you can get away without paying a tip--whether that is through the drive though or takeout--are GG's Corner Cafe (Marion), Blakes's Cafe (McQueeney), Kirby's Korner (Seguin), the Longhorn Cafe (New Braunfels), and today's addition with Landa Station.     This dive bar is located about a block past Landa Park. While looking at their menu online, I noticed that all of their burgers are 1/2 pounders (plus); they have one pounders also, chicken sandwiches, and Mexican food (cool). This is a bar folks!  I went through the drive though, after phoning in my order 10 minutes earlier. I ordered a patty melt ($5.75) because I haven't had one since I was a teenager, ions ago. The patty melt was described as a 1/2 pound burger, grilled onions, and swiss cheese on a buttered, Texas Toast. I must have arrived 5 minutes too late because my \"toast\" was no longer toasted. Either it was not toasted enough, or it steamed in that Styrofoam box and turned back into bread.      The burger was huge, juicy, and was cooked medium, as I had ordered (plus), the onions were great; however, the cheese was a white cheese sauce, or poor quality cheese (I think the former). The cheese seemed almost like white cheese whiz. If these burgers could be improved, I would only serve Wisconsin cheeses. I would pay 75 cents more.  They also have chopped pork, chicken, and many burger combinations. Because of the price, the drive through, and hand formed burgers, I will definitely be back. Oh, and on Wednesdays, when you buy a burger, you get a beer for 10 cents (probably inside only)."

While the store is not big they have a good selection of liquor, beer and wine as well as mixers. This small yet well organized store makes shopping quick and easy. While their prices are a few dollars more than other chain liquor stores in town, I'd rather pay a little extra to support a locally owned business. Also, they offer a members club for a small annual fee, $25 I believe, and with that you get 10% off liquor and wine.   While there are other larger stores nearby, do yourself a favor and shop here; the staff is more friendly and knowledgable."

As \"Wine UnClub\" members at Seazar's we always get a discount on all our purchases. For this third barrel Mike decided to up the price per bottle to retail and not honor our discount club card. When we asked why the price was higher this time around we were told they were doing us a favor by handling the transaction at all. Even though I live in AZ I buy a lot of bourbon from Seazar's and I have many friends in San Antonio. You have lost my future business and I will make sure to spread the negative word about how you do business. We have several more barrels coming and they won't be going through Seazar's."

The service is friendly, the employee knowledgeable, the store is clean and it is very well organized to make shopping a breeze.  The wine is in its own room and is a very nice selection to choose from. Also different price points for every customer. The beer selection is not giant but then while they do offer some national brands most of the beer is from smaller breweries. Many are sold by the single bottle so you can try first.   I do recommend this store as a good place for your liquor needs."

Check often for wine specials/sales because when they clean house, you score. Located in the Sunset Ridge shopping centre next to Baskin Robbins. Note:  keep an eye out for the little old ladies/men in hats driving cadillacs while backing out of your parking space.  This is a great place to hit up when filling out your picnic basket prior to an outdoor concert at the McNay (if it's not on a Sunday)."

Maybe the good people of the '09 don't drink enough lower class beverages to keep the stock rotating, but when I pay premium price for high quality beer I expect it to not be almost a year past its best-by date."

They have wine tastings on Saturdays, and you can also become a \"Member\" for $25 a year, and you will get 15% off all purchases when you come in, well worth it when you like to kick back and have an adult beverage as much as I do (maybe I shouldn't admit that).  They also have one of the best wine selections I've seen in S.A.  Trust me, you can do no wrong by going here, just try it out, this will become the only Fine Wine and Spirits store you will go to from now on."

While there, a guy offered to let us try samples of like 5 of the new beers they had just gotten in. Pretty cool! Even cooler, the owner/manager guy.. (he calls himself Captain (something or other).. I forgot) offered to let us try two wines also. Apparently, every saturday there are free wine tastings of the featured wines.. He chooses good and reasonably cheap ones every week. There is even a group you can join to try them every week and get a discount on them.. Then, we returned for halloween and the owner basically showed off his vast knowledge of different alcohols by recommending various tequilas that were within our price range but also very good. Seriously, this guy knows his stuff and he doesn't try to rip you off by recommending the expensive product.. it's pretty awesome! GIve 'em a try!"

What a great decision! William was attentive, very knowledgeable and patient. He made some excellent suggestions and recommendations for Vodka and wine. I have been a wine collector for about two years and still have much to learn and I already know William will be one of my major resources. One of the biggest joyful surprises was he was able to find a case of my new favorite Chardonnay in their warehouse. I haven't been able to find this small production wine at any retailer online  and even the winery itself is sold out so this was a real find! I joined their wine club and since I live in the area my case was delivered the next morning when it arrived from the warehouse. You can't go wrong with these guys! Their prices are very competitive and with the 15% discount it becomes a lot easier to purchase the special selections. I just can't say enough good things about this place!"

Dedicated parking across the street was like 5 bucks for the day. Overall delightful experience-just so much to see. Really enjoyed the numerous collections. The place is elegant, clean, and inviting. Despite the free admission it really was not crowded-the place is huge. The building architecture is interesting and the exhibits are so well layed out. Plenty of places to stop for a break, bathrooms at every corner, and friendly employees. Regular admission is 20pp which in retrospect is really quite worth it-you get to see so much. Would certainly recommend and go again-wear comfortable shoes!  The mask wearing population was about 50/50, but the place is big so didn't feel crowded at all. Sign at the entrance indicated \"masks strongly encouraged\" which made us happy.   *Location/Access/Convenience:  5* *Ambiance:  5*  *Cleanliness:  5* *Food Taste/Quality:  NA* *Service:  5* *Price/Value:  5*  *Pay Process:  5* *Takeout/Pickup Experience:  NA* *Covid Conscious:  4* *Likeliness of Returning:  5*  ***Overall Score: 39/8=4.7"

                "description": "How does one rate art? Just like anything else, it's about the $$ vs experience.  Parking is convenient...not free ($5) unless you're a member. There was some construction, so navigating wasn't the most fun. Service was superb at the front desk...just smiles and respect.  I really enjoyed seeing ancient artifacts and sculptures...esp the coin collection and Greek statues. There were literally pieces that are thousands of years old, even preceding the days of MOSES. Crazy!  I was a bit fan of the Chinese collections as well....however my 4 star is because of my huge disappoint at the Korean collection. It is labeled Korean so I expected a bit more than a few Buddha sculptures and pottery made in korea...thought it would be more of the culture. Oh well.  For $20, well worth it and lots of food options near by too. If you want to find something to do to spend your day but can't decide, then this is a great option to stroll around and enjoy someone else's hard work.  However, this is probably not a place you want to bring young children or strollers, I don't think the experience would be very pleasant with children around. It was pretty cool that they would allow us to take photos of stuff (without flash) so I get to capture some memories with my wife."

When we came to visit, the elevators were down. So if you have anyone who isn't mobile enough to go up and down the stairs I'd call first to see if they have any suggestions. It took a little over two hours to do a 'quick' run through the whole museum, I could have probably spend the day taking everything in. It's a great place to visit! Definitely would recommend anyone to stop in and get some steps in."

I decided to check it out and ended up becoming a member (it's a good deal; $60 for a year-long all-you-can-visit membership with some free guests or $20 for a single visit unless you're military, a student, senior, etc.) and I'm already considering becoming a volunteer.  I'm not sure why the name is the \"museum of art\" because - as far as I've seen - it's mostly historical artifacts, or artwork from 1000+ years ago. Of course, I've only visited once so far so there might be a large section I'm missing but either way, it's a surprisingly large collection in a surprisingly nice museum. (And I know it might sound ignorant to think a museum like this wouldn't be in south Texas, but I had only seen such collections on the East coast of the US, or in capitol cities.)  Highly recommended to check out while you're in SA!"

                "description": "One of my first visits to SAMA was in the 1980s when my parents took me to a Jim Henson exhibit and I've been a fan ever since. I usually visit at least once, sometimes twice a year depending on exhibits. Parking across the street used to be free but they now charge $5 but members can can get validation. I feel like SAMA tends to get overlooked compared to the McNay. The McNay surpasses SAMA with the beauty of their grounds but SAMA also is located on historic grounds of a former brewery. This is the only art museum in town with an restaurant on the grounds out back by the river (the excellent Tre Tratorria) which is great so that you can see the entire museum with a place for replenishment. They still have an excellent and actual gift shop as compared to the McNay, which has significantly downsized theirs. I feel like the exhibits sometimes pale in comparison to those at the McNay but right now they have an excellent American Impressionism show and extended the very fun Movie Metal showcasing some of the Transformers and vehicles from Batman shows and movies and back to the Future. The museum is several stories tall so be sure to visit the level with the skywalk that many years ago was used to roll barrels of beer across. They also have very cool old-fashioned glass elevators. Free admission for Bexar County residents on Tuesdays and Sundays (check their site for hours).  If paying for parking make it worth your while and take a walk north along the SA River while viewing more art installations and head to the Pearl shopping and dining district and catch a ride on one of the river barges. There are several less expensive places to eat at within walking distance that are less expensive than Tre Trattoria and the Pearl such as Elsewhere and Rosella. You can also walk along the river towards downtown for coffee or rooftop cocktails and light bites at Paramour. For more art (that's free!) walk a few blocks along Jones towards I-35 to see murals painted under the highway."

We got to see all the art displayed. The bad thing about it is the walking, if you don't like to walk, then this place is definitely not for you.  SA is full of rich culture and heritage. I think the museum did an amazing job at depicting Latin American/European art. If you are in this area, you should definitely check it out.

                "description": "We are museum members who visit often, and here are some tips for new visitors.   A path through the museum. From the Great Hall (entrance lobby), turn left into the Egyptian, Greek, and Roman galleries. Take a ride in the glass elevator to the second and third floors with art from Asia, especially the ceramics from China and Japan. On the fourth floor, Australia and Oceania.   The skybridge is a must-see. It has a beautiful of downtown and the Pearl area. You can see many of the rooflines of the converted brewery building that became the museum.   The east tower is changing right now, but be sure to go to the Latin American wing to see colonial art, folk art, and ancient artifacts.   The museum store is in the bottom of the east tower and has books, postcards, toys, and more.   Checking the website will tell you what changing exhibitions are at the museum. On the way to the temporary exhibitions gallery, you will pass under a Chihy glass ceiling. You'll also find out what events are going on, whether it's a Friday night party for adults, or Sunday afternoon activities for families. The website also has up to date information on free hours and free days, often including the day after Thanksgiving and Christmas.   Along the river, there are coutyards for getting some fresh air, as well as restaurant space, currently occupied by Tre Trattoria. The Luxury (an outdoor restaurant) and Rosella coffee shop are just down the block.   This area of downtown is getting busier, but so far we haven't had a problem finding free parking. During Fiesta parades, however, the museum will close because it is so close to the parade route."

                "description": "This was hands down the best art museum I have ever been to in my life. We were there for four hours and still didn't get the opportunity to really look at everything. It's literally filled from floor to ceiling with tons of awesome paintings, artifacts, literally anything you could imagine. The place is very well organized and grouped by different countries. I feel like I see the same art at every other art museum but not at this place. There are so many stunning pieces that are indescribable, unique, and overall incredible. The facility was clean, it was quiet, it was just utter perfection when we were there. My family was able to learn so much and experience things we didn't think we'd ever see in person. There aren't enough words to tell you how incredible this place is. They have every type of art, from every type of place, and just wow. It's also located on the river walk, so you could take a nice stroll afterwards like we did. There's also a restaurant with tons of outdoor seating. I'm just in awe of this place. If you're in San Antonio you HAVE to check this place out."

                "description": "The San Antonio Museum of Art was incredible! This museum focused much more on art from antiquity than modern art. The collections are sorted expertly by time period and include plenty of context for each piece. I could spend all day in this museum!  Parking is free and is directly across the street. I saw several kids' programs going on at the time of my visit, and kids looked like they were having a blast."

                "description": "DISCLOSURE: If you're a lover of art, or have no real interest, this place still has a bit of something for everyone. This can mean a getaway from reality to spend some time in individual contemplation about the ways of the world.  For others, it could be walking, exploring and catching up with a friend of old.  And for that person in need of ideas for a project for their class, the San Antonio Museum of Art is worth the time and day (preferably a free day, so look forward to those Tuesdays or if you're military just walk on in).   Trying to get a feel for a new community that I am slowly beginning to integrate into, it can be easy to drive by this place and not even realize the potential for adventure you'd be missing out on.  This is an instance where one could say \"don't judge a book by it's cover\" because straight up, being seemingly located in a more industrialized looking area, are two huge brick buildings connected by a glass bridge above the entrance. One would more than likely find themselves stumbling across this place realizing that they've found intellectually stimulating, creative brain splurges splashed onto canvases, molded into sculptures, and numerous other ways with the potential of draining your entire day away in the blink of an eye.    For starters, when you do get to the museum, parking is conveniently located directly across the street and the best part is it's free! If you're looking for shade, just park a little further back so that's helpful.  On your way through the parking lot is a little bit of teaser art that I don't think is associated with the museum itself but if you're looking for a shot for Instagram, consider this little jewel on your way to the treasure chest.   Walking into museum, you'll be greeted by smiling employees at the desks in front of you and along the right wall, so don't be afraid to ask questions about the break down of the establishment so you can organize your trip or adventure any way you'd prefer.  At first it can be confusing considering there are numerous centuries of world art divided between several buildings and four floors.  The exhibition available during my time there was 500 years of Spanish painting from museums in Madrid so check out the central building first to see what new exhibitions they have available.  Aside from these are American art, contemporary art, and my favorite would easily have to be art from Greece and Rome so I spent quite a time in that section.   Know that as in any art museum, keep conversational volumes to a low, be mindful of anyone analyzing a piece, and please do not let your kids touch anything (as well as some adults tbh).  The facility is clean, the employees will answer any questions that they can, so help them out and be a fantastic visitor!  When you're done, they have a nice little gift shop and if you're looking to save a few pennies, ask them to point you in the direction of the clearance items which are just as nice as the regularly priced items. This was a great experience and I will find myself coming back here for more brain food!"

                "description": "Thursday night we decided to celebrate my wife's birthday,  since they do not take reservations and did not want to chance sitting outside waiting for a table we went at 5:30pm. We were able to park close and was seated right away. We loved the look and feel of the court yard and restaurant.  Cozy is how we described it. Our server was attentive and we passed on appetizers but order a bottle of French sauvignon blanc wine. Very good wine at a reasonable price point. We both ordered the 7oz loin steak. I opted for chicken tortilla soup, tasty thick soup but it was not very hot (Temperature). My wife had the salad with blu cheese dressing (good quality). We were pleased that our entrees did not arrive until we finished our soup/salad course. Again a point of proper service by our server. Our loin steaks were proper Temperature and had a great char crust. Great tasting. Green beans were fresh and cooked with still a bite to them. Roasted potatoes were nice.  For dessert we ordered black coffee that was fresh, cheesecake and a chocolate cake with ice cream. Desserts were very good.  We highly recommend and we return soon"

                "description": "My new favorite place in New Braunfels! I had a work meeting here and I was looking forward to eating at a restaurant that I have not been to before. I had seen all of the great reviews and even had some friends that Have recommended this place.  I love the decor and the house feel to this restaurant. We were seated right away and the service was top notch. I got the tortilla soup which I recommend and I ordered the steak with the port wine reduction sauce with blue cheese. I am picky about my steaks partly because I think I am pretty decent at cooking my own. This steak did not disappoint and the sauce was amazing.  Afterwards I had the cheesecake which was not only good but also the perfect size. If you are in New Braunfels you need to make a visit here and check this place out!"

                "description": "This is by far my favorite restaurant; I do pick at lease once every two weeks. It's a great place to have a date the atmosphere is just romantic they have out side sheeting shopping in the area and everything on the menu is just amazing. I usually start off with the chips and three salsa, then my go to entree is the steak medium rare with blue cheese sauce, for those of you who don't like blue cheese still try it even if it on the side because I know I'm not a blue cheese love but this sauce just hits different. If you have room for dessert get the cheesecake that has melted Carmel with  pecans or take it to go it's a great breakfast. They are also kid friendly so it a nice romantic dinner even if you don't have a sitter. The service is always great no matter who's your server just expect a wait Friday, Saturday and Sunday but it's so worth it promise."

The hostesses were very rude and non understanding. We asked to be seated outside near a heater and she threw a huge fit, returned outside and threw our menus and silverware and plates (which were filthy from the patrons before, they had not been cleaned properly and were covered in food). Then we waited for a good 10 minutes and still we're not seen by a server so we left. All in all terrible service and cleanliness."

My issue was the food quality. I have run restaurants and I know what should and should not be on a plate, especially with such a busy place. The salad was wilted. My tomatoes were starting to shrivel. The bread had been frozen and not thawed all the way before they cooked it. The meat was a lower grade than we were expecting.   Sometimes it's hard for me to eat out having shopped for three cafes and been a chef for 10 years, so take this review knowing I'm very picky.  My expectations are probably higher than they should be."

My husband and I thought the place was beautiful, however the food was ok. We started off with some wine, the moscato was great and added to the ambiance. We had the broiled spinach and artichoke dip.  I was expecting a traditional dip, but let me tell you what we got was not average at all. The dip seemed to have a hint of lime in it. My husband loved it, it was not for me. I can more closely describe it to tasting like corn in a cup. They also serve it with bread and chips. For an entre, I had the parmesan breaded chicken breast. It was stuffed with mushroom's, spinach, cheese and  artichoke hearts, served with a side of penne pasta and broccoli. I wish that my chicken was stuffed significantly more. I could hardly taste the filling. The penne pasta was a little bland, but I did not mind it. The broccoli was cooked to perfection and I quite enjoyed it. My hubby got the 2oz mixed grill. He was satisfied, but mentioned it was not for him.   In conclusion, this place is worth a try, the location is beautiful, and they also have cats in their courtyard!"

                "description": "We had a very enjoyable day yesterday, thanks to our memorable driver Lindy, the beautiful Texas Hill Country, the historic LBJ Ranch and National Park, the bustling town of Fredericksburg, the tiny but charming town of Luchenback, and the hospitality and great wines of Sister Creek Vineyards in Sisterdale. All this for $109.  We had 8 folks on the bus, so it was a very informal day where you got to know everyone. There were some issues getting a few of the tourists and the bus to the same rendez-vous point, but Lindy patiently made the phone calls and figured out where the parties were.  The mini van gave us a very comfortable ride and Lindy was an absolute joy and delight to hang out with for a day.  The only quibbles I have about the tour was a) the AC could have been better, and 2) I wish the seats would have had headrests for a snooze on the way back.  Well done, Gray Line and thanks for a memorable day."

                "description": "My friend and I bought the San Antonio Explorer Pass from Groupon at $84, which included one premium attraction and two nonpremium attractions; one of the premium attractions was the LBJ Ranch tour. The tour is operated by Gray Line Tours bus service so this review is for that only, not of the Explorer Pass and not of Groupon.  We really enjoyed the tour! I wouldn't say it's worth $109, but a Google search will yield you lots of partners selling the tour tickets at a discounted rate.   Regarding booking, we tried to call the toll-free number on a Sunday for a Monday tour (need to reserve at least 24 hours ahead), but the office was closed. However, the automated message directed us to a cell phone number to call to reach someone directly for booking. My friend texted that number--omitted here for privacy but obtainable by calling the Gray Lines Tours number--and received a response within 5 minutes, if that.   I also called a different number and left a voicemail message just in case, and I was called back within an hour or so and also texted. I really appreciate the effort on the booking agent's part!   Once we were in touch, we provided our San Antonio Explorer Pass voucher numbers over the phone and were told that pickup from our hotel would be at 8:30-8:45 am.   We made sure to be downstairs, ready, and visible from the street. The bus arrive within that allocated time. The bus driver called out my friend's name and we boarded. There were a bunch of others already picked up, and we picked up a few others along the way.  We made a pit stop for bathroom and food about an hour in. The bus driver was super friendly, passionate about his job, and accommodating of passengers' requests. He gave us a lengthy and useful history of the major landmarks, the towns we passed, the important people and what made them significant, and of course much information about LBJ and his wife, Lady Bird.  We stopped by the Boyhood Home of LBJ, the Texas White House on the LBJ Ranch, and saw many animals including longhorns up close and personal. We also got to check out the Air Force One-Half, the plane in which LBJ flew.   We stopped by Fredericksburg TX for 2 hours to enjoy Main Street and have lunch. The pickup spot was easy to find. It's a huge bus after all!  We also stopped by Luckenbach, a small centralized area of land in a town with a history of music and German migrants.   We opted not to stop at the optional winery based on another majority vote.   We were driven back right near where we were picked up and were back to our hotel around 6pm."

                "description": "My family and I booked this tour through an offer with Costco travel... it was not what I expected. In fact, the description was very vague and slightly misleading. Nevertheless, we toured Texas Hill Country and it was a good time. Definitely oriented more towards adults (my 15 year old brother was BORED). The day got a late start which put us behind schedule the entire tour. The driver appeared the be in training and the communication between him and his trainer was poor. But other than that, it was enjoyable! Great way to see LBJ Ranch, Fredericksburg, and Luckenbach all in a day."

                "description": "My husband and I took the LBJ tour. This tour could be 5 stars, but the one we took today was barely a 3-star.  Enjoyable things - the trip itself - there were only three of us and the scenery was nice.  The van stoped at the childhood home as well as the \"Texas Whitehouse\" home of LBJ with tours of both.  It also stopped in Fredericksburg for lunch.    The issues:  1. The driver isn't trained to know anything about the trip.  There are canned recordings that often don't line up with where we are.  Questions to the driver are answered with \"I am not sure but maybe...\"    2. For some reason, we had to switch vans midway.  The second van was very noisy (the engine as well as the rattling of the door) and you could not hear the recording at all.  Also the cover for the air conditioner on the top of the car flew off.  We retrieved it, but it was broken and the air conditioner stopped working.  It was up to almost 100 degrees in the van by the time we got back to San Antonio.  If GrayLine took the time to train their drivers to do the commentary (with a speaker system that could be heard) AND ensured their vans worked well, this tour would be a 5 star.  Apparently, the van the day before (a different one from both of the ones we were in) also lost its air conditioning too.    Definitely better than the hot, and crowded amusement parks!"

It was great to sit back, relax, and be toted around the Texas Hill Country. Each stop was somewhere I wouldn't have thought to stop at on my own, but I'm so glad for each stop! The only reason I didn't leave 5 stars is because we had a late start, and somewhat poor communication about the delay. Once we got rolling though, it was a great experience! I would definitely do something like this again."

                "description": "My husband and I were in town for a wedding and decided to arrive a day early to take the Texas Hill Country and LBJ Ranch Tour from San Antonio.  Our driver and tour guide was Ray.  He was friendly and knowledgeable.  He was fun and quick witted, which we enjoyed.  Ray was great and overall we give him five stars.  There were a total of ten of us on the tour, which was a nice size. I do think it was too much to pack into one tour.  There could easily be an LBJ tour on its's own and another tour of Frederick and Luchenback.  I don't think we had enough time to spend at the LBJ Museum and probably could have used more time at the LBJ Ranch.  In Fredericksburg there are two museums, shopping, and Das Peach Haus.  Das Peach Haus is own for wine tasting, gourmet sampling, and peach cobbler.  It is in a wonderful location.  Outside has nice sitting areas.  We bought some delicious sauce and peach cobbler to go but had to race if we wanted to get through the Pioneer Museum.    Our group was given the choice of how much time to spend at each location but I wish this tour we would have provided specific times.  There is too much to do on this tour and in reality it is two tours in one.  My husband and I returned on Sunday to visit the National Museum of the Pacific War (it takes about five hours to complete).  I would suggest to Gray Line Tours to split these tours."

She provided this great customer service for just a couple of mini bottles while also directing the long lines (that were moving pretty fast) and making sure one of the employees took her lunch break by closing the line without ruffling any feathers. Her positive attitude was such an inspiration during the crazy holiday shopping. Thank you, Alda, and merry Christmas!"

Score on that count.Total Success!  In this Total, the restrooms are at the back of the store instead of as you enter. It's not something one intentionally seeks out at a liquor store, but I've had the need on more than one occasion. Unfortunately, in this case, it's a matter of out-of-sight is out-of-mind, as I found the men's room a bit dirty and ragged around noon on a Friday--far too early in the day to be due to foot traffic alone. That's in stark contrast to the Total near me with its sparkling, nearly spotless restrooms. If that aspect doesn't seem important to you, remember they hold tastings here. Their brand ambassadors can only be as clean as the facilities in which they clean up.  Then again, alcohol kills most germs, so party on! Four stars, and TOTALLY recommended!"

It really see any wine cellar controls in place so I sort of in my mind question how they ship store and control the quality of high dollar bottles so they don't skunk- or have any other issues.   For my purposes and my visit, this store was an unexpected visit but I had been wanting to try it out for awhile.  I was met with friendly staff, and an overwhelming selection of wines and beer.  At about every corner I was met with staff inquiring what I was looking for.  Wine tasting, a huge room for what I assume to be classes and finally a cold and shelf temp beer selection were all cleanly arranged and accompanied with more than adequate signage.    If we speak of selection, I would really like to have seen a better selection of German wine from the Pfalz region.  There is an abundant amount of wine that is from a wine drinking standpoint \"must try\".  But, I do not see them in any stores around."

Honestly it felt like half the beer that TW Cedar Park and South Austin have.  Wines fared much better, but still lacking some of the offerings we typically find elsewhere.

Not just wines or beers, but whiskey and tequila and such. Once I was offered absinthe and the man giving out the samples was the business owner all the way from Oregon! It was like a reverse Oregon-trail, I told him after the sample.  Selection is not what I expect from Total Wine, I have shopped at their locations across the U.S. and this is the least I have experienced. Some of it might be due to Texas Law, as I asked why other stores (such as in Houston) can't ship to this location, and I was told it was Texas law.   A perfect place to pick up mainstream beers and wines, as well as to try the samples (I think they have a schedule for the tastings)."

Total wine not only had more Shinner varieties they also had a bigger and better beer selection. I think they had a better selection of everything period. The staff interaction was pleasant but they didn't have a lot of people on the floor to help you while you were shopping. The other issue I had was actually getting out of the store. They have the doors blocked off to force you to go through a checkout line. This is an issue if you don't need to check out but have to squeeze through people just to leave. Other than that go here over Spec's."

This place has everything what every whisky,tequila,Vodka,Wine drinker and much much more and don't forget the accessories but they got your back on that too. Friendly service and even tho I was just walking around drooling over all the stuff they have I didn't feel out of place I felt welcome. I am closer to the Rim location and hopefully that one is just as good or even better. Next time when I looking for a particular sprit or something that's associated with alcohol I will defiantly come here."

Our tour guide was BJ and he not only make sure everything ran smoothly, but he also let us know about a bunch of cool spots to visit along the hill country! He made sure we were taken care of, he was very personable, and he made sure we had a good time. He also had a pretty good playlist! Texas winos allows you to tour and taste at 3 wineries and you also get a meal! The Italian dinner we had was so good. They also have several discounts! Definitely use Texas winos for your tours of wineries or breweries."

                "description": "3.5 Stars  When I think of the fine art of wine drinking I always defer to Alexander Payne's film, \"Sideways.\" While I did like that movie it has never really inspired me to partake in the vino. Not in the way it has inspired that industry. Nonetheless I never discount the passion of that specific community. As a craft beer enthusiast I try to keep an open mind and an open palate.   So I was invited to attend this event with my partner in crime. Both of us are novice wine drinkers. Did this bias my review? I tend to think any experience can supersede or dash our expectations by its own weight. Typically Texas Winos does a bus tour where you visit different wineries. This particular festival was held in of all places a civic center meant for wedding receptions, birthday parties and quinceañeras. Personally I have no qualms attending an event at a muddy field, a dive bar or at a boujee affair. I'm wondering if attendees were disappointed by the not so upscale provisions?  You purchase tickets online. It's slightly cheaper the earlier you buy them. You pick a time slot, which are in two hour increments. This is mainly to control the size of the wine demos, but I'll come back to this point later. When you check in you are given a sheet with all the wineries participating. You go to each table with accompanying wines and each label does their spiel. The manner in which sample tastings were handled confused me.   Basically couples of two, a group of friends  and a few stragglers at a time would go through a demo rotation. Some stations had multiple wines, thus you would have to wait awhile before you got to any tastings. Once you went through each offering: chardonnay, pinot grigio, merlot, white, red, rosè, etc. you would be done. Which in hindsight probably did keep the lines at a minimum. However you would be in one line and a group of twenty friends would camp out, with little regard that others were there for the same reason.   In addition I felt there was little time to process each pour. You couldn't move on to the next style of wine without first finishing your sample. Which felt like a class moving sometimes in rhythm but most times at a snail's pace. For the most part demos were very informative. Surprisingly the wines I liked best were done by presenters who served as gracious hosts. But there were a few who were so snooty, to serve me was to undermine their vineyard.  Speaking as a craft beer enthusiast I understand every drinking community has its own set of implied manners. At this event what subtracted from my experience was having ultra pushy festivalgoers. For example I was in one line in the midst of a tasting and some arbitrary dude tapped me on my shoulder to move. In another whilst an owner was presenting her wines \"homeboy\" asserted himself, completely ruining my experience. You would be waiting in one line and people from nowhere would impolitely cut in. Is this typical behavior at a wine festival?  As a beer drinker my credo is to \"To drink and to let drink.\" Not to say there is complete civility and organization within the craft beer community. It's just that I left feeling a bit hollow. Yes, lines were kept to a minimum but after the rotation the experience felt anticlimactic. I will say one bright spot was a festivalgoer, named Lauren who was having way too much fun. She offered her suggestions on which wines to try. I wish her friendly spirit would've been sprinkled on the crowd that day.   I think if you like wine and want to get sauced for a reasonable price I say this event is for you. It's interesting that a grape, a peach or a strawberry for that matter when fermented can make you tipsy. With alcohol beverage volumes at 12 percent and up I don't expect you to be doing the, \"Achy Breaky Heart\" perfectly. I'm trying hard to be open minded about wine and maybe I will find one that suits me. But a scene where people are too egocentric, classy gals drop sample glasses and there's no variation in flavors between samples. Well I guess I'm doomed to be a beer guy. Tear."

                "description": "So let me tell you, I thought I was happy and satisfied as a customer of Texas Winos, but I am not. So let's start at the beginning.  My wife's friend was having a birthday and wanted to do a wine tasting tour with a bunch of friends. So we all decided to get a groupon and go with Texas Winos. When you buy the groupon, you still have to go to their website and register and pay a fee ($72 for both my wife and myself). Everything went smooth until we received an email that there was an issue with processing the payment and that we were most likely affected. The issue was that the processor for their credit card had mistakenly changed the decimal point, so we were charged $720 instead of $72. That's a HUUUUGE difference.  So after I emailed Richard Wino, he said the problem was being taken care of and that they will be processing the correct amount. 1 day later, we get ANOTHER charge for $720 on our credit card, so now our credit card shows that we paid $1440 to Texas Winos.  I emailed Richard Wino again and told him the situation. He responded quickly and stated that he is going to cancel all of the transactions and they weren't going to charge us for the $72 either. Richard Wino even offered to give us complimentary tickets to another even because of the errors. My wife and I were delighted and told him we would love to go to the Wino Fest in November and he said he would take care of it. Well, he didn't.  It took about 1 month to get the refund on my credit card. Really slow compared to how fast they took $720 from my credit card TWICE. And even after going through all that, I thought it was ok since they were being nice and apologetic and offered us complimentary tickets to another event. BUT, we never received our complimentary tickets to another event! I know they're free, but what bothers me is that they went back on their word, and THEY STOPPED RESPONDING TO MY EMAILS after the amounts were corrected. I tried emailing Richard Wino a few times since the end of October when we were told that the WINO FEST HAD BEEN RESCHEDULED AND THEY FORGOT TO NOTIFY US (But we never received tickets or anything to begin with). I know that they were free tickets offered and shouldn't be petty, but when someone goes back on their word and stops responding to emails, it bothers me. What if I had been charged the $1440 and he never responded or even attempted to correct the situation? I am attaching emails which have time stamps of the conversations   PS. The tour bus driver and guide were awesome. That's the only reason I'm giving them a 2 star instead of a 1 Star"

                "description": "Previously went on a tour in 2018/2019 timeframe and we loved it! Went again last month and it was a COMPLETELY different experience. We had about 20 minutes at each place. Felt extremely rushed. Not once were we told what type of wine we were drinking or how to drink it (like you expect at a tasting). At two of the stops we didn't even have time to buy a bottle because the line was too large and the bus would leave us. The driver/host got lost on the way to the wineries twice which added 2 hours to our drive time. We calculated it later and we were on the bus for 6.5 hours and we only had 1.25 hour(s) between all the places. We ended up getting off the bus at 8pm just exhausted from all the driving. We would have been better just getting a bus ticket to a neighboring state and just bringing wine on that drive lol. It's sad because this tour used to be fun and informative with a good sit down tasting at each venue. Now it is just poorly run and communicated. I would not recommend this tour anymore. Also we met three other couples on this tour. They all had been on previous ones with this company and they all were saying the same things we were. They honestly should have just refunded this tour. Maybe we were just a one off bad tour, but I wouldn't give this place another try unless they guaranteed a better experience. It was just awful all around."

                "description": "We purchased the Groupon for Texas Winos and we had a great time. We arrived at the restaurant @ La Cantera and had a little delay with our departure waiting on a few. No biggie but it did reduce our time at the wineries. We visited 3 wineries. FAT ASS was probably the best one. Their watermelon wine was a hit with our group. 290 Vinery had some great dessert wines. Purchased a strawberry riesling here which was delicious.  We had a great tour guide. The music was dated and not much of a mix but he was able to change some of the music as the day went on. There were a couple of us who were celebrating birthdays. Do bring snacks with you to eat. The BBQ at Vino was just ok. Nothing to write home about. I would purchase a groupon again for this but int feel full price is worth it."

                "description": "Horrible horrible horrible. I never like to write reviews like this but I just had to. I booked an event with all my friends for my bday. Even before it all started, there was no communication what so ever. I received an automated email the week before saying we would get detailed emails about our event on certain days but they never came until finally the night before after I sent multiple emails asking what was going on. Richard also finally sent my brother an itinerary (after asking for it multiple times). Our set departure time was 1pm but my brother received an itinerary that said our first stop is for 11:45am. When my brother asked him about that, Richard never responded. Every email we received all said 1pm. So we just stuck with what we had agreed to from the beginning since Richard never responded. Forget trying to call, you will never get to talk to someone. The next day, the day of the event I get a call from the driver saying they've been waiting for us saying we were supposed to leave at 11. Apparently Richard gave us the wrong time. It was a chaotic morning trying to resolve things. We were able to still leave at our promised time but because of this, we were rushed on all of our stops and did not even get to see live music which was something I was very excited about. As disappointed as I was, I am even more furious at the fact that I'm being ignored. No ownership of the mistake is taking place at all. No call to apologize for a trip we paid for but did not get what was included in the package. Sent out multiple emails and of course, no response. Who runs a business like this? I totally understand things happen, mistakes happen but make it right! At least a simple acknowledgment, something! Waste of money. Don't ever book through this company."

I was concerned that it might be too strenuous but you had the freedom to walk as much as you wanted or simply hang out in some really beautiful vineyards. The wine offered was really diverse and I would definitely visit each winery on its own. Coby was a great guide, he kept everyone on an even keel, even as the winner flowed. He was fun and engaging during trips aaaaand catered to a wide variety of tastes. Bella was also awesome as a driver, I felt safe the whole time. Would definitely recommend! Would also recommend getting the groupon deal to save a bit of money so you can pick up a few bottles on the way. Being a little more water than you think you'll need, and dress comfortably. Great time!"

The tour felt very family-run - our guide Jordan (who is a hoot) and our driver David were so genuinely friendly and we felt like we got to know them as friends, not just workers.  It's about an hour shuttle ride and Jordan made sure we were entertained with some funny videos, good music, and some jokes.  We had the perfect amount of guidance at each winery and some autonomy so we could wander or relax without feeling like we were on a tour the entire time. It is a full day after all. Jordan was always around to chat or answer questions. You spend about an hour or more at each stop and it was the perfect amount of time.   At the last stop, Jordan made sure to get me a birthday sangria shot from Fat Ass winery which was delicious. I really felt like we celebrated my birthday without being obnoxious/taking over the entire tour.   The busses are really comfortable. On the way back, we played a trivia game and the winner won a bottle of wine!"

                "description": "So I have mixed feeling about our experience. First off it felt like some wineries were not prepared and decided to take us on last minute especially Mendelbaum and the second one in town. Mendelbaum were so rude. I would have rather done 2 wineries and spent an hour downtown enjoying the shops. Tour guide was fun I don't know how much control he had over the day but he tried. The last winery was the best one with friendly staff that were so cool laughing and joking with us. I think they were called Tejas winery. Overall the bus ride was so fun bc we had fun people on there ! Everyone was ready for a small escape and we enjoyed each others company!"

                "description": "I first have to start out by saying that we had a really great time on our winery tour. We ended up meeting a great group of people and we all made it fun.   We purchased vouchers through Groupon to redeem through the Winos website. Groupon does not state anywhere that there is an additional fee of $31 per person for the wine tastings - so be aware of that when you book. We booked a winery tour with a private 3 course brunch at a winery with a surprise bonus stop.   Starting our tour, our first visit was to a brewery. We purchased the winery tour so we figured maybe this was our surprise bonus stop. We ended up having lunch here with only sandwich and chips options or a salad option. This was not the brunch we intended on.   Our 3 winery visits were great. Fat Ass was definitely our favorite as to how lively and fun loving the owner was for our group! Texas Hills was great as well because the owner gave great explanations and stories behind his wines and winery. 290 Vinery was less interactive but had great wine options.   Phillip tried to be a good host. He talked himself in circles, could not command the group's attention ever and maybe drank a little too much while on the job.  We will consider other companies before booking another wine tour with this company."

                "description": "I'm a bit conflicted about the experience. First of all, our guide Taylor was amazing!! He was entertaining and definitely laid down some ground rules that made everyone on the bus feel welcome, comfortable and most importantly, ready to have fun! He set a great tone for the rest of the trip.  The tour itself was just ok. It felt like we wasted a lot of time just getting to the 1st winery, Messina Hof, which was also the best winery of the 3 in terms of service, ambiance and wine quality! We wasted about 10-15 min waiting for someone, got a bit lost in a parking lot for a while trying to pick up the second group, then hit some traffic, etc. The 2nd winery was a bit strange as we were ushered into a dance hall serving Italian food. The wines were not great (food was decent) but we also received such small pours that it was hard to tell. Definitely felt like a tourist trap. The last winery was an Israeli winery. They definitely didn't seem prepared for large groups and the people working there weren't very pleasant or friendly, mostly overwhelmed. It wasn't a fun experience. Given the long lines, you almost had to get a tasting and get back in line while drinking.   Some suggestions 1. The same tours from Austin were also visiting the same wineries. Are there really not more than 3 wineries in the area so you could spread out some of the crowd? Places like the Israeli winery definitely weren't prepared or staffed appropriately. 2. Better winery selection. I would almost rather have stayed and just hung out at Messina Hof with a bottle and a boxed lunch than visit the other 2 wineries.  3. I felt like we had time to fit in a 4th winery but we ended up leaving pretty early and headed back.  4. With a Groupon deal, we ended up paying $75-80 per person. It's nice to not have to worry about drinking and driving but I definitely expected higher qualities wineries."

                "description": "I always look for bus or walking tours when visiting new places. It's always a great way to learn about the city. This bus tour was really great. I recommend you do one full loop before trying the hop-on/hop-off option, so you can see which locations you want to see.  Our tour guide, BC, was hilarious and really made the tour fun. There was a lot to see in San Antonio and the bus route made sure to stop at all the popular tourist areas!  Note: Wear comfortable shoes and bring dollar bills to tip your tour guides."

None of which particularly really wowed me. Some tidbits I did learn...Didn't know LBJ got married down there or Johnny Cash met his first wife at a HS down there.    They do have water for you at stop 19, but no popcorn like website says (stopped after covid).   Bathrooms are in the fudge shop next door. Not the cleanest, but you do have the sugar aroma."

                "description": "Zero stars should really be a thing. This was the worst bus tour we have done in any City we have visited.  The buses are broken down. One didn't have air conditioning. One smelled of fumes so bad that it has to have an exhaust link. Another died at almost every stop and start on the route. There are numerous detours throughout the tour that they knew about ahead of time but the drivers pretended these were a new thing.  They had combined several stops together making more than 1/4 of the stops inaccessible. The audio tour didn't match up to the drive. The promised statement of being past each stop every 20 minutes is a lie. The whole thing was a general disaster. I called to get a refund. The man on the phone was great and apologetic. He gave me instructions to email to get a refund. I emailed them and was told that I couldn't get a refund as we didn't buy the tickets from them directly. We bought the tickets at the shop immediately to the left of the stand. The one with the EXACT same signage. I said this in my reply email but have yet to hear anything. We spent $250 on this tour. I will never use this tour company again. Stay far far away."

                "description": "One of our favorite things to do when we visit a new town is to take a tour bus that will acquaint us with some fun locations and introduce us to the city. So we scheduled the hop-on-hop off bus tour for early in our stay.  We found the stops to be a little underwhelming. Some of them take you to touristy places that you'd expect (The Alamo, Pearl, La Villita, etc.) and other stops felt a little forced. Random streets or restaurants that appear to have no real attraction other than perhaps a deal that a business made with the bus company to put a stop there.  The experience also varies depending on which driver you get. Over the course of our three days, we rode on several busses and found that Kat was by far the most entertaining and engaging. She sang along with the songs, cracked jokes and interacted with the guests. Other drivers hit a pre-recorded track and just drove. I do appreciate that each driver was able to modify the script a bit to match their personality, but some really could have done more to liven it up.  Overall, I'd give this tour three stars due to the inconsistency of the drivers and the strange stops. But Kat was so fun that she earned the company an extra star. She really went out of her way to make our trip fun and memorable."

                "description": "I took this tour on 2/21/2022.  I booked the ticket on-line for 48 hours.  Loved that it was half a block from the Menger Hotel where I was staying.  That said, the man driving the bus at noon was the best!  Music, great info, nice voice!  I gave him a good tip!  When I visit cities anywhere I am hooked on these buses.  They hit all the \"high spots\" and I never rent a car.  The key to these is riding the route first, get the information on each stop, then decide which ones you want to visit.  I stopped at the \"Pearl\" and visited the Emma Hotel on Monday; went back for second visit on Tuesday, 2/22/22, my birthday and had lunch at the \"Mon Chou Chou\".  Wee, Wee, French Bistro. Lastly, some businesses in San Antonio are closed on Monday and Tuesday. It did not, however, spoil this tour for me."

                "description": "So sad I can't give zero stars. The company is very UN-environmentally friendly as the print thousands of schedules they don't follow. We were on the north side of town and the bus was 20 minutes late, or so we thought. Next thing we knew the driver turned off the mapped route and didn't reappear for another 20 minutes (I assume a coffee stop). Bus number 903. As we had walked to the corner to see if he was coming we weren't at the sign, although we waved to flag him down as soon as he turned the corner and saw no one at the stop he hit the gas. We had to walk almost a mile into town to see if we could get a refund-not looking good. Much better to give you money to the numerous vagabond milling about than this company."

                "description": "This is a pretty good way to explore San Antonio's downtown and find out what is available. We bought the two day pass with the hop-on-hop-off feature. Our first trip we rode the entire route to see what was available. They driver, Jack, did an amazing job of giving us some history and pointing out extra elements. He had a small bit of the tour recorded, but it was mostly live.  After we decided what we wanted to go back to we rode 3 other times. The other drivers were nice, but none compared to Jack.   Even though they say the buses are air conditioned, it doesn't hold up to Texas summer heat. Sitting on the lower level gave a little relief, but not much. The upper level is a neat experience, but I would definitely recommend spring or fall to give it a try."

We took a wheelchair as she can't walk far distances. It took you to all of the good places to see. The top of the bus had much better views and you could tell what the narrative was talking about. No air up top but they had a cover and it wasn't bad for July. Of course my Mom couldn't climb the stairs so her and my sister stayed down below in the mild air conditioning."

                "description": "Horrible, horrible, horrible.  Paid $50 to do a upper open level bus tour of San Antonio. Dirty bus broke down 2 days in a row according to the driver.  Waited twenty minutes to get on at main Alamo location to get good seat on top only to break down 10 minutes into trip.  Took over 30 minutes to get a replacement bus less than 2 miles from main location only to be almost full on arrival???  It was a free for all and the twenty plus people already waiting forever raced to get on that one.  Then it took another 25 min for second bus????  Driver and office seemed upset that anyone would complain and frankly didn't care.  Person answering phone said \"I am an hourly employee\" so what do you want me to do????  I want a manager to get involved and solve the situation!  Instead, the manager tells at the driver on walk-in talkie why is that guy complaining?  What the heck, bus #902 and this whole company is broken down.  PS, they gave us an email we could complain to and request a refund, wow!  Update, replacement bus broke down 15 min later at outdoor market....driver acknowledged replacement bus was having mechanical issues prior day???? I am telling you, this company is a joke.  Driver had no answers other than another bus will come along soon and did not give a S_ _ T that about 8 of us were screwed twice.  I could have walked farther in the 2.0 minutes the bus actually operated.  Horrible!"

John \"Pineapple\" was our driver - and he was great!! Super-friendly, gave us lots of good tips of places to go and eat.  In fact, ALL the drivers (we had a 2-day pass) were friendly and helpful.

We only wanted to see one thing off of the bus so we rode to it and got off.   When we first got on at stop 1, Jesel was on the bus, I guess as a hostess or something.  She was super nice.   The driver for our first leg was BC.   He mixed up recordings and live speaking and was very clear on the stops.   His narration was informative and entertaining.    Our second leg was 180 degrees.  We could not hear the driver very well at all from the back of the bus.  I was following along on the map and planned to get off the bus at #18.   He stopped at #17 and was talking but we could not hear him.  he then drove right by #18.   He tried to say that #17 was #18 but I'm not buying it.  We got on at #13 and there's no way he made 5 stops before the final stop at #19(aka #1) plus I was looking at the map and knew where we were.  I think he was just taking short cuts.  Your experience will vary wildly depending on where you sit and who your driver is."

Ended up buying them from the boat company directly as we had already been in line for 45 minutes when we found this out so the online combo is no bargain.  At the bus boarding spot the online voucher wasn't good. We have to go across the street to get tickets printed. Tried to get on the bus and we were given the wrong tickets.

Anyone can have a bad day, but under cooked fries and a cold burger? This is what you're known for. Burger and fries. I've suggested for years yall have a beer menu. It's hard to see what you have back there.  I'll be back."

You pay separately for each item which is costly. If I have one thing to say that would like to see changed is either the size of the bread or the patty. The patty is not thick enough to accommodate the size of the bread. Too much bun for me!"

                "description": "The company logo was like a throwback to Happy Days reruns, so I was very happy to walk in to an ambience of jukebox style 50's music. Yay! I was born in the late 70's, but who doesn't enjoy being transported to an era where we can imagine life was a little slower, a little more private and moments were meant to be embraced in the present and not social media.  Ordered the double cheeseburger - I asked for it well done and it was still juicy. After I ordered, I realized it was probably a bit too big for my appetite but I sure did eat it all - it was too juicy not to. :-) I really liked the buns they used for burger too. I'll admit, I'm not sure if it was poppy seeds on top or something else, but whatever it was, the buns were fresh, soft and tasty. Complemented the burger well. I'll find out next time what the bun is.  Who doesn't love freshly cut fires with the skin on? Salted and fried to perfection. Crunchy and soft at the same time. The regular size was a prefect portion.  Oh, this place also has a great peppermint malt shake. Yum! I can do peppermint all year long, so glad they had it well into the new year. They should have it all year - why not?   Location also has several TVs in great spots so you don't miss your favorite team while enjoying a good-old-fashioned burger, fries and malt."

They have terrible customer service and didn't smile once. I had never been before so I didn't know how the fries and drinks worked wether they came separately or not and they were rude and not helpful at all. The busser was absolutely amazing and should receive a raise! He was so kind, our friend left her wallet and he ran out and gave it to us in the parking lot. So so so sweet!"

                "description": "I came here during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the dining room was closed. They seem a bit under-equipped to do take-out orders. I ordered a cheeseburger and hamburger patties a la carte, medium rare. After picking up my order and driving for a few minutes, I noticed the paper bag was leaking and the grease was getting all over my car. I later realized this was because they packed the hamburger patties *swimming* in pan sauce, with nothing in the foam container to keep it from dripping everywhere. I understand that medium rare meats release juices after cooking, but they should have used an air-tight container or put something in the container to absorb the juices.  To make matters worse, I called them to let them know about this issue with their to-go orders. The lady who answered was rude and disinterested in speaking with me. No apology was issued for how the order was packaged and no thank you for notifying them.  I just cannot see myself coming here again during the pandemic. The food was decent but not worth the customer service or the messy packaging."

From the first sight of the menu and the website to the smells as I entered I thought it was going to be Amazing! Worst thing about this place is the staff. Very rude, didn't even welcome us, barly spoke to us, we got snipped at twice, two other people just while we were there got basically Yelled at for masks. Things that could of been handled so differently were not handled well. The burgers and onion rings were darn good but the patty size thickness is very underwhelming. Could of just been a bad day they were having who knows but I prob won't be going back."

I liked the traditional ordering, makes you feel like you're ordering from a small country town restaurant. The burger was pretty good, it did lack a taaaaadddd bit of flavor buuuut!!! It did hit the spot! Fries looked homemade and crispy, needed a bit of salt or spice but overall pretty good. Little sister got the kids chicken basket, it came with the same crispy homemade fries and a free kids ice cream. The chicken nuggets were little dinosaurs kinda cute but also looked store bought. Overall it was reasonably priced, I'm looking for a place that will really hit the spot and I can brag about to all my reviews about ."

                "description": "Chester's is our go to local burger joint. It was one of our first local burger places in the big city of San Antonio. Years later, it still fills my craving.   We often order double cheeseburger and split it, this way we get a \"whole\" burger patty w/o the additional bread. Definitely my hubby's favorite onion rings are from Chesters. Their fries are fresh cut, sometimes they can be a little soggy but its just one of the things that you get used to. Sometimes the burgers are a little greasy, but when they are perfect- they make my heart happy.   The do also have good hot dog- who would have known(?).   They have an incredible selection of bottled/canned beer, some wine (upset that they stopped selling sangria in a bottle).   You order at the counter, they call out your name and you pick up your delish food. On a beautiful day/night, they will roll up the windows. They usually have whatever game is playing that day.   They also have shakes and malts made to order.   You either love it or not, but they must be doing something right since they several locations and have been around a long time now."

                "description": "Your diatribe does not acknowledge the following: I called at 11:00 when you just opened; I ordered 2 well done burgers and was told by \"Krystal\", the order would be ready on 15 minutes; and the burgers were not ready until 11:30.  If you want to leave customers hanging for 15 minutes, that is a serious flaw in your customer service. If it takes you 30 minutes to prepare burgers at 11am, when you just opened, you need to inform your customers it's a 30 minutes wait, not 15 minutes!!!  Your continued excuse for the delay is freshness is unacceptable. Man up and accept responsibility. And by the way, there are numerous other establishments that serve hot, fresh food products, and do not misrepresent the time for preparedness. I will take your advise and go elsewhere for better burgers; I value my time."

If you are looking for a good burger place, would high suggest! I will say it - for me, the burgers here are much better tasting than Whataburger and In-n-Out. The portions of the burger is filling, delicious, and full of flavor. I would say however, because the burger is larger in size, the price is a tad bit higher. I ordered a cheeseburger, salad, and tea and it was about $15. But it was worth it!  Also, for you newcomers, this is the type of restaurant that you place your order first and seat yourself. I like the decor of the place and the authentic feel. I will definitely come here again!"

This most recent time, we got the Margherita pizza. It wasn't my favorite pizza I've had here, but it was decent. It was done a little differently than this type of pizza I've had in the past. Instead of slices of mozzarella, it covered the entire pizza.  I do love their ranch dressing. I'm not sure if it's made in house, but it does taste like it is. Their salads are tasty every time. We always get one. And the beer selection!!! They have an amazing beer selection. Something for everyone."

I've never placed an order To Go until tonight. Honestly, I expected great food since my dine in experience had been good but cold pizza and burnt wings and limp veggie sticks...not okay. For having spent 60+ dollars, my whole family and I are/were disappointed."

Then something went \"sideways\"!  Last summer we received a \"blonde bottomed, cold pizza courtesy of \"Hunger, no such thing as a Rush\".   Looking to see if things had been fixed and a non marinara based pizza, we decided to give them another try.   70 minutes later, we received a Luke warm pizza and the insult of a receipt with an \"extra\" tip blank and puppy dog eyes of the driver!  I am now officially done with PI and Hunger whatever!"

                "description": "The Owner of this establishment has refused to pay me wages for hours worked. I ended my employment with this establishment back in December of last year and since that time I have made repeated attempts to obtain compensation for hours worked. Terry who is a manager and apparently one of the individuals tasked to remedy this issue is always \"busy\" or \"with a vendor\" when I try to call for resolution. Every other member of the management team has refused to even speak with me on the phone or says of the owner that \"if he doesn't think it has anything to do with him he will just ignore it.\" One manager always puts it off on the next and for months now they have refused to compensate me fairly for my time. The business sent me a tax form indicating they paid me wages last year but refuses to actually pay me what they reported to the IRS in addition to compensation owed for hours worked that would fall under this years earnings timeframe. . According to other current employees of the restaurant the owner has a pattern of refusing to pay owed wages to employees after they have quit. I have gone in person and called multiple times a week in an effort to resolve this issue. I am always polite, courteous and respectful  when I call and leave messages however even my best attempts at a fair , reasonable, peaceful and efficient resolution to this issue have been ignored completely. I would discourage anyone and everyone to avoid working or patronizing a business who is owned by individuals who lack basic integrity and fail to maintain fair business practices with regard to their current and former employees. I am usually the biggest advocate for supporting local businesses but this business significantly fails to exhibit the level of customer care and service that should be expected when allowed to operate in our community. I am in the process of filing a complaint with the department of labor for recovery of unpaid wages. Hopefully they will have better luck than I have. Today the employee that I spoke with when I called and asked to speak with a manager called this employers lack of initiative to resolve this issue \"pathetic\" litterally said by someone currently working for them if thats any indication of the lack of integrity maintained by this business and its owner."

When speaking to the manager on the condition of said pizza, their reply is \"well you accepted it, so there is nothing I can do\". I have ordered pizza from Pizza Italia for more than 5 years and never been treated like this nor had this bad of pizza. Proves that the bigger you get the quality goes to s**t. We will be happy to take our business elsewhere. At over $25 plus tip per pizza you would think that quality control would be part of the service. Guess I was mistaken."

We waited there for 10-15 minutes for a server which never came to our booth. We decided to leave since no one was interested in serving my wife and me. This was on a Thursday around 3:30 pm.

We went to see Santa at the mall and this was a close convenient location for the chain. We were set right away, but then didn't get greeted for about 10 minutes. Our waitress was nice but pretty aloof. She got our drink order (and chips and salsa) then vanished. We watched our frozen drinks melt at the bar. Finally I just got up myself and asked the bartender if they were ours (they were) and served them to us myself. The fajitas I ordered were sizzling, but way over cooked. My husbands sandwich had frozen turkey. My daughters sliders were good. Not the service we are used to at the forum location so we will not return here again."

Fast forward to today 10/09/20 called in the order and explained what happened 09/11/20, the employee over the phone stated Chili's will not honor this! We don't give away free food. Free food? We are not asking for free food! I wasnt even able to eat the meal purchased on 9/11/20. The employee said there is nothing he will do about it.

                "description": "Food was good.  Service was bad. I left my phone at home and the other two in my party were Senior Citizens so we asked for hard copies of the menu.  Our second waitress brought us one menu and said the manager said we could only have one per table.  The menu was in Spanish and when we told the waitress, she said it just looked that way!!! We told her to get us a different one anyway. So we got a third waiter instead. He greeted us and was ready to take our order.  We said we need menus.  He brought us ONE and said the manager said only one per table. After we had to ask for utensils, the rest of the meal went fine. The manager came out and listened to our complaints and said the one menu per table was from higher up.  I've had other issues with the service at this location and I don't think I will return. Even if I liked the food, this disregard for those without technology abilities left a bad taste in my mouth."

                "description": "Chili's is gonna be Chili's no matter where you go. The only different may be the service. This Chili's is one of their more consistent places and I can appreciate that. The service was good, we were seated quickly and our server was very attentive.   My vegetarian self loves to order the guacamole burger with a black bean patty. I really adore this burger. The only thing that messes it up is when they over cook the patty. It's kind of like a coin toss of if it's cooked right or not but most times I'd bet that it's cooked right. For my one side I will order a side a broccoli when I'm feeling health conscious but I do get fries from time to time and they are great as well.   With this meal I ordered dessert and OHHHHH MY GOSH I was super happy I did!! I got the salted caramel molten cake and this is some last meal type ish! Like if I had to plan a last meal the salted caramel molten cake would be the dessert.  It was amazing and worth every calorie and the extra running time I put in for it."

                "description": "Twice now my wife and I have called this Chili's off 410 at Broadway on the near north side of San Antonio as we are getting off the freeway.  We ask what the wait is for a party of two and are told there is no wait.  We turn under the Loop and pull into their parking lot.  We enter the restaurant where we then find out it's a thirty minute wait.  What the !?  I don't believe in the less than two minutes it takes us to reach them they filled up that fast.  I guess they just say whatever to get you in thinking you'll stay and wait.  Hey, I like Chili's but we are not returning.  For options try the newly reopened Mama's - where we went tonight - which is nearby or the even closer La Fonda.  Nuts!  I'm not going to play their games."

Props also to the samples everywhere of beer and tequila makes looking for booze that much easier.  This place has an epic deli as well and they sell fresh pickles which is always legit. The beer section was small in comparison to other specs but they make up for it with the deli.   Things I would do: promote the October beers in a certain section. Had to go looking for them and that took some work, other than that great place!"

                "description": "Have you ever been the one tasked with bringing wine to a dinner party, even though you don't know jack about wine?  Well if you have (or if you ever are), this is the place for you.  I was told to bring a \"moscato,\" but when I arrived at Spec's, I realized there were half a dozen types of it.  d'Asti, pink, black, dessert, bubbly, etc.  I was like WTH do I do? Fortunately, Spec's has plenty of wine experts on staff and they bailed me out.  Then, my next question was \"should it be served chilled or at room temp?\"  They said \"it depends.\"  I decided on chilled, and they directed me to this barrel full of water that magically chills the bottle in seven minutes.  It's pure witchcraft folks, but it's free, so check it out.  I'm still in total awe of this magical barrel full of water.  P.S. don't forget that this Spec's location has a deli in the back that's good for lunch.  See my previous review for a few details.  The food is really good.  Why four stars instead of five?  Because they charge a penalty for using credit cards.  They try to convince you that it's a \"discount\" if you pay with cash, debit, or check, but I see it more as a penalty."

                "description": "A unique Texas liquor store. Good for somethings and nah on others. Nice craft beer assortment, wine has lots to choose from, Whiskey/bourbon unique items, cordials good selection, rum is ok and lots to choose from in vodka category.  Tequila assortment is hodgepodge and not to great.  They have a great deli to visit in the back.  The thorn that bugs me is they ask if you want a bag for your purchase. Really? It a tad tacky if you ask me. My previous visit started this little irritation as I purchased a very expensive whiskey for my husband and was asked this question. On this visit as I was checking out I mentioned this past experience. Right after told the cashier what happened and paid for my purchase...what did he ask me? (Yup!) Did I want a bag? I straight up asked him why they ask. His answer was \"we don't really want to give them out if we don't have to.\"  Really? Ok if it's a recycle thing then take the route of encouraging people to bring their own bag like Sprouts. If it's a being cheap thing then find another way to save a buck - your bag with the Spec's name and logo  is important advertising that walks out the door with every customer that spends their money in the store. It's a missed advertising opportunity if I don't walk out with a bag.  My suggestion is to stop having your cashiers ask people this question."

                "description": "Anything that you need to make any type of alcoholic concoction can be found here.  Any liquor you are looking to find it is here.......but wait there is more.  In this Specs there is a small deli in the back offering various sandwiches.  Not only do they have a generous selection of sandwiches they also have those back there which will help you choose perfect pairing to go with their adult libations.  These suggestions range from various cheeses to meats.  If you are the cigar smoker, there is a large selection of cigars inside to choose from.  There are various Specs in the San Antonio but thus far this one seems to be one of the larger ones offering a greater selection.  Any bar supplies you are looking for can be found here.  If you are like me, you will walk around the store to see the myriad of drinks they have.  I actually found some various flavors of soju and managed to find a bottle of Brazilian rum (cachaça).  The prices are good and they offer a military discount.  There is also a rewards program.  I know what you are thinking.  If you in there that much that you need a reward card, then you (fill in your judging thoughts). A good place to get lost and find your favorite drink at very reasonable prices."

Up to this point I have always been pretty loyal to Gabriel's, and no disrespect but this place is way cooler!  The deli foods look really good, I was wondering why we didn't come here for lunch instead!  The alcohol prices look great, I always try to compare prices at each liquor store that I visit.  Just like the Gabriel's on 1604, Spec's has two separate prices, one being lower than the other, and all you need is your Spec's card for the additional discount, which is absolutely free to sign up for.  The lady who signed me up also told me that they have special promotions for card holders as well.  I loved the truffles; love the variety of gift-sets; love that they have a HUGE selection of beer, wine, spirits, and ales; love that they've got coffee beans for sale a-la-carte style; love the friendliness of all of the staff members.  LOVE this place!  Highly recommended to anyone, even if you are not a drinker, you are guaranteed to find something you like."

The jalapeño cheese bread is a must. You must pay up front before you can get the food at the deli, but that gives you time to browse the candy selection up front.   Downsides can be they change up the menu, not all items are available consistently. As of June 2017, Peppered BLT is gone. :/  Oh well, maybe I'll find something new."

                "description": "The Northside has been the happening spot as of late. With the addition of The Big Hops Growler on Huebner Road, the influence of the craft brews, wines and spirits on our lives is growing more intense and popular with each day. And while the HEB on DeZavala Road has a pretty decent array of beers and wines to quench the most discerning palate, SPEC'S is the way to go.       This SPEC'S location always reminds me of the one I went to in Austin. It has a pretty diverse selection of beers, wines and spirits alongside elegantly displayed chocolates and cheeses. Unlike the one at Rector, this one is more vast. The lanes open with shelves and shelves of products. There are fancy tequilas, Hennessey, whiskeys, rums etc. with prices to match. They have the customary two buck chuck. Or you can splurge on a high end vodka meant for that special office party to impress your boss and coworkers.   Throughout the store each section is manned by workers who specialize in that particular department.  I'm a beer person myself, so I tend to gravitate toward that location of the store. They have a quite impressive selection of craft beers veering towards Texas, foreign, regional, national and hard to find stuff. On hand they have Trappist Ales, Barleywine, Stouts, IPA's by breweries like Rogue, Southern -Tier, Karbach, Ranger Creek, Mikkeller, Stone, Prairie etc. It is quite a stellar selection of kind brews.    The service is good here and the employees are knowledgeable. And of course you get a deal when you pay with cash or debit. Which is pretty cool right about now. While I do like this place, the sheer volume of items is worth the drive, I do like the one on Rector. It has a more personable touch than this one. Sometimes I have noticed at this location it can suffer from that whole frat boy vibe ala UTSA (I'm not hating, I myself graduated from there!) and they can clog up the aisles. Still when I look and see the selection the other patrons are deliberating on, I have come to the realization that we are all here on the same mission: to find good drink at good prices.   I like SPEC'S, particularly this location. Good products, good service and good prices for all. Total Wine and More. Gabriel's Superstore. Pig Liquors. Many locations of SPEC'S and more to come. Our city is no longer the Heavy Metal Capital of Texas, but now more readily and quickly being recognized as the drinking capital as well...\\m/"

Get a Spec's savings card (just a rewards card, not a credit thing) and save on items that are on sale!  Tastings of select wine and liquor usually every Friday's and Saturday's.    Downside I've noticed about this location...not real great about maintaining their shelves appearance. Maybe they are understaffed? I don't know but last night I saw 2 guys working in liquor area but the shelves were a mess!! Nobody fronting or filling empty spots on the shelves. Nobody available to help customers in beer section and Lots of people wandering that area. However, right before leaving beer section with our selection, we noticed someone inside the beer cooler. He was working hard to stock the empty spots in the cooler windows!! So, GOOD FOR YOU, DUDE, FOR TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS!!  Just wish someone else was outside the cooler helping customers, but at least YOU were doing what you were supposed to do!!  Spec's management, you need to work on having your shelves maintained and fully staffed to help customers!"

I'm embarrassed to admit that I'm 10+ years over the legal drinking age and I just got around to trying a margarita. As such, I'm a total novice and didn't know what to get. I hastily Google searched \"best tequila for margaritas\" and was hit with a million results. Thankfully, I found a super helpful employee to assist rather than Google. I wish I would have gotten his name but he was a middle aged gentlemen with short graying hair and he was so kind and thoughtful as I bumbled my way through the store. He didn't make me feel stupid for my lack of knowledge when it comes to alcohol and was just really non-judgmental and had such a calm vibe. I can't even begin tell you how much I appreciated his suggestions. And he was spot on because the margaritas I've been making at home are delicious! I will definitely go here again when I need more."

I've heard fantastic things from friends and co-workers about the one over in The Forum so when I saw one was being built by my house, I was pretty excited to be one of those people who bragged about how awesome Specs is! ;)  My first trip here was actually before it even opened. The sign was up, there were minimal cars out front so I wasn't actually sure if it was open or closed. When I walked up to the door, the guy said they were having a soft opening and they actually didn't have any alcohol yet, just food. I passed on going in because I originally wanted a bottle of wine and didn't want to buy anything unnecessary, didn't realize at that time that they have SO MUCH MORE then just alcohol.  When I went back, I probably spent about an hour just browsing the different aisles and all the fine foods they had in the back. It was pretty shocking to me! I'm from England and it's pretty hard to find British food, especially at British restaurants (which there's only one or two in San Antonio anyways) and most of the time, the price is marked up ridiculously. Specs had an awesome selection of foreign foods, including chocolates and frozen meals. It was just fantastic.   Employees are so helpful. I was just here yesterday trying to pick out a Riesling and the man helping me was asking a bunch of different questions about what I'm looking for, he picked out a really yummy one, gave me two different options, a $20 or $10 so wasn't just trying to get me to pay an arm and a leg for a bottle of wine, which made me happy.  Also, if you have kiddos - they have a shopping cart with a miniature car attached in the front, total bonus and another reason why I love Specs. Keeps my 2 year old happy while I browse for wine!! ;) One of my favorite places in SA and would advise anyone to check it out."

Alright, so I'm not a total non-drinker; however, I did notice that the past couple of times I've been here I bought Sprecher's cherry coke and bar nuts.  Seriously????    Even the cashier asked me right before she started checking me out, \"Do you know about our rewards card?\"   Me: \"No.  I didn't know you had one.\"   Nice cashier lady: \"Yeah.  It's actually pretty good.\"   Pause.  **Looks over my purchases** Pause.  **Still scans**  Pause.  **One final look-through**  Nice cashier lady: \"So uhm.... yeah, you don't have any items here that are eligible for discounts SOOooooooo...  yeah, we have one.\"    **Quickly checks me out of her line**"

                "description": "It is time to start to enjoy your visits to the wine, spirits, and finer foods store.  Spec's has now arrived inside of the 1604 loop and not a day too soon.    If you are persnickety about, well, your wine, spirits, and finer foods, then you're in luck.  Not only does Spec's offer an expansive variety in each of these categories, the staff is incredibly helpful.  And knowledgeable.    Fitting that they opened on the 4th of July.  We are freed from the other San Antonio standards and now have some variety.  During today's impromptu and unanticipated visit, I was asked very politely by no less than two staff whether I needed any help.  I was pleasantly surprised that the service was consistent with the excellent help I have received at other Spec's and they had only been open for four hours!  Now that is something to toast to!  Salud!"

He walked me over the aisle the item was out of stock. I asked him should I try something else but he advised he never tried the drink I was referring to within a seconds into the convo he noticed the original drink I came for was at the top of the shelf, grabbed a ladder and proceeded to give me the bottle. That really made me happy bc I've been looking for this bottle or Rose for a while. Thanks Mike"

The rest will go on a Total Wine gift card.  We shopped here for our wedding at the beginning of November 2021 and found out about this local, store policy at the time we were returning the product. It especially impacted us since we were encouraged to buy more alcohol than necessary even after we disclosed our wedding guest count had decreased significantly.  Further, the manager reluctantly refunded us in full and hung up the phone on us after we thanked her and were polite.  I've always shopped here but may go elsewhere in the future."

He knew the store very well and helped customers find exactly what they were looking for. He went out of his way to answer any questions I had while also recommending great things to try right now that I bought and in the future. I love learning about wine and spirits and learned more in the few minutes I was speaking with him than at any distillery. He not only made great suggestions but gave me options at multiple price points and told me how many different drinks I could use them with. I have always loved total wine but this experience really cemented that I will be purchasing all my wine liquor and beer from here going forward."

They have huge selection of wine and they have all kinds of Bourbon,Rye,Tequila,Gin,Whiskey and much more from low prices to very expensive like I saw a bottle of Tequila behind a glass cabinet for like $2500!  I went there recently to buy Luxardo Cherries for my Old Fashions and I found that they have Humidor with nice selection of premium cigars so it eliminates two stops in case I am in the mood for a nice cigar with my old fashion I don't have to stop at Cigar shop and traffic in this area can get little crazy so less stops the more better. I am not a frequent shopper here but I might stop by more cause they have a nice Humidor now and I think their prices are little cheaper than most places or competitive. Like to mention that all ready Jell-O shots,Buttery Nipple shots and few more I can't remember the name but have some funny names like for example Twisted Shots and Miami Vice Shots in a 15 count package which come in different flavors and  Wine and More has all your party accessories for your New Years Eve Party!! I am coming back for some party shots!! Oh I just found a bottle Cognac for $3999. Look up there Web Site you can type in whatever your looking for and it will show a pic and description but I recommend you go there instead oh and they have on line pickup too. I have no pics for this review but if you go there you won't be disappointed."

Signs throughout the store give you taste suggestions and comparisons to similar products. There are so many products that if you leave empty handed it's your own fault. At almost every visit I am greeted by a vendor representative giving samples. At my last visit, signs listed products you could taste before you buy. The sales woman is also able to give you a history of the maker and other products by that maker. It's so satisfying buying a product you already know tastes great! Tasting classes are offerred almost daily, which I would like to try sometime soon. Other liquor stores cannot compare to the stock availability at Total Wine. I was previously on a wild goose chase for Pearl beer and Total Wine had it. I also wanted a bottle of one of my favorite wines and Total Wine satisfied. There's really no reason to shop elsewhere for your adult beverage needs."

At that moment I decided to give Devils River Distillery a try. There is outdoor seating but I decided to sit inside, in a spot where I could still hear the music but where it wasn't loud too loud to have a conversation. You had to go to the bar to order drinks. They had a menu of mixed drinks using Devils River of course. There is also the option to do whiskey flights or tastings. I decided on the Rasmanian Devil. A drink with whiskey, raspberry and lemon. This drink was very refreshing. Next time I'll be game to do a tasting. The ambiance was cool and I met a cool couple while chillin. I'll definitely be back and bring some friends."

The coffee whiskey was delicious and the bar tender was very friendly. The decor of the place is super nice and you must check out the basement when you are there. This is a hidden gem and more people need to stop by for a drink."

                "description": "While visiting San Antonio , Riverwalk, we came across Devils River . WOW what a fun find. That night they had Nathan Bibano a electric violin player who was fantastic. He played so many fun tunes people were stopping and listening as they walked by.   As we walked into Devils River we were greeted by Adrian. He talked to us at length about the Distillery and its process. It was different from the ones we had seen and visited at the Kentucky Bourbon Festival. So it intrigued us.   We decided to try the tastings and started off with The Devils Alley which was Devils River Bourbon, Devils River Rye, and Devils River Coffee Bourbon which my wife really enjoyed too. Next we tried the Devils Boulevard which included Devils River Barrel Strength, Devils River Single Barrel, Devils River Distillers Select.  My wife also had a mixed bourbon coffee drink and loved it along with tasting some of my smooth milder Devils Bourbons.   All had its own flavors, from mild to okay that got our attention and YES we have some favorites.. but will leave that to you as everyone has different likes and dislikes for various reasons.. and YES we have well over 2 dozen Bourbons and Scotches in our home bar.    Kudos to JON, Adrian and Muldin for a great night and properly humidified cigar!  Also one of the owners and his wife stopped in to check on what was happening.. great to meet them too!  You now have a fan of your Devils Bourbon as told to you that night.. I already passed it on to our bourbon group.. in Florida and Georgia!     Please do not sell out to the big guys or China Corps as others have and ruin a good thing!"

Make sure to check it out if you are visiting San Antonio or are a local! Beautiful building, great ambiance, awesome drinks."

Whiskey itself is still second to Ranger Creek, but Devils River is still great and has an awesome location, with a cool inside, great patio and advertised rooftop patio that I didn't check out.  They off mixed drinks and had a frozen slushy coffee whiskey as well.  I did a flight of the high proof and it was fantastic!  We sat outside and it is on Houston St but has more privacy than some spots and is totally out of the sun.  This isn't a sports bar type place or dance club but has a comfortable laid back vibe.  I definitely plan to return."

It could have used a bit more seasoning for my taste, but overall it was excellent.  The Old Fashions were some of the best tasting I ever had.  Top notch dinner!!"

I'd probably skip on the charcuterie plate next time unless you really need some quick bar snack bites. The wings were amazing though."

I had passed Maverick Whiskey multiple times when they were only selling hand sanitizer. The place looked cool.   I was downtown for The Monkees show. I wanted to stop by for a drink. The bartenders were very friendly and talented. They had a few unique drink options. The got one of both old fashioned cocktails they had on their drink menu. They were both great. The guys to the right of me were raving about the food especially the fries.   I had to order the fries and they were $11. They had a nice cheese sauce,bacon and a runny egg on top. The fries were super tasty. I will recommend them to everyone. I am looking forward to trying more menu items in the future. I will definitely be back."

It's small, but the tables are spaced nicely. It wasn't too busy when we went.   We had tastings for their spirits and beer. Both excellent. $10 spirit flights are the way to go. We did try cocktails. Their old fashioned was on point. I love their little extras like the ice cube with their symbol.    Food was good too. We shared a pretzel, fried goat cheese, deviled eggs and cauliflower. For my main meal I had the smoked salmon nachos. They were delicious. The majority of the table got the bone in rib eye and were all happy with it.   Staff was friendly.   They don't have parking, but you can find nearby parking garages."

The kitchen didn't open till 530 so we were stuck with some appetizers, menu it's not real expansive so basic meat which is fine. Dining space is a little tight and can get loud depending on the crowd but overall a cool spot"

                "description": "Awesome atmosphere, cool story. Local whiskey distillery and restaurant near the Riverwalk. All whiskey is distilled in the old bank building with restaurant upstairs. The food was quite good - I got the mesquite pork Ribs. They were not traditional ribs, but they were smoked well and were tender. I thought the fries were excellent. The whiskey flight was a cheap and fun experience. Only $10 for a 4 drink flight. Probably equaled about 2 drinks.   I'll go back to try it again and maybe get an actual tour.   The women at the front door were fun and had a great attitude. Service was a little slow, but I had good company so it wasn't as big a deal."

Chef Joshua's menu was outstanding and the star of the show was his NY Strip Steak.  The well balanced drinks were all made with spirits distilled in-house.  Highly recommend for a large event, or just a dinner out downtown.  Much thanks to Ken for being helpful planning and delivering a memorable event."

There were no vegetarian dishes on the menu. Also, 2 of 3 drinks were so bad they were left more than half full when we departed. And, the place is extremely over-priced with very limited options. We ended up ordering a couple of vegetarian friendly appetizers to split and left hungry."

                "description": "We thoroughly enjoyed our experience here. We did the tour which lasted about an hour and a half and had dinner at the restaurant as well. The service was exceptional and everyone were very friendly and welcoming.  Our tour guide, Nicole, was fun, engaging and knowledgeable. The uniqueness of Maverick lies within its rich history and dyanmic cultural narratives surrounding the family and the area, so the tour is a must if you want to fully appreciate the experience! At the end of the tour, we tasted a few of their spirits and their straight bourbon whiskey. This whiskey has a lighter note to it and very smooth. My friend prefered the Alamo whiskey which has a bolder taste.   We also got a chance to hear some spooky ghost stories from Dan, the manager. \"Spirits and spirits\" ;)   The restaurant is upstairs with an elegant atmosphere and a view of the distillery on the side. The deviled eggs were okay but did not leave a strong impression. But their baby back ribs totally made up for it. The tender, juicy BBQ ribs combined with cripsy fries offered an amazingly satisfying taste. Their shrimp scampi is just as delicious, flavorful and cooked just right. The whiskey ice cream sweetly concluded our delightful evening there. We'll definitely recommend Maverick to everyone!"

We also tried the goat cheese croquettes (heaven) and the charcuterie board.  The charcuterie board has some different meat choices than you would normally see, but we all really enjoyed everything.  Would definitely recommend."

The teacher was so friendly and you can tell he really loves what he does; the tasting are a bit strong for me but my favorite was the coconut pecan omg yummy!!! You can't take a look around at the distillery just because Covid but still so worth the class. After or even before they have a full bar where you can enjoy so drinks or buy a bottle prices are reasonable I paid $25 for a bottle of my favorite coconut one. If your in the area and like bourbon the give it a try."

The tour was guided by a very knowledgeable tour guide and showed the distillery, best part is you end the tour with 9 samples of their whisky and vodka. The tour it's self is $5.00 but well worth it to try all 9 samples.  The location has darts, jinga and other table/bar games. The bar only serves Rebecca Creek products but all drinks are all made with high quality juice and syrups.  After grabbing a drink we headed to a cute picnic table and enjoyed live music followed by karaoke.  This place is dog friendly and also has a bbq food truck/shack. The bbq smells amazing and tasty."

The staff are always very welcoming and accommodating, and they're very knowledgeable on the drinks served there. We enjoyed the tour of their facilities when they were open pre-COVID, and we also enjoyed the outside tastings they're doing during COVID! They have many different flavors of whiskey to choose from, and we love every single one. Our all-time favorite has to be the Texas Ranger."

But when we arrived we had to pay a cover and then a few locals weren't wearing masks and it wasn't enforced for them to put them on once inside the bar. One of the employees wasn't wearing one either. While there were signs none of the employees behind the bar asked them to put one on.   I get that you have the option, but all bartenders, restaurant owners and places of business should make their employees wear a mask. Other than that the drinks were fantastic even w the $10 cover."

I just dropped in to purchase a couple bottle of TX Ranger so that I can use as gifts when I am visiting other states. It's not only a great whiskey but also a great conversation starter talking about the distillery just down the road from my house. Due to some restrictions though, I can only purchase 4 small bottles a month   but I can live with this, I guess I have to ‍  Covid has definitely affected the hours of operations but the gift store is still open and they have some GREAT TX spirits as well as gifts.   Oh and let's not forget, they are definitely Military friendly offering Military discounts   Thanks Rebecca Creek for your spirits and hospitality"

                "description": "I was kind of meh about going here. The Enchanted Rock Vodka and Rebecca Creek Whiskey I have had before and they are veryyy enjoyable. However, not being a huge mixed drink person I was apprehensive, also seeing that they only had mixed drinks- no beer or wine.  We chose a beautiful day to go! All of the seating is outside, with plenty of room for small or large groups. The drinks you can choose on the rocks or mixed- their mixes are delish! I stuck to the vodka with blueberry lemonades and other choices. All blended very well! I was surprised- I expected them to be too strong to enjoy.  We enjoyed a free tour of the distillery and got to sample the vodkas and whiskeys- all very good and learned why their liquors don't burn when you drink them (hint: they do it right). It was all started from a Texas State alumni and there is some history behind the name Rebecca Creek, which I never knew, and thoroughly enjoyed!  There is a lot to do- a good stand (not truck) on site, a live band (the All Nighters were preforming there- which btw are amazing and play everything from Pink Floyd to Foo Fighters), games such as darts, horseshoes and more. They even have a fenced-in dog park!  It's a cute place to hangout. Don't wait forever to stop in like I did. Drink local!"

My most recent trip was my third visit to Rebecca Creek to do a distillery tour and tasting and it was as much fun on the third trip as it was the very first.   You can't beat a FREE 20 minute tour and tasting of the five different liquor offerings they offer at this Texas gem. Every time I come I learn something new about the brand and their process and the tour guides provide their own unique flair to the tour. This time I had the pleasure of \"Nitro Nick\" as my guide and he was AWESOME! A perfect blend of humor, intelligence, and sarcasm :)  When you're done with your tour be sure to stick around and enjoy a cocktail outside on the patio or at one of the many picnic tables scattered around outside. With lots of games (jenga, darts, corn hole), live music on Saturdays and a man named Tommy serving up some of the best bbq in Texas there really is no better way to spend your day."

                "description": "I went with a group of friends, apparently if you have 10 people, and you email for reservation? You get a tour, tasting and a cocktail for each person.   I had originally been to Rebecca Creek Distillery back in 2011, and boy has it changed for the better!   I unfortunately cannot remember the name of the gentleman that gave us our tour, he was in charge of marketing, I do remember that. He was so kind, energetic, passionate about Rebecca Creek Distillery and knowledgeable about the distilling and bottling process. The tour was very informative, you actually go inside the workings and distilling of their spirits. This is where you get to taste their Enchanted Rock Vodka, Enchanted Rock Peach Vodka made with Fredericksburg peaches, Rebecca Creek Whiskey, and their Canadian style Texas Ranger Whiskey, which was sweet and had nodes of caramel and vanilla.   We had our cocktails made by Helena. She was great! So friendly, on top of crowd control and making cocktails FAST! I had the peach vodka mixed with lemonade.. that went down too fast! We purchased a few more cocktails (and if you check in on Yelp! you get $2 off your cocktail purchase! Woo!) We gathered outside on their covered patio, played darts and smoked cigars that a friend had brought. Apparently there is usually food trucks on Saturdays, but the rainy weather had scared them away..   Super cool - they have a dog park on premises!!   On Thursday, its steak and open mic night, Friday, it's happy hour, food trucks and karaoke, Saturdays is live music and food trucks and Sundays is whiskey and wag Sundays.   Dog park is open Thursday-Sunday.   Also - they have their own radio station!! You can listen online, or at Rebecca Creek Distillery.   Do yourself a favor and go check it out, be sure to tell Helena I said heyyy!"

We bought a huge bottle for our whiskey bourbon colleague who unfortunately couldn't make it.  So we hope it helps takes away her bronchitis. :)  Our tour guide Miranda hopefully had a lot of fun too because when you're dealing with a lot of marketing people, oh and one chemist, we have a lot of \"suggestions\" and plenty of questions. She was so nice and quite informative but more importantly was a great sport and smiled a whole lot. The tour wasn't long because you're right in the heart of it all, but it was worth it, especially when you get to the tasting part.   They have an outdoor area for games and we were all in as we continued to drink.  Luckily we had some food that we brought along to snack on. All in all, great place to visit, have a party, and more importantly have a drink! Stop by if your in San Antonio!"

Gabe administered our tour today and did a good job - he was engaging, informative and knowledgeable as he easily answered guests questions. Pretty cool little hangout spot outside with live music and Tommy's Zmoke BQQ, and it was a pretty cool atmosphere. Only major bummer to me was that the Old Fashioned was subpar. Call me high maintenance, but I had higher hopes for an Old Fashioned from a whiskey distillery. Otherwise this is a pretty cool place and they seem to be doing some good things to get the community interested and make them informed about one of Texas' few whiskey distilleries.   Cheers!"

The guide was very knowledgeable and you can even get a taste of their flavored vodka, they have a new peach flavor and it does smell real peachy. I'm not a drinker but I did get a taste on my tongue, it's the smoothest and real peach flavored drink. It does have a kick when the taste gets back to your throat. I don't see how people can drink it, but like most things it's an acquired taste. Their whisky flavored is that of a cream soda and I dipped my finger in a tasting cup, it smelled like a vanilla Carmel cream soda.  The taste to me was real strong. I can see why I'm not a drinker. I will stick to my sweet tea and virgin piña colada's. My next venture will be to go to a winery to see and taste real French wine!"

He picked us up from our Airbnb and drove us 45 mins out and back, while we blasted some rachet songs to sing haha. He would check in on us during the winery to see if we needed anything or have any questions, and he would offer to help us take multiple pictures. He also got one of the wineries to allow us to explore their cellars!   On our last day in Austin, he drove by our airbnb to pick up someone else and honked at us as we waited for our uber. We were all so happy to see him again, as we all enjoyed our experience with him.   I recommend Texas Tipsy Tours with Arlen ;)"

She was friendly and very informative.  She helped make the experience exactly what I was looking for. I wanted less sweet wines and a winery with food options. Arlen was our diver and was so knowledgeable and friendly. He picked us up right at the hotel in Austin. I felt the price for the experience is definitely worth it. If you were considering this experience, I highly recommend this company. They care and that is important."

They do all the heavy lifting with the friendliest spirit and let you and your group have the time of your life!  We had the BEST time on our tour and absolutely adore Arlen, our driver! He was the kindest, most considerate, thoughtful, responsible driver ever! He was so fun but also let us have our time to just be girls and we didn't have to open a single door, make a decision, or carry a single bag (if we didn't want to) the whole time we were with Arlen!  Also, the management team was incredible. Wei booked last minute and they were so accommodating and listened to our unique needs/wants for the tour! And we're so detailed in instructions. I have had bad experiences with wine/bus tours with other companies and I was SO impressed with the whole experience at Texas tipsy!"

They are organized and timely. If you're an out of towner like myself and decide to book accommodations in Austin they will pick you up from there and bring you back.   All of my future bookings I will definitely request Wade. He was very professional and personable, he made sure we were taken care of at each location on our tour.

                "description": "Y'all BOOK WITH THEM!!!!! I literally do not have one negative thing to say about this company. From the minute I called to book to the minute I said goodbye to our driver the day of the tour they were fantastic.   So when I called there actually weren't any times available. They worked with me to make sure they had a tour time and sprinter available for our group of 6. I had a million questions; they were patient and kind.   Our group was 6 but one of my friends asked if we could add an additional person. Reached out to TTT and they said sure no problem. Literally 3 HOURS LATER I got a call that another girl tested positive with covid and wouldn't be able to come with us obviously- they were so nice and made the switch back to 6. Very grateful for their exceptional customer service.   Day of our driver Bryant was early which was great! Got on the bus and let us have free range of the radio, answered any wine questions we had or any questions about Fredericksburg. He was a fantastic host. Always texted 15 minutes till our time at the winery was up and took as many pictures as we wanted. He was so sweet! He also made sure we were never thirsty or hungry. Which for a group of girls is very important- smart man! Haha   I've heard things about other companies having hidden fees and people getting charges after leaving Fredericksburg and we had none of that. Texas Tipsy Tours was very transparent with all of their pricing and they had no hidden fees.   Thank you TTT for making our trip perfect. You won't regret booking with them."

                "description": "My experience with Texas Tipsy tours was nothing short of perfect!!! From pickup to drop-off, Courtney (the owner) made our experience amazing! When I initially started inquiring about a tour a few months ago, many of the companies only offered private tours for a minimum of 4 people. However, Texas Tipsy Tours offers small group private tours (i.e. 2-3 people). This was perfect for me. She also made planning our trip so easy, and she promptly answered all of the questions I had.   On the day of the tour, she picked us up from our hotel in Austin in an Infiniti SUV (it was very clean too)! She even made a pit stop for me at a CVS on the way to our first winery. Throughout the 6 hour tour, she made sure we stayed on schedule. She even let us change a stop last minute because we wanted to check out a brewery!  One thing that was amazing was the comfort she provided! She allowed us to pick the music, provided phone chargers, and let us control the AC! She even opened our doors for us AND dropped us off/picked us up right in front of each place we went!  Overall, I highly recommend Texas Tipsy Tours, and I will definitely be back!"

We chose the half day option and were picked up right at our vacation rental (Farmhouse on Elder Hill) We wanted to just stay nearby so we visited Driftwood Estate Winery and Fall Creek.  We were planning to also see Vista Brewing (all in Driftwood), but we chatted and laughed so much that we ran out of time and Eric, driver/owner was flexible with our change of plans and let us just extend our time enjoying the fabulous view at Driftwood Estate.  The tour service was absolutely awesome and professional.  Everything done with excellence.  Thank you Courtney and Eric!"

It was as easy as getting on the phone, explaining what I wanted, and Courtney took care of literally everything else. We picked the breweries we wanted and even included a food stop. She coordinated the bus pick up, drop offs, schedule, and even reserved tables for us at each stop. I love that we had our own bus (very nice one, by the way!), and had the flexibility to create our own tour based on beers and food my husband liked. It was the perfect Saturday in Austin! Payment was very easy as well - they sent me an invoice to my email and I was able to pay directly online for everything. Highly recommend, and thank you Texas Tipsy Tours!"

I have taken quite a few van tours around the hill country and Texas Tipsy Tours sets themselves apart by not just being drivers but they truly host you the entire day. I will ALWAYS use this company going forward. We did a private charter from Driftwood to Austin, TX and back and Keaton our driver was a delight. He made sure we were picked up on time and each of our stops were easy and flexible. We did a mixed tour around Driftwood and Dripping springs the next day and our guide Eric executed the BEST DAY for us. He even picked up on what we were liking and recommended a change to our final stop to Vista Brewing and we were SO glad he did. At each stop he made sure we had plenty of water, snacks and chairs to enjoy the gorgeous venues. This is totally above and beyond what we would have expected from a driver. Courtney was so easy to work with and she helped make recommendations for our group ultimately making our weekend get away FLAWLESS. I promise if you don't use this company, you're wrong."

We were staying in the adorable town of Wimberley so I researched tours in the area.  Jodie's Taste of the Hills Tour got great reviews and went to wineries close to the Wimberley area. The day of the tour ended up being chilly and rainy. As soon as Jodie pulled up with her spectacular shuttle-like van she was out like a flash with pretty umbrellas for us! We went to 3 different wineries which we thoroughly enjoyed! After the first one, we returned to Jodie's vehicle and she had a gorgeous tray for us of cheese,  sausage,  crackers,  grapes,  olives, dips.....simply divine!!! The tour was also just the 2 of us and we loved that Jodie still did ALL of this for a tour that I believe takes up to 12 people! The next time we plan a trip to the Hill Country we are going to do one of Jodie's Beer tours!! We had such great conversations with Jodie too! Thank you sooooo much for the GREAT time! Sooooo much fun!"

Jodie made us all feel like we were old friends, even though we had never met anyone else on the bus.  She was very detailed with the stories of each winery, and explained all the different varietals, answering our every question along the way. The bus was very comfortable and clean, and she stored each bottle we purchased until the trip was over, but we could have had the bottles on the bus had we chosen to.  The wineries all seemed to know her, so they were expecting us and were incredibly friendly. We were not rushed anywhere, and still managed to make it back into town to enjoy shopping on the square.  My wife and I were pretty hungry by the time we had lunch, since we didn't have breakfast, but the tapas style lunch was perfect for the glass of wine we purchased to have with it. The lunch was delicious and filling.  Overall this was an amazing experience and I will be recommending this tour to everyone I know."

                "description": "This wine tour with Jodie is a must.  We got Serenity Inn on a Wednesday so we were lucky to be on the wine tour with only one other couple.  Jodie is such a pleasant and inviting soul. She asked about each person's preferences as to be able to personalize the tour and pick which wineries she decided to take us too.  She is very knowledgeable of the town and the wineries.  The lunch she provides is just amazing. By the time we were done I felt like I had made an incredible new friend. I can't wait to go back and do more tours."

She has an extensive knowledge of wines, the wineries, the towns, etc. Our favorite part was lunch because of the views and the wonderful spread that was provided for us. I highly recommend this tour and in fact will probably we doing it again, soon, I hope."

                "description": "Perfect - the highlight of our trip!  Jodie was the best, most fun, knowledgeable and coordinator.  We went to Driftwood, Duchman and Fall Creek Vineyards.  We were fortunate enough to have great people touring with us, and it made the tour all the more fun.  She prepared the best picnic lunch I've ever had.  Sugar Shack cake balls, meats, cheeses, crackers, hummus, a goat cheese something served on crackers (that I LOVED, and I hate goat cheese), spinach feta rolls, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something.  She was fully prepared for everything.  Boxes for the wine we bought, umbrellas in case in rained (it didn't), plenty of water...this wine tour couldn't have been more perfect if she tried.  Thanks, Jodie!"

She provided an excellent variety of foods including a hot portion and gluten-free (just in time `cause I was lit after the 1st vineyard). The three vineyards for that day were selected based on the wine preferences of the tourists that day (A+ perk). We never felt pushed or obligated to buy wines, but we all did because they were very good (!), and Jodie kept our purchases organized and stored for us. She also gave a good background on each vineyard and on the Wimberley area in general. We learned a lot about Wimberley and wine and were able to get tipsy knowing Jodie was an excellent driver of her comfy bus. And have you been to Wimberley? That hilly countryside is beautiful!"

Our tour was originally scheduled for 10:30a, but got pushed back to 1:15p due to shuttle trouble (we had the option to receive our money back, but actually liked the later time).  We stopped at three wineries, including Driftwood Estate and Duchman Family Winery.  The views at all of the wineries varied, but each were unique to their locations.  Jodie provided an amazing picnic-style lunch, including a charcuterie (meat and cheese) board, chicken salad, nuts, walnut and feta salad, grapes, chocolate cake balls, bottled water, etc. At the second stop, Jodie was kind enough to call in people's orders to Salt Lick BBQ and had it all ready to take home by the third stop.  We can't wait to return again!"

She gave us a lot of background information on the wineries as well as the town of Wimberley. She had a delicious assortment of snacks for us to munch on while we rode to and from each winery. She helped package our wine purchases and brought us umbrellas as it started to rain. She even went the extra mile, literally, and drove us back to our hotel since it was raining as we had walked to our meeting spot earlier in the day. We had another couple on the tour with us which was really nice since we had people to mingle with. It was a very personal experience and I felt as though we were all just great friends spending an afternoon together. Who needs Napa, everything is better in Texas!!! We will definitely be repeat customers."

Today was my second visit in about a month, and it will become a regular place to visit. Mike is a great guy, and he makes a great product.  On my first visit I purchased the Kentucky Straight Bourbon, which is distilled in Kentucky and bottled locally.  This Time, I purchased Mike's Texas Bourbon, which he distills himself and ages in 7-gallon barrels, and look forward to drinking it as well. The Kentucky Straight is very smooth for a 110 proof, and prompted me to go back for more.  They also mix some wicked concoctions. Today I had a fantastic Old Fashioned, and a bourbon-based Mule.  My wife, who is not much for hard liquor, loved the Old Fashioned as well and she also tried a heavy creme or milk-based bourbon drink that she absolutely loved.  Give this place a try, and I can pretty much guarantee you'll be back.  Oh, and you might want to go around lunchtime, as he always has some chili simmering on a wood-fired kettle outside!  Also, Mike is a career veteran of our great US Navy, so if I haven't given you reason enough yet to stop by, I hope that does it for you!"

He was quick to respond and helped me schedule a party bus big enough for all of us. David, our driver, showed up early and made sure we had everything we needed for the trip. He had a giant cooler with ice and waters that we were able to load up with seltzers. I booked our wineries ahead of time which made getting into the tastings a breeze. David made sure we got to each winery on time and went in ahead to ensure each winery was ready for us when we arrived. He even coordinated to have the band at one of the wineries sing Happy Birthday! David was absolutely fantastic, and we had a great time with him. We will definitely be booking with them again for our next trip. I highly recommend Open Range Tours to anyone visiting Fredericksburg!"

As we had a decent amount of guys with us- he suggest Garrison Brother's Distillery which ended up being a HUGE hit!  He was extremely professional, courteous and just an absolute delight to spend the day with!  He also has a wicked funny sense of humor.

                "description": "Do NOT recommend! We booked a tour for 8 people and everything was a mess from the beginning. We were told we would be upgraded to a 15 passenger bus. A 15 passenger VAN showed up with a dent in the side and ripped seats. We were told we could bring coolers. We were only able to fit 8 adults in the van with our two coolers- no way we could've had another person in the van. None of the wineries had been scheduled yet and the ONE we had specifically requested was not available. We had to scramble ourselves to find wineries, in which we were promised everything would be done ahead of time. The meat and cheese tray that was promised was a small tray that was bought during the tour at a convenient store to feed 2 people. Our driver was great, however the owner did not deliver what was promised and we were highly disappointed. There are plenty of companies to choose from, and I would NOT recommend Open Range."

                "description": "I arranged a Girls' Getaway to Fredericksburg, so naturally I wanted to do a wine tour. I contacted several tour companies. D'Ann was extremely responsive and gave me several suggestions of where to go. Since I'm a wine club member at quite a few wineries in the Hill Country, I opted to do a custom tour and made my own reservations. Greg, the owner (and D'Ann's husband) arrived on time and drove us to 3 wineries where we were able to enjoy a nice, relaxing afternoon. Greg was so friendly, helpful and accommodating. I would highly recommend Open Range Tours...thanks, D'Ann and Greg!!!"

There were some general issues with scheduling and logistics that were my fault, but she very kindly fixed everything!  Our driver David was on time, helpful, and a lot of fun.  They know a lot about the wineries and have personal relationships with the owners/managers/tasting staff.  David also went above and beyond by making an extra stop for shopping/pie-indulging and by dropping us off at our dinner restaurant so we didn't have to walk from the visitor center where he picked us up.

                "description": "We went to Fredericksburg for a girls trip and wanted to spend a day at the distilleries and breweries. David was fantastic to work with planning everything out. I wouldn't have changed any of that part. But, once the day rolled around we were met with a hiccup. The driver, not David like I was anticipating after multiple conversations, arrived in a mustang for 5 of us. Obviously that wasn't going to work so I was offered by the driver only to cancel or reschedule. Our trip was planned around spending our day out and about so cancelling wasn't an option for us. After a phone call to David, we were assured our day wasn't ruined just a bit delayed. The driver left and showed back up with an SUV and away we went. The driver wasn't interactive and she didn't seem to even be having a good day... It happens I get it but come on. Anyway, we made the best of our day and enjoyed ourselves. When we were dropped off, I tried to pay but she said to get with David. No problem but I did have a problem with her then saying that she'd go ahead and take the gratuity and that the standard is 20%. I didn't even know what our total cost was to figure 20% but asking for the gratuity before I even paid for the day was in poor taste. We did go ahead and tip, and well mind you, because that's the kind of people we are. I ended up calling David and finishing out the transaction and once again, he was a pleasure to deal with. Overall, we'll use them again because I appreciated David that much. But, I'll definitely make sure we don't have the same driver. 5 stars for David but 4 stars overall for the above mentioned."

Throwing a surprise weekend is stressful enough but Woody was SUPER accommodating especially for being so last minute.  There were many tours that I could've chosen to stick with but Woody was so authentic about his services and was a person of integrity when it came to what he offered.  He personally picked us up from our little hotel we were staying at and drove us to all three of our tours. His tour bus was super clean and we all had a blast! He even offered to pick up some cheese and snacks at the HEB close by to have on the bus if we wanted! I really appreciated Woody taking the time to answer my numerous phone calls with questions I had as this is my first Bachelorette party I threw.  I HIGHLY recommend using Woody if anyone wants to have a great time and looking for someone to trust. I will be booking with you again Woody, thank you so much for everything!"

If you come across Fredericksburg Uncorked Wine Tours, stop your search and make the booking.   Organizing a wine tour for 18 girls as part of a bachelorette party was a breeze with Woody, the owner/operator of Uncorked. He gave great advice, offered competitive pricing (especially for the expectant mothers/non-drinkers in our group), and was easy to communicate with. Woody was incredibly patient during the lead up to our tour, and then was a funny, gracious, and attentive guide during our wine tasting experience.   Our tour was fantastic from start to finish, and I can't recommend Woody and the rest of the Fredericksburg Uncorked team highly enough. All (18) of us had the greatest time!"

I honestly called three or 4 more tours throughout the week and left messages and he is the only one that called me back. Not only did woody come through, he came through at the last minute when I thought We weren't going to make a tour.  He was funny , knowledgeable and overall a great guide. He even recommended a few things that weren't apart of the tour (Alamo Springs Cafe) which we ended up going to and was delicious.  Lunch was not included but the place we went to was pretty great for a sandwich . I'd hang out and grab a beer with woody any night !  Thank you for making my boyfriends birthday a good one !!"

I never agreed to Woody keeping my credit card information on file after he charged the wine tour for 11 girls (almost $1,300).   The driver Tommy was nice but he did nothing special and didn't know the basics of Woody's business. Had he known even a little bit about Uncorked Tours, there wouldn't have been confusion about lunch.   As far as the wine tour: William Chris and Lost Draw were my favorite wineries. Hye Market pretended we weren't there half of the time. Pontotoc was greedy with their pours.   Woody was very unprofessional and difficult to work with at the end. I would not recommend him.

He even got us a private tour of the cellar at Hawk's Shadow Winery.  Absolutely reach out to him if you're in the area."

It was so relaxing to sit back and enjoy the day with friends, all while knowing every detail had been taken care of.  This coming from a very \"type A\" personality is a huge 5 star! We did the \"red rose\" package, touring 3 wineries and had a few hours in Luckenbach.  John was friendly, fun and a great host. All we had to do is drink wine, visit with friends and enjoy the day! If you are looking for a fun experience, try Yellow Rose! We will be back next year to do it all over again!"

                "description": "Do not use this \"tour\"!! It is cheaper to pay the tasting fees and hire your own driver. The owner is greedy and a complete A. We originally had 5 ladies who were going on the tour with us and one backed out. We didn't ask for a private tour and John (who I'm guessing is the owner) didn't tell us until we were already at the first location that he would stop the tour until we paid for a fifth person that wasn't there. No wonder he kept pushing cash, it was a complete rip off. It was either go home after that tour paying $125 a person..Or have two more tours while paying for a person who wasn't there. PS it's about $15 for the wine tastings. ($15x3=$45) It was not worth it. On a positive note, Gary at Hanhe Estates winery was amazing. Highly recommend this guy and his wine."

                "description": "\"Tour\" is an awfully strong word. We were picked up and then drove for 45 minutes without our driver, John, saying a word about where we were going or how long it would take to get there. He then picked up 3 other people when it was supposed to be a private tour. He took us to the wineries but never said a word about where to go or what to do. He followed us around at the wineries and sat with us. He was 30 minutes late then forgot what the schedule was supposed to be and tried to keep us at the 2nd winery until 30 minutes after we were supposed to be home. He told us we could pay with cash or card, but he only actually took cash or PayPal, which put some people in a real bind. He hounded us about payment the whole time. It was awful and we will never do it again."

The transportation (van) was very clean and well-taken care of. We had the van to ourselves on the couple's tour but it can easily fit a big party!  Booking a couple's wine tour on their website was super easy (and I'm sure it would be for big groups too)! The date availability, cost estimate, and customizability is spot-on. The moment you book, they send you a comprehensive list of wineries and distilleries (!!!) with rankings of the view + wine. They also have great options for add-ons, such as a charcuterie board or stopping by for lunch mid-wine tour. Love that.  There's no doubt I would choose and recommend 830 Elevated again for any future wine excursions in Hill Country. Thanks again, Brayden and Deb :)"

From start to finish everything was so easy and customizable to what we were looking for while planning our annual girls trip. Prices are incomparable with Five Star treatment on a PRIVATE tour. Right after booking we got an email with a list of the area wineries and restaurants that had notes and ratings so we could choose where we wanted to go. This is a private tour so Brayden picked us up right in front of our Airbnb and we were off. We toured four wineries and he kept us on schedule but never rushing us. After the tours we opted for the night service so he dropped us off on Main Street so we could grab dinner, sing some karaoke and when ready to be picked up to end the evening just had to shoot him a text and he was there. We just cannot say enough good things about this company. Do not second guess - book with Brayden and Deb"

                "description": "I came across 830 when our bed and breakfast cancelled our room and wine tour reservation (due to remodeling) a month before our 10 year anniversary trip to Fredericksburg. I believe they were on the city website as a recommended tour, but also Google directed me to them. Either way, I am so glad it happened this way - our experience with 830 was indeed elevated!!! The customized tour that Deb set up with me over the phone was exactly what my husband and I wanted - a distillery, a brewery, and a winery that made you feel like you were in Napa. Without even knowing us, Deb helped picked the perfect places for us to enjoy. Communication up until the tour and the day of the tour was prompt and courteous, always with our best intentions in mind (example: Deb texted us and offered to pick us up even earlier than planned due to the heat at one of the outdoor locations). The drive in between locations was full of great conversation, and we were thankful they provided cold water for us. The van was immaculate and the drive was very comfortable - I didn't know the luxury that a private vs public tour would offer! Deb was so knowledgeable (she's a local, of course!) and so sweet with helping us newbies figure out what to do. Her service went above and beyond, and she made us feel like celebrities. It was an absolute pleasure to work with them - do yourself the best favor and book with them!!"

But the best we could find was a limo driver that would charge us almost what it would for 4 people. Then we found 830 Elevated. They're filling a niche most tour companies aren't by providing an affordable private tour option for couples. They were great. Small, young company. They don't have deep knowledge on wine like veteran companies but they are personable in that they also tour wineries themselves and can share their inputs."

Here's my story-   I booked with this company over a month in advance prior to my trip to Fredericksburg for my fiancé and I's anniversary, as well as his birthday. After booking, the company was very communicative for the first few days. After the first few days, I did not hear a word from them until the week of our trip. I had told them a month in advance which places we wanted to go. The week of, they inform us that Augusta vin is not taking people for reservations. Which was fine, we went ahead with the other vineyard they had suggested. We had booked for a Saturday. That Friday at 3:00AM, they had informed us of a change of driver due to a family emergency which we completely understood, and now that our pickup time had changed to 11:30AM instead of 1:30PM. I wake up to that email Saturday still understanding, and we changed our plans to be at the pickup destination by 11:30AM. We are waiting there over 15 minutes for them to show, and no one does. We call, leave voicemails, and still hear from no one. 30 minutes passed, they send a TEXT MESSAGE informing us they aren't showing up for the entire time and that we are on our own for the entire day. LEAVING OUR PLANS FOR THE ENTIRE DAY RUINED. Incredibly horrid communication from this company. DO NOT BOOK WITH THIS COMPANY!!!! I seriously am understanding that situations happen in life, but they had guaranteed us a driver for the day regardless of what had happened. I was truly heartbroken to have not received a personal phone call from the company, instead they just send us a text that they are not coming. I have NEVER written a review for a company before, but this needed to be shared. We discussed the situation with multiple locals in the town, no one had ever heard of this company. Whatever you do, save your money and time."

Nestled away with a nice patio to hang out and have a glass of wine.  Downsides- one bathroom and the staff seemed a little overwhelmed with the amount of people.  I can't be very negative though about service since they didn't charge me for an ornament I dropped and broke.  10% of bottles for military."

Upon entering we were immediately greeted with warm smiles by the staff/patrons and to the soothing sounds of a wonderful singer.  There were a number of comfy tables/chairs, bar stools and couches available for seating.  The place was warm and inviting with a rustic chic vibe.  The ordering process was fantastic with lots of recommends. We were checked on frequently and just had a wonderful time interacting with the team of ladies that made sure to take care of us.  The wine was great as well.  I would definitely recommend stopping in to grab a drink.  The live singer was a real bonus.  Not sure how often he is on schedule but sure you can call ahead to check."

We were definitely impressed with the service - everyone is super friendly and tries to learn your name. They will also help you with picking out your favorite wine to try.   The wines are made there, although we think they are similar to any wine making kit you can buy online and do yourself at home. I didn't find a favorite wine this time, but I'd try it again. It's a great place for a group of friends to come and try some wines, and they're at decent prices. You can also bottle your own wine and create labels if you have an event or something - super cute!"

                "description": "We were looking for something to do and stumbled across this place. The yelp reviews were good so we decided to check it out. This is the only winery in the city of San Antonio which I thought was pretty cool. Stray Grape has an extensive selection of wines. I was very impressed by the selection and the taste of these wines.   We went to Stray Grape on a Saturday. It was the day of the Kentucky Derby and it was packed. When me and my fiancé first walked in we thought we may have walked in on someone's private event. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by one of the employees and they were very friendly. We instantly felt welcomed by the employees and the regulars.   I recommend others try some of their Port Wines, they are to die for. For being the only winery San Antonio and having the market cornered they still treat you like there's competition in the city. People are friendly, prices are reasonable and the wine well, it tastes fantastic.   If you're looking for something to do and want some free wine tasting, this is the place to visit. Me and my fiancé will definitely be back."

We were able to take some snacks and opted out for purchasing an entire bottle vs wine tasting ($10 for 7 tastings I believe). I found that I'd take my chances w/the sweet blueberry wine and it'll be cheaper and more rewarding ($15+ per bottle).  The only thing I didn't like too much was that the wine wasn't cold. I know red wine is good room temperature but I like sweet wine cold."

It doesn't look like much from the outside; it's part of a small shopping center. But you walk in, and it's comfy and nice. There weren't that many people there, we went pretty early during the day, so I'm sure it gets more crowded in the evenings. There are multiple TVs and plenty of tables. Our server was knowledgeable, fast, and friendly.  For a mere $10 you get to taste 7 wines AND keep your glass! They give you little paper menus to keep. This was helpful as I underline each wine I tried so I could keep track, and even make a plan for the next time I go. My sister and I enjoyed tasting the wine, then writing how many stars we gave each out of 5. They have a pretty solid variety to choose from. Cabernet, Merlot, Moscato, all very different with varying depths of flavors. Ask your server for recommendations! They are super helpful. I definitely want to go back soon."

I am an avid wine drinker and have done the whole--look at the wine in the glass, smell, taste and savor. However, that was all for show. I can't be the only one who does this at the dinner table after the Somm pours a first \"taste\". What am I really tasting though?   Jennifer shared her extensive knowledge in her inaugural Tasting Deconstructed: Understanding Your Palate class. I learned how to look and taste through a Sommelier's eyes and mouth. I learned how to distinguish the color and age of the wine. I learned how to properly smell and identify scent characteristics that sparked core memories. Yes--wine can do that. I learned how to taste and differentiate if the wine was high acidity, high minerality, or full bodied. I learned all the things!  Going back to that table side pour. I was always going to enjoy the wine--let's be honest. However, now I feel confident to have a discussion about the complexity, the bouquet, or what memory was sparked. Instead of the typical head nod and \"It's good\"."

This is a really neat concept as you buy your wine in a growler bottle that can be used again and you get a small discount when you bring it back.  I will not spoil the experience for you, I will merely suggest that if you like wine and enjoy urban wineries, try it out, you will really like it and probably go back and more than likely join their wine club too."

                "description": "Cute new spot in hemisphere park! It's a little hidden, tucked into a corner of a building, away from the playground. There's a few outdoor tables, but the majority of the space is inside. It's nice and open inside with glass walls that fill the room with natural light.  The owner was very friendly and offered us a full complimentary tasting. She bestowed us with knowledgeable about the wine, telling us about the grapes and how their flavors incorporated into each final product. Their wine is made locally in Fredericksburg, and many of them hold the honor of a having a San Antonio name. It was very enjoyable learning about the drinks. And they were delicious!!  We ordered a charcuterie board and the cheese was perfect! Each cheese had a complimentary dipping sauce. Ah, they were all great combos. Next time I'll ask about a meatless option.   You can purchase either a glass or growler. And they're reasonably priced. The menu includes the tasting notes of each wine, which I greatly appreciated. They're still relatively new and said they'll be adding more options in the future. We had a great time here, and we look forward to coming back and enjoying more local wine."

However, from the initial meet, I can tell that Jenn is knowledgeable! She knows and understands regional wine and will give you recommendations based on your experience with wine and drinking preferences!  Awesome vibe with industrial elements, in a relaxed and non-pretentious setting. Stop by!"

                "description": "We had been eagerly awaiting their opening, that, like so many other businesses, got delayed in the past year. It's a bit difficult to nail down an all-encompassing descrition of what's going on here, but here goes:  -custom crush urban winery featuring ALL TEXAS wines. If you're new in town and considering a US 290 wine trail trip, START HERE! An amazing amount of knowledge to be had regarding, varietals, production techniques, and personalities in the Texas Hill Country wine scene. Can't think of too many other folks bringing Jennifer's years of experience and general wine knowledge to the community in a way thats approachable/informative regardless of your prior background as a wine consumer.  -neighborhood wine bar with a selection that, while not in the dozens in terms of selection, has something that should be pleasing for just about every palate, regardless of your \"usual favorite\".  The cheese/charcuterie plate available makes for a great addition also!  -retail wine outlet featuring eco-friendly reusable growlers for everyday use as well as kegged wines for larger gatherings/events. At some point in the future, they're planning to have offerings from other Texas wineries on hand as well.  -winery tasting bar with a couple different \"wine club\" experiences available. Wine education seminars are also on the longer term horizon."

                "description": "ReRooted is located in a new building on the Hemisfair site.  Parking can be a bit tricky. Don't use the adjacent surface parking lot, like I did, but instead use the parking garage that is part of the building that ReRooted is located in. Much cheaper and I understand that ReRooted may validate your parking.  ReRooted 210 represents something of a new concept. I have watched owner/solemner/wine maker Jennifer Beckmann's career over the past ten years. She has been involved in setting up several fine wineries in the Hill Country (among her many accomplishments).  Now she and her husband are setting out on a new and, I think, relatively new concept. Recently opened, ReRooted features wines that Jennifer has blended and produced from Texas grapes. As such, these wines are only available at this location. Instead of bottling the wine, it is stored in recyclable casks and dispensed much like draft beer. Much friendlier for the environment. In addition to dispensing wine by the glass you can purchase the wine in reusable bottles much like growlers for beer. When finished, bring the bottles back for a credit on your next purchase.  The space consist of a bar for dispensing wine, an airy modern seating area and some adjacent outdoor seating.  Wine: We tried the sampler of I think six different wines and I was very impressed. The wines were well crafted and I think very similar to European style wines that I have had in the past.  Food: Food is limited to a very nice cheese and charcuterie plate and I believe one other selection that we did not try.   A great place to meet with friends and enjoy some very nice Texas wine."

Nothing off the charts - I must say I consider myself a professional wine taster or connoisseur so I wasn't over impressed but I must say the service was good. The prices were a bit over the top (and I don't have cheap taste). Overall, it was an okay experience. You have to pay $15 to park in the garage to come here no matter how long you stay. We had a cheese and meat platter and each had a tasting, took 1 bottle and it was well over $100"

                "description": "***Update: The company did reach out and refund the extra hour which I appreciate. Although I was asked to delete my review, which I will not be doing.   First off, let me start by saying our driver Nate, was an absolute doll. He was the only good part about the experience with this company.  The company is called San Antonio Wine Tours, their website says they are based out of SA and pickup in SA. When booking a half day tour, their website says there is only enough time to go to dripping springs. So I booked dripping springs and requested and additional hour to have lunch. Upon calling to update my reservation I was told the extra hour I purchased would go towards travel time. TBF dripping springs is 1.5 hours from my home and they said ppl usually spend 45min-1hr at the wineries. That being said, why does the basic half day package say there's enough time to go to dripping springs only, which I chose, yet my additional hour has to be used for travel. It didn't quite add up.  So I explained this to them and was given the response \"oh, I guess the website needs to be corrected\". Also, they just asked \"do you want to cancel?\"  No attempting to right their wrong. I soon realized it's probably bc the deposit I put down was non refundable so they probably didn't care bc they already had some of my money. I was told that apparently they have been pulling this since they started 2 years ago and the website was supposed to have been \"corrected\" many times before this.  So buyer beware, this company practices dishonest and what I feel is shady  business. They also seem to not care about if the customer is upset and only about the money that can get."

Sara made recommendations, and those wineries turned out to be excellent choices...we all really enjoyed them.  Clearly, she knew something we didn't.  However, the reason I can't give a better review is the limo.  We paid an upcharge for a limo, and the one that was sent was old and the AC/heat did not work properly.  We were pretty uncomfortable for the long drives to and from San Antonio.  Sara did get right on it when I called, but we shouldn't have had to deal with it at all.

He listened to what I  said about the kind of wines I like and don't like, and even though I'm not a red girl, he gave me a reddish wine that was exactly what I wanted. I've never had anyone pair a wine to my pallet before. Five stars. We bought the bottle to have on the patio. Such a relaxing escape from the outside world. I heard they sold it today. A little bummed because the owner is so personable, but hopeful the new owners will offer the same great personal touch."

The meat and cheese trays are big enough for three people. We don't actually eat that much but, anyway, the peach wine and the Cabernet are definitely worth the trip. We were seated at the pavilion, and it was a record hot day for Oct. Also, finding this can be a challenge because their sign is not a stand out. I'd recommend this to any group but not on record hot day. They offered Brie but we're all in agreement to go again another day when it's COOL and getting the Brie."

Every wine was wonderful, but our favorites were the Zinpom and cucumber sauvignon blanc. The facilities are amazing and offer plenty of seating with great views of the surrounding hills. The owner, Mike Lara, and his staff were all incredibly friendly and accommodating. We bought a bottle of the Zinpom, and will definitely be returning!"

The wine was excellent, we did a wine tasting for an affordable 12 dollars a person and Michael Lara came over and introduced himself and gave us complimentary pairings (strawberries and olives) so we'd have a better tasting experience. The vineyard was beautiful, the wine and the conversation with the friendly and personable staff (specifically Tara) was amazing. Overall a really fun experience with great people, I bought a bottle of their seasonal Strawberry blush wine, and we will be back next month!"

                "description": "My husband and Mom decided to stop and do a wine tasting today $4 for 4 flavors which in my opinion is a steal. You could take the glass home for an extra $2 if you wanted which had their logo on the side.  We've had a really hard time finding wine we like in Texas and I believe we finally did.  They said that every flavor they tried was smooth, balanced, and the fruit flavors actually resembled the fruit they were supposed to be.  They're both still talking about the lil cranberry flavor and the blackberry flavor. Crisp and refreshing were the words I heard coming out of their mouths multiple times.  Prices for their bottles are well worth it at about $16 for the reds and $12 for the fruit flavors. They had a deal today where you got a discount if you purchased 3 or more bottles of wine so of course we had to splurge.  Even being pregnant, the staff was super nice to me and included me even though I couldn't drink. We talked about mixing wine flavors to make interesting combos and wines we thought I would like once I could drink again.  Great experience, will definitely be returning."

If you've been to Gruene you know parking can be a little bit of a nightmare, that is why we love to come to this place since they have their own parking and is also located near the entrance to the town. They have both indoor and outdoor seating, with a cute little garden which is great for photos during spring. They have a decent selection of wines, which you can purchase by the glass or a bottle. If you are hungry, they also have a BBQ food truck but is not always open. Last but no least, if you are parent searching for a changing table, this is not the place for you. We had to change our baby inside our car, which was a little annoying since it was 90+ degrees outside."

They're right on the Guadalupe River in downtown historic Gruene TX. If you're having a bridal party, etc. this is an ideal spot with great social distancing and a recently added BBQ Food Truck. I'm not giving it more stars because 1) they're not growing grapes and 2) I'm really not impressed with their products BUT I don't like sweet wines which they specialize in from the looks of their menu. Their service was impeccable and quick and attentive even though it was a busy Saturday. Dog and kid friendly. Cheese and crackers available."

                "description": "Recall when I said I had reviews in my drafts? Ughs, this one is from 2018 (don't judge me).   Winery on the Gruene is a small 'boutique' style winery that makes vino on the premise. There are a variety of vino's to sample at a reasonable price (4 tastings for only $4.00). If you know what you want and are a true vino drinker like me, you can 'go for it' and just order a glass (Vino Blanco in my case, $5.00 per glass; see my receipt).  The vino selection here is decent and the customer service is even better. The only facet about this location that is not great is the lack of room inside when you go for a tasting. However, if you have time to come here and have a glass of vino while you sit outside and enjoy a nice spring day, you will not be sorry.   Happy Drinking!"

Pictured is the wine-a-rita, mix your favorite wine with a frozen margarita mix. These wines are seriously delicious. I'm usually not into fruity wines, but these are done right and are amazing. The employees are super friendly and it's a good time every time we go. There's even a bbq food truck in the parking lot if you get hungry!  Dog friendly patio, with some more secluded picnic benches if you'd like. Highly recommend!"

                "description": "Wow, how have I not written a review about Winery on the Gruene?! It's like my best friend's favorite place to go in Gruene so I've actually been so many times... We've been visiting since they were at the original location down the street like ten years ago in one of the new strip centers on the outskirts of the little village of Gruene! Winery on the Gruene got lucky when this location became available, right in the center of Gruene!  Winery on the Gruene is located just up the hill from Guadalupe River about a block west of Gruene Hall. Great location, easy to find. Lots of room to sit inside or out. There is even space upstairs to sit or rent out for private parties.  All the staff have always been amazing... Thank you! That is always one of the reasons to go back to any business.   Winery on the Gruene is not a vineyard. Most grapes are not from Texas. Maybe not even any. That is my only complaint as I like to keep my wines local, although that is what works for these guys. They are not limited in their creations. They purchase grapes from all across the country to make their wines. They have a large selection on their menu, so you will find something you like. Winery on Gruene specializes in these sweet fruity wines, which is one of the reasons why my bestie LOVE them!  My favorite is Blackberrry Merlot. On my last visit for Tami C.'s birthday surprise, that is all I had... no need to sample, just give me a big full glass and I'll be a happy camper!   Yeah, you  know I'll be back for some of that Blackberry Merlot!"

Very charming staff and was helpful on wine tasting. We choose four wines to taste from their menu and have different emo fave on what we thought of the wine. I must say the tasting serving are healthy pour and provide the opportunity to enjoy a little more of each wine.  For me most of the wine was somewhat sweet and berry tasting as the Merlot wine has a hint of sweet berry. Reminded me of when I was had my first drink of Boonesfarm wine but not that sweet...lol.  Charming with that modern industrial farm decor.  I would come back to just sit on the porch with glass of vino. Cheers."

                "description": "I have heard nothing but good things about this place so I was pretty stoked to check it out. The long line of people waiting BEFORE it even opened and the hundreds of preorders waiting outside had me excited to try their wine.   I was genuinely disappointed. The staff was friendly, incredibly thankful for the support and were moving fast so everyone wasn't waiting to long in the Texas heat. The disappointment was sadly the wine.   We ordered 3 different types: cranberry, blueberry, and the Malbec. The fruit ones were all watered down tasting. If you handed me the cranberry or blueberry flavored one and told me to guess, I'd honestly have no idea what I was even drinking. $15 a bottle and it tastes worse than the $5 ones you can get at H‑E‑B. I'm still crossing my fingers that the Malbec one is good.   Overall I do want to try them again just based on service because maybe I didn't order the best flavors or wine they have there BUT if the wine I got today is any indication on their products then I'm not sure why they're so popular."

                "description": "This is my favorite place to buy bottles of wine. My favorite red wine they have is called the Black Forest Port--it tastes like chocolate covered cherries. Another sweet wine they have is the Strawberry Riesling, which is another favorite. My husband likes the Brunello, which is a much drier wine.  The location is beautiful, and the staff is very friendly and let us try different wines to see what we liked best. They also offer a military discount.   I highly recommend this winery. You can pop in just to buy a bottle or you can relax with friends and family and enjoy a glass of wine. There is indoor and outdoor seating available."

                "description": "Everything about Helotes Creek winery says southern charm. From the people to the ambiance. It is located in the old Bandera area and is surrounded by little cute antique shops/ bakeries/ and boutiques! There's are tons of tables and chairs outside on the patio under huge oak trees!   When walking inside you are greeted by all the workers at the desk. Once there you are handed a menu with the all the wines and the price for a glass/bottle.  At the bottom of the menu there is an option for wine tasting which includes trying which ever wine you would like and keeping a free wine glass for just $8! I did this option to get a chance to try all the yummy wine! They do offer discounts for teachers and military!   The majority of the wines they hand craft in house are sweet, and a few dry wines.  They get their grapes from California to Texas and Italy for some of their specialty wines! Aside from all the wines on the menu that they have all year around they also make seasonal wines, ports and frozen wine!   After trying majority of the wine. I picked my favorite, the Strawberry Riesling which was absolutely delicious. The strawberry wasn't over powering at all, I highly recommended you trying it and taking home a bottle. Or even drinking it at the winery outside or inside for a relaxing evening! My favorite part besides trying all the different wines was taking my frozen strawberry/watermelon wine outside and sitting on a patio chair in the shade while listening to Frank Sinatra playing over the speakers. I was truly in my own little heaven! I will be back on Wednesday for ladies night!"

Their known for making a variety of sweet wines, Reds, Whites and their delicious Port wines. The hit this summer is thier frozen wine slushies. They always have two rotating flavors and you can get them as a swirl if you like. On weekends you can get Sangria pitchers with fruit chunks added. If you get hungry order some cheese food trays to pair along with the wines. The place has plenty of seating inside and outside with oak trees providing plenty of shade. Make sure you check out thier merchandise, koozies and mini tumblers as well. You'll be happy you came and you'll definitely be back for more."

We came here for my bday so I guess it was a perfect time to come!   It wasn't busy at all. We got service right away, soon as we walked in. I had the wine tasting and the glass came with the price. I tasted 2 dry reds and 3 sweets. I ended up ordering a glass of Brunello and ordered my husband their Peach Chardonnay since he loves peaches.  I bought 3 of their wines and 4 of their summer size wine (similar to a beer bottle that's equivalent to 2.5 glasses of wine). Highly recommend this winery. The only con is they don't have that much wine selections and most of their wines are semi sweet- sweet. We will come here again in the future."

We are no strangers to \"blink and you will miss it\" type of venues and we had the pleasure of finding this one. Thanks to Google, and an adventures mind set. Much like any other wine tasting, we knew we were in for a variety of wines, but like in a safari, we were fortunate to have a exceptional guide like Alex who had the passion for the business like a matador. He prepared the line up like a narrator in a Broadway play making sure that every bottle had the proper presentation utilizing decanters, air aerators and precise attention to serving temperatures. But that aside, the attention to detail that is given to the wines before they even become a staple for us to enjoy that matured into voyage that complimented the experience."

We stood there for about a good 15 minutes just admiring the beauty of the scenery. Once we made our way over to the tasting room we were promptly greeted by the staff and offered samples of a couple of their summer favorites as they were not offering tasting on that day due to a special 4th of July event. We decided to go with a bottle of \"Banana Split\" which was a very affordable $16 and great tasting selection (probably not for those of you who prefer sweet wines). Once we purchased our bottle we were able to go outside and continue to enjoy the beautiful scenery, live band,  very laid back patio. Like I mentioned, on the day we visited the winery was hosting a 4th of July event so there was a live band; I'm not sure that this is always an option. We had a great time and can not wait to visit again as it is only about a 30 minute drive from our home."

Definitely worth a visit. Although we do not normally like the dry reds theirs are a bit milder and more enjoyable"

A few years ago, my husband and I bottled our own wine wand added labels for our wedding party- it was so fun since we had some bottles of wine with our parents while bottling and were also allowed to bring in snacks and sandwiches.

I can't add more to what has already been said by previous Yelpers. The staff is still knowledgeable and answers all of your questions with ease. The staff was extremely accommodating.  The server kept moving back and forth, checking on us, pouring wines at other tables, and had a smile on his face.   I had one of his award winning wines.  And, my friend tried a different award winner.  They did not disappoint.  This cute lil gem accommodates the vino aficionado as well as the novice."

Some Saturday nights they have live music. They have a wine club you can join to get bottles at a discount and many more benefits. You should visit if you like wine."

                "description": "First things first: JS is about quality not quantity!  I cannot believe I only recently discovered this store, it is truly a diamond in the rough. You will find this gem of a wine store nestled within a warehouse/industrial area. Even though they've been in business for decades they do very little advertising as they prefer the \"if you're in the know, you're in the know\" type of clientele and, yet, they have the kindest and most attentive staff waiting to greet you when you walk in.   This is the mecca for San Antonio oenophiles. I was wary of even writing a review as I want to keep this place a protected institution but I decided that if I did the review any justice then the right people who truly appreciate wine would be as thrilled as I was when I discovered this store.   If you are looking for cheap, mass produced wine then this is not the place for you. This is a boutique wine store with down to earth employees who have a passion, love, and (most importantly) expert knowledge of wine. Here you will find an unassuming building and space that has a \"home-y\" feel to it. Different staff have different areas of expertise just let them know what you are looking for - French, California, etc. What I personally appreciate is their flexibility to accommodate the needs of each patron including budget, grape, region, drinking now vs storing, building a collection,  etc.   Every wine that is on their shelf is there for a reason they are all hand picked and oftentimes from lesser known but \"well kept secret\" types of wineries throughout the world. Even more impressive is their willingness to educate and share their knowledge of the wine, winemaker, wine making process, etc. This is not a place where you run in, grab a bottle, and go home. When come here you can expect an experience - you'll be here for quite some time walking through different options, discussing and being educated on wine!   It would be remiss of me not to mention that they also have liquor and specialty cordials on hand as well, in fact, they have an entire room dedicated to them. I tend to focus on the wines  and their impressive collection which transition from region to region - Italian, French, Austrian, German, California, a handful of Texas wines, and then a hodge podge of miscellaneous \"must try\" unique wines (I'm sure I missed a few key regions my apologies in advance). I've never had a wine I didn't like from JS but more importantly I've been introduced to wines that I normally would have never tried or considered. Thank you, JS, for broadening my experiences of wines and challenging my palate in all the right ways.  A special thank you to Chelsea, who made our first visit such a wonderful experience that we are now becoming \"regulars\". We always look forward to engaging with her as she shares her love, excitement, and knowledge for French wines!"

My mother in laws birthday was coming up, and she lives in San Antonio. I live in Miami. I googled and found this liquor store by her house hoping they can deliver (of course assuming the recipient can show ID). And they agreed! Delma was so amazing and even texted me pictures of the different offerings they had. We chose a nice bottle for her, and they wrapped it up and delivered it. It truly made her day special and my life a lot easier as you can imagine the difficulties of finding something special to give to an amazing mother in law. Thank you Delma and JS!"

There's also an area for wine tasting when you do select your bottle. The store is laid out well and it's always easy to find assistance from a friendly and knowledgable associate. I love Turley Zinfandel and this is the only store near me that carries it. I also pick up some delicious olive oil from this location that I'm not able to find anywhere else. If you like your wine, I highly recommend you stop by."

                "description": "Another Saturday came and went so I did the usual which meant a trip to Saglimbeni's for their weekly wine (and sometime fine spirit) tasting.   Here's the thing, they have an unrivaled selection of wines and a hearty selection of high-end spirits. The tastings are always attended by a person \"in the know\"-- who can explain the experience in terms of source, what you should expect on the palate, and what you might team each selection with.   This time, I came away with a light, crisp South African Sauvignon Blanc I'll enjoy with the Springtime weather, and a subtle fruit old vine zinfandel. The latter is not the sweet stuff the kids drink, the flavor is more sophisticated to be sure.  The creators of Mar Azul tequila were also on hand with a full complement of their renderings. They produce a fine, peppery silver tequila along with a delightful reposado and anejo. Additionally, they have a host of what I'll call infused tequilas. Not flavored artificially or colored. These are distilled spirits. I tried them all, each very good.   I settled on banana and almond. Yes, banana tequila. It's wonderful and will be drizzled over each serving of my homemade banana pudding. I'll use the almond in my flan and in a cranberry yellow cake I've perfected over time.   I also picked up some of the fine balsamics and olive oils made, and distributed by a local vendor who shares space there. I've been cooking with these a couple years now. The new balsamic is key lime, I'll be serving it drizzled over tangelos, fresh mozzarella and basil for a light summer salad.   Although I didn't make time for the food truck, it was there. JS's is the perfect place to spend a couple hours, discover some great finds, enjoy a lunch outside at the picnic tables maybe over a newly-acquired bottle of goodness. Great place to meet friends who might enjoy the same. And to wrap this package up nicely are the employees--all friendly and professional. This is a regular go. Find time to treat yourself."

I pulled into a very cool little  Parking lot and was immediately greeted by  2 very nice women.  They offered me a  Champagne try As they helped me look for the perfect bottle. Perfect being inexpensive. This did bot bother them at all. Take in can you to treat me as Well as any of the other customers  Who were all better dressed than I.  Those who might feel uncomfortable in nicer liquor stores will feel  Quite comfortable because while they are extremely knowledgeable they are also not  Pretentious in  any way. It is hard to find such a good combination of quality and down-to-earth atmosphere especially in the world of liquor and wine.  I will definitely be returning to one the Saturday wine tastings they have every week"

I was greeted right away and they directed me to the Sardinia, Italy collection in the back. I was looking for a birthday gift for my husband who studied abroad there 20 years ago. Sardinia is a very small island off of Italy, (I was thinking maybe they had one or two choices) and the store surprisingly had a collection of about 10 wines from the region varying in prices. Will def try again!"

You have got to check this place out if just to be in awe of their wine selection.  Are you a Scotch drinker?  Look no further.  You can get a $40 single-malt or a $600 50 year old Islay.  The staff is very nice and all of them are very educated.    Check out their wine tastings on Saturdays, for an extra special treat!   This is my favorite liquor store, EVER and I have lived all over the US and visited stores in many places and this is still THE standard that I hold other wine stores to.  Needless to say,  this is the HANDS DOWN best wine store, EVER.  Enjoy!"

                "description": "Warning: this is going to be a rant.  I've been here twice now on Saturday for the wine tasting.  The first time was very enjoyable and it was just as Aliyah described in her review.  Everyone is nice, the atmosphere is very social, and  I even went home with a bottle of saki.  This weekend I went again and discovered half the crowd was the same (they must be wino's :).    My girl and I visited the front bar for a while, tried all the wines, then the back and did those as well.  I wanted to return to the front room/bar to check out some bottles on the shelves.  As I was reading a label, the employee behind the bar (different than the one from earlier) loudly said \"Hey, hey YOU! Come over here.\"  At which point he pointedly asked for my identification.  Reacting to the puzzled look I had, he offered that even he \"gets carded at the airport.\" huh?!  I have no trouble being carded in liquor/wine stores.  However, a logical policy would be to card people when they enter the store, before they are served a sample, or at checkout.  I had already been in the store for almost an hour trying the wines and I didn't see anyone else getting carded.  Also, I was in the middle of browsing!  Totally unprofessional, -3 stars from an otherwise 5 star review."

All items are 20% every Friday and Saturday.   That includes wines, pastas, spices etc.  Their overall selection is pretty satisfying and IF it is not, they may be able to order what you are looking for on your behalf.   Grappa, an older black lab that is an animal companion of the Saglimbeni family, can be seen begging for treats - don't feed him but do give him a pet on the head.  By treats I mean the yummy bread and olive oil or pate that is complimentary at each tasting.  In addition Joe's has cute napkins, gift baskets and greeting cards for sale.  Standing space can be limited and the place can get packed, but Joe's draws a nice crowd so enjoy."

Every major growing region and varietal is well represented.  The staff are extremely knowledgeable and friendly.  My wife and I have attended their FREE Saturday afternoon wine tasting 3 or 4 times.  Each time, we've enjoyed several tastes of whites, roses, and reds and naturally took home a few bottles.  In addition to wine, they have a crazy selection of spirits, many of which I'm sure you've never heard of or tasted.  The building is an odd maze of connected rooms, each with a different theme or feel.  This is wine heaven.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."

The parking situation can be a little anxiety-inducing... but I like to park around the park (take a right at the light before the store) and walk over.  This is such a little gem! They carry a LOT of different types and flavors of olive oil, cheese, wine, and spreads! I come over here and seem to find things I hadn't noticed before, all the time.   I love experimenting with different types of cooking, so having a gourmet store like this near me is really convenient.   The people who work here are also very helpful. I'm not very educated in the ways of wine and cheese (something to strive for?), and they were able to help me find a bottle (or two... don't judge!) and cheese to pair with it.   There's more! They DO have an educated wine professional come in and give tastings, EVERY Saturday! I went to one of these events, and it was a lot of fun!! The store was filled with local people, and some from around the hill country. Because of the small family feeling of the store, everyone was happy and socializing together... which can be a hard thing to accomplish these days   Lastly, (I swear!) I love that this store carries local goods. The honey alone is enough to get me in and spending money.   Check it out sometime!"

Would have given a 4 or 5 ratting, but...This year, AFTER the wine tasting they tell us it's $3 pp. and even though we purchased a bottle of wine they still charged us for the tasting. This is pretty cheap of them. Won't go back now."

I got the 6 pack (and got a % off for buying a pack) and brought them home. My husband LOVED the nitro beer I got him. I also got my mother in law a coffee ale. She said it was the best beer she had ever had and she doesn't even like beer. My father in law drank the White Stout. He said it was phenomenal.   Hats off to the owner, for helping me pick out the best beer. And hats off to this store for carrying such a great variety and quality of product! It was amazing!"

                "description": "I am new to the area and wanted to check this place out and grab a dry cappuccino after pizza yesterday, Monday October 18th around 7pm. I was unenthusiastically greeted by a girl who acted as if I was bothering her by coming into get coffee. I was asking her questions about the place and what they had and she was incredibly rude and continue to answer my questions with one word answers. No smile ever came across her face and she really made me feel uncomfortable as I was just trying to get some information about the store. My family is really big on cigars /coffee/ whiskey and I was very disappointed in the customer service or lack of customer service. I decided to push through and continue with ordering a coffee and when I asked her for a dry cappuccino she proceeded to roll her eyes and told me she didn't know how to make it and asked me what a dry cappuccino was. When I asked her \"isn't this a coffee place?\" she said \"I don't know how to make the coffee I just push the buttons\". As somebody that has been a barista and worked at a coffee shop I tried to explain to her how to make it and she just increasingly became annoyed with me. I decided to scratch the dry cappuccino just ordered a double shot of espresso which was awful by the way. As I continued to try to make small talk it was very apparent that I was not welcome there. I even asked her if she wasn't having a good day because of the way I was being treated. As I was paying, I asked her if there was a place that I could leave a review for the store she looked me dead in my eyes and said no. I confusingly asked her, \" oh you don't have a Yelp?\" She straight up told me no. As somebody that has worked in customer service I have got to say this is the worst customer service I've ever experienced and I would never treat a customer the way that I was treated. I just hope that the owners can see this and know what goes on in their store when they're not there because if I was the owner of the store I would want to know about one of my employees making people feel very uncomfortable And not being helpful at all. I made several attempts to try to turn this experience around and give her the opportunity to create a pleasant experience for me but she just acted like I was interrupting her day of sitting on the stool behind the counter. Customer service was awful coffee was awful she didn't even know how to make a dry cappuccino. If I were you I would steer clear of this place it's not worth it."

The gentleman behind the counter, Steve, is super knowledgeable about his beers and stogies. If you enjoy the nicer things, here is your place.  Better pricing than other places on both beer and cigars.   This place intentionally protects it beers and cigars from harmful UV light by putting reflective tint on the front windows and the right amount of illumination inside. That shows seriousness in what they do."

This place super surprised me, it is decked out with liquor from top to bottom, pretty much anything you could ask for. And if they don't have it, they'll get it, just for you. I was looking for a bottle of a special Asian wine, this location didn't have it but another did... and the owner, Paras, delivered it himself within an hour to the store. Owner, Paras, great person, super knowledgable, and way cool. It was Friday night and he had about 6-8 bottles out for samples and gave recommendations on best ways to drink and mix. Gotta try this place. And if you want \"high-end\" bottles, Paras is the man to talk to."

                "description": "My friends and I bought the ARC Hill Country Wine Tour from Living Social for about $30. Trying to schedule the tour was really confusing, because the system they have on their main website is not the same system/website that you book with if you have a Living Social deal (it was a bookeo.com site). My first recommendation is to include, somewhere on your website, a link to your bookeo.com site for people who have Living Social/Groupon deals. I also submitted multiple emails from the website's \"contact us\" page without any response. When I did call Alicia to check if she received my emails, she claimed that she had not, but she had yet to even ask me my name....Weird. Anyway, this could have gone alot smoother.   The actual tour was okay. My friend read reviews about Alicia showing up late, and she did. We were all on the bus for the most part and she showed up maybe 4-5 minutes late. I completely agree that she, as the business owner and tour guide, should be the first person there with the driver. Second recommendation - show up early and take care of checking people in as they arrive, not 10-15 minutes after the tour was supposed to start.   Alicia talked to us the entire way telling us the history of wine making in the Texas Hill Country, and that was really nice. We were sitting in the very back, so it was hard to hear her. I would get a small microphone to help with that, because the stuff she was saying was very informative. We went to 3 different wineries. All were excellent, and we learned alot. My favorite was Singing Water.   After the 2nd winery, Alicia put on this wine tasting dvd while we were on the bus, which was basically a \"Master of Wine\" talking about how much she knows about wine. It was insanely comical. We were all thinking \"omg is this chic serious?\" I do like that Alicia tried to give us a break from hearing her talk, and she probably needed it to, but there HAS to be some better material to show us. Please, get another dvd that is not so obnoxious. I did a quick youtube search on \"Wine 101\" and a handful of much better options popped up.   All in all, we had a fun time. I feel bad for giving only two stars, but the truth is, there is alot of room for improvement. Had I paid the full $100+ dollars for this wine tour I would be outraged. It was fine for $30 bucks though."

                "description": "I realized this would not be a professionally run operation when we got on the bus. The tour guide stood up, gave us all a big smile, and immediately said, \"I'm not going to talk much to y'all this time because I'm tired and I don't feel like it.\"   It all went downhill from there. She then told us she was not a wine expert and explained her business at length, asking us to please tip her and telling us about her money issues. Despite her first statement, she never once paused for breath the entire ride to Fredericksburg, alternatively talking about her personal taste in wine, sharing a random, vague tidbits of information about wine and Texas, and telling us more about her personal thoughts about wine and how she treated her friends who didn't appreciate it  properly. She occasionally asked questions about the groups' tastes in wine and was condescending to those who answered 'wrong.'  My seatmate and I were looking out the window during the bus ride and we occasionally whispered to each about the sites we saw on the way there since this was our first trip out to Fredericksburg. The tour guide heard our whispering and chided us like naughty schoolgirls. She then told us about another customer who asked her to stop talking so much and how she told him off as well. We were astonished.   I look younger than my age, which occasionally gets me treated in a very condescending manner, and this was one of these occasions. I was the only one she carded, which I could understand, but then she made non-stop cracks about my relative youth and taste in wine. She asked who liked sweet wines, and since I was one of the ones who raised my hand, she repeatedly told me I would someday \"grow into my big girl pants,\" assuming I was completely ignorant of good wine, that familiar creature, due to my youthful appearance.  She was also rude and/or condescending to the rest of my party and some of our fellow wine tourists. I could see why she found it necessary to repeatedly remind all of us about tipping her.   Lunch was very small and disappointing: a small turkey sandwich on dry bread, a small bag of chips, and a cookie.    The wine tastings themselves were fabulous! We really, really enjoyed the wineries when the tour guide left us to ourselves and we were allowed to chat and taste. To quote Jefferson, \"Wine brightens the life and thinking of anyone!\" We also appreciated the bathroom breaks the bus made there and back. Though we will avoid ARC like the plague, we intend to attempt a proper wine tour in that area. There are many other similarly priced wine tour options in the area that I recommend trying before this company. For a few dollars more, you can actually do three wineries in a limo with Fredericksburg Wine and Limo. Fredericksburg is lovely and the wines are fabulous!"

She didn't talk about tipping or making fun at others offensively at all. We went to 3 wineries in Federickberg. A lot of relaxing time. Lunch was satisfying. It was chicken salad sandwich with chip and cookies. The wine testing was great. I read the reviews in the past and I think Alicia has listened to all the critics and has improved the services. The only reason I gave 4 stars because before the tour took off, Alicia was late 7 min. while about 25 customers was waiting on the bus. The guide should be the first one there.  Anyway, take the tour...it was fun and nice scenery."

                "description": "My husband and I did theTexas Hill Country Wine Tour.  It  was GREAT!   Alicia was very nice and informative.  Since we are pretty new to San Antonio, She told us about all of her favorite places in the Hill Country and more.  I could not write them down fast enough.  Can not wait to try some of her other tours.I highly recommend this tour!"
