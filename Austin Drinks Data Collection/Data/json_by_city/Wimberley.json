                "description": "This place was pretty spectacular. I've been wanting to go for a while and it finally happened! It was in the low 70s and perfect weather. The hill country views are beautiful and I'd imagine sunsets here are gorgeous. Outdoor games available. Dogs on leash are allowed.   Lots of seating and an interesting idea on how to hold your seats/table. It was nice not having to worry about somebody taking our spot while playing with the animals. You can also get food for them at the bar. They were pretty gentle and didn't mind selfies.   Lots of beer, cider and wine options. I had the sweet Sangria (Messina Hof) and Cherry Cobbler by Martin House. Both delightful and fruity.   They have 2 food trucks: Gringas Grub Shak and Kelly's Hill Country BBQ. I went with Kelly's and got the Brisket Elote Parfait and it was so, so good. I want to go back just for that! There were so many options to choose from. There's really something for everyone. I'll definitely be back!"

If I remember correctly the drinks consist of beer, wine, and soda. (Water cooler is available as well)   Seating is on a first come first serve situation went on a Friday during spring break and had no problems at all!   My only con is on the day we went there were a lot of children everywhere. Running everywhere. Of course that's more so on the parents but just keep in mind that there may be a bunch of kiddos ."

Spent the birthday weekend out in the Driftwood/Wimberely area and our friends told us about this spot and we were not disappointed. Although it's kid central (which can be good or bad for some people), the views (especially for sunset) are amazing. The drinks were good. They have multiple fire pits during the winter time. Lots of seating. Llamas Ofcourse. What more could you want?!"

It the best of what the area wineries offer in terms of a place where you want to spend a leisurely couple of hours, with a great assortment of local craft beers on tap (and options for the non-beer drinkers).  I like that there is a variety of seating options (picnic tables, Adirondack chairs, barstools) and they are nicely spread out.  Aside from the view the main attraction is their resident llamas and mini donkeys, and trust me, splurge on the bag of feed for optimal up-close interaction with these adorable camelids!  | Beverages | A nicely curated selection of local beer on tap, and surely something to please everyone.  There's also a selection of cider, hard seltzer, wine, and non-alcoholic beverages.    | Eats | We didn't eat here, but there's an onsite resident food trailer offering tacos, quesadillas and burgers."

It's kid-friendly, dog-friendly (just don't let them get close to the llamas) and the views of the hill country are gorgeous. My only suggestion would be to add a really nice, healthy mocktail to the menu. We had the lemonade, but it was an artificial lime green, which was a little unappetizing."

As soon as you walk in, the chairs and hammocks out provide a nice campfire style vibe. There are a ton of trees to keep you cool, and the view of Hill Country is one of a kind. To your right, there is a small fence with adorable llama's you can feed and pet. I didn't get to try the food, but the bbq smelled incredible.  Lots of beer and wine options, and great place to bring your friends for a relaxing afternoon."

The check in is nice, you tell them how many people are in your party and they give you a table sign to reserve your spot. The beer selection is local. Wine is local as well. The llamas are an extra treat to see. You can purchase feed at the bar. The view of the valley and hill country is fantastic. This is a great place for groups, dogs and is kid friendly too.  All staff members are friendly and helpful."

                "description": "What a perfect place to enjoy a relaxed few hours on a nice weather day in the Hill Country! The Shady Llama, just west of Wimberley on the way toward Dripping Springs on RR12 is a gem of a yard bar offering Texas-based craft brews, soft drinks, and wines with a killer view and a few furry mascots to feed and pet.  Our family loves this place. We can each enjoy a tasty beverage we like, have a good lunch from the Gringa's truck we like from Wimberley, and feed some alfalfa to some llamas and burros.  There are plenty of socially-distanced places to lounge around the terraced and tree-shaded yard, and everything is outdoors. It's actually perfect for pandemic times.  Pro-tip: do not try to come here during any weekend with special events in Wimberley, like Market Days or Rodeo. The parking lot has limited capacity. Lazy Sundays are the best time IMHO."

Plenty of great drinks on tap as well as friendly bartenders.   The bae and I came here after a swim at the neighboring Blue Hole Regional Park. Short 11min drive will get you to Shady Llama from Blue Hole.  The star of the show is the petting zoo featuring the llama and two donkeys. You can get up and personal with the llama by feeding and petting. I was a little hesitant to get too close because who knows if he'll spit.  The view of Texas Hill Country is breathtaking and you could sit here for hours just taking it all in. There were two food trucks on site offering tacos and bbq.  THE FINAL BAMBOO: The vibe here was so nice. Great place to unwind after long day at the pool or chill with friends until dusk."

                "description": "Judging from the recent reviews, I guess I'm in the minority. But I miss pre-COVID Shady Llama.  It's just not the same and the magic is gone. Given that literally 100% of the place is outside,  their COVID protocols are way over the top.   Why do you need to assign picnic tables??   And all the hammocks are gone (risk of transmission is greater from canvas than wood??).  At least they stopped doing the inane requirement of reservations they were doing for a while.   So if you're uber paranoid and love restricted freedoms maybe it won't be an issue for you.    But it just made my wife and I sad to be back (1st time in a year and pre-pandemic we were regulars).   Yes they have good beer, and higher prices now to offset the fact that people obviously aren't flocking there like they used to.  And the view is great and it's fun to see the llamas and if you never went before maybe you'll be none the wiser.  But for me it's just a sad reminder of what it used to be and a testament to how much fear and paranoia have all but ruined our country.   I won't be back until they restore everything to pre-pandemic protocols."

                "description": "Just all sorts of whimsical in brewery form.  Their table designation decor they give you at the front so you can claim your spot without fear of anyone scooping it up when you're grabbing a beer or going to gawk at the llamas or mini donkeys is adorbs and shows attention to detail and a winning customer service experience right off the bat.   The tables are spread out nicely and there's plenty of shaded options or exposed ones, depending on your tolerance for the sun/heat.   It's actually on top of a hill so you can get a lovely panoramic vista of Hill Country, so you better believe if you're there at sunset, you'll be getting a gorgeous setting to close out on.   They don't brew their own beer (or wine), so they offer up a glimpse of Texas' finest on tap, which I appreciate. During COVID, every order came with chips or a treat (from a Costco assortment), but there's also a taco truck in the back if you're looking for something a little more substantive.   Kid and dog friendly, and since there are cute animals roaming the grounds (but fenced away from the tables), there are a lot more kids also roaming the grounds, so if that's not your thing, this may not be the place for you ;)  They have 6 llamas and two mini donkeys, and while the guy checking us in made it seem a sighting of them is rare unless you get there right when they open because that's when feeding time is, they were ever present during our midday visit. You can purchase feed for $1/bag to lure them over, and so I have a feeling we just had an extra generous crowd that day that always kept them fence curious!"

The lady on the other end of the call was quite nice suggesting they had PLENTY of space for our cars to park.  Well, they weren't wrong. Quite possibly the best photo opportunity of the entire weekend. Our attendees overlooking 24 cars perched in the beautiful trees of Hays County overlooking some of Mazda's genius. Free samples of crafted rum too?   I'd call that a win! Owners were quite attentive as soon as we arrived. Telling us the story of the brand; walking us through each tasting.

                "description": "Tucked away behind Wimberely mear Jacobs Well stands a small distillery with a small bar and large patio.   They offer free samples of the three different whiskeys with one of them being bourbon barrel aged using Rebecca Creek barrels.   The staff was friendly and well informed on the products. Currently they are distributing to smaller local stores and will start distributing to more stores in the future.   As it is August right now we couldn't tour the distillery because it was too hot but we were informed that the tours would start in October when it cools off.   The bottles are decently priced for hand crafted rum like this.   There are plenty of tables and chairs for groups, drink cocktails were decently priced, and property is a great change from the city."

They have a food truck on site. Their mojito was refreshing. They even let me be part of the cocktail making process. The owners were super friendly. For those that want to taste before buying, they offer free rum tastings."

The patio area in the trees was beautiful and they had this nice swing. I had the drink with the pineapple and vanilla rum.....sooooo good! It was so good my husband grabbed a bottle so we can drink it at home. If you're touring the area i would recommend coming here early and just enjoying the scenery and the lovely conversation with the guy at the bar!"

                "description": "Laura guided my boyfriend and my tour through the distillery.  She tries to schedule them so each party has a separate tour.  It's a really nice touch, because it shows they aren't trying to blow through tours by combining as many people as they can into one group.  The tours are $5.  We emailed her to set ours up.  We started with a tasting.  Laura had bartended for several years before the business started, so she made us a Vanilla Rum mixed drink in a sample cup.  It was nothing short of delicious.  Absolutely fantastic drink.  Atfer that, the tour started.  Laura explained how the business started up, showed us the distillery and explained all the functions, and then showed us the bottling room.  She answered all of our questions and was very personable.    We concluded the tour with 1 more sampling of their normal rum combined with a mixer.  Again, a totally refreshing drink.  We stayed and talked to Laura for about 20 minutes after and were on our way.  This was a great experience.  It's a humble distillery with a growing presence.  They've won a couple of major awards and you can definitely they definitely love what they do.  Makes for a really enjoyable tour."

                "description": "This place is the cutest, most quaint little gem.  If there's a local distillery, I always want to try out their goods.  I didn't expect it to be at someone's home, though!  Not that it's a bad thing.  Rum, for me, is a take it or leave it type spirit.  I typically use it only in cocktails.  I don't think I've ever wanted to sit down with a glass of rum.  Now bourbon?  That's a different story.    On arrival, I just expected a tasting only, but they actually make cocktails.  They have a small menu, or you can request whatever you want from the mixers they have.  Mojito?  Of course.  Want to go dive with a great rum and just some Coke?  They won't judge you for that, either.  They make their own version of Rumchata in house and it was SO DELICIOUS.  For real.  And they'll give you the recipe.    Pick your favorite of the three varieties: Crystal, Gold, Vanilla and buy a bottle.  Then pick up a bottle of vanilla extract.  If you don't cook, make your mom very happy.  That stuff is fantastic.  In the hotter months, don't be a jerk and demand a tour of the actual distilling barn.  We all know how distilling works.  If not, the internet is your friend.  They don't want to be in the high temperatures, and neither do you.  Let them explain the process to you while you sip a nice, cool drink instead."

It was a little expensive and no tours are offered but the tastings are free which is a nice change to the other places we have been.   Make sure you try the vanilla rum and take a turn on the tree swing! My nephew loved it.   Wish they would have more signs.... the first was easy, then we were feeling lost."

                "description": "The best part of this distillery is the location...a country vibe that is beautiful. Now for the bad news...The rum is a strange flavor. I have been to other rum distilleries and have never stumbled upon such a \"harsh\" flavor that could never be drank alone. That being written we decided to have a drink on the patio...I'm glad alcohol kills germs because the guy serving us had the dirtiest hands and fingernails I have ever seen in my life and I have children. For example when he grabbed our glasses from the cabinet it left a dirty grip mark. I was pretty much grossed out. It's too bad because again the location is great."

                "description": "How sweet is David, distiller, maker, and bottler of Cypress Creek Reserve? Let's examine the facts:. -- He led us through a tour of his small but highly functional distillery. -- He answered all of our questions about the process he uses, and even showed us some of the machine parts he's made. -- His wife made us two (nicely sized) tasters: a mojito, and another thing I drank even faster than the mojito that tasted like a lemon drop.  $5 each later, we skipped right down to Wimberley Valley Spirits to get ourselves a bottle, because the law is mean and David can't sell any of the goods on the premises.  Stupid Republicans, or something.  Now we check out our unopened souvenir, plotting and planning, totally giddy that we pulled into that questionable-looking lot with the signage for rum. Who were we to say no?"

My husband loves the beers and gets excited to try each seasonal release. I am not a big drinker but honestly just go for the atmosphere- super relaxed, nice spot in nature, our kids ages 3 and 6 beg to go bc they have a fun area to run around and gravel with construction toys to play with. We usually order a few appetizers and sit under the trees or an hr watching the kids tire themselves out."

                "description": "As good as it gets!! I have always loved their farmhouse ales (Ona is probably my favorite dark saison in existence but I'm also so happy about their lager program starting up.   It's great to have refreshing approachable pilsners for people that aren't quite ready to walk on the (beer) wild side. If you're ready to go a little wild I definitely suggest their cave aged beer (the premiere has a little funkyness but it's not too crazy, like overripefruit and sourdough bread) we loved it and it feels really fun to pop a cork out in the texas sunshine.   You can always count on Roughhouse to make something creative and unique and if you come to the taps with an open mind you definitely won't be disappointed. They have beers to go in bottles and cans too which is lucky bc some of the high abv ones are really the best (but I can't have them before driving, ha!!)   Great food for snacking, we got a bbq sandwich and really liked the bbq sauce, we ended up getting extra so we could dip our chips in it lol  The setting is hard to beat, plenty of shade outside with abundant picnic tables, plus there is an air conditioned loft if you just can't handle the heat!"

I love the shaded outdoor picnic tables, and there is even a fire pit for s'mores ($3 to buy the kit)! The beer is delicious and fresh and they have a menu of farm to table foods. My husband and I tried the salsa (made from the goodies in their on-site garden) and it is the best I've had with the right amount of heat. We were able to buy a quart of it to take home- yummy!  This is definitely a great place to hangout with the pups and to get some fresh, countryside air while enjoying an acoustic band and some fresh beer served by the friendliest people."

Admittedly, my hop-soaked beer taste buds may not be par with a more astute beer connoisseur, but bad beer is bad beer. Tis a shame: this place is a true retreat. The Austin-indie-jazz duo provided an eclectic sound which paired perfectly with this serene outdoor haven.   Their flight card/cart is cool...it's dog friendly....there's a cactus.  The point is, what can you do when the beer's bad but move on and find another place.   I'm also slightly irked when businesses refuse legal tender."

                "description": "A group of us drove in to get some beers on a hot early evening/late afternoon after shopping at San Marcos Outlets. And if you're debating whether or not to make that drive--do it. You're welcome.  Roughhouse has THE space, service-oriented people backing it up AND...(the most important part for all of us beer nerds) a delicious lineup of their own beers. We drove in and were surprised to find that it was tucked in at the end of this residential street. There is plenty of space here though--it gave us Jester King and TX Keeper Cider vibes with the \"outback\" far out drive that make you feel like you've escaped the busy city/town life. Parking is abundant in the gravel area, and from the moment you arrive you know it's going to be a wholesome good time.  We could hear the live band out there that day, and we saw people with their dogs and kids. So awesome when breweries allow all people and furry friends! There's a kitsch pickup truck out front and a huge wooden cottage-like space that is the microbrewery. The interior feels much more quaint and modern, so get out your hipster glasses and handkerchiefs, millenials! I enjoyed my flight of beers for $12. My favorite beers were Treeform IPA and Floral Print. I ended up taking a Treeform home, and the label is so tastefully done with an earthy and spritely flavor.   We also ordered burgers (that come with mac and cheese! SO ooey gooey), and I gotta say their black bean veggie burger was not bad. I'm critical of veggie burgers because most people just slap it on the grill and that's it...or they just give you a thick piece of Portobello between two slices of bread. Not at Roughhouse! We also enjoyed a game of cornhole and can confirm they also have large Jenga. They have clean restrooms and serve-yourself water. Wifi is strong and it's a guaranteed a good time. Will definitely be back. Can't wait to see them grow and expand in the community."

It is a bit out of town yet that contributes to its uniqueness. If you like non-traditional American food then you will like the menu and can try something new and tasty."

The beer is good, the employees are friendly, and the venue offers socially distanced picnic tables under some nice shade trees. There was live entertainment when we visited. Great way to spend a Sunday afternoon."

                "description": "Roughhouse Brewing is the cutest husband and wife brewing company in Texas!   If you're in the San Marcos area, this is a great place to spend the day drinking some delicious farm-style beer, wine and ciders in an absolutely gorgeous wooden barn.   The building alone is worth the drive, but the Treeform IPA is what kept me smiling ear to ear! One of the best IPAs I've ever had.   Our Saturday trip included some really nice tunes by a local acoustic guitar player on the stage in the backyard. We had a very large group in town for a funeral, and there was plenty of seating outside for us all and the staff was incredibly accommodating, offering everyone samples since we were all first timers.   We don't make it out to San Marcos often, but this will definitely be a place we visit every chance we can. Great job! We wish you nothing but the best!!"

They spent the pandemic brewing up some tasty new beers to add to their already delicious standards, I think Good might have replaced Third Coast as my favorite while Evil has supplanted my husband's usual Juicy Visions. And have to give a shout-out to the edition of the Burger Truck--wonderful, especially the bacon/Brussels sprout combo (I know, sounds weird but so good!). We were so worried about our local hang-outs surviving the pandemic and couldn't be happier that Middleton not only survived but is coming back stronger than ever."

                "description": "I'm going to get this out of the way real quick.  There was a cat walking around on the bar.  Yes, you heard me.  ON THE BAR.  I knew it was a dog friendly place, but come on - a cat ON the bar?  It even walked over to my side of the bar, sat down, put its leg behind its head like cats do, and then proceeded to lick its butt in front of me.  Hey cat, I'm really impressed that you can do that, but you're not getting a tip from me.  The staff member that it belonged to shooed it away, but it stayed on the bar.  Subtract one star for this show.  Next up:  As I said, it's dog friendly.  VERY dog friendly.  There were two dogs belonging to customers roaming around freely inside the place.  A third dog was on a leash, but it kept barking at the other dogs.  This wasn't outside on the patio, this was all inside.  When I go somewhere to hang out and relax, I don't want to deal with barking dogs (in my book, it's akin to bringing screaming kids into a bar).  Subtract one star for letting the dogs inside.  Keep the cats and dogs *outside* and this would be a five star brewery to chillax at.    Beer:  They have a decent selection of brews and like most breweries, they have some permanent ones and some seasonals that rotate in and out.  They have five or six store bought wines available.  Staff:  VERY knowledgeable about their beer and can suggest something for you once you describe your taste palette to them.  Food:  The food truck out front is permanently hitched up here, the one in the back changes occasionally.    Plenty of seating inside and outside, there's even a spacious deck on the second floor.  Growler refills are $14 and crowlers are $9.40 (buy three crowlers and get 10 percent off).  If your selection is over 8 percent ABV, additional charges may apply.   One more note about the dogs and I'll put this puppy to bed.  There's a fenced off area downstairs to let your dogs run rampant in - put them in there instead of bringing them inside - or better yet, leave them at home.  This whole thing with people bringing their dogs everywhere is getting out of hand.    I was going to give them two solid stars, but now that I think about it, if they let cats run back and forth across their bars, how clean is their brewing process?  It's a cool place with good brews, and I want to like it, but when I think about the animals everywhere, I think twice about what might be in the beer."

                "description": "I'm giving this place one star for the burger truck. Our beers were good and I like the atmosphere inside. The guy in the burger truck was SO rude. The table next to us also had multiple issues with their orders that they were loudly complaining about. I asked for the loaded tots with no beef and he said he couldn't ring them up that way. We weren't asking for a discount, just remove the beef???? So then he said to get regular tots and add cheese and onions/jalapeños. What did we get? Plain tots. He was also so fricking unfriendly. The table next to us retired a burger that had the bun top black/burned, and apparently he complained about redoing it. Brewery needs to rethink this employee."

                "description": "Middleton is a must if you're stopping by or even in the general area.  We were driving from Wimberley (a fun day at Jacob's Well) towards the San Marcos outlets, and had to double back even to come to Middleton! We were so glad we did. My bf even walked out with their peach crowler...just a warning though, bring a cooler of some sort so it doesn't explode in your car with the heat! Totally speaking from personal experience, sadly.  We shared two rounds of tasters, which come with 5 different selections. So come with friends and try them all! You'll be surprised at how delicious they all are. Middleton is also HEAVEN for Belgian lovers. Good thing we love Belgians. Little did I know that a microbrew outside of Austin would be a great place for craft Belgians. I'm an all-around beer lover--everything except saisons, NE pale ales, and lagers, whereas the bf is a Belgian enthusiast. He always goes for Belgians. So you can imagine why we decided to get a taste of everything Belgian. I also enjoyed their Easy Ride PA, but was not a fan of the chile IPA (to each their own). It was almost impossible for me to compare and contrast the beer quality to the all-around atmosphere of the place. It oozes joy and love--they have brew dogs (and customers can bring doges too) who basically just lie around and nap, PLUS they have popcorn that is self-serve from those tiny machines that you see in Disneyland and other carnival events.  Will definitely be back to Middleton. Clean restrooms, and large space indoors for bigger groups (WITH TV's!) and cool fun outdoors games like human jenga outside. There is plenty of parking in their private loose, gravel parking area, and they had a food truck parked right outside. Awesome spot, great beer, fantastic space!"

I will confess I am not a huge beer lover but my friends are and were raving about this place so we  stopped by to watch the Euro Cup game between Germany and Italy.  The brewery is well design with great bar space and patio area. Dogs are welcome so bring your pup, children not so much ;-).   Step up to the bar and build your own beer flight you get five picks of 2-3 ounces each for $12. There wasn't a beer I didn't like! From the Porter to the American Red there were all good!   Live band was great and the two flat screens more than met our soccer watching needs.  So if your looking for a place to get your hops fix in the Texas Hill Country this is it!"

                "description": "A MUST for anyone looking for an essential hill country experience. Delicious beer in a variety of styles. Wonderful atmosphere.   2 world famous brewery mascots; Pinky the dog (as white and large as Gandalf's horse). Dunkel the cat (omnipresent and all-knowing)  Dunkel is the sweetest cat and deserves to be in the brewery hall of fame. Some heartless punk in the reviews below complained about Dunkel. This same guy has a Lonestar beer as his profile pic, so at least we know he has ZERO brewery review credibility.   As a result Dunkel's been banned from the taproom. So, Thank you, Lonestar bro, for driving out from your big city to a enchanting, rural, authentic hill country brewery and complaining about an animal for no good reason.   Knowing the type of compassionate, animal-loving people who frequent this place, I'm sure we can rally together to #FREEDUNKEL."

And, there is plenty of beer to try. The location is between Wimberley, Canyon Lake and San Marcos...As the Hill Country grows, places love me this are a great option for all those migrating South!"

                "description": "My wife and I took my cousin and his wife for a visit on a quiet weekend. My wife and I are avid animal lovers and thus it's hard to describe our feelings about this place. On entering, there were numerous dogs wandering around and a cat walking across the bar, and after we sat down there were animal feces and urine on the floor. Needless to say, this was offputting to our group. Unfortunately, we did not notice the animal waste until we had already ordered. The service was average and somewhat lackluster. Nobody checked on us after we ordered our beer. As for the beer, it was good quality craft beer but nothing stood out at us. Take him away the issues with the animal waste, we still would not have found this an impressive venue and probably would not return. This is truly a shame, given the place's 4.5-star reviews on Yelp."

Beverage selection: beer, soft drinks and some drink creations they make from their beers. Beer selection was over a dozen, about half  were IPAs. No porters, no stouts, especially for this time of year.  Overall sampling of selections was nothing to rave about, very little body and no depth in flavor. Bar staff was polite and busing the entire place. Unisex bathrooms need regular attention, bar staff should not have to do that too.  Overall impression: we won't drive to Dripping for Twisted X as a destination in the future."

A food truck offering tacos and other Mexican snacks is parked on the premises.    Beer offerings are good with a varied selection.  Available on the day we visited, was chupaHOPra IPA, Mango IPA, Oatmeal Stout, Zwickle, Pilsner, Lager, Pale Ale and a few guest beers.  Flights available, $2 a taster for a very generous pour. Good flavor profiles to the ones we sampled.  2 bathrooms available. Out of toilet paper and not very clean on the day we were there.  Dogs are welcome, however, the outside seating area isn't huge.  Cornhole outside and the COOLEST carved tree you have ever seen!  Worth a stop and a beer just to appreciate the giant gargoyle and sombrero-wearing iguana."

We got a few beers then went on a tour. Very cool behind the scenes look of how they do everything in house!  Came back and told the bar manager we trusted him to put together a flight for us.

On the Sunday that we visited it was too darn hot to enjoy their patio even with their Big Ass Fan. Inside was cool and comfy as we ordered a couple of their taproom only specialty brews and enjoyed the live music. A shoutout to the guitar player who finished his set with a great Spanish guitar-led song.   So bring the mutt and your kiddos (there is plenty of room for both them to run around outside) and enjoy a few of their wonderful craft beers.  Be sure to check out their website for taproom only beers and new releases!"

                "description": "I had been meaning to check this place out for a while.  I have been a big fan of their Chupahopra for quite some time and finally made the pilgrimage.    The brewery has nice curbside appeal.  The structure is nicely done and their is a little area for the doggies.  Of note, dogs are also allowed in the tasting room.   There is also a food truck there.  The inside is your typical tasting room with an industrial look.  It is nicely done.  The bartenders are good.    The prices are right.  I would recommend the flight so you can try ones.  I really think they do a good job on the IPAs.  Their beers are quite good.   But of all of them, i favor the Chupahopra!"

                "description": "Visited for the first time this past Saturday. There as a good crowd, busy but not packed, and we had no problem grabbing two seats.   It's not a huge place, but they have tables and chairs outside, an outdoor patio section and then some indoor. You can also sit at the bar. They had live music while we were there (a single guy and a guitar which was pleasant and not overwhelming, and there is a food truck on site. Plenty of parking as well.   We told the girl behind the bar it was our first time, and she did a great job of talking about the beers. I'm not an IPA fan so she recommended the German lager, which I found to be delicious. My friend got the mango IPA which he also liked a lot. And a good price at $5 per glass.   They have tours twice a day but we missed it as well as merch for sale. All in all, I found it to be a great place to hang out on a Saturday afternoon and it's in close proximity to Salt Lick and other wineries/breweries. Definitely make it part of the list to stop at!"

Me and my husband each did a wine  flight and picked our favorite sips and ordered a glass each which we enjoyed on the fabulous patio.  I love that with every flight purchase included is a souvenir wine  glass. Flights and by the glass were very reasonable given the type of wine  served.  We ended up enjoying our time so much that we came back an additional day.  I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to sip on some delicious wine ."

We had to wait about an hour for their food and in the meantime we had a glass of Astoria Moscato and watermelon wine on the porch. The weather was perfect and this created a whole mood. We then proceeded to their wine tasting room and tried some of their best wines. I've got to say the Astoria Moscato was their best. At least for those who like sweet wine. My husband liked many of their dry wines as well. Definitely going back with the kids so they can pet the donkeys in the neighboring pastures."

However, do not fret if you didn't, because the grounds are stunning. You can order a glass or a bottle, no judgment ;), from their double decker bus, that gave me some serious harry potter vibes. Then take it and enjoy the view. There is ample sitting. I would love to come back with reservations of course, and try a flight in their beautiful tasting room."

Plenty of outdoor space to social distance along with animals to interact with: donkies, goats and miniature horses! A decent selection of wines with one standing out in particular to our taste-buds, can't remember the name specifically but it was red wine cherry blend, maybe seasonal?   The staff is friendly, place was very easy to find, there is a bit of construction going on in and around the place but it's not too big of an annoyance to take away from the overall great experience."

The tasting reservation process was pretty easy. The tasting price is very fair (5 glasses for $18) and the pours were generous. The wines were very good. I left with a couple of bottles. I definitely recommend the Christmas Cuveé and the Sangria wine. Once you finish your tasting, there is plenty of space outside on the patio or other areas to just sip more wine and just be.  A lovely experience."

I did like the outdoor patio and the arrangement of all the things. I enjoyed the red wines that they had. I really liked the season fruit wines--tasted like juice with how fruity they were (I mean that in a good way).   The food truck also served some pretty solid food. Really enjoyed the chili and cheese tator tots. The pizza was good too! The burger was a little disappointing though.   All in all, nice place to visit! Come check it out!"

We made a reservation for a tasting. Well worth it to learn about the types of wine. The staff is knowledgeable and nice. It is a comfortable environment and you can ask many questions. After the tasting we ordered a glass each and went outside. We ordered a pizza from the mobile kitchen. It was wonderful!  I suggest going on a beautiful day and enjoy wine, good food and sunshine!"

After our hour of tasting 5 wines, we bought two bottles and went out to the property to enjoy the day and the live music. We had a perfect spot beside the musicians (who were very very good) and had an amazing view of the property. I was at peace with all the elements in place.

                "description": "This is my second time visiting this winery. I loved it the first time and it left an impression on me to go back. Because of Covid, they are doing tastings by reservations only so that they can control number of people and properly space out in their tasting room. I'm sure you'll love a bottle to buy and you'll have ample time and space to enjoy it on their deck or yard after your tasting. Our tasting guide, Robert, was very knowledgeable about the different wines and a joy to converse with! They do have a good truck on their premises that bakes wood fire pizzas. I didn't try any this time because we already had brunch before coming. The port was my favorite wine. You've got to try it for yourself!"

                "description": "A year later and Wimberly Valley Winery is just getting better!  Our friends are members here and we joined them to go out and pick up their wine. While we were there we had a tasting.  They now have a full line up of \"fruit\" wines like Blackberry, Cherry and cinnamon, honey crisp apple, and others. They are on the sweeter side but for me were seriously tasty! I loved the cherry and the blackberry.  However at this time of year it is the mulled wine that truly wins the day for me! If you haven't had mulled wine I suggest you get off your butt, drive the distance, and sample some right now! It is so worth it!  A hearty and loud Ooooh my Goddie toooo Hottie to this wonderful glass of spiced wine that is served hot! It brings flashes of warm fire places, deep snow, thick sweaters and holiday cheer with every sip. It is my absolute favorite!  They are adding more structures to the location, the outside area is a divine place to grab a bottle and just sit and soak up the outdoors while enjoying a good sip with friends, and the inside is a great lush environment of comfy lodge like decor.  It is a great location with good people and a great selection of wines... not only theirs but a plethora of other wines as well. We always enjoy our time here!   One last note.... try the mulled wine! It is the holiday season in a bottle!"

They don't even use Texas grapes so these are all from out of state and only a handful are barrel aged. They were basic and not anything special. We came for a tasting so we tried a total of 5 different wines each (10 between the two of us.) They even serve store bought wines here!!! I've NEVER been to a winery that serves what I can buy myself at HEB. They didn't tell you anything about the wines other than \"this is dry and fruit forward,\" no explanation of the grapes used, how long its aged, etc that we've become used to at other wineries. Also the alcohol content must be very low in thier wines, we went on empty stomachs and neither of us felt a thing which is not the case at other wineries we've been to. I'd give it a try if you're in the area, but don't expect much. The grounds are nice and they have a cute double decker bus they converted but for us one visit was plenty."

My niece and nephew love taking carrots for the horses and donkeys and kicking the soccer ball around. The venue is just beautiful and even when their are tons of people there it just doesn't feel crowded, the layout is perfect.    The wine is top notch. I  like sweeter wines so most on the menu suits me but they have some dry wine as well for folks who love a dry red or white.  Slushes in the summer, warm spiced wine in the winter, fruit wines in the fall ... this place has it figured out!  Grab a Cheese tray and hang out for an hour or stay all day!"

                "description": "The drive is as peaceful as the landscape is serene. Like everything in and around Austin, there's a sense of \"for now...\"   And that's why Vista Brewery is a smart play. It may be a drive out of the way now but soon it'll be right in the middle of everything.   Hopefully not too soon...  On a cold, sunny day, the grounds are a welcomed sight for adults and kids alike. The two buildings are new and impressive but not imposing on the landscape.  Now, the beer. The stouts were quite impressive. They were smooth and strong with a distinct personality. I tasted three of their stouts, loved all three for different reasons. My wife had a couple ales and was equally impressed.  The food was acceptable but not something to write home about. I feel like they could take it to the next level if they brought on 1-2 food trucks but I get that may not be in the cards for now.  All said, it offers something for everyone and you're bound to leave happier than you came in."

                "description": "Really like the venue and that they've completely opened back up. Looks like a great spot for a group event or private party.   Dog friendly. Plenty of parking. Seating inside and out. Small menu with plenty of Biergarten faves.   Just wasn't digging the beer this time. We did a couple of flights and sampled 8 different brews. The Blonde Ale was okay. Hubby and I both liked the Destination IPA. He likes the Dark Skies. Overall, the beer was a little off. Maybe next time."

The staff was welcoming and extremely helpful and the venue was stunning! All of our guest commented on the amazing food. We could not have dreamt up a more perfect location. Thank you to the staff at Vista!"

                "description": "Wonderfully off the beaten path.  I absolutely loved the modern space inside but also the very rural outdoor space. Wonderful areas for kids to play and adults to chill. Lots of great beer options for everyone no matter what your taste is. I tried the Everything is Aussome - an Aussie sparkling ale. It tasted a lot like an IPA to me. I may have expected it to be a bit lighter in taste but still a great bold flavor. Great for groups, family picnics, or just a fun day out to relax. Definitely worth the stop in the area."

                "description": "Beautiful spot, used to be great.  Beer is pretty rough these days.  Food offerings were always a bit comically small before the pandemic, but delicious, now they're just overpriced and not very good.  I miss the friendly staff, seems like they cycle through staff pretty regularly now.  It's a long drive and probably not worth it  these days.  This place used to be the absolute best.  The beer was epic.  Such a shame."

                "description": "This brewery should be on everyone's stop if your going to Salt Lick just down the road. Stopped here on Friday night and caught the tail end of their acoustic live music set which they happen to do every Friday night. They stage by far is the best set up I've seen In the area under a natural oak tree with twinkling lights scattered above. Could easily see this place being a great wedding venue. They also had a nice little hiking trail where there's additional seating and a kids playground located further down. Now let's talk about the beer and the brewery. The brewery is huge and has a nice modern approach with a little Texas flare. As far as beers I ended up trying a flight and by far definitely grab a Barton creek gold on a hot summer day. If your looking more of a full bodied beer destination ipa would be my choice. Can't wait to come back here once the weather starts to cool down."

                "description": "I haven't found another brewery on the level of Jester King, but Vista brewing got the job done. It has a great location right by Deep Eddys and Salt Lick BBQ, which allows you to make a nice day trip out of it.  Starting with the service, my party and I were seated immediately and were served. For drinks, we ordered  1. Adair 2. Zwickled  All the beers were excellent, especially the Adair.  For food, we ordered  1. Pretzel  2. Brisket Sandwich   The food was also great and a lot better tasting than other breweries, for sure. I did think it was interesting to have brisket pastrami cold, but it was still solid.   Overall, I will definitely come back to the spot because they have great food and even better beer."

We were looking for a tap room, since Texas doesn't let you buy beer beer before noon on a Sunday.  Vista has a huge outdoor seating area and they have a real good beer menu. I got two IPAs. They had snacks you can buy as well and I got a beanie and they had stickers if you ask.  Very nice people at the bar and lots of COVID appropriations were in place. Their free was was super good as well!  A really great place to try!"

                "description": "Came here on a Saturday evening, was pretty easy to get a reservation and their patio had tons of open space. They did a great job of enforcing masks when people aren't seated at their table and made it easy for us to keep distance while in line.   Their beer selection is very diverse, so I opted for a flight in my first round. I was pleasantly surprised they allowed you to include their more expensive barrel series in the flight which made the 4 4oz pours for $12 a great deal. While those were tasty my favorite was the dark Pilsner, for such a dark beer it had a more mellow, malty flavor than you would expect.   Food wise it was fairly typical brewery fare, but the $1 hunks of watermelon really hit the spot on a hot August evening.   If you're looking for a brewery a little outside of Austin to escape the city for an evening I'd definitely recommend checking them out!"

There is something there for everyone including the wine lover, most of these breweries only cater to brewing beer but Vista also has a good selection for wine. They always have cool food trucks with tasty items to round out A wonderful visit that you won't forget anytime soon. It also has a wonderful playground for kids and a band that's just the right amount for a venue like this. Bring your friends your family you're out of town cousins because this place is all that and a bag of chips."

                "description": "Vista Brewing is one of the Breweries exempt from the new closed bar order (during Covid19) because of their food to alcohol  sales ratio.  We were excited to make a reservation for a special occasion and were assured (by way of Facebook messenger) that their \"kitchen was open and ready for business\".   We arrived, ready for some good beer and food.  First disappointment:  Their reservation check in system.  A chalkboard sign indicated a table for to-go order pick ups and simply an arrow for reservations.  No employee to greet, direct or be helpful.  2 employees filling to go orders as we stood in what we estimated to be the 'reservation' line.  Several people were behind us when 2 young women cut in front of us and said loudly \"Will you take walk ins\" and to our astonishment they got an employee's attention who completely ignored us and helped them get a table.   Very rude!  Once we were checked in we found a table in the shade and went to get our  beers and food.   Disappointment #2:   No food.  Only popcorn and a cheese plate.  That was it.  We told them we had been assured over messenger that their kitchen was open and they shrugged and said  \"Don't know what to tell you.  It's being renovated.\"     I can't understand how they are allowed to stay open with beer and POPCORN sales as food, under the Governor's new restriction.   At this point we already had our beer so we went back to the table to make the best of it.  Disappointment #3:   the amount of flies and mosquitoes. We go out to another \"farm style brewery\" frequently and have never had an issue with flies or mosquitoes like we did here.   Maybe it's one brewery using a spray service vs. not?  Maybe it's dog poop from being a dog friendly brewery (although, so is the other farm Brewery we go to...)  We had 4 mosquito bites while sitting there and this was at 5:00.  Flies were insane.  It was a disappointment all the way around as we had really been looking forward to several hours of relaxation, beer and food out under the trees.  Added on 7/11:  I have not changed a word of my original review, however I am adding a Star based upon the great communication I have had with one of the owners, Kent, who wrote to me after my original review.  He seemed genuinely interested in my feedback and responded in a very thorough manner."

We love sitting indoors and outdoors depending on the weather and like that we have that option. They have live music on weekends and the beer/wine selection is good. Pre-covid their food was farm to table and delicious. We're anxiously awaiting the return on their standard food items. Definitely a great place to check out!"

I didn't realize the current menu is because of covid. The sandwiches were all cold. The pimento cheese dip was good but hard because it's also cold. Literally everything came out of the fridge as they handed it to us.   It was a terrible first impression. I understand it's covid, but I think they could've at least heated the sandwiches or tried to make some better food that can be packaged.   Great venue. Not sure I'll come back."

Plenty of seating in and out.  lots of room for the kids to run about and having a great staff about was wonderful.   only ding was the coordination / distribution of food.  Basically they ran out for our guests, and well, there is nothing you can do about it.   Events are hard to plan for, especially with family and kids, so we will work with them next time to better handle the food service / serving.   The beer was good, the wine selection was pretty good.   What i liked the most was the atmosphere. on a cool evening, with the stars out, it was a great place to be to unwind and chill with friends / family.    Plenty of parking..   Finding the place...well, thats tricky.  See punch in the address in Google Maps, you will be ok, just know that when you get close, slow down, and know the entrance is on top of a hill ... so you can miss it if you are not paying attention.   will I go back: of course, and I would recommend you go and visit."

                "description": "First time ever at Vista! Also first draft beer (not Crowley/growler) since beginning of lockdown. Such a great spot.   COVID: Vista has a GREAT outdoor area with plenty of tables distanced from one another. The ordering process specifies 6 ft of distance in line. Hand sanitizer is everywhere. Beers are delivered in single use cups. They have also started their live music Fridays again where you can venmo the artist tips. Masks are required everywhere but at your table.  You can make a reservation on Open Table for their outdoor area. Currently, they are open until 8PM.  We brought our own chairs and a blanket to use as a tablecloth. We also brought our own glasses to pour the beers into. I love beer out of a glass so this was a need for me.   Overall: This brewery has a ton of good stuff going for it. It's a little out of the way for Austinites (40 minutes), so you've got to make a night out of it. We're generally bigger IPA fans, so there are a few breweries we would check out ahead of this one. BUT they still have a ton of great beers on tap, and it is so worth checking out."

The cocktails at this place are great! The most popular is their frozen margarita, you have to try it. If you really just want to get a feel for what Sotol tastes like though, try ordering the flight first.   For food, there is a food truck on the premises. I think they switch it up but when I went it was a Mexican food truck with very good Birria tacos."

Very Instagramable location with the truck outside and the silo.   PARKING I went when it was pretty busy. I found parking but I did have to wait for like 5 minutes so cars could clear the road. It gets pretty tight once the parking spots are all full. It's all free. A lot of cars parked on the road. Just be careful crossing the road.   FOOD When I was here they only had one food truck. The options were limited. The prices were a bit too high for the food options available. I didn't try it out. My friends ordered a few things and they felt the food was just ok. I'm not sure on the current food status here.   AMBIANCE  They only had outdoor seating when I was here because of COVID. I sat on the covered outdoor seating which was great since it was around summertime. It was HOT! Really cute tables, friendly/helpful staff, and live music! I don't remember his name but there was a gentleman playing guitar and singing. He was fantastic!   DRINKS I ordered 3 drinks. The first two were the Comanchero and the third was The Copperhead. I'm glad I stopped there. They are strong!   I'm giving it four stars because I felt like the size of the drinks didn't coincide with their prices. I hope I get to stop by here again. It's a bit of a drive for me. It's a really beautiful drive though. Keep kicking butt y'all! I want to try everything!!"

We sat outside in the lovely fall weather, enjoyed some acoustic tunes by a talented duo with a female vocalist, and tried several cocktails -- all of which we enjoyed. My friend tried the frozen Bartender's Choice which was like a frozen apple cinnamon cocktail, and I tried the Comanchero, the Yipping Coyote, and the Rugged Flower. Each were so smooth and well-balanced. This place not only makes a flavorful Sotol with a smooth, clean finish but transforms it into mouth-watering mixology masterpieces!   Aside from the bus loads of out-of-town tourists who looked like they were part of an Instagram filter for an \"Ashley/Ashleigh\" compilation (complete with brimmed hat, scarf, and boots), this place is a must-visit if you're in Austin. Couple it with a trip to nearby Fredericksburg and you've got yourself an amazing day!"

                "description": "Finally decided to take a day trip down to dripping springs and had to finally stop at Desert Door. To start, this place is designed so beautifully. I wish I could steal the décor and put it into my own home. Both the inside and out were so inviting, I don't know how someone could go and not spend hours enjoying the ambiance, food, and drinks. What I thought was so cool about Desert Door was that they educated you on what you were drinking and the history of Sotol. What I did not know, is that they are actually the only Sotol distillery in the US.  We started off with the Sotol flight, and two drinks. Although we did enjoy tasting the Sotol by itself, it was a lot to start the afternoon off with! We also ordered the The Copperhead (my personal favorite of the day), the River Rita, and the Sotol'd Fashioned. I loved each drink but the copperhead was definitely the star of the day, which was a Sotol version of an espresso martini. They also have a food truck on site serving out very unique food. We ordered the tacos and vegan \"queso\" and both really surprised us by how unique and amazing it was. We loved this trip out to Desert Door, and will definitely be back."

                "description": "I'm generally not a huge fan of tasting rooms and find them gimmicky and far from truly experiencing the spirit of the spirit. See what I did there.   But every rule has its exception, or exceptional. Desert Door is a destination in itself. Beautiful southwestern interiors and stylish furniture. The space is cozy but didn't feel crowded, though every table was full. They do have a large patio for outdoor seating and bigger groups.   Now, the sotol. I had never heard of it and didn't know what to expect. The best way I can describe it is an agave spirit, clear, between a vodka and a tequila in its thickness/smoothness. In plain English, it's delicious.   We did the tasting flight, which was a great way to get introduced to a new spirit, followed by a round of cocktails. The cocktails were excellent and reasonably priced.   They also had a lovely food truck on site but we didn't have enough time to try it."

Huge outdoor covered area with plenty of picnic benches and  lounge seating.  I can't remember who our server was but she was freakin awesome! She brought our pup a pupsicool (bone broth frozen pup treat) to keep cool and occupied lol. Pup also sported a DD bandanna : )  We didn't order any food from the food truck, but appreciated the option to order quick bites."

Great patio vibes: chill, mist fans going , and live music about to start. Inside is nice too, super clean and cute/trendy.   The sotol is great and their cocktails are delicious, as well as unique. Had a difficult time deciding which one to get but our attentive and extremely friendly waitress, Nicole strayed me the right way with the Comanchero. Hubs got the ranch water (served in a Topo Chico, gotta love that)!   Nicole our waitress and Erin the bartender are solid assets at this establishment! Thank y'all for a great Saturday afternoon!"

                "description": "Such a beautiful, can't-miss distillery in Texas Hill Country!   We were absolutely shocked by how much we loved Sotol after trying it first as a standalone shot. And they sure know how to do a cocktail, too! I got the River Rita and it legit blew my mind.   Sit and stay awhile, listen to the live music on the patio and if you need to cool down, the interior is a WHOLE mood.   Be sure to visit their gift shop to buy an adorable handmade clay shotglass (SO CUTE) and a bottle of their famous Sotol.   The staff was also astoundingly friendly and the kind of people you want to hang out with."

When we walked in we were very disappointed in their craft selection. I had researched this prior to choosing to go there based on their craft choices showed online. Again, something else that needed to be updated. Also, they aren't serving food. There was a large dog walking around that would come right up to you or sneak up under the tables and lick your feet.

                "description": "They've thought about everything at this brewery.  Great food, live music, seating inside, outside, and UPSTAIRS on the deck!  When the weather is right, they have the big glass garage doors open.  Yeah, they brew their own beer here and they have a decent selection.  It's not your typical brewery where you can just stroll in and choose the table you want to sit at.  That's because they have full table service for food and drinks.  I prefer breweries that let you wander around from the bar, to an outside table, to an inside table, and then back again - you know, rinse, lather, and repeat (relaxed and unstructured - I need that once in a while).  If you just want to stop in for a quick beer, you can sit at the bar.  The bar is quite large but also very popular with the college crowd, so it's hard to get a seat at times.   Now to the serious stuff - the beer!  I've had their Kolsch (San Marcos Blonde) and their Vienna Lager.  The blonde was the run of the mill Kolsch, not bad by any means, but the Vienna Lager - wow!  It had a great malty taste to it.  I liked it so much that I purchased a crowler of it to take home.  I rarely do that, so that tells you it must be good.  Enough useless banter - here's everything else you need to know about this place:  Free parking lot right next door or free 2 hr street parking.   Patio areas in the front and the back with overhead infrared heaters and fans with misters (they have both Texas seasons covered).  This place is popular with the college kids - TOO popular.  Growler refills are $12 or $18 for 64 oz, and $24 or $36 for 128 oz, depending on the beer you select.    Crowlers to go:  $8 or $10 (depending on the beer).  You can get three for $20 or $25 (depending on the beer).  Plenty of food options.   And I almost forgot to tell you - they have a FULL bar, not just beer!"

                "description": "Aquabrew is definitely a gem in San Marcos. I learned about it through the purchase of the brewery tour on Groupon. The tour was quaint because it's not that big, but very interesting.  The gentleman who gave the tour seemed a bit rushed at the end, but he answered our questions and seemed very knowledgeable.   At the end of the tour we got to sample some beer. They also have a beer club where you buy a growler, we got the one for $100, and join their beer club. You get a punch card for 10 refills on the growler. My husband and I got one each for $200. I was thinking it an \"okay\" deal i guess. Truthfully I wasn't that thrilled cause of the price. But OMG!!!! IT IS WELL WORTH EVERY PENNY FOLKS!!!!.   Aquabrew has some of the best beers around. I am Army and have lived and traveled all over the world and this lil place holds its ground when it comes to beers! Purchasing the growler is the best deal too.   I have not had the food yet, but the place is always busy and people seem to love it. And they have some of the cutest guys behind the bar.  In all, I give this gem an A+"

This place really has a community feel with longer style tables and an incredible open patio with fans and lighting, ping pong and live music... and of course... beer.  The food was very flavorful. Thai chicken had good spice and the chicken thigh was tender and juicy. The Margarita flatbread was fresh tasting. The arugula salad was huge and bursting with fruits and flavor.  The beer was excellent and just what you'd expect from an onsite brewery.   Overall, if you're looking for a fun place for you and your peeps to chill, eat and drink in San Marcos... you'd do well to try this place. Plus it's right up the street from the Cheetham St warehouse."

Long tables instead of individual tables to encourage people to meet new people ! Which is a really awesome concept . Also there's a large bar since it's also a brewery.  Food- my food was about a 3.5/5 , but my friends was a solid 1. Her salmon Benedict had almost uncuttable biscuit since it was so hard , and the most burnt potatoes I've ever seen. My food which was the stuffed French toast was pretty yummy, but not a lot to it.  Noise level - 1/5 THE BAND WAS SOOO LOUD. I couldn't here my friend talking 1 foot in front of me :(  Price - 2/5 wayyyy overpriced for what you get. My French toast was 11.91 and my friends meal was 15.91  Probably won't return unless it's for a group outing , but still a cool little place to check out !"

                "description": "Odd to see the plethora of reviews stating that the service here in subpar, as this was definitely not the case when I went yesterday. Easy to get a seat and our waitress was very attentive, despite it being happy hour and slightly busy on a Friday after work.  As a table, we ordered the: a) Brew House Pretzel - Amazingly soft and the beer queso is a great pairing  b) AB Bacon Jam Fries - HOLY! The bacon jam itself is something I've never had before and I must say this makes it a must return for me  c) Glass of Imperial Pilsner - Smooth and pretty standard for a Pilsner  d) Glass of Artificial Intelligence Tripel (9.72% ABV) - Yeah...the ABV tells the story itself  This spot has a great atmosphere, very rustic and cozy. Definitely a nice place, just wish you could order directly from the bar for faster access to beer."

If you want delicious food, great drinks, a casual yet elevated ambiance I'd say look no where else and go here. The waiter was fantastic (I can't believe I forgot his name). He was helpful and very knowledgeable of the menu. His suggestions were all a match to our taste buds.   Can't wait to go to Austin to eat here again!"

                "description": "You know when someone takes a picture of themselves and posts it on Instagram,and it's at just the right angle to make them look super attractive? The Yelp reviews of this place kind of remind me of that. It's not that it was bad, but I was expecting a lot more.  The highlight of my meal was the Mosaic IPA. Balanced and drinkable, this beer was really enjoyable. I also tried the Swine Dive IPA. The taste of this was a little too clean for an IPA and just didn't have the hoppy depth to add to its character. Not bad, but I wouldn't get it again.  Overall the food I ordered was really lackluster. I didn't hate it, but it certainly wasn't a memorable meal. My chicken empanadas were oily, and had very little chicken in the filling. The whole thing struck me as more of acorn dog egg roll hybrid, and didn't really seem like an empanada at all. I was grateful for the spicy sauce it was served with, which was pretty tasty. I also ordered the brussel sprouts. There were some decent flavors here, but I would have really preferred them to have a little more char on them. They came across as slightly undercooked and worse yet, very wet. A little crispness would have gone a long way.  Service was fair, friendly enough but really on the slow side. It took me almost a half an hour to get my food and it wasn't crowded. The couple at the bar sitting next to me ordered hamburgers. I have to admit I was a little jealous because they looked good. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. Maybe it was a bad night. Whatever the reason I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again."

I wish I saved room for the Porter Ice Cream Float.   The AB burger was solid, maybe a little messy tho.  Forget the fries tho. The regular fires were under seasoned and chewy. Think Wendy's fries when you  don't finish them at lunch and try to eat them at the end of your shift. Bleh  The staff was super friendly.   The outdoor portion looks great but a bit too hot out today to go and enjoy it."

That portion of the night really sucked.  Howeverrrr, the street corn, queso, crispy tuna, edamame, and loaded fried were reallyyyy good. We especially loved the street corn. I wish we would've gotten the delicious food on time, instead of having to remind the staff multiple times butttt at least it tasted amazing??   I can't give them more stars even though the food was great because service is so so so important."

                "description": "Unfortunately the new menu and chef drops the rating from 5 to 4. Still friendly waitstaff and excellent happy hour. But the reason I come to AquaBrew and recommend it to everyone I meet is the food. The \"new\" salmon dish isn't even close to the goodness of the previous balsamic salmon with veggies. Dry. Lacked flavor. Sticky rice instead of the delish potatoes and only green beans instead of a mix of seasonal veggies. Hubby had the tostadas and 'meh' reaction. Will give it one more try before relegating it to happy hour only place with 3 stars. So sad."

                "description": "Just left after lunch. Cute/hip spot with friendly staff.   We ordered the AB burger and I did an upgrade to their bacon jam fries ($4 upgrade). I was so excited to try these fries but they were very underwhelming to me. $4 is steep for an up charge but had I enjoyed them I wouldn't have minded. The burger was the best bite on the table. It was small in size but very juicy and tasty. Not one to split.   Next up was the fried chicken and eggs. It has so many things I typically like - fried chicken, cream gravy, bacon jam, eggs, but I didn't like this dish. It lacked dimension of flavor. It needed something. The herbed fries that came with it were good. I liked them better than the $4 bacon jam ones.   Our kids split the stuffed French toast. The only ate a little bit because it was too sweet. If a kid thinks something is too sweet you know it's toooooo sweet. Neither ate it. It was a waste of money.   Overall I'm glad we tried it but don't need to return on our own accord."

We had the pork tacos and quesadillas which were excellent. The sweet tea is also a nice drink if your into teas. They have a patio area which is comfortable and allows for a cool indoor - outdoor experience.   I'm new to San Marcos but this is going to be my first \" go-to\" when I need a great taco. Hands down a highly recommend!"

I had to ask the waitress where mine was, she checked and said it was next up. 10 minutes later still no lunch. I checked and it was behind 4 other orders! Their excuse was that mine had to be cooked, but it doesn't take 30 minutes to tear up a couple tortillas, heat them in salsa and fry a couple eggs to put on top!  They won't have another opportunity to provide me with bad service and excuses!"

                "description": "Food was amazing but service was eh. I've been to my fair share of food halls and similarly set up places, but this one was a little confusing walking in. Think hop daddy or a similar restaurant. Once you order at the front, grab your seat and make yourself comfortable. I stopped by on a Saturday early afternoon, and luckily enough it wasn't super busy. If you if anyone was wearing a mask. But since this is Texas I guess COVID doesn't exist.  Onto the food! I ordered off of their brunch menu which was super delicious. The Chilla Quiles were enormous l!!    I sat down at the bar, which was OK and really where my four-star review comes from. The bartender was nice enough, but really didn't seem interested in actually serving people. She's definitely one of those bartenders that wants to give you your drink and then get you out of her face. It wasn't super clear to me how to check out so I asked another random person that came by and they were kind enough to explain the process to me. Being from out of town, folks in Texas sure aren't as nice as we say we are. And I say this as someone born and raised in Texas."

                "description": "We happened to be in the area and stumbled across Industry as a brunch option. First, today is pretty cold outside and their wall windows (?) are wide open. I get it, it's their design. We were considering finding another spot, but decided to stay and try it out. I ordered the chilaquiles w/ chicken, hubs got the chicken sando, and we had a side of the green chile queso. The food came out at a decent pace. The queso was barley luke warm. Why? It tasted okay, flavors are nothing special, but I was expecting it to be warmer than what it was. When our order came out, my chilaquiles were also luke warm, if not almost cold. Is the cold air chilling the food quicker than normal? Probably not. The side of beans and rice I had was piping hot and I ate that towards the end of my meal. The chilaquiles were made w/ the chips that they serve with their chips and dip; not a fan of that. The hub's sando was good. Overall, 3 stars cuz the flavors weren't that bad: I was willing to overlook the cold dining room, but not the almost cold food."

                "description": "TLDR a-ok to I'm a fan despite some bumps  My first time ordering for pickup. Everything was delicious, it was ready at the time promised. The big flaw was I didn't get the beer battered squash I ordered and paid for, but as Mr R didn't check the bag before leaving we cannot lay that all on them. It was a very busy night and mistakes happen.  The other error was I didn't get the 30% off to-go booze still advertised on their online menu which is why this isn't 5*  Mr R is besotted with their black bean veggie burger. I think there must be spice in the patty as none of the other listed ingredients explain its lovely low heat. He also likes the texture of the bean patty, he wanted me to mention that.  The salmon burger was good, huge, nice fresh veg, I love the spice in the aioli and poblano ranch, but I REALLY wish they still did the smoked salmon bagel I had one brunch there long ago.  The farm beet salad? Gorgeous. Mr R gleefully ate most of it on his own and he often eats salads with a sense of duty rather than joy. I loved the white balsamic vinaigrette it came with, I'm going to need that more often in my life.  The drinks to go? Hooray! One note, bring your own standard brown pulp drink tray if you think you'll need one because they didn't provide one. The pours were fabulous on our mimosas, The Closer and White Box. Ice was the perfect amount.  The transaction could have gone smoother, but the meal went down great. This remains a place Mr R wants to go *every* time he's in town."

                "description": "We ordered from UberEats and after having them call to say they were out of the Salmon Burger and Catfish with Chips we opted out for the Chicken Friend Chicken and Fried Chicken Burger. The order was delayed by 35 minutes which is understandable since they had to switch out our meals. But once we got our meals we realized the sides that come with the entres were missing completely as well.  Starving my friend dug into his Chicken Fried Chicken and I took a few bites of the sandwich. He was basically done with it when he cut into the last bits and realized that the food was indeed cold and fleshy. I stopped to look at mine and I was baffled by the underlying pink on the bottom of the chicken patty. He immediately regurgitate it back up and I stopped and threw the rest of my sandwich away.    We spent over 70 dollars on a meal that had to be thrown away. The only things we did eat were our Brussels sprouts and cheese fries.   Will not be eating here again."

                "description": "We came down from Dallas and made industry our 1st-night-in-town place for drinks and dinner. We had an awesome time with Thor as our bartender last time we were in town. He was there this time and we got to say hi again. We sat at the bar and Raina took great care of us! We tried 2 lagers from different TX breweries and had some great shots. I could not decide among 3 choices for dinner, so I let her pick and surprise me. She chose the al pastor tacos. They were delicious! We are only staying in San Marcos 4 days and are already planning to go back for dinner on Monday! Ps if you are a whiskey drinker, try this! It was so smooth!"

The $11  mimosa carafe special immediately got my attention. I knew I had to have that. Found us a booth on the left corner by the bar. Ordered the mimosa, 2 industry burgers, Parmesan fries and the tater tot casserole. The mimosa was disappointingly room temperature. The burgers were bordering on salty but were good. We especially liked the chips and salsa that came with it. The fries were good but a little expensive for what you get. The tater tot casserole , we didn't like at all. Very salty and the hot sauce did not go with the dish at all. Don't think we'll come back."

                "description": "There were mixed reviews...the adults loved their food! We had the CFC w queso - gave it two thumbs up!! We also had the chicken tacos and the person who had those raves about how good they were! We also had the queso, salsa, fried squash, loaded fries and Brussel sprouts for appetizer and all were a huge hit!! Most of the teenagers had the burgers and did not like them. They said they tasted like sausage. I think the issue is the burgers were very, very lean and smoked so they were a little dry.  The BIGGEST COMPLAINT were the flies...OMG!!! So freaking annoying to have to constantly be waving your hand back and forth so a darn fly does not land on your food!! Do something about that bc we would never come back solely for that purpose!"

Whiskey Business has a diverse, quality, well-priced inventory. They had everything I needed. Even took home a six of Boerne Brewery's Old Courthouse Ale at the owner's suggestion. It's like he knew what I'd like. He did. One of my favorites is an Irish dry stout {think Guinness}, and I've now found a new favorite. Love it! I'll make Whiskey Business my go-to.

The views are breathtaking, and the main house is absolutely impressive, I was so impressed with the property I had to explore it further on my own.   They have been operating since 2004 and turned the former residence into a tasting, event and sales space. The sunroom and patio are perfect for enjoying a tasing or a bottle of wine among friends.   I actually sampled all of the wines on my visit to the vineyard, of course my preference is red, but I found many of the whites quite refreshing. Although the pool is no longer used for swimming, it makes an excellent backdrop, stop in and set a spell! Cheers!"

I'm not weeping with joy from any of the wines but they're easy enough to drink.  It's particularly lovely for violet crown sunsets, so save it for your last stop if you're making the rounds in this neck of the woods.  They don't have any ice, which I find supremely odd being that it's Texas and they serve white wine! If you want to keep your wine chilled while sitting outside (they've got plenty of gorgeous trees to provide shade but shade is not a wine bucket!) the only way to do so is to drink it real fast while thinking cold thoughts."

We were a little disappointed to hear that, as of our visit in May, they weren't doing tastings due to Covid because I do think it can be done safely and would've made for a better experience. Otherwise, you either have to buy a full bottle or multiple bottles if you'd like a well-rounded understanding of their wines. We opted for a blend that we absolutely loved, described on the bottle as a \"patchwork quilt of grapes.\" It was honestly worth every penny--so delicious!   We took our bottle and glasses outside onto the expansive lawn which is just perfect for picnics. They have lots of shaded tables under the old growth trees.   Perhaps for safer tastings they could serve them \"beer flight\" style with the informational flyer and direct you to sit outdoors so that you can still experience a handful of their wines without breaking the bank? That would make it a 5-star experience for me!"

I've done the tasting before and also just purchased wine by glass. Both are delightful. Tasting is nice for first timers to explore a variety of wines Duchman produces. Because of the tasting, I was able to find my favorite red and white wine of theirs. And for $10/tasting, it is such a steal!! (Price may have changed. This was based off of 2018). After my first visit, I just opt to get a bottle or glass of my favorite red and sip it on the patio taking in good wine, views, and company.   My friends and I always love to end our Hill Country winery trek at Duchman and drive over to Salt Lick after for good ol Texas BBQ."

This particular winery has outdoor picnics for groups and benches for smaller groups for one to buy a bottle , bring some of your own food and enjoy their wines. During this pandemic time, this is the perfect scenario to drink wine while still practicing social distancing.   They do allow you to use the restroom with mask wearing enforced for you to go inside the building.   Their wine was light and refreshing. We chose  a white wine.   If you go near the end of the day you enjoy a nice sunset followed by lighted trees giving you a Christmas vibe. Up until that day , I never knew that Texas had a winery side like Driftwood but places like Duchman Family Winery proved to me that they do exist and they have really good wine too. Highly recommend you make a stop at this winery."

                "description": "I live in California and only an hour away from Napa. I wasn't expecting anything close to what one would experience in Napa. However, I still wasn't fully pleased.   The only way I can imagine that someone would really enjoy it, is to bring your own picnic and use their outdoor seating area. This is of course conditioned on the weather and also whether or not there is gonna be any bachelorette party there during your visit. (We saw two when we visited and they were so loud and they had overtaken all the outdoor seatings)  We tried their tasting. It was only $15 which is relatively cheap. In Napa you pay 2-3x more than that in a good winery. They let you choose your own 5 wines out of their selection or go with their recommendation. The tasting overall was okay, nothing that I disliked and at the same time nothing wowed me. I'm not sure if I'm gonna go back there, but it was worth to try it once."

                "description": "Nice stop just outside Austin for a wine tasting! The outside setting is very cool, spacious front lawn and some tables/chairs for hanging out. Dropped into this place for a quick wine tasting, consisting of 6 small pours of wine. The whites we tasted were all very smooth, not overly sweet but just the right amount of smooth and dry. Definitely recommend sampling all the whites if you have time, you won't be disappointed!  We didn't go check out Trattoria next door for food, but have been there in the past and pretty good Italian food, pairs well with the winery.  If you come here and the weather is looking good, you can expect a very scenic, picturesque spot to spend some time at!"

                "description": "Over priced tasting . $17 tasting for very small pours of 6 wines . No water in tasting room. Had to go get it yourself . No crackers or palate cleansers . If it was a free tasting I wouldn't care as much . When I made reservation I was specific about food and was not given accurate info. You are not able to order food or eat during the tasting. Food only available to purchase after tasting was over. Servers poured wine on top of previous tasting . Missed poured twice . Server changed frequently and not consistent. They obviously are not organized to keep track of what wine we should be on . Huge red wine fan( live in Europe for 6 years ) was not a fan of  any of the reds . Surprisingly liked 2 of the whites, Beautiful atmosphere and building . A shame the tasting experience doesn't match . Could be so much better!!"

                "description": "Duchman is a great winery to visit near Austin that makes great wines.  I've recently been on a kick to learn more about and try Texas wines.  I've tried wine from several different Texas wineries in the past couple months (all purchased from wine stores) and Duchman is so far my favorite.  I prefer red wines and my favorite Duchman wines are the Aglianico and Sangiovese. Since the winery is so close to Austin, my husband and I decided to visit.  The grounds are beautiful - the perfect place for a picnic.  I appreciate the precautions they've taken due to COVID-19 too.  You can't go into the building (though they will let you in if you need to use the restroom), so they are set up outside selling wine by the bottle and require everyone to wear a mask.  There is plenty of space to picnic and social distance.  They sell some picnic meals on-site, but we brought pizza from Pieous, bought a bottle of wine, and had a lovely time relaxing at a picnic table in the shade.  I highly recommend visiting Duchman.  I'm happy there is a winery that makes great wines so close to Austin.  Even if you can't do a tasting during COVID-19, it is still worth the drive to drink wine in a pretty setting!"

                "description": "Really beautiful property. We wanted to go to Salt Lick and wanted to find some other activities in the area so came here for a tasting before lunch. They do $15 for 6, which is pretty good, and was offering 5% off your total bill for following them on Instagram.   There's some beautiful benches set up outside to go with your glass of wine. It unfortunately seemed to be drought season when we visited so the actual grape plants were pretty bare. Once you step inside, there's a small room where the tastings happen and the shop where they sell bottles and all kinds of souvenirs. There unfortunately wasn't any seating indoors so we had to stand the entire time. If you walk in more, you can see barrels and label making rooms. Wish they had given us more history during our tasting but it was fun nonetheless.   It was pretty easy to get an uber out here from the city but be warned getting an uber out here may take a little while."

I messaged Jodie in April to see what her pricing and availability was for Memorial Day weekend and she responded quickly. Paid deposit through venmo and paid the other half day of our tasting. We did one winery, one distillery and one brewery. She gave us a small history of each of the places we went too. Her cheese board setup was amazing! Very sweet and easy going. I highly recommend."

                "description": "OMG, Jodie is FaNtAsTiC! My bff and I were on our annual girl's trip and wanted to book a wine tour before we left the Hill Country of Texas. We were staying in the adorable town of Wimberley so I researched tours in the area.  Jodie's Taste of the Hills Tour got great reviews and went to wineries close to the Wimberley area. The day of the tour ended up being chilly and rainy. As soon as Jodie pulled up with her spectacular shuttle-like van she was out like a flash with pretty umbrellas for us! We went to 3 different wineries which we thoroughly enjoyed! After the first one, we returned to Jodie's vehicle and she had a gorgeous tray for us of cheese,  sausage,  crackers,  grapes,  olives, dips.....simply divine!!! The tour was also just the 2 of us and we loved that Jodie still did ALL of this for a tour that I believe takes up to 12 people! The next time we plan a trip to the Hill Country we are going to do one of Jodie's Beer tours!! We had such great conversations with Jodie too! Thank you sooooo much for the GREAT time! Sooooo much fun!"

                "description": "Amazing tour!!! My wife and I came into Wimberley during Spring Break to relax from teaching and this was the perfect trip to do so! Jodie made us all feel like we were old friends, even though we had never met anyone else on the bus.  She was very detailed with the stories of each winery, and explained all the different varietals, answering our every question along the way. The bus was very comfortable and clean, and she stored each bottle we purchased until the trip was over, but we could have had the bottles on the bus had we chosen to.  The wineries all seemed to know her, so they were expecting us and were incredibly friendly. We were not rushed anywhere, and still managed to make it back into town to enjoy shopping on the square.  My wife and I were pretty hungry by the time we had lunch, since we didn't have breakfast, but the tapas style lunch was perfect for the glass of wine we purchased to have with it. The lunch was delicious and filling.  Overall this was an amazing experience and I will be recommending this tour to everyone I know."

We were fortunate enough to have great people touring with us, and it made the tour all the more fun.  She prepared the best picnic lunch I've ever had.  Sugar Shack cake balls, meats, cheeses, crackers, hummus, a goat cheese something served on crackers (that I LOVED, and I hate goat cheese), spinach feta rolls, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something.  She was fully prepared for everything.  Boxes for the wine we bought, umbrellas in case in rained (it didn't), plenty of water...this wine tour couldn't have been more perfect if she tried.

She provided an excellent variety of foods including a hot portion and gluten-free (just in time `cause I was lit after the 1st vineyard). The three vineyards for that day were selected based on the wine preferences of the tourists that day (A+ perk). We never felt pushed or obligated to buy wines, but we all did because they were very good (!), and Jodie kept our purchases organized and stored for us. She also gave a good background on each vineyard and on the Wimberley area in general. We learned a lot about Wimberley and wine and were able to get tipsy knowing Jodie was an excellent driver of her comfy bus. And have you been to Wimberley? That hilly countryside is beautiful!"

She gave us a lot of background information on the wineries as well as the town of Wimberley. She had a delicious assortment of snacks for us to munch on while we rode to and from each winery. She helped package our wine purchases and brought us umbrellas as it started to rain. She even went the extra mile, literally, and drove us back to our hotel since it was raining as we had walked to our meeting spot earlier in the day. We had another couple on the tour with us which was really nice since we had people to mingle with. It was a very personal experience and I felt as though we were all just great friends spending an afternoon together. Who needs Napa, everything is better in Texas!!! We will definitely be repeat customers."

Karen and Neil were extremely attentive and made everyone feel right at home. The wide variety of Texas craft beers, wines, and meads absolutely blew everyone in attendance away and we can't wait to go back to try the beverages we missed."

My parents were staying at the cabins at onion creek right behind this place and when we stopped I saw a dog inside so I called my parents and said meet us up here and told my husband whoa we gotta pet that dog!  I enjoyed the bead as I had never had it before and loved the inside decor and how the place is set up.  Cozy if you want it, outside on the patio ( not for us since it was raining) up at the bar or in large tables.  If you're in the area its definitely a must."

We met beforehand to plan where to place the food, decorations, and talk about special drink offerings. The staff was super friendly, went out of their way to make us feel welcome, and made it a very special night. We had a party of about 25 and the space was perfect!

Beer, wine and mead only in a warm industrial space. The service was very accommodating, however not as knowledgeable as I had hoped, given the selection and the many questions several of us had as we tried mead for the first time. Prices seem to be a bit high considering we aren't in downtown, but it's a place we'll visit again."

                "description": "Hill Country Tasting Room is a wonderful find - I strongly recommend it! We rented out the entire venue for our rehearsal dinner, and it was absolutely perfect. We had ~50 people with an outside catered buffet dinner, and the venue was the perfect size - it still felt intimate during the speeches, but there was enough room for everyone to sit, eat, and mingle. The layout worked really well for us - for dinner, people could sit and eat on both the ground floor and mezzanine, and for speeches people mingled on the ground floor while the speeches were held on the landing. We love the atmosphere there - a combination of industrial, rustic, and chic that totally matched the vibe we were going for!  Planning was a breeze too - first Lindsey and then Deepa were both so accommodating and answered all our questions. Especially compared to some of the other venues I was talking to, Hill Country Tasting Room responded so quickly, kindly, and didn't mind when I asked a bunch of questions! I would definitely recommend them for hosting an event.  The drinks themselves were also amazing. We loved that it was all Texas beverages, and there were so many options! We were so glad to find a place that offered such a wide variety.  On the actual night of the rehearsal dinner, the bartenders were so helpful - I even got comments back from a couple of guests stating how nice they were! I can't wait until our next visit to the Dripping Springs area - we are definitely going back!"

The staff were very friendly and knowledgeable about the selections they were carrying and they were able to make great recommendations based on our tastes. They have reasonable prices, they were in line with the other tasting rooms we had visited during the day. Their concept was awesome! Their selection is from local craft breweries and wineries and rotates between different companies. They also had the beverages available to take home if you found one, or more, you enjoyed."

                "description": "Two friends and I went to Driftwood Tasting Room and asked to do a wine tasting. The only employee there, Antonio, said the tasting would be $8 for four tastings. The menu had a long list of beer, mead, and cider as well as wine. We asked if we could mix and match the tastings between these drinks, and the employee said yes. We then asked, several times, if this would still be $8 for the tasting. He again said yes. When we went to pay, we discovered that our bill came out to more than twice that amount. Apparently, the tasting was not $8. He told my friends that we received full pours, and that's why it was more. Here's the thing, WE DIDNT ASK FOR FULL POURS; we asked for a tasting. The employee took it upon himself to give us the full pours, which we did not ask for and shouldn't have had to pay for. We left upset and confused as to what happened. One of my friends went back into the establishment to discuss a refund. We didn't want to all three go in and cause a scene, since the man was kind to us, we just wanted to remedy the situation. Apparently, he reexplained the full pours THAT WE DIDNT ASK FOR and then offered my friend $10 out of his pocket. She felt guilty about this and didn't ask for compensation for the other two of us that did a tasting. I repeat, tasting and not full pour. I'm not sure why he would offer us his own money instead of trying to correct the problem initially. Maybe he knew he was wrong? Or maybe he just wanted us to go away and not complain? I really don't know why he would do that. We discussed it more and felt upset about the whole situation and how it was awkwardly handled. It was a damper on what was supposed to be a nice day out. I decided to contact management through the Driftwood Tasting Room's Facebook page the next day to see if we could be fully refunded for the employee's mistake. I explained everything to the manager, Lindsey Pierce, who, of course defended the employee. I understand this, and I have nothing against the employee, but a mistake was made and I wanted it corrected. I didn't mention the $10, since it went to my friend who spoke to the employee. Apparently, this gave the manager reason to believe that I was lying. She said that my friends could contact her for a refund and I could get one after I returned the $10 cash, which I didn't even get, but ok. I mentioned how she was treating me like I was lying and like I was a criminal for complaining about what happened. Lindsey Pierce then THREATENED to take me to SMALL CLAIMS COURT for SLANDER for writing this negative review. All I tried to do was express my dissatisfaction and try to get a refund, and the manager treated me so impolitely and with such disrespect. I would never want to go to a place where the management treats a customer so rudely. There are better places down the road where the servers charge you what you expect to be charged and the managers are polite and genuinely care about your experience at the winery. I'd avoid this place at all costs simply because of how the management treated me when I tried to explain what happened."

                "description": "This place is a hidden gem and definitely a much needed place for the growing area. It has huge potential and I hope they get enough business to stay in business! I live nearby and it's a nice place to grab a drink. Beautiful interior! The glasses of wine were a little pricey compared to the nearby vineyards but everything else seemed reasonable. The guy serving my friend and I was super friendly and helpful I hope they continue to have great service. The only things I would recommend would be to maybe add a couple TVs without sound on to keep some of the guys happy should there be UT games or golf on. The bar is a beautiful spot to hang out. I'd also recommend having some nice big glass jars with some pub mix or nuts in that folks could purchase by the scoop and maybe even a cheese/meat plate or some olives. It's a great hidden gem for us who live nearby to be able to have an upscale bar with great local beer and wines. And sometimes someone in a group doesn't want wine so it's nice to have the options! Something for everyone. Hopefully eventually a food truck or some dinner pairing event would be fun. I have seen some really cool events advertised on fb but haven't had a Chance to make it in to one yet. I will add as I have two kids I wouldn't recommend this a place for kids as there isn't really an outdoor space. A great date spot or place to meet friends for a small birthday. Bonus would be to add a happy hour or special pricing for driftwood locals!!"

                "description": "When you hear the word BUS one would normally think about a city bus or there like. This is not the case for the Crafty Thirst Beer Bus, no it's a VW van that is being used to serve beer. We were passing by and noticed a sign that said Grand Opening. We stopped to check out this Grand Opening. We were approached by this creepy guy smoking a cigarette as he said do you have ID, we showed our drivers licenses and instead of saying thank you, have a nice day anything he just stared at us. We were reading the list of beers that were offered. It was a little confusing as there was no direction on what the beers were are how much they were. We decided to order at the VW \"BUS\". We were asking what different types of beers were available and how much they were. The guy that was helping us (later found out was the one of the owners) passed us to someone else. We thought that was rude but the lady that served us made up for it. The beers were $7.00 dollars for a 9 ounce or you could get 4 -  7 ounces for $10.00 dollars to me that is extremely high. Most of the places in Canyon Lake have beers for $2.50. The beer we had, had more of a foam head on it and we were not offered to top it off. Another guy was serving mixed drinks one with Pecan Rum. The mixed drinks were $7.00 dollars, high for the area and the amount you get. I will confess that the rum was one of the best I have had. A few times I heard other people saying that the price's were too high. If you can get a beer for $2.50 then why would someone pay $7.00 dollars. The band was the only entertainment and they were amazing. There was suppose to be a raffle for the VW BUS but when I asked about it I was told that it was not going to take place. This was troubling being that I was told by the owner that it was the main giveaway."

                "description": "I really love their burgers and those cheese fries are to die for. Ive also tried their pulled pork quesadilla, steak @ their steak night ( $16 every Tuesday!) and those are solid choices as well. I liked the chicken sandwich but it didn't wow me like the other items i've listed above. Bartenders and staff are super friendly. Overall a great atmosphere, especially now that it's getting chillier out!"

Best steak in town with the best signature drinks around. A great mixed crowd of really cool people, not just college kids, but true locals from all walks. Owned and run by two amazing brothers - They are deeply rooted into this community and really give back in soooo many ways. I love this place, centrally located with great drinks and fun clientele!"

                "description": "This place was sick, drove by it multiple times and was a huge fan of the aesthetic. Great visuals and vibes for a nice day. The staff was however, sus. They seemed to have attitudes of a bar that is not in a college town but a boujee downtown bar. The bartender who was close to my age charged me for regular priced drinks when we ordered 2/3 of our drinks in the happy hour range. When I came to close out and order our (3rd) last drink. The bartender said \"do you mind if I close you out?\" I thought this was very odd as it was a Wednesday evening and I was purchasing not only alcohol but food. I do believe they have an amazing food truck that supplies great food. I am sure this was a one time fluke as the rest of the experience was great. I do stand by my opinion that the staff maybe biased to certain crowds so be weary."

Loved the atmosphere and customer service and ice cold beers. My bestie and I had a mini day in San Marcos as a girls trip within in COVID rules and we loved this little spot. We found it while looking at houses in the neighborhood surrounding the bar. The staff was kind and courteous and the misters and fans were a nice cooling off touch with the Texas heat."

They have happy hour everyday from 2-7 ( and all day on Sunday) which include a big 4$ strawberry margarita that I could dieeee for! If you are under 21 you can't stay past 7 which has always been a little upsetting considering some of my friends are underage and they are very strict about it , but still one of my favorite bars on the square ."

Friendly, and more importantly, knowledgeable tap masters that can match your beer tastes to the selections on tap.   You can order a pitcher of beer at this place!  I don't see this in many growler stations.  All in all, it's a very fun place.  The staff and the customers are very chill and down to earth.  It's in a strip center at the corner of LBJ and East Sessom Dr.  The address is listed on LBJ and while you can enter there, it's a lot easier if you enter from East Sesson Drive.  And there's a LOT more parking on this side."

Very interesting pieces. But enough about that.  This place is loaded with craft beer from Texas. Texas is apparently pretty big in that regard (and nearly every other regard). For a place as small and intimate as it is, there's a lot of seating packed in it and even some outdoor seating. There's games, lots of games. Card games, board games, darts, pool, and sometimes even a live DJ.  If you dig the craft brew scene this place is surely right up your alley. If you find yourself in San Marcos come check em out!"

They have all Texas craft beers, 28 on tap, fresh, and they even have a few selections in cans and some wine!      I was shocked when I saw they had The Infinite Monkey Theorem Rose' ....impressive.   The vibe is awesome. Super laid back, chill, artsy, and hipster. Loves it.       The owners are lovely people. So nice, great service, and very informative on every single beer. They make it their priority to get the perfect beer for you.   They have some savory oyster crackers for you to enjoy while you booze it up. Cards Against Humanity is also available to play for free!        The decor was my favorite. I was super into the refurbished wooden pallets, the art work, the baby succulents, and the colors!   Will definitely be returning many more evenings."

Great selection of Texas beers. Very helpful staff who encouraged us to sample several based on our likes including several blends we may not have thought of trying. 2 beers led to 3 and then 4.

With that being said, I've been to growler places in the greater Austin area and IMHO, I think The Growling is better than most of them.  As previously mentioned, there are 28 beers on tap, all Texas-made stuff, but unlike other growler places I've been to they have a bar and you can drink a pint, invite friends, and just hang out. The owners are super friendly and work hard to set you up with the perfect craft beer experience! They even have a stage setup for live music and get live acts mostly on the weekend.  Also, as previously mentioned, there is no kitchen but they allow outside food and with Pie Society, Bobcat nation, Dos Gatos, Mocas/Javas, Rose Garden (Chinese), and Thai Thai in close proximity; you won't have to go far to fight off those hunger cravings! They haven't been open very long (less than 2 months) so they're off to a slow start but hopefully as word gets out they'll start getting busier and maybe even expand on what's an already great start! If you're in San Marcos for the River, the Square, the Hill Country, or in school looking to skip class, The Growling is every bit worth checking out!"

You said I was \"punching down for laughs\" when he was greeting me to your establishment.   First of all, he was the one \"punching down\" since he kept making his jokes loud so that all the other employees around could have a laugh. He never greeted me to the establishment. Also, I kept my mouth shut, took his rudeness in stride, manned up, and moved on. Apparently his and your feelings were hurt by my relatively insignificant review and you just had to make a public display.   I neither live in the area nor will return to your business, and in the end, neither of us should really care."

                "description": "We were in town and decided to stop by for lunch and reminisce on the good old days. We came in knowing it was under new management but wanted to still give it a shot. The waitress was very attentive and checked in on us often, and when she gave us the menus we instantly realized NOTHING WAS THE SAME. I had always ordered (and was craving) the jalapeño queso burger but that was now named something else, and based on the description I knew I wouldn't be a fan. We both ordered their 1/4 smash burger with grilled onions and a basket of fries. When we got our order we both looked at each other and knew this was not the Taproom we had during college. The food itself was okay (not great as before) and the amount of grilled onions was significantly less... unless we are in an onion shortage I feel more could've been given. After we finished eating we both agreed this would probably be our last time coming for a while. Just not the same.   Again, the waitress was very attentive, checked in often and food was okay, but it's hard to not compare the past to present."

That being said, we all got burgers so I feel like it could have been faster? The food hit the spot after a day on the river but just to get the waiters attention was hard work as they only had 4 people on duty. Then to pay the check again it was another long wait. I can't recommend this place if you're hungry, but if you have the time, sure you should go. Prices were reasonable."

                "description": "Salty with a side of Micro transactions.   I have had a few items here and I would have to say this is the saltiest food in San Marcos and not in a good way.  Their menu is very over priced and boy do they love their micro-transactions or add-ons.  Fries are extra with their expensive and average burgers. BACON is like $2 extra.  They charge you for using a credit card and so much more.   Their queso is Velveeta and rotel and not even that good. Most of their chips they serve with the queso is tiny broken scraps and they get annoyed if you ask for more.   The staff is either uncaring or over-worked. I have had many incidences where I am eating solo and am ignored in getting service initially and after.  This is most likely because the server is more interested in dealing with the beer drinking frat guys. Almost every time I have been there I have been left without a basic refill of water. Many times i have also sat waiting for my food with no sight of my server.   The only saving grace of this place is the half price wings on Wednesday, but even then I would get them to go."

                "description": "Drove up to San Marcos from SA to meet sister and niece to help move into dorms.  They were running late, so decided to stop here for some drks and grab a quick bite.  Place was not that crowded (in the front) and the tables were spaced out.  View was nice to enjoy those strolling by  the sidewalk.  The sign at the front said $3.50 bloody mary's, so I ordered one and it was the bomb (see pic).  Perfect drink that had all the fixin's.  The Chicken and Waffle Bites caught my attention, so I ordered that to hold us over.  These were really good and worth the appetizer! The reason for 2 stars knocked off were the service that was absent throughout our time here.  He disappeared all the time and couldn't find him once my sister and niece showed up.  This service made me decide to go somewhere else for lunch.  The other star was due to being charged full-price for the 2 bloody mary's.  I didn't say anything, as I wasn't sure when the waiter would come back and also felt small businesses need any extra cash during these times.  I still tipped the waiter, since they need money too but not sure how he was so busy with a light audience in the place."

They are my go to burger when I get a burger craving. However, I have heard that all their other specialty burgers are amazing as well.   My one complaint is the service. It's mainly a bar, it's going to be busy- I get it. I've worked the industry. But every time I've gone, something is wrong with my order, I'm double charged on something, or the waitress hardly ever comes to check on us.   I'll keep coming for the amazing burgers- and they deserve the stars, but the service needs some improvement."

They refused to serve me and I refused to stay quiet. I escalated to the owner after his employees all worked together to ensure that customer service is not important to them at all. I spend a lot of money eating out especially to try new things and I support local businesses. But I couldn't try their food because they don't accommodate properly to accept mastercard payment on a to go order (which they now claim they do allow). Hope you all decide to go somewhere else that values you as a customer. Support black owned businesses.  I hope the COVID hits them hard in the pockets."

                "description": "North Street is a coffee shop, beer bar, and Indian restaurant... and it's amazing.  We went late (well late for us, it was 8pm) on a rainy Saturday night. It was medium busy, most of the indoor tables were filled up and the bar had a few other people. We sat at bar seating and were helped right away. Being so close to the university, it's a college vibe.   I ordered a chai hot chocolate, it was amazing. Something about hot chocolate on a rainy day.....  We ordered loaded samosas (Vegetable samosas topped with chana masala, curry queso, cilantro walnut chutney and cucumber mint raita) and a sampler trio. We got spicy powder on the side.   Great flavors. We left full and happy. If we lived in the area this would be a regular spot for happy hour."

                "description": "I walked in and made myself \"home\" by taking a seat at a table and waiting 15 minutes to be served on. The two servers walk by my table and didn't make eye contact, as though they had never seen someone with so much melanin before. They continued to serve other seated and even folks coming in for the first time. It was embarrassing. It's 2022 and the last thing I want to assume is that it was because of race. Frustrated, I walked to the bar and asked for a manager. The bartender (Josh) informed me it was the dark hair gal and that is when I was acknowledged. Josh was very nice and served me and took my order.  Josh saved the day, but they need to work on their customer service.   I had their taco and the fries were absolutely delicious! The food blunted my frustration. I will come back because I believe in 2nd chances...and of course the food."

                "description": "We really wanted to like this place.  It has a great casual ambiance and we loved the place when we walked in.    We went on a Sunday, and it wasn't too busy.  There wasa couple with a great dane there, so it's dog friendly.  My bride ordered the samosas, and I ordered the curry trio with saag paneer, butter chicken, and chicken tikka masala.  We got north street fries as a appetizer.  So, the samosas came out nice and warm.  My wife thought the bread was overcooked, but she was hungry.  Perhaps it was old oil on a Sunday evening after a busy weekend.  The fries were warm-ish and a bit soggy.  The seasoning was very good, though, and the basket of fries was a good size for two.  The curry trio was disappointing.  The saffron rice was hard and warm-ish.  I don't know how else to describe it.  The Saag paneer was kind of tasteless.  I've eaten great saag paneer, and this ain't it.  The Chicken tikka masala was similarly underspiced.  The butter chicken as well, but I expect that from butter chicken.  I had ordered it as a counterpoint to what I had hoped would be some spicy dishes.  At this point, I'm wondering if it's us.  I've worked with Indian nationals that have taken me to some hole in the wall Indian places in Irvine, CA, and they absolutely knocked my socks off.  We go to many places in Texas that have a good yelp rating, and we get a lot of bland food.  We really like to patronize smaller places, and I hate to give poor ratings, but have to be honest.  We really liked the people and the place, so will give them a try again in the hopes the stars align for a better experience."

                "description": "I came here to meet a friend for drinks and a light lunch -- we both got appetizers since we were planning heavier dinners later that night -- and when it comes to the food and drinks, I was not disappointed.   I got the vegetable samosas, and the samosas were nearly perfect, with the potato and pea filling having just the right level of seasoning. They came with beautiful mango chutney whose chunks were visible and a lovely green chutney. Both were so delicious I was hard put to decide which I wanted to put on each of the three samosas.  For drinks I had two of the Wasatch Polygamy (a nitro porter), and it was fantastic. It had a hint of sweetness, but wasn't as overwhelming as a milk stout, but also the delicious flavor of a porter.  The patio dining was great, with plenty of shade.  The only reason I'm not giving five stars is that service was... slow, with respect to both drinks and food. Otherwise, the whole thing was outstanding."

                "description": "My mom and I were looking for a new place in San Marcos. We come here often from Kyle and tire of the places right on the interstate. The establishment is adorable - informal seating inside and out.   I first got some pappadum and a few chutneys-tamarind and mint. They were spicy! Caught me off guard but delicious for sure.    My mom ordered the Curry Trio with chicken curry, paneer tikka masala, and saag paneer. I ordered  a beef kabob curry taco. Every bite of every dish was delicious. While I loved my taco, I highly recommend the Curry Trio because you get a great choice.   When we first got there, I was like meh. Only a few tables were seated outside and the inside was empty. But right after we ordered, the place quickly filled up! Wow.   The service was superb. I couldn't have asked for a better server. I'll definitely be back!"

                "description": "The food here is amazing and the staff is very friendly! The idea of putting a Tex-Mex twist on Indian food is brilliant.  I was very pleased with the variety on the menu and how tasty everything was. My children loved the curry queso, saag paneer, and the paratha.  My husband and I enjoyed our paneer tikka masala tacos (I had chicken).  The Mango lassi was different as it is icy and minty, but we really enjoyed it, and so did my children.  I can't wait to go back! One thing that was also really surprising is that the coffee was super good! Please remember this is a fusion restaurant, so it is not your typical Indian. I noticed a lot of lesser star reviews complained about it not being Indian food. Yet, it is Indian Tacos. It is a fun twist and something different. I highly recommend."

                "description": "Visiting San Marcos and North street popped up on my Yelp top restaurants.  Restaurant is in a renovated older house with super cute outdoor patio seating. We sat inside it's smaller but very cozy. They have a bar with many draft beers, wine and specialty drinks.  We started with the vegetable samosas and it came with side of mint sauce and mango chutney that was so tasty. Both complimented the samosas in a wonderful way. The flavors were amazing.  I ordered the tiki masala taco that was filled with so much flavor and very filling.       A must try!! And hubby had the trio which he choose tiki masala, curry chicken and butter chicken along with coconut rice. All three were fantastic.  Service was good and food was fantastic and very reasonably priced.  I'm excited to come back and try something new on the menu and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND North Street!! #supportsmallbusiness"

                "description": "Ok. Here comes another Indian restaurant review. But wait! Its TexMex Indian!  Went to lunch with coworkers on the first day of fall, so we got a table outdoors, never stepped foot inside. Service was slow, but it seemed it was only one waiter, so no points taken away for that.  Server was detailed in explaining what everything was and the level of spice and comfort. We had one vegan and one spice sensitive guest in our group, so he pointed out what would be best for the group to order. I ordered chicken nachos, and paneer tacos, wanting spice and meat. Other guests ordered samosas with mango chutney, vegan nachos, and spinach paneer. It was filling enough with a beautiful presentation! The jalapeno cream mixed with tamarind on the tacos mixed perfectly with the Indian spices.  The curry on the shredded chicken and tortilla chips (couldn't tell if they were made in house or store bought) had me trying not to lock the bowl. Will definitely go back to try more items on the menu!"

The building is absolutely adorable and beautifully decorated. Bathrooms are always spotless and the women's bathroom kindly offers hair ties, feminine products and occasionally mints. (It's the little things!!)  They only offer beer or wine cocktails but even the wine cocktails feel and taste pretty craft cocktail-y. The ginger lime spritz is my fave!  Being a self proclaimed queso connoisseur, I was hesitant on curry queso. Why fix what ain't broke? I was wrongly hesitant, North streets curry queso is liquid gold and oh so delicious.   I don't think there's a single bad thing on their menu.  The Katz brothers truly do no wrong"

                "description": "Hilariously good Tex/Indian fusion. The chicken Tika and curry tacos are out of this world. The queso is ok. But seriously, if you're not already in San Marcos, come here. And eat this. It's that good. If you think you're a foodie and haven't tried this, fix that. So incredibly good. And for $9 per taco that's basically a meal and a party in your mouth, it doesn't exactly set you back much. They have a great beer selection too and cool ambiance and attentive service. But the tacos are the draw. Come here. Eat the Indian style tacos. 5 stars."

                "description": "Unique spot with a mix of great options of drafts and curries!  We enjoy having different types of beers and this place has a good unique assortment of drafts to try.  I was able to get some lavender cider since it was pretty early in the day, but the porter and stout options were very tempting (some at over 12% alcohol).  The dogs were with us so we settled outside in their spacious yard that has a lot of shade and a fan blowing.  We ordered curry fries as an appetizer and they were wedged exactly like chic fil a fries seasoned in a curry mix powder.  These were good, but can do with a pinch of sugar and lots of extra spice.  I had the chicken Tikka masala plate and my husband got the chicken 65 taco.  The taco looked more like a wrap and wasn't as filling as what he expected, but tasted pretty good.  Fried chicken seasoned in sauce inside the taco had a good kick to it.  My chicken Tikka masala plate was delicious, but a little extra spice would help.  Also, I think the restaurant can do better by adding naan! Great concept to check out!"

                "description": "In the latest wave of gentrification in this town, it seems like all I can find are hipster breweries that serve \"craft\" beer and overpriced food served on rectangular plates. If you like that kind of crap, go to aqua brew, you animal. If you want to go somewhere with cheap drinks and cool people (and if you live north of campus like this guy), look no further than Treff's. Some highlights.  You call it nights and you call it week:  Every Sunday, Treff's does $2.50 you call its, and $2.00 you call its on Tuesday. In addition to that, Treff's picks one week out of every month to be You call it week. That means $2 you call its all week. Going there, getting piss drunk, and stumbling back to my apartment, is among my fondest memories.   Atmosphere:  This place is dirty and divey in the best of ways. I used to go here with my friend from work all the time, and I always enjoyed seeing the bartenders and regulars. Really interesting people. Another upside is the patio, which allows filthy smokers like myself to smoke, drink, and have interesting conversations with other people. Another thing to mention, though, is that Treff's is much more of working people's bar. If you're a frat bro or sorority girl looking to blow mommy and daddy's money on a night of partying, you probably won't have a lot in common with the people here.  The glasses: This is just a little nitpick of mine, but I always hate going to the square and getting served drinks in a plastic cup. Treff's gets ridiculously busy some nights, and they still manage to serve all of their booze in glass, which is something I like. On another note, the bartenders here are absolute rock stars, and they don't take shit from anyone.   I haven't gone in a while since I don't have anyone to go with, but you can bet your ass the first place I'm taking my girlfriend when she turns 21 is gonna be Treff's."

I was willing to look pass this until I went in around 12am and had a few drink and was allowed to order a drink at 1:52am and they close at 2am. At 2:03 they bouncer was stand at our table demanding that two of my girlfriends and I chug our drinks and leave when we stated we'd like to not get drunk and drive the entire bar staff proceed to attack us and demand we finish our drinks, that we had just got and paid for, and leave or they'd take them. I felt very uncomfortable and attack so my friends and I just left. It was not a good way to end my night."

A few minutes later another friend met up with us and brought a round of shots. Within 10 minutes of being there a bouncer came up to us and told us we need to leave because we were \"too drunk\". I told him we weren't and we hadn't drank at all before we got there, we had all just been at a work function. He told us the bartender saw us walking to the bathroom \"looking drunk\". He wouldn't let us finish our drinks that we had just been served and only made the 4 people with shots out of my friend group leave. I think the staff there is racist just like other reviews are saying. Won't be coming back."

The bartender who is also manager and share-holder DID NOT MENTION TO US  that well vodka in the form of a pickle shot would be $6. As a longtime bartender being served by a long term bartender, when I'm told \"wells are $2\" I trusted that Chad would be honest with us. Instead, he took us to the cleaners. If I could give no stars I would. I have been in San Marcos for over 10 years. About 6 years ago I was man-handled by a door guy for no reason. I did not return to Treff's for almost 4 years. Since then, I have gone back a handful of times in hopes that it was just \"one bad apple\", but now I see that the employees at Treff's are out for nothing more than money. Even the door guy tonight was short and smile-less. I have received nothing less than awful service at this bar and I will not be returning."

This was my second visit to Treff's because the first time i had been there i did not have a great experience. However, I am a big fan a second chances because who knows what might had been going on that night.   The drink prices are very reasonable. Whiskey Sours only $3.50 and then they have some killer drink specials during the week I believe on Sundays and Tuesdays they have -You - Call -  Its- for only $2!!   The upstairs bar area has a bunch of darts to play and even a pac-man arcade game to entertain with.   As for this little dive, I would return."

A toss between \"dive\" and \"college bar\", this establishment has cheap drink specials and the students know it! Beer selection is moderate, but for a college hangout there's a few local and craftbeers in the mix of domestic \"moneymaker\" beers.  The bar gets super busy, especially during \"$2 Tuesdays\" when everything is $2 and I mean EVERYTHING! With other various specials during the week, this is a must if you're a student looking to have a good time and stretch you're student loan/ scholarship/ college fund/ or emergency credit card that mom gave you just a little more..."

Their selection of beers was so/so, although I had heard that they had more than what they actually had.  The parking lot was awful. Construction going on and one way in and out. Only about 10-13 cars could park and you can forget it if you're driving a truck, as the guy driving a f250 found out after hitting the parked Mercedes.  Not a great place for a huge group of people, but not bad for a San Marcos bar. When visiting just be wary of the parking lot and crazy drivers."

Well, as usual, we squished into a parking spot in the front of the tavern, walked in and sat at an open bar stool. I ordered an Ace pear cider and started chatting with friends while the jukebox was going with a vast array of music choices! Thats the beauty of a jukebox and I love the diversity!  Okay so I decided to check in (via Yelp) and saw that they had an offer for $2 drinks which really excited me because it wasn't a Tuesday and I still could get some $2 drinks? HELL YEAH!  WELLLLLLL.... it was more like a HELLLLLL NO because the bartender didn't allow me to redeem my deal. He even said he texted the owner and that the owner had no idea what kind of deal I was talking about? Well, the offer is still open on my Yelp app and I plan to find the owner next time I'm at the bar and ask him about it because that offer didn't magically come to be!!!  Anyway, yes Treff's is a super chill, casual and cool bar but they lost some points with not accepting my Yelp offer (I mean that's what the offers are there for hellloooooo)!! Guess I'll stick to only going in on Tuesdays..."

All the outdoor spots were taken, so we made our way to the upstairs outdoor balcony, until we were able to snag a table downstairs (which is where you want to be). We quickly found out it was BINGO night. Yes, bingo night! No, it wasn't a bunch of boomers either! I wish I had gotten her name, but the girl hosting Bingo was incredible - great personality with lots of jokes and she def knew how to work a crowd!  Cons - sadly there are some. The sangria flight is awfully sweet. The pizzas are good but took soooo long to get. The food menu is very small so you better not come starving or with a picky eater.  However, if we're ever in the San Marcos area again, we will definitely be back to just enjoy a night on their outdoor patio!"

We both had drinks, a couple of martinis and something else that I can't quite remember.   The Brie was something new to my boyfriend, and we really enjoyed it.

                "description": "Tonight we tried out this quaint wine bar for the first time. For a tapas bar, they offer a limited menu. This is the only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars Bec we expected more selection. They have a few cheese plate options and small gourmet pizzas. I chose the pear and bacon pizza, which was delicious. my husband had a pepperoni pizza. I also ordered a sangria flight, which was quite nice. On Thursday nights they offer a free lava cake with the purchase of a flight. The lava cake was tasty. The servers were friendly and the decorations were nice."

                "description": "I stopped here with a friend on our drive from Austin to San Antonio and will definitely be making the trip back to San Marcos to visit again! I ordered the white sangria, which fair warning was very sweet but it was still delicious. The menu said the white sangria had ginger in it, although I didn't taste that specific ingredient I was hoping for, it was still a good choice. They do wine flights as well, and have a pretty good happy hour.  We ordered a cheese board and sat at the bar. The cheese board was generous and filling, the service was great, and the atmosphere was on point. It is a casual wine bar, and they had live music outside which would have been nice to watch aside from the cold weather. They have a lot of seating outside, and a good amount of community seating inside.  Overall, great experience here and will be hopefully going back!"

                "description": "Leaving the Outlet Malls and headed back home via Hwy 21, we needed a lunch spot on the \"right\" side of the interstate for easy in/out. 54th Street hit all of those needs.  We were promptly seated by a super sweet hostess. We have a toddler and we were able to grab the booth highchair on the way to our table instead of getting to the table and then waiting for a highchair. I know that doesn't mean a lot, but 90% of the restaurants we visit, we have to wait for them to seat us then they bring a highchair to our table. By them having the booth highchairs at the hostess station, they are \"working smarter, not harder\". Big kudos the them for that.  Our waiter was (forgive me for I didn't catch his name) was extremely knowledgeable of the menu and helpful for all questions.   I had the Cherry Limeade to go along with the Gringo Dip and Chips we ordered for our appetizer. Both the limeade and the chips/dip were outstanding. I would recommend both.  For entrees, we had the Prime Rib French Dip and the Havana Club. The French dip is the first sandwich listed and I didn't read any further. I'm a sucker for a good French Dip and this sandwich delivered. The wife commented that her Havana Club was delicious as well. The kids had grilled cheeses with fries. All looked great and they devoured them.  All in all, this is the spot you're wanting for an easy off/on when traveling north on I-35. We'll be back when we are in the area."

Cooked and seasoned perfectly.  My daughter ordered the butter penne pasta with side of sweet strawberries, ice cream and strawberry lemonade. The lemonade was fresh and not overly sweet.  My husband had ribs. My friend had ribeye with blackened shrimp. Everything was tasty.  Waiter tried but kept forgetting stuff. We didn't get straws till 20 min after our drinks were served. Like no one got straws to drink.   then he kept forgetting the refills and my glass of water.  My 5 yo noticed and commented on the server's forgetfulness. He was nice but he's obviously new-- he didn't know the menu well at all. But it's fine, we had a good dinner. Price was very decent."

I checked in online before we showed up, and we were seated immediately. We both had the vodka strawberry lemonade cocktail, which was very sweet and weak. I ordered a chicken avocado sandwich with sweet potato fries.  My husband ordered the chicken quesadilla. Our food was prepared quickly. My sandwich was tasty, as well as the fries.

I had the Havana Club sandwich with the Chicken Tortilla Soup on the side and the Key Lime Pie for dessert. The sandwich was great! Pretty big and definitely worth the price. The soup was also good as well. The pie was great and unlike any other pie I've had, tangy and with amazing crust.  Overall the atmosphere of the restaurant was great, especially for the night time. Its got a cluttered pop-culture type decor style, similar to that of Beyond Burger, nice dim lighting, and huge comfortable booths. Our waitress was also very kind and did a great job. I highly recommend this place, especially in the night time for the atmosphere."

To start we ordered a Four Play, I regret not having a photo, but I can tell you it was delicious, the sauces that accompany this order were excellent, all excellent, the fried potatoes, the mozzarella, the spicy chicken but with a good flavor.  In addition this time we ordered the same Plate, Flat-iron steak and shrimp with mashed potatoes, I found the steak cooking to be perfect, as well as the shrimp just right.  We recommend a delicious beergarita.  Only you have to prepare your wallet, it is not cheap, but you will enjoy it."

After tonight we will no longer be returning to 54th street restaurant. We had family come in from 2 hours away to try the food we always talk about, and were turned away, REFUSE us service because our party of 13 was \"too large\". Yet there was a party of 12 that didn't show for their reservation and still we were refused service. It was supposed to be the graduation dinner for my fiance and this is how it turned out. It is not our fault that the restaurant is understaffed, but losing us as loyal customers definitely is their fault. Save your time and $ take your family somewhere else."

A gentleman from North face recommended it to us and we are thankful we listened. The best way I can describe this place is a pub like feel with amazing pub like food and even better personal service! The gluten free menu was AMAZING and I felt safe eating here as a celiac! The rest of our group had plenty of option as well. Two of us had burgers and the other had soup and sandwich and we enjoyed every bite! Jeanne was our server (hope I spelt that correctly) and she did a great job helping us choose menu items! If we ever come back to Austin/San Marcos this will be a stop on our list!! The gluten free burger was so good, the bun was not crumbly or taste like cardboard but perfect! I actually took home half of the bun to eat later... ha! Thanks 54th Street, it was great!"

The tater tots were filling, and made me feel full despite the order only giving five tater tots or so.   The pina colada was good too. I am usually not a fan of alcohol, but this pina colada was actually good to me. Not too bitter, which was pleasing. However if you have more mature tastes, then the drinks here might not be satisfactory. College students like sweet alcohol, and this restaurant gives exactly that.   Parking is plentiful, and the demographic of this restaurant is mostly college students. This place gets loud too."

The pot pie was so good. The crust and gravy were perfect. I wish there was more crust. I had the lunch portion. I'm not sure if the regular portion is bigger but I definitely wanted more."

                "description": "WiFi password is Guest2018...  I haven't been to Sean Patrick's since I graduated from Texas State in 2011... Not much has changed and I'm glad for that. It was nice to reminisce.   Meet a couple for dinner while going through town. They recommended this place because they have \"The Incredible Burger\", a vegan burger option. They have driven to San Marcos a couple of times from Kyle just for that burger. One got it on a Patty Melt and said the Texas toast was the perfect addition. The other got it on a regular bun. Both with fries. Both disappeared quickly! They also had a Bloody Mary each. The staff was very accommodating in regards to one's request for extra olives.   My husband had the fish and chips Irish style, so a Guinness based batter. I had the fish and chips Texas style, so a corn meal based batter. Both were fantastic. I tried some of his. His better was crunchier and crisper than mine. Both were very good.  My husband had the Solid Gold lager. He said it was pretty light but good.   The overall noise got a little loud quickly but it's a Saturday night in a college town so that's not unexpected. There are a couple of pool tables and several TVs. It's a great college hang out place.   Lots of beer options.   My husband said there was a trough in the men's restroom... The ladies could have used some attention but mostly well maintained."

                "description": "I've been here for the last 3 fights and I'm watching the last one I will watch here. 15 bucks to watch on half the really poor quality TVs. Though that is just the tip of the iceberg. Got here 2 hours before the fight and they would not turn any of the TVs to the prelims out on the patio. We asked 3 times and the 3rd time they said they could not cause people wanted to watch the soccer game that wasn't even on yet, also we are the only people at the time watching on the patio. Next is there was no cover when we got here, walked in sat down been drinking and eating and they are coming around telling us we have to go buy 15 dollar tickets at the door. On top of that the food is not high quality but the most expensive on the square and the service just isn't really there.   Also half the TVs are the fight and they are small TVs! Like super and low quality  Just ripping regular people off cause they are the only people on the square that show the fights. Bad business."

                "description": "I've been going to Sean patricks for a couple years now regularly with my girlfriend and my service dog. Every time we go someone always makes a comment to me about how well trained and well behaved my service dog is, and this evening was no different in regards to that. I always had a great experience with nice employees who were very welcoming.  I've never had a worse customer service experience in my life as I did today. The manager on duty Marshall Wyatt or Wyatt Marshall kicked me and my service dog out because he didn't have a vest for show that says service dog on it from Amazon. I explained to him more than I legally needed to in regards to my service dog. He at first turned me over to his manager under him, who was very nice, as employees usually are at Sean Patrick's. I compromised with sitting outside as they were busy on the inside anyways, and I didn't want to cause any issues. Then we were getting stormed on outside with winds blowing everything off our table and getting rained on while we ate. We only needed to have their coverings for the outside patio rolled down, but they took forever, and after asking multiple times for someone to come take care of it, I began taking care of it myself when finally Marshall Wyatt or Wyatt Marshall comes out and attempts to take care of it, but the covering just kept flying into our table and hitting my girlfriend. While we are getting pummeled by their outside seating covering. I pointed at it while making eye contact with Mr Wyatt, he makes eye contact, but continues being fixated on a tv while he leisurely walks over to assist. He walks back inside after putting a chair in the way. Well, the chair blows back on us with the crazy winds. We walk inside and get harassed by a bar back because Marshall Wyatt instructed him to in regards to my service dog. After explaining the law to the bar back we sit down, and I determined it was time to talk to someone about the experience I've had tonight. I spoke with the manager under mr Wyatt. Again, she was very nice, welcoming, and apologetic. After speaking with her mr Wyatt comes over to ask me how he was \"rude\" to me. I explained to him my experience, and he proceeded to argue every detail to defend and deny his lousy service. I thought he would come over to take responsibility as a manager and apologize, so I was caught off guard and told him that I didn't want to hear his argument, he then snatched everything off our table and kicked myself and my girlfriend out, saying that my service dog was in there \"illegally,\" even though I tried to explain to him that he can simply refer to the ADA website. I cannot say I will be coming back until Mr. Wyatt is gone.  Owner Brian Jeffrey, please make this right, and reach out to me. I will miss going to Sean Patrick's, but who my money goes to is a huge thing for me."

If you are looking for a place with some great food with an Irish flair, you are good to go.  If you like cold beer, and a great selection of it, again, you're good to go.  If you like good service, yep, good to go.   Lots of TV's.  Great place to take in a game.  Wonderful place to hang out in a college town and pass some time.  They've got pool tables, shuffleboard, a nice outdoor patio for you and your dog.    Overall, great drink selection.  Great beer selection.  Tasty food.  One of my SMTX faves, and certainly my GO-TO when I am in town!"

Me and my boyfriend came in to watch the World Cup game because I remembered this place had tons of tv's, and the most seating out of pretty much any bar in San Marcos . We ordered drinks , chili cheese fries, and a DELICIOUS 2$ scoop of pistachio almond ice cream in a waffle cone . All the food was awesome ( which I can't remember saying in past experiences .)   After the game we opted for some shuffle board and darts , which was a great end to an awesome World Cup game . Couldn't have asked for a better place/ environment for watching , enjoying great food, and hearing a lively crowd !!!"

When their order came out the fish and chips were awful, breading was soggy and the 'white' fish was grey in color, they were refunded the meal, but didn't want to take a chance on anything else. Later I went to use the restroom, only to be in a stall that has no toilet paper. Very disappointed as I was from out of town and looking to try something local. Very disappointed."

It's ok to make it with beef but one must correct their menu as it's correctly called \"Cottage Pie\" when made with beef.   Blackjack Burger - Pretty Good Philly Cheese Steak - No Flavour (yes, there's a damn U in it) Smithwicks - Ran Out (pronounced incorrectly... don't say the W)  As a immigrant this is far from Irish, in fact so far removed from anything Irish it's an insult. No offense, but an American would never know the bloody difference! In addition, the bathrooms are named \"Lasses\" and \"Boyos\".... the ladies is a SCOTTISH name and the men's is WELSH name; no S at the end. This damn place needs to learn some shit really quickly, because they look like fuck'n idiots to everyone out of county.  Skip this shit-hole and get a decent beer and food at Aquabrew down the street... you were warned, so go ahead regret it at your leisure!"

We tried to tell him separate tabs, handed him a 20 and a credit card for the two tabs. He kept the 20 and didn't bring back any change, and charged all of the drinks on one tab- never saw him again. We were in a rush so couldn't track him down to correct it. Needles to say, a little disappointed..."

It'll be a great space to spend an afternoon once the pandemic ends.  Call ahead if you want to pick up some of their fabulous Texas Holiday Nog, but remember, only 2 bottles per person per month.  Careful though and drink responsibly. This is not your father's Oldsmobile eggnog. It will sneak up on you and kicks you in the noggin like a freakin' mule."

                "description": "The place has great potential. Very cute and good drinks.  But they have a long way to go when it comes to customer service.  The bar tender seemed to be really put out that we were even there.  Didn't welcome us, when we asked if we needed to go to the register part of the bar to order,  he looked at his phone and rudely said, I'll be with you in a min. Then continued to be annoyed that he had to take our order. The place was empty only 1 pinter group of 4 so wasn't like he was super busy.  They even said he didn't really seem to want to be there and definitely didn't want to be taking our orders.  The AC was also very lacking we were all fanning ourselves with the menu which seemed to be the best use of the menu since he didn't want to serve us. The sink in the women's bathroom barley had water coming out if it and they were out of toliet paper but we dare not ask the 1 bar tender as that would have really put him over the top. I wouldn't recommend this place and if I was the owner I'd want to know how bad my employee is. No wonder there was no one inside."

The creams are out of this world and the elderflower liquor is perfect for a spritzer or to sweeten that mixed drink from Brad. I can just drink it on its own but I am tough like that."

The two female bartenders we have had in the past were amazing.   However I think they missed the mark on this expansion.  Sadly this is NOT the same place.  Total different vibe.  The new 'bar manager'  (a dude) made me a Mojito that I couldn't drink. He also told my husband that he is planning a lot of new drinks to put on the menu"

All the liquors were good, the cocktails were too. The gentlemen working were friendly and knowledgeable.

These guys had a great playlist rocking, and the wood wall behind the bar is beautiful!"

My friend and I went on a whim after eating at the Salt Lick and seeing signs to this distillery. We hung out for an hour. We talked with the staff, drank a dram, and played some corn hole. Great little spot with awesome drinks. As a whiskey guy, that's what I wanted to try, but it wasn't ready. Nevertheless, brandy was good. Great time at an awesome location with good people.   Enjoy."

Original takes on standards like their take on the margarita: The Brandyrita.  Had a great time. But the star of the show was their Texas Brandy, and the Carajillo, which made me a fan.  Can't wait to go back and find out what else they have cooked up.   Great stuff."

                "description": "We passed by this place heading to the Drip yesterday and since I'd never heard of it, I immediately yelped it.  A new distillary only about 10 minutes from my Casa?  Hell yes, I'm curious.  And I'll admit I became even more curiouser after reading Arian's review....I intended to ask them about this \"one of the best after-hours swingers hangouts in Austin!!!\" sitch.    The tasting room was a little hard to find as it's around the back of this little warehouse strip but it's open and spacious and we were only the 2nd couple there on a Friday evening.  We were warmly greeted and bellied up to the bar.  Our bartender (and all the staff I think) are in the Stinson family.  She was very friendly and gave us all the history of the place and explained each tasting in length.  They are currently offering a tasting of 4 of their liquors for $7 (these served quaintly in communion cups) and have cocktails they can serve as well.  We sampled everything (of course), the vodka, the white rum and dark rum, the elderflower liquor (think St Germaine) and the Holiday Nog.  She also threw in a sampling of their Bailey's style coffee liquor that's not quite \"ready\" yet.  I immediately fell in love with the Holiday Nog, which doesn't actually have any egg in it (thank goodness) and is made more with rum than whiskey (again, thank goodness).  This will go great with holiday gatherings.  I will keep an eye on their FB page for release of that coffee liquor!  All of their bottles run in the $25 range.  Hubby and I each had a cocktail, him the mojito and me the Citrus Fizz, and both were made well and were tasty.  We also bought several of their cocktail glasses as they are sturdy heavy glass, perfect for Bourbon.  Which, btw, they are still perfecting their whiskey recipe and will offer that in the future as well.    We really enjoyed talking to everyone and after getting a little liquid courage, I did ask about the swinger's parties.  She laughed and said that was just a friend making jokes....I wonder......"

He picked us up from our Airbnb and drove us 45 mins out and back, while we blasted some rachet songs to sing haha. He would check in on us during the winery to see if we needed anything or have any questions, and he would offer to help us take multiple pictures. He also got one of the wineries to allow us to explore their cellars!   On our last day in Austin, he drove by our airbnb to pick up someone else and honked at us as we waited for our uber. We were all so happy to see him again, as we all enjoyed our experience with him.   I recommend Texas Tipsy Tours with Arlen ;)"

She was friendly and very informative.  She helped make the experience exactly what I was looking for. I wanted less sweet wines and a winery with food options. Arlen was our diver and was so knowledgeable and friendly. He picked us up right at the hotel in Austin. I felt the price for the experience is definitely worth it. If you were considering this experience, I highly recommend this company. They care and that is important."

They do all the heavy lifting with the friendliest spirit and let you and your group have the time of your life!  We had the BEST time on our tour and absolutely adore Arlen, our driver! He was the kindest, most considerate, thoughtful, responsible driver ever! He was so fun but also let us have our time to just be girls and we didn't have to open a single door, make a decision, or carry a single bag (if we didn't want to) the whole time we were with Arlen!  Also, the management team was incredible. Wei booked last minute and they were so accommodating and listened to our unique needs/wants for the tour! And we're so detailed in instructions. I have had bad experiences with wine/bus tours with other companies and I was SO impressed with the whole experience at Texas tipsy!"

From the minute I called to book to the minute I said goodbye to our driver the day of the tour they were fantastic.   So when I called there actually weren't any times available. They worked with me to make sure they had a tour time and sprinter available for our group of 6. I had a million questions; they were patient and kind.   Our group was 6 but one of my friends asked if we could add an additional person. Reached out to TTT and they said sure no problem. Literally 3 HOURS LATER I got a call that another girl tested positive with covid and wouldn't be able to come with us obviously- they were so nice and made the switch back to 6. Very grateful for their exceptional customer service.   Day of our driver Bryant was early which was great! Got on the bus and let us have free range of the radio, answered any wine questions we had or any questions about Fredericksburg. He was a fantastic host. Always texted 15 minutes till our time at the winery was up and took as many pictures as we wanted. He was so sweet! He also made sure we were never thirsty or hungry. Which for a group of girls is very important- smart man! Haha   I've heard things about other companies having hidden fees and people getting charges after leaving Fredericksburg and we had none of that. Texas Tipsy Tours was very transparent with all of their pricing and they had no hidden fees.   Thank you TTT for making our trip perfect. You won't regret booking with them."

                "description": "My experience with Texas Tipsy tours was nothing short of perfect!!! From pickup to drop-off, Courtney (the owner) made our experience amazing! When I initially started inquiring about a tour a few months ago, many of the companies only offered private tours for a minimum of 4 people. However, Texas Tipsy Tours offers small group private tours (i.e. 2-3 people). This was perfect for me. She also made planning our trip so easy, and she promptly answered all of the questions I had.   On the day of the tour, she picked us up from our hotel in Austin in an Infiniti SUV (it was very clean too)! She even made a pit stop for me at a CVS on the way to our first winery. Throughout the 6 hour tour, she made sure we stayed on schedule. She even let us change a stop last minute because we wanted to check out a brewery!  One thing that was amazing was the comfort she provided! She allowed us to pick the music, provided phone chargers, and let us control the AC! She even opened our doors for us AND dropped us off/picked us up right in front of each place we went!  Overall, I highly recommend Texas Tipsy Tours, and I will definitely be back!"

We chose the half day option and were picked up right at our vacation rental (Farmhouse on Elder Hill) We wanted to just stay nearby so we visited Driftwood Estate Winery and Fall Creek.  We were planning to also see Vista Brewing (all in Driftwood), but we chatted and laughed so much that we ran out of time and Eric, driver/owner was flexible with our change of plans and let us just extend our time enjoying the fabulous view at Driftwood Estate.  The tour service was absolutely awesome and professional.  Everything done with excellence.  Thank you Courtney and Eric!"

It was as easy as getting on the phone, explaining what I wanted, and Courtney took care of literally everything else. We picked the breweries we wanted and even included a food stop. She coordinated the bus pick up, drop offs, schedule, and even reserved tables for us at each stop. I love that we had our own bus (very nice one, by the way!), and had the flexibility to create our own tour based on beers and food my husband liked. It was the perfect Saturday in Austin! Payment was very easy as well - they sent me an invoice to my email and I was able to pay directly online for everything. Highly recommend, and thank you Texas Tipsy Tours!"

I have taken quite a few van tours around the hill country and Texas Tipsy Tours sets themselves apart by not just being drivers but they truly host you the entire day. I will ALWAYS use this company going forward. We did a private charter from Driftwood to Austin, TX and back and Keaton our driver was a delight. He made sure we were picked up on time and each of our stops were easy and flexible. We did a mixed tour around Driftwood and Dripping springs the next day and our guide Eric executed the BEST DAY for us. He even picked up on what we were liking and recommended a change to our final stop to Vista Brewing and we were SO glad he did. At each stop he made sure we had plenty of water, snacks and chairs to enjoy the gorgeous venues. This is totally above and beyond what we would have expected from a driver. Courtney was so easy to work with and she helped make recommendations for our group ultimately making our weekend get away FLAWLESS. I promise if you don't use this company, you're wrong."

                "description": "Brandy was the best tour guide! My husband and I booked a tour/tasting for my birthday. Masks are worn and there is a plastic divider inside of the van.  The gentleman at Sister Creek who served our wine did great. Brandy was very knowledgeable, personable, professional and kind. She is a walking wealth of wine/vineyard information. If you're looking to book a tour, short or long, I highly recommend this company! We were given the option for her to provide a little info and just let us vibe or provide us with everything. I love all things wine so I went for it all! I wasn't disappointed. (Btw she took magnificent pictures for us as well)."

                "description": "A few of us from Houston wanted to do a wine tour birthday party for a friend.  Brandy was super accommodating in the reservation process and her husband Matt picked us up the day of at the hotel we were staying at in San Antonio.  He assured us it would be a very different tour from what we're accustomed do and he was right!  He was so knowledgeable that we really enjoyed the tour.    We had shopping time in Fredericksburg and we never felt rushed.  Excellent recovery on their part too when there was a slight hiccup in our reservation and with what was available to tour, he didn't skip a beat.  He  made other arrangements and we continued our tour.  Additionally, I left my iPhone charger in the van and they had it delivered the same day.  One of my girlfriend's left her sunglasses at the Sisters Creek Vineyards and Matt was able to recover the sunglasses and had them mailed the same day.  That's true service!  We would most definitely enjoy doing another tour with Cottonwood Wine Tours in the future and we plan to do so soon."

                "description": "This wine tour was for my niece to celebrate her birthday. I did not expect much but I was not impressed with the timeline, the first winery, the driving, or the mask mandate. To start, we were one of 3 stops and that should have been planned better. One pickup and drop off only. Second, the first winery was not pleasant, friendly, or poured enough wine to have two sips. The second winery was more energy and fun. The driving was a little unsettling. Before ever sipping wine, I felt sick in the van with the disruptive swerving and plowing over bumps. I was uncomfortable with the lack of ventilation as well. While I do not expect a lot for $125 a person, I did expect a fun experience. My recommendation is drive yourself, get a hotel, and not be confined to a timeline, other people, car sickness, or bad wine."

                "description": "What a great tour!  Diane picked our group of six up at our hotel and the adventure began!  We had our first stop at the Saint Tryphon winery, which was the cutest place with an amazingly knowledgeable and friendly staff!! Tres  presented our tastings and was great to talk and listen to.  Our group of six bought several bottles of wine.  We then journeyed to another gorgeous winery with a little less on the customer service.  We gave our feedback immediately to Diane, who said that she would have a discussion with that winery and I believe she will!  Diane then took us into Fredericksburg and pointed out many local establishments.  Throughout the day, Diane provided many facts and tons of information about the area.  She even managed a quick detour to drive by Luckenbach for us!  We chose this company because it is a small business and were very pleased with the personal touches, snack bags, and intimacy of this tour.  We would highly recommend this company for your wine tour adventures!"

                "description": "I met my mom and sister in San Antonio for my mom's 65th birthday.  They came by way of Chicago and I came in from Portland, Oregon.  My sister did all of the research for the trip and found Cottonwood wine tours so we could get out of the city and into the hill country of Texas.  It was a Friday and my mom's actual birthday when Matthew picked us up at the hotel.  Right off the bat he was really cool and laid back.  He had a lot of fun facts about San Antonio as he is from there and the drive out to Sister Creek winery seemed like we were just hanging out with a friend.  Coming from the Willamette valley I have seen plenty of winery's but nothing like this one. It is an old cotton mill turned into a small winery that produces some great Bordeaux varietal blends and even a Pinot Noir!  Matthew was very knowledgeable on the topic of wine and wine making.  After the wine tasting we headed to Luckenbach for some beer and a little live country music. There is a lot of history to this place and we had been there 33 years prior when my sister and I were toddlers.  He told us no rush and let us enjoy this little country music Mecca, he even had the famous song loaded up on his phone when we got back to the car.  We had him take a picture of us that emulated the one that had been taken so many years before.  Next stop was some Texas bbq, like real bbq, he said we couldn't expect any city bbq to be better and I would say he was right!  All in all this tour was awesome, I would have loved to take other tours with Matthew, like the Alamo or some of the other missions but I don't think he offers those yet, maybe an idea?  He was very personable, knowledgeable and friendly.  The type of person you want to be around and I know my mom had a very special birthday because of this tour/guide.  I highly recommend Cottonwood wine tours for any tour they offer in San Antonio, it is run by Matthew, his wife and his mother in-law and I look forward to returning here to see their success!"

We visited two wine vineyards and were able to spend the last hour of the tour walking around Fredericksburg. Overall, the tour was amazing! It was put together well and worth the price! I highly recommend doing this tour if you're in town visiting or live in San Antonio. They also give military discounts"

Matt picked us up and was super friendly and gave us a lot of information about San Antonio, the winery we were headed to, and was just overall really nice and friendly.  At the first winery at Sister Creek, we switched out with Brandy because she was doing the actual tour we booked, Matt was just doing our pick up. Brandy was super fun and every bit as good as Matt. She took us to another winery, let us walk around Fredericksburg (after some great advice on where to eat), then at the end decided she'd take us by a small local liquor distillery that makes some really cool stuff like jalapeno moonshine!  From start to finish, it was amazing. These two are friendly as can be, very knowledgeable, and nothing felt cookie cutter. They make it feel like a personal experience. I definitely recommend giving Cottonwood Wine Tours a try!"

He was so polite and interesting, genuinely knowledgeable when it came to wine and the Hill Country. After our first winery, we got back into the car to find goody bags with water and snacks waiting for us. He had extra chocolate if we needed it!    I really liked having time to eat and shop in Fredericksburg between drinking. He pointed out suggestions for places to eat or to drink more on Main Street before dropping us off. He even took us to a bonus winery not on the schedule since we were doing so well on time.   I highly recommend Cottonwood. Matt was easy to contact and professional throughout, even when we were all a bit tipsy. He was a very safe driver. Great job."

                "description": "Looking to experience great Hill Country wines and barbecue - we had both taking Winding Road Wine Tours Salt Lick Sunday Wine Tour.  The tour picked us up in Gruene in a new luxury bus at 10:30. We were greeted by the tour owner Billy Martin.  The bus was very comfortable with a u shaped seating arrangement and a table in the aisle.  Should seat around 12 people comfortably. The bus has a great sound system that is Bluetooth enabled - Billy played whatever we wanted from sources such as Pandora and Napster music service. First stop was Driftwood Estate Winery. Driftwood has perhaps the best winery views in the Hill Country.  I really enjoyed the reds and came away with a bottle of Longhorn Red to enjoy at our next stop Salt Lick Barbecue. Yes, Salt Lick is byob. It was beginning to rain and Billy dropped us off near the check in stand. He's thought of his customer's needs providing us large golf umbrellas. It was busy with people waiting to be seated. However, he got us seated right away. Our final two wineries were Fall Creek right across the street from Salt Lick and then Wimberley Valley Winery. Fall Creek has solid wines and the service for our group was outstanding. Wimberley Valley Winery was an unexpected pleasure. Their tasting room is roomy and comfortable with plenty room at the tasting bars and a comfortable seating area facing a large stone fireplace. They have a variety of wines bottled on site along with other wines from around the world. The grounds were spectacular with numerous large shaded decks to enjoy a glass or bottle as you wrap up your tour.  What a great Sunday drinking Texas wines, eating Texas barbecue and meeting new friends!"

There were 7 of us on a family vacation trip and we wanted to have a fun but classy wine tour where we got our money's worth and then some. As a new resident to the area, it's important for me to know what high quality tour guides are available. Well, Winding Road Hill Country Wine Tours with Billy is definitely the way to go, folks."

The vineyards selected by Billy are great - wonderful grounds and fantastic wines.  Billy (great guy) is well known at the vineyards and ensures you get great service and a great spot at the tasting bar.  The charcuterie board for lunch in conjunction with a tasting in a private room was very special.  All-in- all just a wonderful experience.  Highly recommend this tour.  I understand he also conducts craft beer and spirits tours (next time)"

An unplanned stop to provide a bathroom break before arriving at our destination was provided upon our request and was greatly appreciated. We ended up losing one of our group and our Driver allowed us to wait and look for them. Additionally, a phone was lost in the furniture and again our Driver provided concern, patience, and assistance in order to retrieve the seemingly stuck device.

We originally had the bus for 5 hours but Daniel was nice enough to let us add an additional hour to our trip for just a small charge. I would recommend ThunderDome Party Bus to anyone.   We definitely want to plan another trip in the summertime to go floating.  Thanks Daniel!!!"

The stereo system was bumping, and Daniel, our amazing driver, had no issue with us turning it up to 11.  Our group was most guys in their 30's and Daniel gave us good recommendations on spots to check out that were age appropriate.  In between spots, Daniel drove me to a gas station to help me restock on beer. He even came in and helped me carry and load beers into the coolers.  Great communicate from Daniel from beginning to end, and he someone found the perfect spot to pick us up on busy Rainey St at the end of the night.   Great value and great experience.  Highly recommend."

                "description": "So first....let me say that our group totally dropped the ball on planning.  We reached out to Carla 3-4 weeks before but did not confirm until the week of the wine tour.   By the grace of the \"wine\" Gods, Carla could fit us in her schedule!  She is completely open to letting you choose your places or you can follow her lead!   She picked us up at our accommodations which were several miles outside of Fredricksburg.  We did introductions and she laid out the things that were already scheduled for the day.  On our way to the first winery, we decided to \"reroute\" the tour to hit some lesser known spots.  TBH, we were excited for Carla's recommendations.    Our first stop was Six Shooter because of their variety of dry wines, sweet wines and meads.  You have to try the Jalapeno shooter!!!  SO GOOD!   Second, we made our tour time at Real Ale and did a beer tasting. Third, she realized the majority of our groups like Whiskey, so we stopped at Andalusia Whiskey in Blanco!  This place met the needs of our entire group (even the non-whiskey drinker) and was by far the most unique stop of their day!  If you go here, try the Cherry Cola cocktail!   We stopped for lunch at Pecan Street Brewing in Johnson City, where we drank lots of water and had really great food.   Our last stop of the tour was Zero815 Winery which had a cool mix of wines and friendly staff.   At the end of the day, Carla made sure that we made it back to our accommodations safe and sound.  We had the very best time and she knows some of the coolest places that you might miss without her expertise.  She was extremely professional and very down to earth.  She was always around to help with recommendations or just to snap photos of the group!     We highly recommend doing a tour with Carla and Texas Wine and Spirit Tours!   You won't be disappointed!   We'll be booking with her again the next time we are in the area!"

                "description": "My best friend and sister planned a weekend bachelorette party for me complete with a wine and art tour. The weather was pretty bad that morning, so we started a little late, but the van that they have is really, really nice, clean, and spacious. She even has a little stool in case you need help getting into the van, and she helps everyone get in and get out. We went to three places around the Johnson City area. The first one was a quick tasting, the second one we learned A LOT about wine and got a lesson in how to properly drink wine, and at the third winery we got the most interesting history lesson about President Johnson and Lady Bird Johnson from the winemaker himself. Leslee personally knows the places and owners and was just the best tour guide. One of the places on the tour where we were supposed to also eat dinner at cancelled due to the weather, but Leslee was quick to find a different place for us to go to. She took us to a cute cafe in downtown Johnson City where we ate a ridiculously good dinner. We even went to Leslee and her husband's bar at the end of the day for one last drink and got a chance to meet her sweet daughter as well. I thoroughly enjoyed the tour with Leslee and highly recommend D'Vine Tours!"

                "description": "Clint was a total professional and a wonderful driver.  At our first stop he ordered a different vehicle so everyone felt more comfortable.  What a surprise when he told us!  Didn't see that coming.  Three great tastings with good friends.  Discovered some very nice 2015 Texas wines.  The grapes have matured immensely since 2008 and glad to finally enjoy some good Texas wines.   Can't recommend this company any lower than *****!  Thank you Discovery Wine Tours for a memorable afternoon."

                "description": "Used Discover Texas Wine Tours for a 30th birthday. John, our driver, was wonderful. He called me a couple of days before to introduce himself and to confirm the pickup details. He also called me the day of and was on time. He made sure we were settled at each location and made it a great experience. Felt very safe - John wore a mask the whole time. Also, Kathie helped plan the itinerary. She's familiar with the wineries and distilleries in the area, and was very friendly. Couldn't recommend them more!"

                "description": "I was so impressed with this tour the first time we booked that I had to book it for another party! Well, this time it wasn't as impressive. I don't know if the business has just gotten bigger than the owners can handle but communication was subpar. It took several calls and emails to get answers sometimes.   At our first tour, Kathie took tons of photos and would pose us at the wineries. This tour, we had to prompt her. It was a cloudy day so not the best for outdoor pics but I was disappointed we took most of them ourselves or had to ask her to take the pictures.   Our tour was April 11, it is now almost 2 mths later I haven't received the few pictures we took. I emailed twice and have finally heard back that the SD is apparently not working. I'm not sure why I had to email to find this out, seems like this info should have been divulged as soon as the problem presented itself.   I hate to downgrade the star review but my second time with this company just wasn't as epic as the initial tour I took with them. The wineries all seem to love this company though."

                "description": "We had a small group of three, but did it right with a Discover Texas Wine Tour limousine. DTWT was very accommodating, scheduled the wineries we wanted to see, ordered the lunches, and then confirmed our selections a couple of days prior to our tour. At the last minute after visiting with a couple in our third stop, we changed our fourth stop to a different winery. Jason (our driver) was happy to accomodate us. My only regret is that we didn't choose a few wineries a little further out of town, so we could spend more time in the limo listening to our Willie Nelson songs. Jason was awesome, and I highly recommend this tour."

                "description": "We started researching half-day wine tours for my BFF's bachelorette party several months in advance and chose this company because of its good reviews and cancellation policy (full refund up to 7 days in advance).   First, the bad news. The booking process is way more arduous than it should be. My initial discussion about the tour plans happened over the phone, so I asked for a written, e-mail confirmation of what we had discussed - specifically how the deposit and refund policies work. It took me more than three weeks to get that first e-mail confirmation of our booking and deposit payment. I then went back and forth, back and forth, back and forth with the company, hammering out the details, like setting a pickup location and our choices for the winery stops. Many times, three weeks would pass and I'd have to make multiple attempts before I would get a response to my e-mails. Sometimes, the responses would be incomplete and we'd repeat the process of trying to get information confirmed. Seriously a pain for an experience that costs $129 per person.   Now, the good news. The online payment portal for each attendee was a breeze to use and eliminated the need to handle money all through one person. As for the actual tour itself, we couldn't have asked for a better experience. Our driver, Bobby, was on time and wonderful on the day of the tour. He was funny and polite and had good knowledge of the area. Also, very importantly, he was a good and safe driver! The Mercedes bus we took was very clean and spacious, and they provided water, cups and napkins. They also allowed us to bring our own food onto the bus. The three wineries we visited, Driftwood Estate, Duchman and Fall Creek, were all accommodating and fun. The views were lovely and we never felt rushed and made it back on time. It was raining when we got back to our car, and Bobby was so nice and helped us get our stuff back into our car in the pouring rain.   All in all, despite a wonderful wine tour, I'm not sure I would recommend this company, only because I spent way too much time hounding them throughout the booking process. While the wine was excellent, I NEEDED to drink after dealing with their horrible communication. Discover Texas Wines should strongly consider re-evaluating their communication practices and hire more people to keep up with the demand for their service. It's the only way they will stay competitive in the long-run!"

He picked us up on time, was incredibly friendly, and funny even though we were a bachelorette party and knowing the possibility of it getting crazy with 7 girls. Seriously, request Roy. He made the trip a blast. There was cold water for us in the bus. Oh did I mention it's a Mercedes bus? Super nice! An AUX cable was available to play our own music too. The selection of wineries was amazing, perfect mixture between red and whites/dry and sweet, so every one of us could have something tasty. The drive was beautiful and not too far out of Austin. Overall, I am very impressed with this tour and the wonderful employees. Would definitely go again."

                "description": "Absolutely do not recommend using this company. I made the reservation back in January, gave my card for deposit and was told I'd be emailed a link for everyone to pay. Over the next two months I called and emailed asking about the link so my friends could pay their part and I was repeatedly told they were having issues. Okay fine, no big deal- I also emailed again saying we can just pay the day of if the link wasnt working and never received a response. The day before our tour, as I was driving from Dallas to Fredericksburg I get a call from Some guy at the company and he seemed very annoyed with me saying no one had paid yet. Um.. I'm sorry I didn't realize you finally sent it after months of my asking. (He had sent it the day before calling me to tell me no one had paid) The vehicle I requested was not the one that showed up. The driver Julia was late bc she did not write the address down correctly. We also had 3 girls cancel last minute, so we were down to 5 instead of 8. Considering there minimum is 5 I wasn't expecting that to be a problem but Julia felt the need to bring it up multiple Times as if it caused some inconvenience for her. Rude people, horrible communication."

Organizing a full day wine tour for 50 people in the Texas Hill Country may not sound like an easy task, but Noel at Discover Texas Wine Tours made it smooth and most importantly, unforgettable. His main goal is to make sure everyone is comfortable and has a good time! Most companies were not able to host a group this size, but Noel made it happen. He made sure our bus was the best he could find, worked to have a lunch catered for us at one of the stops, set up private tastings with many of the wineries to accommodate a group our size, even stopped to let one of the guys who didn't drink wine buy some beer. I can't say enough good things about Noel and how hard he worked for our group. I highly recommend him and look forward to another tour with him soon!!"

Throwing a surprise weekend is stressful enough but Woody was SUPER accommodating especially for being so last minute.  There were many tours that I could've chosen to stick with but Woody was so authentic about his services and was a person of integrity when it came to what he offered.  He personally picked us up from our little hotel we were staying at and drove us to all three of our tours. His tour bus was super clean and we all had a blast! He even offered to pick up some cheese and snacks at the HEB close by to have on the bus if we wanted! I really appreciated Woody taking the time to answer my numerous phone calls with questions I had as this is my first Bachelorette party I threw.  I HIGHLY recommend using Woody if anyone wants to have a great time and looking for someone to trust. I will be booking with you again Woody, thank you so much for everything!"

If you come across Fredericksburg Uncorked Wine Tours, stop your search and make the booking.   Organizing a wine tour for 18 girls as part of a bachelorette party was a breeze with Woody, the owner/operator of Uncorked. He gave great advice, offered competitive pricing (especially for the expectant mothers/non-drinkers in our group), and was easy to communicate with. Woody was incredibly patient during the lead up to our tour, and then was a funny, gracious, and attentive guide during our wine tasting experience.   Our tour was fantastic from start to finish, and I can't recommend Woody and the rest of the Fredericksburg Uncorked team highly enough. All (18) of us had the greatest time!"

My husband and I are not about organized tours all that much, but this tour was not an organized group of people like a lot of tours are. He went out of his way to text us even before the tour and recommend places for us to go. We loved him so much we even hung out with him after the tour. He is an awesome tour guide and a blast to hangout with and knows anyone and everyone! Can't recommend this tour enough!"

I called him Friday morning at 8:50 hoping I'd get a call back before the 10 am tour and I did ten min later and I was able to get on his first tour . I honestly called three or 4 more tours throughout the week and left messages and he is the only one that called me back. Not only did woody come through, he came through at the last minute when I thought We weren't going to make a tour.  He was funny , knowledgeable and overall a great guide. He even recommended a few things that weren't apart of the tour (Alamo Springs Cafe) which we ended up going to and was delicious.  Lunch was not included but the place we went to was pretty great for a sandwich . I'd hang out and grab a beer with woody any night !  Thank you for making my boyfriends birthday a good one !!"

He responded to my call right away and set us up with a 4 person private tour plus lunch. We all had a great time with lots of funny narratives.

                "description": "Woody was nice at the beginning but there was miscommunication about lunch and he decided to take it upon himself to charge my credit card without my permission. I was upset and apparently he was too so he threw customer service out the window. I never agreed to Woody keeping my credit card information on file after he charged the wine tour for 11 girls (almost $1,300).   The driver Tommy was nice but he did nothing special and didn't know the basics of Woody's business. Had he known even a little bit about Uncorked Tours, there wouldn't have been confusion about lunch.   As far as the wine tour: William Chris and Lost Draw were my favorite wineries. Hye Market pretended we weren't there half of the time. Pontotoc was greedy with their pours.   Woody was very unprofessional and difficult to work with at the end. I would not recommend him. Book early to get the highest rated wine tours (2-3 months prior)!"

I called the number provided on the website and had a great conversation with Woody. He set up the perfect private winery tour for me and my friends on Sunday, since Saturday was full. It was a really great and memorable experience and I would definitely consider doing it again! We had our own spacious limo that we could sip on wine we brought with us, as well as some we purchased at the wineries we visited, while driving from one vineyard to the next (drive time between each location was max. 15 minutes). Overall a great experience!"

Sam, the owner and driver, was unbelievable. Very accommodating, great driver, and super chill.   We planned to hit up the Salt Lick on the party bus and then venture around to some breweries afterwards. Sam made sure that the group got where we needed to be on time, had great suggestions for breweries, and made sure we were having as much fun as possible.  The bus is great. Fit everyone comfortably with enough room for a cooler in between all of us. Sam had her playlist turned up or she would hand over the AUX cord and we could play our tracks as loud as we wanted. The whole experience was incredibly laid back and worry free. I would absolutely recommend Cool bus ATX to anyone that wants to have a great time with a big group in Austin.   On a side note, if it is Sunday, make sure that you buy beer on Saturday because they don't sell it on Sunday before noon.   Thanks again, Sam!"

We stopped in on 3 different wineries and Kim had made superb choices in each spot; from the wines to the view to the suggestions on what to try and how to make the most of our samples so everyone could try as many as possible (thanks for that tip, Kim!).

                "description": "Brayden and Deb are an amazing duo. Very personable and easy to work with. They aim to exceed your wildest wine tour expectations! The transportation (van) was very clean and well-taken care of. We had the van to ourselves on the couple's tour but it can easily fit a big party!  Booking a couple's wine tour on their website was super easy (and I'm sure it would be for big groups too)! The date availability, cost estimate, and customizability is spot-on. The moment you book, they send you a comprehensive list of wineries and distilleries (!!!) with rankings of the view + wine. They also have great options for add-ons, such as a charcuterie board or stopping by for lunch mid-wine tour. Love that.  There's no doubt I would choose and recommend 830 Elevated again for any future wine excursions in Hill Country. Thanks again, Brayden and Deb :)"

Deb (co-owner and our tour guide) was absolutely AMAZING and she made sure that we had everything we needed!!!  Seriously can't wait to book again next time we are in Fredericksburg and we have already decided it needs to be a yearly trip for us!   They were so informative and helpful with picking out which vineyards would be best for us and answered all of my questions quickly and with helpful details and suggestions!!"

                "description": "We had the absolute BEST time with Brayden on our tour. From start to finish everything was so easy and customizable to what we were looking for while planning our annual girls trip. Prices are incomparable with Five Star treatment on a PRIVATE tour. Right after booking we got an email with a list of the area wineries and restaurants that had notes and ratings so we could choose where we wanted to go. This is a private tour so Brayden picked us up right in front of our Airbnb and we were off. We toured four wineries and he kept us on schedule but never rushing us. After the tours we opted for the night service so he dropped us off on Main Street so we could grab dinner, sing some karaoke and when ready to be picked up to end the evening just had to shoot him a text and he was there. We just cannot say enough good things about this company. Do not second guess - book with Brayden and Deb"

They were on time and very accommodating, went as far as going to buy a stool for my friend who has trouble getting up and down the steps to the van. The wineries they took us to were exactly what we asked for. We never felt rushed and they handled everything for us and we never had to lift a finger to do anything. I would 100% recommend them and will definitely be using them again!"

                "description": "I came across 830 when our bed and breakfast cancelled our room and wine tour reservation (due to remodeling) a month before our 10 year anniversary trip to Fredericksburg. I believe they were on the city website as a recommended tour, but also Google directed me to them. Either way, I am so glad it happened this way - our experience with 830 was indeed elevated!!! The customized tour that Deb set up with me over the phone was exactly what my husband and I wanted - a distillery, a brewery, and a winery that made you feel like you were in Napa. Without even knowing us, Deb helped picked the perfect places for us to enjoy. Communication up until the tour and the day of the tour was prompt and courteous, always with our best intentions in mind (example: Deb texted us and offered to pick us up even earlier than planned due to the heat at one of the outdoor locations). The drive in between locations was full of great conversation, and we were thankful they provided cold water for us. The van was immaculate and the drive was very comfortable - I didn't know the luxury that a private vs public tour would offer! Deb was so knowledgeable (she's a local, of course!) and so sweet with helping us newbies figure out what to do. Her service went above and beyond, and she made us feel like celebrities. It was an absolute pleasure to work with them - do yourself the best favor and book with them!!"

They made the trip so easy, worry-free, and fun! Brayden and Deb were super communicative and gave us a wide variety of wineries to choose from. We ended up going to Baron's Creek, Signor, and Augusta Vin. Deb was our tour guide and took care of absolutely everything and was such a joy to be around. If you are headed to Fredericksburg and wanting to visit the wineries, you won't regret choosing to book through 830 Elevated!!"

                "description": "We toured Fredericksburg with Brayden and he was very friendly, knowledgeable, and flexible with our requests. We were able to customize our winery stops which was not the experience we had previously with a different wine tour company. We spent the day with our group of four instead of getting shuttled around with strangers to fill seats (which I really prefer)! We requested a charcuterie board in the vehicle and Brayden picked it up while we were at one of our stops. We will definitely be back and use 830 Elevated for all of our future trips!"

                "description": "I like their hustle. Wife and I wanted a private custom tour (because COVID). But the best we could find was a limo driver that would charge us almost what it would for 4 people. Then we found 830 Elevated. They're filling a niche most tour companies aren't by providing an affordable private tour option for couples. They were great. Small, young company. They don't have deep knowledge on wine like veteran companies but they are personable in that they also tour wineries themselves and can share their inputs."

                "description": "The worst experience. Here's my story-   I booked with this company over a month in advance prior to my trip to Fredericksburg for my fiancé and I's anniversary, as well as his birthday. After booking, the company was very communicative for the first few days. After the first few days, I did not hear a word from them until the week of our trip. I had told them a month in advance which places we wanted to go. The week of, they inform us that Augusta vin is not taking people for reservations. Which was fine, we went ahead with the other vineyard they had suggested. We had booked for a Saturday. That Friday at 3:00AM, they had informed us of a change of driver due to a family emergency which we completely understood, and now that our pickup time had changed to 11:30AM instead of 1:30PM. I wake up to that email Saturday still understanding, and we changed our plans to be at the pickup destination by 11:30AM. We are waiting there over 15 minutes for them to show, and no one does. We call, leave voicemails, and still hear from no one. 30 minutes passed, they send a TEXT MESSAGE informing us they aren't showing up for the entire time and that we are on our own for the entire day. LEAVING OUR PLANS FOR THE ENTIRE DAY RUINED. Incredibly horrid communication from this company. DO NOT BOOK WITH THIS COMPANY!!!! I seriously am understanding that situations happen in life, but they had guaranteed us a driver for the day regardless of what had happened. I was truly heartbroken to have not received a personal phone call from the company, instead they just send us a text that they are not coming. I have NEVER written a review for a company before, but this needed to be shared. We discussed the situation with multiple locals in the town, no one had ever heard of this company. Whatever you do, save your money and time."

He was quick to respond and helped me schedule a party bus big enough for all of us. David, our driver, showed up early and made sure we had everything we needed for the trip. He had a giant cooler with ice and waters that we were able to load up with seltzers. I booked our wineries ahead of time which made getting into the tastings a breeze. David made sure we got to each winery on time and went in ahead to ensure each winery was ready for us when we arrived. He even coordinated to have the band at one of the wineries sing Happy Birthday! David was absolutely fantastic, and we had a great time with him. We will definitely be booking with them again for our next trip. I highly recommend Open Range Tours to anyone visiting Fredericksburg!"

As this was my first Texas wine tour, he did an AMAZING job of helping us select which wineries would be a good fit for the group.  As we had a decent amount of guys with us- he suggest Garrison Brother's Distillery which ended up being a HUGE hit!  He was extremely professional, courteous and just an absolute delight to spend the day with!  He also has a wicked funny sense of humor.  He was also very accommodating and ordered and picked up lunch for us so we could continue to enjoy beautiful Hill Country.

A 15 passenger VAN showed up with a dent in the side and ripped seats. We were told we could bring coolers. We were only able to fit 8 adults in the van with our two coolers- no way we could've had another person in the van. None of the wineries had been scheduled yet and the ONE we had specifically requested was not available. We had to scramble ourselves to find wineries, in which we were promised everything would be done ahead of time. The meat and cheese tray that was promised was a small tray that was bought during the tour at a convenient store to feed 2 people. Our driver was great, however the owner did not deliver what was promised and we were highly disappointed. There are plenty of companies to choose from, and I would NOT recommend Open Range."

They know a lot about the wineries and have personal relationships with the owners/managers/tasting staff.  David also went above and beyond by making an extra stop for shopping/pie-indulging and by dropping us off at our dinner restaurant so we didn't have to walk from the visitor center where he picked us up.  Highly recommend!!!"

                "description": "We went to Fredericksburg for a girls trip and wanted to spend a day at the distilleries and breweries. David was fantastic to work with planning everything out. I wouldn't have changed any of that part. But, once the day rolled around we were met with a hiccup. The driver, not David like I was anticipating after multiple conversations, arrived in a mustang for 5 of us. Obviously that wasn't going to work so I was offered by the driver only to cancel or reschedule. Our trip was planned around spending our day out and about so cancelling wasn't an option for us. After a phone call to David, we were assured our day wasn't ruined just a bit delayed. The driver left and showed back up with an SUV and away we went. The driver wasn't interactive and she didn't seem to even be having a good day... It happens I get it but come on. Anyway, we made the best of our day and enjoyed ourselves. When we were dropped off, I tried to pay but she said to get with David. No problem but I did have a problem with her then saying that she'd go ahead and take the gratuity and that the standard is 20%. I didn't even know what our total cost was to figure 20% but asking for the gratuity before I even paid for the day was in poor taste. We did go ahead and tip, and well mind you, because that's the kind of people we are. I ended up calling David and finishing out the transaction and once again, he was a pleasure to deal with. Overall, we'll use them again because I appreciated David that much. But, I'll definitely make sure we don't have the same driver. 5 stars for David but 4 stars overall for the above mentioned."

It was so relaxing to sit back and enjoy the day with friends, all while knowing every detail had been taken care of.  This coming from a very \"type A\" personality is a huge 5 star! We did the \"red rose\" package, touring 3 wineries and had a few hours in Luckenbach.  John was friendly, fun and a great host. All we had to do is drink wine, visit with friends and enjoy the day! If you are looking for a fun experience, try Yellow Rose! We will be back next year to do it all over again!"

                "description": "Do not use this \"tour\"!! It is cheaper to pay the tasting fees and hire your own driver. The owner is greedy and a complete A. We originally had 5 ladies who were going on the tour with us and one backed out. We didn't ask for a private tour and John (who I'm guessing is the owner) didn't tell us until we were already at the first location that he would stop the tour until we paid for a fifth person that wasn't there. No wonder he kept pushing cash, it was a complete rip off. It was either go home after that tour paying $125 a person..Or have two more tours while paying for a person who wasn't there. PS it's about $15 for the wine tastings. ($15x3=$45) It was not worth it. On a positive note, Gary at Hanhe Estates winery was amazing. Highly recommend this guy and his wine."

We were picked up and then drove for 45 minutes without our driver, John, saying a word about where we were going or how long it would take to get there. He then picked up 3 other people when it was supposed to be a private tour. He took us to the wineries but never said a word about where to go or what to do. He followed us around at the wineries and sat with us. He was 30 minutes late then forgot what the schedule was supposed to be and tried to keep us at the 2nd winery until 30 minutes after we were supposed to be home. He told us we could pay with cash or card, but he only actually took cash or PayPal, which put some people in a real bind. He hounded us about payment the whole time. It was awful and we will never do it again."

                "description": "I rented a party bus through this company a couple weeks ago. In the beginning, Robert was extremely accommodating and friendly. And our driver, Terrell, was great. We got dropped off at COTA for a show and had a great time!  But where it turned south was at the end of the night. I texted our driver 30 minutes before we needed to be picked up (like he requested) and he said no problem. Then we left the concert and were walking to the pickup spot where I gave him a call. He said he got in an accident but would only be 20 minutes and I said that's fine. 20 minutes roll by and I gave him a call again, no answer, but texted and said it would be another 20 minutes. We ended up waiting in the cold for almost an hour and well after most people had left COTA. Multiple people in our party ended up just taking ubers because they didn't want to wait. The whole point of a bus is so you don't have to wait.  The next day, I texted Robert saying we would like a refund for the extra hour we paid for waiting that we wouldn't have used if we had been picked up on time. He said he would call to discuss but never did. I've now sent him multiple emails - mind you, being incredibly nice about it. All I asked for was an hour refunded back - not the whole thing, not even half. But still no response.  The customer service level of this company is terrible should anything go wrong. So hire them at your own risk."

We had rented a party bus on pretty short notice to take a Bachelor Party to and from Lake Travis and Robert and team were amazing.   It was also Prom weekend so the schedule was packed for them but they still took care of us and worked with our schedule.   Our boat ended up staying out on the water longer than scheduled which through our plans all over the place and Robert was there waiting on time. Given his packed schedule, the driver did have to leave without us but Robert made sure to get me in contact with another service and they sent a bus over right away.

                "description": "I'm incredibly frustrated with this business.  We had spoken a couple times in the months before I decided to book and I initially felt great about potentially booking with these friendly people.  When it came time to book I called them and was told, once again, that our requested date was open and we talked out an agreement.  The owner tells me we're good to go, and that all he needed me to do now was to send him my information so that he could get a contract sent that same day.  I'd explained to him that I was booking this bus ride to and from a party boat, and that I would be booking with them that day as well.   SO, I get off the phone and send my info.  I call my party boat folks to let them know I've just confirmed my bus, and I'm ready for a boat.  I book with them based on my discussion with these guys and put down $400 to hold our reservation.  It's been two weeks since I last spoke with this company and they have ignored my calls, texts, voicemails trying to figure out why the contract hasn't come through.  Our event is next month, and at this point I've been researching new solutions, and unfortunately the new solution means I can't use the same boat company, and therefore I've lost my $400 deposit.  I did not have this money to lose, but after being ghosted by this company I guess I have to take the loss and move on.  They seem like nice people, and it takes A LOT to get on here and write a negative review, but this has caused me a lot of stress and I want to prevent this from happening to anyone else.  I hope at some point I find out a reasonable explanation and can revise this review, but not counting on it.  We'll see I guess."

                "description": "BOOK WITH THIS COMPANY!  Robert did a solid job taking me and a bunch of my friends to Lake Travis and back on July 4th. His price was WAY lower than other companies I called, being the ONLY one that actually sticked to his regular prices during this busy day. He arrived early and was 100% responsive to my emails and phone calls. He arrive early to pick us up and was extremely friendly and professional. He helped us carry our coolers and accommodate everything on the bus.  The bus itself is amazing. Seats are stacked in two rows facing each other, which is great for dancing and socializing, since you are actually facing half of the crowd. The sound system is also very good. I almost feel that the bus trip was even more fun that the boat.   In summary, Austin Nites Ent. is the best on price/quality, Robert and his wife are responsive, professional and friendly, and the whole experience I had with them is positive. Would highly recommend anyone to use it, and will definitely consider using them again if I ever need to.  Thank you guys!!!!!"

                "description": "We rented a party bus from Robert for my brother's 30th birthday. They were one of the only companies I found that didn't increase their rates because of prom season. I called about 10 other companies looking for fun and safe travels with almost all of them being ridiculously overpriced to take advantage of the prom goers. Robert was very accommodating, professional, and had awesome rates. He called two days before the scheduled time of arrival to check in and verify everything was still good to go. He asked if there were any changes in the amount of people and offered a bigger bus just in case. Our drivers, Patrick and Joe were awesome! Patrick called me early the day of to verify everything and let me know he'd be there at 8 and then called again when they were almost to our pickup location. They arrived right on time with an awesome bus just for us. He had coolers with ice, a flat screen tv, music system, AC and even a bathroom in the back. What more could you ask for? Part of the evening was spent at Graham's Central Station in Pville. We didn't realize prior that Graham's doesn't serve food anymore and had to order pizza to the bus. Patrick gladly retrieved our pizza and brought it to us when it arrived. We all had a blast, felt safe and were taken care of. Highly recommend Austin NItes and shout out to Patty PartyWagon, if you had a Yelp page, I'd write a review for you too."

The place wasn't too crowded but they just opened in November and I think people are going to be learning about this place and packing it out very soon!   They grow grapes on the property but all the wine I had was outsourced since their weren't ready yet. They had three wines to try (white, rose and red) but will be having six very soon as their home grown grapes are about ready. I enjoy dry, less sweet wines and these were perfect. Highly encourage you to put this spot on your wine tours of Wimberly! They also have some snacks/small bites if you are hungry."

They now have 4 wines and all of them were delicious. I'm not a sweet wine drinker and gratefully none of them were sweet. One crisp white, 2 rosés and a red. We left with a bottle of the red and one of the rosés too. The property and views are beautiful. They have two decks with tables and umbrellas to relax and enjoy the wine, the views, the weather and a fabulous charcuterie platter. It is a bit tricky getting there BUT it is well worth it. Don't miss this delightful vineyard!"

                "description": "The olives!  This place is a fun foodie shop right on the beautiful Wimberley Square. It looks like it might have been a gas station or something at some time, but you can tell that they've spent a lot of time and effort to making it an appealing place to learn about new flavors. When I went, they were celebrating National Paella Day, and had lots of little Spanish flags everywhere. (I would've appreciated a Catalonian flag in there, but let's not get political with the paella.) The clerk patiently explained to the visitors what paella was, and seemed attentive and on the ball. The store also sells paella kits, with a dish, pimenton, bomba rice, some saffron- everything you need for a paella party!  My favorite thing about this place is all the pickled, canned stuff they have- crazy olives with wild stuffings in them from all over Texas, and some from abroad. They also have hot sauces and fun things to take home to show how we do it in Texas.  There's also a wine desk, where they'll pour you a glass of something good. They focus heavily on Texas wines, and if you ask me, the reds are where it's at. Really, the Texas red varietals of wine go quite well with Spanish food- they're similar grapes, I believe.  We skipped out on having lunch here, but really enjoyed the merchandise they had and the vibe of the place. It seems that part of it is still under construction, and they aim to expand.  Be sure to check out the real live olive tree out front!"

                "description": "We were so excited to check out a new place in Wimberley, and we'd heard such great things about the Buda location but....yikes, we will definitely not be returning, sadly.  We walked in around 1pm hoping for a simple lunch- we only ordered one sandwich and two sides. An hour later, we finally had all of our items :( she packed it to go for us since I told her we'd been waiting so long and my fiancé had to get back to work. If they had told us about the crazy wait time before we ordered, we would've appreciated the heads up so much. It was confusing to us since it didn't seem busy at all- she told us they were understaffed. I guess that might also explain why it took so long for anyone to acknowledge us when we stood at the counter- we had already ordered but had to go back for water, napkins etc (no one came and checked on us or anything). The girl at the counter just went about her business and seemed to be ignoring us...  After all that, if the food had been amazing, that could've been a saving grace but, unfortunately, it was ...just ok? What a bizarre experience. Maybe we came at a bad time - I hope they get properly staffed soon!"

Three employees behind the counter and not one had a greeting or smile to offer.  Just blank faces.  There were four customers at one table so it wasn't like the restaurant was busy.  After asking about how ordering works, we ordered two entrees.   After about 20 minutes, one entree arrived.  We split it in half and after finishing it, another employee came and asked if he could clear our plates.  We said we were still waiting for the second entree.  No reaction.  My boyfriend said, \" could you please go check? If it hasn't been started, don't start it now.\" The employee said, okay.  Five minutes later and no update.  We decided to cut our losses.  Head up to pay at the counter. Three employees standing there again.  We tell them we are done and please take the second entree off the bill. One employee says alright and the scowliest female, who never spoke or assisted previously, says, \" it's ready now so you have to pay.\" Nope. We will not be returning. Every recent review is similar to this one and that tells me that no one cares."

Overall a great place it's stop and check out while you're in Wimberley."

                "description": "it was nice to get to a vineyard that was hospitable and had darn good wine.  We continued through our drive in the countryside south of Austin to the next vineyard, which was Driftwood.  after pulling in and walking down the trail to the main house we got in line to do a tasting.  actually my gal got a tasting, was happy to try a full pour of the Cabernet they have.   While we waited I took in the rooms that we were in.  It was a homey vibe with lots of small things to buy and others to just look at. The tasting was pretty good, but I took my glass of wine outside to the edge of what seemed the property as it dropped off sharply down a hill. There was some chairs there to sit and look out over the valley and that's just what I did.  it is a beautiful spot to appreciate the views of the wine valley here.  I could see the vineyards crawling over the hills on the other side.   There was a gazebo a ways to my right with a couple people people enjoying there wine there.  They had some classic rock songs going on the sound system which added to the relaxed vibe. I would definitely recommend going, and for sure enjoy the view out back."

The tasting isn't inexpensive but the pours are generous and the quality is superior to many other wineries.  The staff was knowledgeable and friendly. The terrace view is panoramic and spectacular. I'm so glad I stumbled upon this winery again when avoiding I-35 back to Austin from San Marcos."

                "description": "Absolutely horrible experience this afternoon. My review is similar to those before me. There is a long list of rules and policies posted at the front. The one policy not listed is one you will be yelled at for violiting and practically chased out of the building for. We went in with the intention or purchasing a wine tasting experience. The woman behind the bar was rude, as others have mentioned, and did not tell us anything about the rules. We received our pour and stepped away to sit outside since, while the website boasts table tastings, there aren't any tables inside. We were yelled at in an absolutely abrasive manner by two woman behind the bar. We were then informed that we were not allowed to take our tastings outside and come back inside for the remaining pours. They stated: \"it's just too busy to allow that on the weekends\". There were four other people inside. Busy? I think not. There isn't a sign anywhere stating you must remain inside for the duration of the tasting. The women were so incredibly rude when referencing a policy that isn't stated anywhere and that we were completely unaware of. It was humiliating and aggressive. So many other wineries allow you to taste at your pace and sit wherever you'd like. This was not the case. We were so thrown off by such atrocious customer service that we settled on a bottle just to get out of the building.   Hours later I saw one of the same woman chase a woman out of the building while yelling \"excuse me, excuse me\" because the woman had violated some other unstated policy. Chasing after and yelling at paying customers does not invite a relaxing winery experience.   We are local to the area and are members of two other wineries. We would have been back but my opinion of this \"estate\" winery has been permanently soured. Don't aggressively yell at customers in front of other guests and certainly don't chase them around your property. We'll stick to welcoming wineries with better tasting wine like Duchman, Bell Springs, Wimberely Valley, and Fall Creek. If you're looking for a great Texas winery skip this place and head elsewhere."

Beautiful area you can see the vineyard from up top.  Dogs welcome, to s of land outside for the doggies yo play in.   We tasted award winning wine from TEXAS grapes!  I'll just bet that when the temperature is a bit WARMER, and the sunshine's one would have a memorable time relaxing and enjoying a bottle or two  Some nibbles you can purchase, not a whole lot the time we were there, remember it was TUESDAY"

                "description": "We made a quick stop at this winery and enjoyed the view while having a glass of wine.  I chose a jammy Cabernet called Lone Star Cab that was perfect. They do wine tasting but I just opted for a glass of what I knew that I would enjoy.    The cafe was not open but they had items that paired well with wine.  I'm sure it is busy in the weekend.  The Cafe is small so get your food to go and enjoy one of the many cozy spots to view the vineyards.   The staff were very friendly and the store was very clean.  They have gifts as well.  If we were in town longer, We would have come back for lunch.    The road to the vineyard is gravel so drive slow.  Parking is free and plentiful.  Follow the signs as the vineyard is about a mile up from the main road."

The wine was fine but definitely not the sole reason to visit, so make sure you have a couple places you're bopping around to in the area. Cute little tasting glasses and there's a shop for kitschy items featuring a lot of wine puns.    I do think the crowd skews a bit older, so better suited for entertaining folks than a bach party!"

                "description": "Beautiful winery 25 minutes from Wimberly! We stopped by during 4th of July and was surprised there wasn't more of a crowd. Strict 21+ policy (many signs warning you to turn back if you aren't 21!) but the servers were so nice and kind. We did a wine tasting which was $20 for 6 samples of white, red, and sweet wine. You can also split the sampling between people, which I shared with a friend. Server (I think her name was Julie) was so sweet and knowledgeable about the wine flavors and gave us recommendations and some history of the flavors. Our favorite was the Starry Night, or the Orange Muscat wine! A bit disappointed they didn't give chocolates or nuts during a wine tasting and overall felt a bit rushed through the process as more people showed up, but it was still a unique experience.   The patio has a beautiful view of the orchard, which is why we came here versus other wineries in the area. Outdoor seating is plentiful, many round tables for larger groups too. Definitely would've spent a good half of day out here sipping wine if it wasn't for the rain. The Bistro (food/restaurant area) was closed because of Covid so eat before you arrive so you don't get hangry or wine drunk! ;)"

They are on a hill so that the outdoor seating has a great view.  We got 2 tastings and for the most part I enjoyed all of their wines. The Alamo Red was great and so was the Longhorn Red. My wife enjoyed the Chardonnay as well. The servers were very helpful and help guide us to their more popular wines.   We ended up buying a couple of bottles and really enjoyed the experience and the view. We plan on coming here again soon!"

                "description": "The wife and I tasted a flight of 6 wines: including the Rose, Cab, Red Blend, Merlot, Sangovese, and Syrah.  They were all simply awful swill. Everyone of the varietals lacked depth, character and complexity.  Everyone of the reds tasted blah, and I mean blah. They all lacked the distinctive aroma and notes that each of the grapes are known for.  The Rose  lacked any minerality that one would expect, and was as bad as the others.  The tasting room experience was as bad as the wines. The server had zero personality or character either.  We came away with the same thoughts as we have from other Hill Country Wineries.  They should not, nor should they be attempting to produce well known wines, and in fact do a terrible version of Cabs, Merlots, and Chards.  They should stick to Italian varietals, as well as a few others that might be better suited to the Texas climate, even though most people have no idea about those varietals. I suppose its just marketing to attract people in to the tasting room, and once they get toasted enough it no longer matters, since once the minds fogs, its just pour me another."

The ambiance is fantastic and is worth the visit to just get a bottle and enjoy the panoramic views.   Pro tip: they do not allow children, so know that before you go.

They wipe down tables in between people and staff are all wearing mask. Plenty of space outside for proper social distancing and enjoying some wine. We grabbed a bottle and ate at the small restaurant they have there. Would recommend you make reservations if you want a view. Service was great and food was amazing. My favorite was the pizza, don't remember the name of it but it had honey on it and it was the perfect amount of sweetness.

They have an outdoor sitting area where you can admire the views and the bottle that you order is brought to you by a server who wears a face shield and gloves.    My group ordered a bottle of the 2017 Newsom Cabernet Sauvignon and we were pleased with our choice. It was not dry like a Merlot but just right. This winery does not allow you to bring outside food only the food offered in their bistro outdoor facility. This was not an issue for us.   Overall, it was a pleasant experience."

Prior to this place, everything I tasted was a mixture of sour fermented grapes. Not knocking Texas wines but they are just not my style. Maybe it needs an ice cube. Every wine here, ones that I tasted, is 100% Texan and done the way I think it is suppose to taste. Also, the view from the estate is beautiful. Very worth a stop for tasting and buying."

We went an 75 minutes out of our way to stop in for a tasting to see what peaked our interest in their current offerings. We loved that they have so much beautiful outdoor space. That is something that was always a major draw for us at Driftwood.   We called ahead, let them know we had a pup with us, and wanted to do a tasting. They told us to come on in. (It was a Monday and the place was very slow)  Upon arrival they told us they will only to tastings inside? What? In the era of COVID? As for the dog, they said one of us could do a tasting.   Between the lack of customer service, unfriendly attitude, and most importantly lack of outdoor tastings we will never bother to come back. WAY too many options with just as beautiful of grounds, equally great wines, safe tasting environment, and more importantly good customer service."

                "description": "A great winery!  This is a beautiful winery and a great stop if you plan on visiting the other winery nearby or salt lick BBQ. Everyone is exceptionally helpful, they have a very comfortable tasting room, but I felt the tasting was way overpriced, so I decided to just buy a bottle of the Fall Creek Vineyards Tempranillo to drink while the rest of the group had their tasting.   They have an impressive operation and make some wonderful wines, definitely worth the stop. Cheers!"

Got to get one of the bottles for a present and an edged glass to keep.  I plan to visit Texas in a near future and this is one place that I plan to come back again. Wine first and bbq later.  Of all of the wines Mourvedre was our favorite."

                "description": "If you're looking to have a nice day trip from Austin, Fall Creek is a great spot.  I love coming out here for a wine tasting and enjoying the outside patio and having the vineyard to explore. The landscape is gorgeous and the staff are so knowledgeable and friendly.  Most importantly, the wine is delicious.    Pro tip- for an additional $8 you can add on an extra tasting of the ExTerra Tempranillo (usually a $100 bottle). It's amazing and a must try."

                "description": "The wine was amazing!!! Needless to say, we will be returning on our next trip to Austin. We are huge Cabernet fans and all of the wines were delicious. We took a few bottles home. When we tried the Tempranillo and it swept us off our feet. We have since found some of these wines in our local Houston Spec's.   The facility is clean and the grounds are well kept. The restrooms are also clean!!! Our host was simply amazing and went above and beyond to explain the process and enjoyed the discussion describing the notes we would/did experience. Really enjoyed the entire experience."

                "description": "TLDR: relaxing atmosphere with nice white wines. Good on the spectrum of Texas wines but not on the level of French or Napa wines.  This is a great spot right across the street from salt lick. Parking lot is gravel but there's plenty of parking available. Hostess was extremely friendly and great conversation.  The wines themselves are good- we especially loved the Chardonnay and reserve wines. Based on Texas wineries, I have to say this is hands down one of the better vineyards. That being said, I have a deep love for Russian river valley wines (especially green valley pinots and Chardonnay's) and Texas grapes just don't measure up. Is that an unfair comparison? Probably.  Overall highly recommend visiting and supporting local. You'll want this on your wine tasting list of stops for sure, and best of all it's fairly close to Austin."

                "description": "Fall Creek Vineyards totally exceeded our expectations! We have been super strict about staying home during COVID-19, but my #1 birthday wish was to get out ... in a safe way. With young children. My husband called Fall Creek ahead of time and was told that kids were allowed and that there was plenty of outdoor space.   We arrived around 2pm on a Wednesday afternoon and were greeted by a super friendly and knowledgeable gentleman. I wish I had grabbed his name, because he was seriously amazing. He let us know that a food purchase was required to be served on premise, which was not a problem at all because everything looked delicious (we chose a cheese platter), and gave us a wine menu as well.   We selected our own seats and were able to stay away from the party that came in after us. Our sommelier was so knowledgeable and provided everything in a COVID-19 safe way. He was also super sweet to our kids, even though our three year old was crushing crackers on the table (we cleaned up after him before we left but it was still so embarrassing).   All of the wines were delicious. We ended up leaving with their Tempranillo, their Sauvignon-blanc (vintners-selection) and two souvenir glasses.   We spent about an hour at Fall Creek, which ended up being the total highlight of my birthday, but could have spent more time there exploring their beautiful grounds  had we not had a dinner reservation."

                "description": "Texas has great wines.  A short drive from Austin (right across from Salt Lick) you can spend a few hours in the vineyard, sit in the patio, or stay inside. Of course, there is wine tasting and a variety of bottles for sale.  Fall Creek makes wines in all price points. From the quite good inexpensive wines to award-winning bottles for people who really know their reds. I am a fan of their Tempranillo.  If you are in Austin, it's worth a visit!"

                "description": "TL;DR: Couldn't recommend this more for a safe way to spend the day with your friends during (and even not during!) Covid.  My mom's in town so I wanted to take her to a winery semi-close to Austin but not too far away. ENTER: Fall Creek. It's been recommended to me by several friends so figured I'd check it out for myself:  PROS: Seriously the nicest staff in the world. Thank you Daniel! Plenty of socially distanced tables and chairs in LOTS of different areas of the winery A bottle of their amazing Sauvignon Blanc - $22! Great snacks to accompany (I got Pimento cheese) They had live music on a Saturday with a full band. swoon! Across the street from Salt Lick if you want foods  CONS: Seriously none. Couldn't have asked for a more perfect day. Can't wait to visit again!   Pro tip: go to Desert Door nearby for more fun. :)"

                "description": "FCV at Driftwood is a nice little winery, with seating indoors and out. When we were visiting, there was only one other guest present (midday Tuesday). As a personal recommendation, if you're trying to social distance, I would suggest visiting here only during the weekdays when it's less busy, otherwise it may seem too crowded since the place is on the smaller side.  The food menu mainly consists of cheese and snacks that go well with wine but it's a little overpriced. The staff was nice but they were just there for the most part, nothing more to enhance our experience.   3/5 staff/service 4/5 nicely decorated interior and exterior 5/5 with the right company"

                "description": "Good stop on your wine tour! We opted for two full glasses of their most standout wines and although it was much more expensive wine than I'm used to, we did get a generous pour. The backyard terrace is peaceful and has many seating options. I would've loved to see an option where you could do a wine tasting outdoors, perhaps the same way you order a beer flight. I saw this because wine tastings are only offered inside."

Our 2nd stop was Falls Creek....it was so pretty with perfect sunny weather and enough seating inside and out. Covid is still among us so they offer hand santizers but you bring your own mask. Most patrons didn't have on of course once they had their wine in hand.   We opted to sit outdoors. Tables are 3-4 ft apart in some spots so choose within your comfort zone for social distancing. We grabbed a quick glass of wine and made our way to the next stop.   Looking forward to returning with the hubby this summer."

We requested the tasting - 5 wines that are pre-selected, you aren't able to choose.  After the second (extremely small) pour, we had to request water.  Decided to order a couple of apps for the group..we were brought store made hummus and pimento cheese - still in the plastic container, propped on a plate with a wrapped package of crackers.  Had to request small plates, which seemed to surprise our server.  By the end of the tasting we were all sweating as the sun was beating down on us and there seemed to be no AC. The wines were okay, but the experience and service could have been much better.  I wouldn't return."

                "description": "I've had my fair share of vineyards from local like Grape Creek in Fredericksburg then to Castello di Amorosa in Napa Valley. I was embarrassed after taking my family to experience the wine tasting here. Although, some of the wine were fairly tasty, but the serving was small compared to the vineyards I mentioned in the beginning. I had never been to a wine tasting with a pour stopper that was new to me. Mind you they charge $20 per person for wine tasting. We were observing a table near us that was getting extra pour from the pour stopper technique. We decided to order 2 cheese plates ($25/plate) that came in this container after we finished it, which was a small portion by the way. We noticed that the container said \"Best By: 2/12\" we visited 2/13. So we alerted our server she politely checked with the back she was told that it meant Arrived By, which to me was odd. If it was \"Arrived By\" I think that's what they would've put on the container but I guess just to shut us up.  As to COVID capacity the patio was full we couldn't wait to leave. This is my family and I's experience I wish it could've been better."

It turned out to be the best decision; there was a huge event (and beautiful weather) so the heart of Wimberley was PACKED. This place is a bit outside of the main part of town and had plenty of parking, and the best part was it was not crowded. :) They've got minimal seating inside, but plenty of outdoor seating. They also have a nice selection of both beer and wine, plus some yummy snacks (like edamame and hummus!). My friend and I both opted for the wine flight: 4 tasters of wine ranging from red to white to bubbly, all great, and the staff was attentive and ready with the next pour in order to keep the cold ones cold. We had a lovely experience. I definitely recommend if you're near the area!"

This little house is full of rooms and nooks that give it a very intimate feel where you and your friends and family can congregate and feel at home. The bar is loaded full of wines and the staff here isn't shy in regards to providing you with samples and information on each of them.  I don't know very much about wine, but was able to follow along and still get an enjoyable experience out of what they had to offer here. We came on a Sunday afternoon so you know I had to try the mimosa out. Crisp, clean, and refreshing!  Be prepared to shell out some $$ as this place isn't the cheapest option, but you do get a high quality and a large amount of variety which is hard to find in Texas.  Support this local business and lets keep their doors open! Spots like this are hard to come by."

The host is very smart about the wines they sell here and enjoyed the smooth wines tastings I received. It located downtown Wimberly so you can't miss it. I certainly will visit again soon.

                "description": "What a great little spot! Small quaint tasting room with a bit of wine related retail.   Right near the square and very close to Wimberley Cafe. Very reasonable tasting price at$7 for 6 wines. You can order the dry red flight, the white flight or the sweet flight. Most all the wines from the Escondido Valley in west Texas. This is were most of the grapes are grown in Texas anyway although not widely publicized. Lost Draw Cellars and William-Chris are two of our favorites. Really enjoyed both the red and white flights. The sweet flight is VERY sweet and all about fruit. One exception is the Choco-wine. Sounds really awful- chocolate wine!? I am NOT a sweet eater and don't really like chocolate but this is a perfect combination similar to non-dairy Baileys.   So enjoyed the owner-host that helped navigate the wine. Super personable and great to talk to. We'll return here again!"

                "description": "This little shop offers tastings from various Texas and other wineries, organized by a preset menu of either whites, dry reds, or sweet wines. You pay $7 for an etched glass promoting Wimberley as a Little Taste of Heaven (well, why not?), and that includes the tasting of all the wines from the menu of your choice.  There's room for about 6 or 7 people at a time to belly up to the antique bar (standing room only), and the sommelier/host pours for each group separately, explaining each wine and its history as he/she goes.   The afternoon my friend and I were there, we both tried the dry reds, and our host was knowledgeable and entertaining. There was not a bad wine in the bunch, although we each had our separate favorites. A lot of these wines are served by the glass or bottle in the local and regional restaurants, and you can buy them here more reasonably (about $22-36/bottle for the reds we tried) without having to visit each winery. They also have an entire wall of wine-related gift items and cute bar accouterments.  Definitely a place to put on your list to stop by during an afternoon of shopping in Wimberley. Be aware that like most of the shops, they close up for the day at 5PM."

We wanted to order two bottles of wine for our Aunt and Uncle to help them celebrate their 55th wedding anniversary but we live in Tucson. We had stopped in the store during our last visit and found the shoppe to be welcoming and the owners charming. We told Jill want types of wine our relatives like. She suggested two wines, included a note from us, and facilitated the delivery. Our ralatives were very pleasantly surprised and they said the wines were delicious. We highly recommend this store!

                "description": "The old bar is beautiful and from an old Willie Nelson movie, \"Red Headed Stranger.\" Their \"dry\" red wines were not dry. They were all very fruit forward compared to the traditional tasting notes of the types they are serving. It's a cheap tasting at $7, and comes with a glass that is etched with \"taste of heaven\" and Wimberley on it.  Now, it's more of a shop, than a winery. So, don't expect to have a few glasses, sit down, or to use a restroom. The girl that was waiting on us was very young and knew very little about wine, and seemed to care very little. That's not the best wine experience! If I came back, it would be to show my boyfriend the bar. Overall, the wine was mediocre! So, it's kind of a one time thing!"

You can only choose from reds, whites or sweets. The tasting comes with a free glass. It's a cute souvenir. The lady serving us that day was very knowledgeable and even gave us a history of each wine and winery with each pour. The tasting room is small and can get crowded. There's no sitting, but it's not a bother. They do sell some cute wine associated items. I ended up leaving with wine and extras. I can see myself going back when in Wimberley."

                "description": "I was not impressed at all by the wine tasting here. I would recommend this place for the wine merchandise over the wine tasting/ wines. (I purchased a candle). It is a very small place with a bar that has no seating. They hand you a menu with with 3 lists of wine (Red, White andSweet) and tell you to pick one and they go down the list and give you a sample of each one off the list you chose. There was only 1 gentleman working at the time we myself and 2 friends went and he was too busy to even acknowledge us. We waited while he finished up with other customers then started the tasting. The man told us what we were drinking, which we read from the list, but other than that, seemed to have no other wine knowledge. A few times he told us about the wine maker who was featured in a magazine, or gave us facts about the prizes a wine had won, but no true wine knowledge about what we were drinking. I had to even ask for water to rinse my glass between tastings. He was just pouring wine after wine in my friends' glasses, even a white after a red! This was the strangest wine tasting I have ever done and to be honest, not something I would ever pay for. We had a gift certificate for a free tasting.   Bottom line, if you know anything about wine, I don't recommend it. If not, and you're just looking for a casual experience with a little wine involved, go for it."

However, when the owner is there, she is rude, condescending, and cheap.  Pours a few drops in a tiny cup.  I won't buy anything from her. ...and if she continues with that poor service, I won't ever go back.    So, let's see???  Act friendly and let people actually taste the wine...you get business.

                "description": "We regularly go wine tasting here.  They only stock wines from Texas wineries that make batches too small to distribute to stores, plus one red and one white wine from Italy for the Italian restaurant goers across the street.  It's like visiting half a dozen wineries in one stop.  The wine lists change minimally throughout the year, though, and sometimes they can't get a particular winery's top products (ex. Sistercreek won't sell them their best blends).  Wine tasting is $7 per wine list (red, white or sweet), and each list includes ~8 wines.  Purchase 3 bottles and the tasting is free.  Purchase 6 bottles and 1 tasting is free + 10% off.  My husband and I usually taste both the red and white lists and walk away with 3-4 bottles of wine.  Each bottle is only a few dollars more than if bought at the wineries.  If you want to taste more than 1-2 types of wine, please be respectful and purchase a wine tasting.  They get a lot of foot traffic and can't give all their wine away."

                "description": "Stopped by, last night.  The woman I was with asked for a sample of the Christmas Wine and was given a plastic goblet that held about an ounce, or more, of wine.  She ended up buying a bottle.  I asked about the blueberry wine and was asked if I'd like a sample.  I was given an ultra-mini, paper souffle cup to drink from.  I then asked for a sample of the mead.  Again, I got a mini-cup and, inexplicably, an extremely rude, \"That's the last sample I can give you\" from the owner.  Keep in mind that my friend got a sample, in a plastic goblet, that was five times the amount I received in the paper mini-cup.  She also bought a friggin' bottle of wine.  There was no excuse, ZERO, for the owner's rude way of treating me.  As I sipped the mead, groups of women came in and the owner was all over herself to serve them and strike up animated conversation.  I was amazed and angry.  Maybe there's more, here, than meets the eye, but that's not the point.  I should have been treated as well as the women customers.  I certainly wasn't.  I will never go back to this place.  You can count on that.  The reason I gave the two stars:  The owner was extremely knowledgeable about wines.  She did give me good information about sulfite content of the sweeter wines, comparing sulfite addition in wine to oatmeal addition in meatloaf.  Mitigating factor?: She did tell my friend that her store had been flooded by a broken refrigerator while she was visiting her husband in another state.  She struggled to reopen her store once she got back to town, just a day ago. Even so, her rude behavior cannot be excused.  FWIW, my friend told me that if this woman had responded to me, in the manner she did, before she, my friend, had purchased the bottle of Christmas Wine, she would not have completed the purchase."

They had the adjoining BBQ place and we were hungry so figured to start here then hit some of the other vineyards.   The place was designed to take in a lot of people.  it was full of folks at 1PM on Friday.  There was maybe 150 cars in a lot that could hold 10 times that. The grounds were nice, with lots of shady trees and people having a good time.  I think it was more of a good time from the BBQ and beer maybe as the wine was nothing to cheer about. we walked and asked for a tasting from the little window that was the winery.  We got an eye roll and were told no.  So we each got a glass of wine, not wanting to waste the stop.   Both glasses were not good.   Not to sound like a boozer but I can finish most any glass, but we had to pour both out sadly.  it threw off our mojo enough that we didn't even get a different glass or BBQ.  The good news was there were plenty more options down the road!"

The first time I was there I remembered picnic tables so we took a chance. There was already a line when we arrived at 11:30 am.  All of the outdoor tables were wet and no one was  eating outside. People were just standing around the picnic tables waiting to be called inside.  I asked the hostess if we could sit outside since we had the pup. She said due to the rain they didn't have any servers working the outdoor tabled so she recommended that we order to go and were welcome to use the picnic tables.  We had our waterproof picnic blanket with us so that was perfect.  Also, the picnic area was BYOB so my husband had a beer from our cooler before we got our meal.   We had the ribs and burnt ends plate with sweet tea.  The plate came with potato salad, coleslaw and baked beans.  The coleslaw hang a tangy taste as did the bbq sauce. We both really enjoyed our meal and will be back next time we're in the area."

                "description": "This place clearly has a cult following.   Not worth the wait or money.   The BBQ sauce is pretty amazing.   Sunday 12pm was a 90 minute wait for two people. We opted for a to go order. Took about 30 minutes. We ordered the brisket and ribs meal for $27. You would have thought the meat was top notch expensive stuff with how little they gave us. And to think, for $3 more (and 60 minutes more of a wait) we could have gotten all you can eat.  Thank God for the delicious BBQ sauce I poured all over the meat as well as the sides. If it wasn't for the sauce I would have thought I had Corona virus because this stuff had no taste.   I see reviews saying they only accept cash. We paid with a credit card. There was a minimum payment for alcohol though. I think it was $18."

It's BYOB or you can get wine or beer (I recommend lone star) in the cellar that's right next to the BBQ."

There are little items for sale like candles and honey.  I tasted a few where one was too tangy for me but did pick up a bottle of Salt Lick Cellars BBQ White.    Outside will find tables under huge oak trees and games to play like bocce ball. This place is designated as over 21. Besides wine they sell buckets of beer bottles to enjoy."

We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves (even had a good laugh at the tipsy women imbibing). Wish we could have ordered wine at the restaurant though. I knew we wouldn't be able to finish a full bottle and still drive back to Austin so the wine stayed stoppered. My husband was able to enjoy a couple of his beers, so a win for him."

It's a nice drive out of Austin, getting a little taste of Texas hill country. Ideally I'd go to a swimming hole near by, then stop at salt lick for a great meal to finish the day.  Everything is delicious and it's an awesome atmosphere. Plenty of outdoor seating which makes it an even better experience."

                "description": "The Salt Lick Cellars was a nice little bonus to our trip to The Salt Lick bbq. With a little bit of a wait ahead of us, we decided to walk over to the cellar for some beers. You walk down the sidewalk along side of the actual Salt Lick restaurant and drool as you see the other patrons inside eating their bbq.   As you enter the cellar you are faced with various wines wall to wall hut on the far left, their selection of beers. We looked over their beer selection and picked up 3 buckets of various beers including lone star and shinerbock. After grabbing our buckets, we enjoyed some on their benches outside. From there you can enjoy looking at their vineyard or play some bocce ball. Or you can walk back with your drinks back to the wait area to be seating.   Perfect side stop if you're looking for an adult beverage while you wait if you forgot to BYOB"

Well, it was a girls weekend, we were soaked to the bone and freezing, unhappy/snippy tenders, and we were jammed in a tiny wine tasting room stuffed with other people trying to avoid the rain.  The fellow customers were likely just as unhappy as we were, but there was wine!  One note though - everyone else was just standing there, we were the only ones that were paying customers and we STILL got attitude.    Our least favorite tasting we did all weekend, but wines were good (not great).  Need to try again one day when there is great weather!"

There are 2 main buildings but the wait for a table was over an hour. Sat outside, food came out super quick. Even got to go in the back and check out where they smoke all the bbq. Authentic as it comes. Texas bbq. This places is BYOB there were even college kids with handles of liquor on their tables as if it was almost a daily event or something to do on the weekend. Atmosphere is cool and kid friendly but you can also have a great time in the winery. Definitely a must if you visit austin, it will not disappoint my meal was about $33 and this place is cash only. The ATM wasn't working so this was somewhat of an issue but we got it handled. Awesome bbq"

I mean what else do you do after a 6 mile walk  through the parks but stop for wine!   We got good service inside, both the woman that helped us and the younger guy behind the bar were very friendly and helpful .   We both did a wine tasting (I did the whites) and hubs did the reds. 5 tastings for 12$ which I thought was pretty reasonable. The Chardonnay they had was pretty good along with another I can't pronounce . Hubs enjoyed a couple of the reds as well.  Both left with a cup of white sangria while waiting for our food next door. It was a perfect day to enjoy it on the patio as well.   Would we take an Uber out from Austin just to go here, meh probably not. However, if you're in the area it's a great spot with friendly service. When we're back in the area with friends we'd go back."

                "description": "Honestly so disappointed by the service and quality. We waited for a long time to get our six pack, then when we started drinking it, we noticed that the beer had a best by date of December 18th which was a week and a half ago. When I brought this to the bartender's attention, she said that she could only give us new beers if they hadn't been opened. She also said that the best by date didn't mean anything and brushed off my concerns. This is a quality issue. No restaurant or store should be charging full price or even selling goods past their best by date. I find this extremely upsetting as I've spent money on beer that should have been sold a week and a half ago. Also, we opened the beers but stopped drinking immediately after noticing the date on all the bottles. I don't think a cellar should be able to sell beer or wine past the best by date, and I'm sure no one wants to buy it either. Word of advice, check the date on the bottles before opening. Or better yet, don't bother waiting in the lines and spend your money elsewhere."

                "description": "My wife and I went to Bella Vista Ranch for a 4th of July tour with lunch, and we found it to be terrific value for the money. There was a nice lunch from a food truck (the name of which eludes me, unfortunately) followed by an interesting talk about the history of olive oil and the origins of the Italian family farm dating back to the second century BCE. The owner explained how he established Bella Vista on the ancient Roman model and described the modifications he has made to make olives grow in Texas. Then we toured the olive orchard and learned about the different varieties of grapes grown on the property. We saw the processing room containing the \"frantoio\" or olive press as well as the vats where this year's wines are aging. We then tasted several oils as well as four glasses of wine per person. All this for $25 (the regular tour without lunch is only $15).  Oils, vinegars, wines and soaps are available for sale. These are pretty expensive (e.g. $18+ for 250ml of their basic Texas Blend oil), but I don't mind paying those prices for high-quality locally produced specialty goods. This is a fascinating day out, which I recommend wholeheartedly.  Pro tip: If you're coming from San Antonio, take I-35 instead of US 281 and the back roads. We were expecting a relaxing drive in the country, but construction and traffic made it a stressful trip. Coming back on 35 was a joy by comparison!"

                "description": "So, so rude. The olive oil and vinegar are excellent, but the experience was ruined by the lady--the one everyone complains of here. The hours on Sunday are until 4. I get there at 3:25, and she walks past me with her whiny, demanding voice telling me that they close at 3:30. Uh, wanna put that on your website as your updated hours?  I went in anyway. The gentleman doing the oil tasting was knowledgeable and helpful. He told the lady to close the gate.  You know, what a non-stupid person would do should they slothfully decide to close early since they dont work for a living.  My mother was incredibly upset by this lady's rudeness. When you run a service like this, you stay open until you no longer have a good flow of customers. Closing is at 4? Hi, if a bunch of people are coming in at 3:30 thru 4:00, you keep working. Lazy Texas people who inherited their property and think they work hard by paying others to harvest their crop and bottle it. Meritocracy, right? They are the class of people who make this state an impoverished mess.    Don't run a customer service business dependent upon people stopping by on a lark like a fascist regime. You don't get to do that. Then again, when you dont have a legitimate concern about how you pay your bills, i guess you can just work until you get bored with the whole work thing.   Go sell wholesale if you hate customers. Working for yourself does not mean you get any more freedom. You have are dependent on good will. And you don't have mine.  The lady tried to make up for her garbage attitude when i made my purchase. You know what? Have a blessed day, lady. A.BLESSED.DAY.  Tl;dr. There are other puveyors of Texas olive oil, particularly in south Texas. Do not waste your wine tasting trip here. If you want to support local, consider others who are hard-working enough to sell their products in Central Market."

                "description": "We took the tour here three years ago and had a decent experience. Customer service was nothing special but not bad. The olive oil was excellent. Went back last weekend just to buy a few bottles and there was a group tasting inside. The lady who met us was terse and short with us, and the oil lacked the punch we're accustomed to from fresh oil. It was ironic to listen to the speaker discussing the peppery flavor of the oil when it was completely absent this year. Maybe it's an off year. But one thing was the same: it's not a welcoming place at all. They seem to be put out by visitors. They really don't seem to want kids there at all, even when they are standing still and quietly listening.   We've had far better experiences, and far better olive oil, in Dripping Springs at Texas Hill Country Olive Oil. Night and day difference."

The tour and history of olives was really interesting. Definitely try the balsamic and infused oils. The wine tasting was pretty brief compared to the olive portion but great none the less. The wines are dryer, not sweet. I thought they were great. A lot of the other local wineries wines are very sweet, but I really enjoyed these! You should absolutely plan to visit if in the area."

He seems rather joyless in making something that could ideally fulfill the soul.  His 1 1/2 hour (yes, it's long) \"tour\" is mostly comprised of the history of the Olive, snarky political opinions, braggary of his past career in Silicone Valley, and a hatred for Texas AandM.   Not a place to take a kid. Seriously.  We sat and listened to him for well over an hour then briefly stood under two olive trees, looked at another one that was hurt in a storm, looked at the press machinery, and then did a \"tasting.\" Like I said, the oil was good. I got the impression that the lady helping in the gift shop/tasting room didn't want to be there either. Basically I was confused why this man (and his 5th wife...no lie) were running this business and opening it to the public.  I walked away a little sad that something so wonderful like successfully growing beautiful trees to make a solid product could be reduced to something so joyless."

                "description": "We were warned at great length that we could not even look at our cell phones during the tour which seemed odd when people might have a kid or babysitter or be waiting on something important from work to come through--I mean we are all adults...but I soon found out why.  Far less than an entertaining traditional tour, you sit and listen to someone talk more like a college class lecture, but with way too many rabbit trails of information that eventually make you tune out.  Like what a certain blizzard is called in different parts of the world, how accounting dates back to the Romans, etc.  I am passionate about olive oils and wine but learned too much about history and every other subject to even focus on what I wanted to know about olive oil. Or feel entertained.  The group I was with concurred.   There are 3 types of learners: auditory, visual, and tactile and the class is entirely sit and listen to one man talk for half of it then stand and listen by a tree then a press for the other half. So only appealing to auditory learners. And no audience engagement during the lecture.  At the end you actually get to see and touch. But they had no bread for us so we had to drink an olive oil and talk about it for 30 more minutes so I left before I tasted the other flavored oils as it had already been a full day of just listening to way too much info to retain.  In a very strict manner rather than entertaining with audience engagement.  And strict rules.  Obviously people tune out and begin looking at their cell phones so that's why they don't allow them.  Rather than making the tour entertaining so you dont' want to--It was in the hot sun as well so it was pretty miserable.  The olive oil was good but I've had better, it was a bit weak to me, we did the wine tasting as well and those were not acceptable to me.  I actually would recommend skipping the tour and talking to the staff as you taste the olive oil because they knew all of the information given on the tour without the lengthy side notes of things that should be shaved off for entertainment value.  And that's really the best part.    I don't think they like people very much though to be honest."

                "description": "I will never recommend this place to ANYONE! The main older lady was very rude to my parents, as well as the other couple in front of us. I regret not reading the reviews before coming here because everyone is saying the same thing. We did a wine tasting (which was $10) and were barely served anything. My husband and I both left this place wondering how they are still in business. The wine was super expensive (not good at all), and they have horrible customer service. Listen to these reviews, people!"

                "description": "I can't believe only 5 people have reviewed this ranch. I have been back four times now and each time come away with a little more understanding of the narrative that is offered. While I purchased my typical bottles of olive oil - some for myself, some for holiday gifts - I did also indulge in some olive oil based soaps.   The olives and oil are fabulous. I am not as great a fan of their wines. They are not awful, just not with the properties I care for, typically. The in-laws found a favorite to take home, though.  The tour is still $10 and includes the wine tasting, which is a good deal.  Bottles of oil range from $16-$27 each, depending on size.  Soap is $6.99 a bar.  They also feature balsamic vinegars (not made there) and jars of olives, which are delightful as well."

                "description": "Do not judge a book by its cover. Take one look at Jack and the humble grounds here at Bella Vista, and you'd never guess that he has olive friends he emails with back in Italy or that he can tell you all you'd ever want to know about the science and technique behind growing and processing olives.  I would highly recommend the tour - while there isn't much walking involved in this tour, my husband and I found it to be highly informative. And with Jack's red-blooded Texan sense of humor, it was a very entertaining education. Be sure to note the times of the tour (Sat @ 10am and 1pm, and Sun @ noon) since it's a group setup.   After the tour comes a tasting of several types of olive oil produced on site along with some of their balsamic vinegar offerings. While they also have wine offered, I'd recommend sticking with the olive oil - clearly what they specialize in. If you're only interested in tasting the oils/wines (not the tour), it's probably good to avoid arriving at the tasting room about an hour after each tour start since the tasting room isn't overly large and tends to fill up easily with the folks coming off the tour."

                "description": "Super disappointed in the customer service.  Both the lady and the gentleman that run the place were very rude and short with us.  Their products are not made by them in Wimberley and when asked about that they became extremely defensive.  Beautiful place that has a lot of potential if they were friendly and cared about the experience people want from that kind of place... but the vibe is anything but friendly and welcoming.   When they started to bash a particular presidential candidate it killed it for us. Keep your opinions out of your business. Don't bother would be my recommendation."

                "description": "A hidden mecca of olives.  In central Texas.  The Bella Vista Ranch was designed as a traditional Italian family farm and features the first commercially grown olives in Texas.  And the olives I sampled are Texas size and Texas good.  Apparently the crowd favorite is the bleu cheese stuffed olive.  We sampled a garlic stuffed olive that was really good.  The ranch also offers delicious balsamic vinegars and olive oils which go for around $17 a bottle.  My lips slurped the Fig Vanilla Balsamic over and over again.  I am sure I was sample cheating but that stuff is incredible.     This is also a working winery that produces several red and white varieties plus a Natural Blackberry Wine!  Yum.  Wine tastings are $5/per person.  I think the owner has a great thing going for him and a beauty of a property. Tours of the orchard happen on the weekend and include a wine tasting for $10/per person."

                "description": "While I thought it was pretty interesting to learn about and taste boutique olive oil (as I'd never been to an olive ranch before) $15 per person does seem a little high when the actual tour is quite short and obviously the intention is that you're going to buy some stuff at the end, and all that stuff is small batch and quite pricey (understandably so.)  So it ends up  being more like $100 for two people when you include the olive oil you will want to buy plus the wine you might want to buy (some people seem to think it sucks, we liked some of it.)  But you will leave with a buzz on and some delicious olive oils!  The owners were away so their daughter gave the tour; I thought she was pretty funny and personable but there were some questions she couldn't answer but it was really no big deal (and she wasn't super long winded like the owner seems to be  but of course some people like that and some people don't.) It's also probably better when there are olives on the trees but it was still overall pretty interesting to see the different trees different olives grow up and hear some history and facts about olive oil production.  I liked hearing about the process and seeing the machinery. And of course I liked tasting the fresh olive oil, which was indeed super tasty and surprisingly spicy. Most of their oils are made from all different olives smushed together but they have one variety that's just made with one kind of olive which we got to try. They also had a blood orange infused oil that I'm now obsessed with; we bought some and later made some asparagus on the grill that had been rubbed with the oil, it was the most delicious asparagus ever! We also enjoyed the wine; we are not wine snobs in any way but we enjoyed what we had and bought a bottle just  because it's the polite thing to do. We sat out on the bench in front of the tasting room and enjoyed our wines and just had a lovely afternoon.   I will say that it gets a little hectic in the tasting room when people come in just for a tasting after a tour- I would say if you want just a tasting, don't come between 1:30-2:30 because it's going to get confusing!"

                "description": "The couple who own this place are fantastic characters. The wife is sweet and talkative. She was delighted to hear that we moved out here from San Francisco (that's where she grew up but couldn't  stand the fog). The husband is an old curmudgeon, but delightfully so. He worked in high-tech in Silicon Valley and moved out his last company to Austin in the early 90s, eventually leaving to grow olives and make wine.   it's not always the case that you visit a winery and the owners pour for you, so that was a treat. They are a very small production and a bit off the beaten path, so it was pretty quiet there too. A small group arrived just as we were leaving, but it was nothing like the bustling tasting rooms at nearby Driftwood Cellars.  The blackberry wine is actually good--you wouldn't necessarily guess that it's made of blackberry not grapes. And the other three reds we tasted were also nice."

The inside tasting room is a tad bit shabby and small. We went outside on the deck and they have lovely views but only one side is shaded, the other side has a retractable awning but they did not open it so it was roasting hot.   While there we tried their Cabernet Sauvignon and unfortunately it was not memorable. I was going to give this winery a two-star but the views and the staff are sweet, so I bumped it up a star."

Thanks to the people at Canyon Gorge we discovered this hidden gem in the Hill Country!   The proprietors do everything from crushing and pressing to making their own labels and they consider their wine \"holistic\". They produce only dry wines with no preservatives or additives and is sulfite free.   Patty gave my friend and I and our dogs a tour and tasting on a Sunday when we stumbled upon the vineyard. But, the official tasting hours are Noon - 7PM on Saturday and by appointment.   If you like a dry Merlot I recommend Fawncrest."

                "description": "As the BF and I found ourselves taking care of business in Canyon Lake, I thought it would be awesome to check out a local Texas Hill Country winery. Seeing that there were only 2 in this town, we went for the one that was closer to where we were. GPS landed us in a neighborhood of houses which confused us as we were used to visiting wineries with long pebble stone roads filled with vineyards and an entrance sign. Don't expect that here as the tasting room is truly located in the owner's house! We were definitely thrown off and nervous to approach a house with two dogs in the back yard fence for fear of being shot for trespassing, but luckily, there is a small sign on the front of the house providing directions to walk around to the back and enter in the sliding glass doors. We ended up in the small cozy tasting room which is an extension of the owner's house and were welcomed with open friendly arms. The McNeil's are the sweet couple that owns the small vineyard. One side of the house has a sit and sip porch that has a view out onto the lake and the 4 rows of grapes. The tasting room is air conditioned with a TV that we found ourselves watching football with the owners and playing with their big puppy. The free wine tasting was the icing as we got to try all of their wines and have a second sample of our favorite. They make a delicious Chardonnay which is aged with both French and American oak chips. They also have a Cab Sav, a Cab Franc, a Merlot, and a red blend of 3 grapes called The Meritage. We loved the relaxed charming atmosphere and the selections of wines this vineyard had to offer. BTW, there is an outside tasting bar that they have to host larger groups which is nicely covered to block the hot sun in case you're wondering. We left this little charming simple vineyard with a large smile, 3 bottles in hand, and another fond memory to add to the book."

We couldn't check in on time because they were short staffed even tho they told us we could the day before. One of our screens was falling off. We have extra pillows in closet but no extra pillows.  I swear our place was never actually cleaned between the people before us and us.   Serenity you looked so cute and wrap wanted to book our wedding there but you were just too dirty.  Hot tub had so many chemicals it took off my spray tan in less than 5 minutes. You couldn't sit in tub because you couldn't breathe with all the chemicals."

Next, the phone number listed is to an answering machine in which you have to leave a message and hope they call back.   Upon making the reservation I was assured everything was going to be great with my room and the special lovers cruise package I paid for.  On our way to the resort I called to inform them we were on the way and to ensure everything was good with our room.  I was assured by the staff that everything was in order with my room and the lovers cruise package.    Upon arrival we went to our room and not only was the lovers cruise package I paid extra for not set up but there was also animal feces on one of the rugs!  This naturally upset us to a large degree.  Here we are not two minutes into our stay and we have two major screw ups.   The next day I informed the staff that my wife and I would be gone for a certain time (I was specific about from when to when).  During the time when we were away I requested that they refresh/clean our room.  I was again assured it would be done with no problems.  Upon our return, of course, the room had not been touched.  When I went to the staff and complained they stated that they again were sorry for the failure and would rectify it quickly....  We had just a little time before our wine tour and needed back in our room to get ready.  So I politely went into the room and asked the maid how much longer she would need to finish our room.  The maid gave me attitude and disrespectfully said another five minutes.  Even after this insult I again was polite to the maid and thanked her for her efforts, she in turn ignored me.   This was a disaster of a three year anniversary celebration for me and my wife. I would give zero stars if I could.  For the amount of money I spent there, I expected far better customer service and professionalism.  I would certainly not recommend this place to anyone."

                "description": "We stayed in the White Buffalo Bungelow with hot tub. 6/28-6-30/19. Communication was difficult. They had to send 3 different sets of pictures to get them correct. We arrived at 10pm and there was no light on the 75 yard flagstone walk to our cabin. The place was nice but the exterior deck with hot tub had over grown weeds all near the outdoor seating and bugs were crawling everywhere. The next day Saturday, I asked if they could cut the weeds back, they said no. Can you imagine?!? We paid $67.00 for a $20 brunch voucher on Sunday which was a joke. Place needs updating and needs to be more accommodated to people arriving at night. Refused to negotiate a partial refund. So bad service gets bad reviews. No excuse. Poor management and ownership. They said my expectations were too high????!!! Make sure everything is right because it won't get fixed the next day. Avoid this place"

                "description": "We scrolled thru Facebook and Instagram pictures the days leading up to our stay, when we arrived, we immediately agreed that pictures did not do the Serenity Farmhouse Inn justice at all! The staff is friendly and very helpful. The layout of the grounds is perfect - everything is nearby but still far enough away so it's quiet outside. We stayed in the Farmers Market, and it was absolutely adorable, cozy and comfortable. Each morning a delicious breakfast was delivered to our door, and when we were done all we had to do was put the tray outside and the staff discreetly came out to pick it up. The sunset views were spectacular, and watching the deer walk around during the evenings was the perfect way to end our day. We cannot wait to visit again!"

I would have given it a Ten but the property is about 8 miles outside of town where all the happenings are. If you love the country and rural areas then this is the place. The cottage was very nice and a huge heart shaped tub for 2 people but no shower. There is a bunch of cats on the premises and my saw a pregnant fox. Hey Welcome to Wimberley Texas."

I was originally told it was okay, the manager called me back and said can't do it because there no one available to clean the rooms in a Sunday. My stay isn't till June 3rd surely there is a way to make an extra day happen in the beginning."

                "description": "We had a wonderful stay at Serenity Farm House Inn! They were so kind and welcoming to us. We stayed in the bungalow named, \"Merci Mimi\". It is an \"upgraded\" one with a hot tub! The property is located off of the busy highways, so it is always peaceful and relaxing out there!   When we arrived we were able to park near the cluster of bungalows and were welcomed with some fresh sangria wine! The hot tub was already up and running for us and they had a few coupons for certain shops/restaurants around the town for us!   As we explored around the grounds, we found they have a pen of a few rescue animals like donkeys, goats, and pigs which was a unique touch. The pool was also located near the houses and was small but had a beautiful view (as seen in pictures).   The houses were very nice and well kept. They had plenty of towels, kitchen supplies (everything you would need to cook), the kitchen appliances were in great shape and worked great! One thing we had some issues with is the ac unit, there was one in the bedroom, which I liked, and one in the living/kitchen area. They were just kind of complicated to use, we sat up late one night, with the handy manual they had laminated for us, trying to get it to keep the fan on while we slept. What I would suggest is having a ceiling fan in the bedroom or at least an easy setting on the ac to turn the fan on. We also were constantly adjusting the ac, it seemed like it would get really hot and then really cold. We also tested out the hot tub, it was really nice, but we couldn't go out there at night because there was hardly any lights out there. I also wish the hot tubs were a little more private, the house's windows next to us looked right down into our hot tub and people using the walk way by our bungalow could see straight into where the hot tub was. I noticed most of the other houses with hot tubs were more \"private\" than ours so it may just be the way the houses are laid out.   They also brought us delicious breakfast every morning complimentary! It was so good and fresh! So much better than any complimentary breakfast at regular hotels!   Overall it was a great stay and we will definitely want to come back in the future!"

We remarked every day on how quiet the place is although there were many other guests staying there at the same time. The drive to the inn is remote but it will be worth your while. Each morning we were greeted with eggs, bacon or sausage and bakery (I requested gluten free and was accommodated easily). We had champagne and chocolates in our room upon arrival. We couldn't have asked for a more perfect place to spend a week just to relax and get out of town."

                "description": "Nice stay, but could be improved.  We stayed 2 nights at the Rocky Creek Retreat in the resort village area, full price and not from a Groupon deal.   The grounds were nice and well maintained with cute decor.  The hot tub was clean and the cover looked brand new.  As we left Monday, I heard them cleaning other hot tubs.  We enjoyed our 2 kitty visitors that hung out and 'talked' to us.  We saw deer, a tarantula, and a fox roaming the property in the evening.  Lots of butterflies and birds, and wasps.  Breakfast was served promptly at 9:30 each morning, and it was divine.  Sunday we had chocolate covered strawberries atop a small bowl of fruit, with champagne and glasses of orange juice, a boiled egg, a cinnamon roll which I believe was made from croissant dough, and bacon.  Monday we had cheddar scrambled eggs, sausage links,  a blueberry lemon pound cake slice, peach jam, biscuits, and orange juice.  I wish it were served earlier, but we were aware of that at the time of booking.  Be forewarned - the roads that lead throughout the bandb are very rough with significant bumps and deep gouges for small cars, so drive slowly.  Another note on the vehicular aspect - you are not able to park directly in front of this particular cottage.  There is an area for you to park, then walk to your cottage. When lugging heavy luggage and in warm weather, it is a bit of a chore.  When we arrived and I mentioned this, the lady who greeted us offered to use her golf cart to tote our bags for us to our cottage, which was very kind.  The bungalows are pretty close together.  We arrived about 10 minutes before check in time, and our bungalow was still in the process of being cleaned, which was expected to take 30-45 minutes.  She offered us complimentary drinks and coupons to various restaurants in town if we would have liked to start there versus waiting, but having all of our things in the vehicle, we chose to wait for it to be cleaned.  It took only 30 minutes, and she prepared a fruit and cheese plate for us since we had to wait.  The very first thing I noticed about the bungalow was that it was very clean, from top to bottom.  The bathroom towels were clean, soft and thick.  Another thing, which I didn't think to ask about, was whether or not they stopped in while we were out to refresh towel supplies.  They didn't, and we used 3 towels on the first night, leaving us with 1 bath towel.  No fault on the bandb's part.  I wasn't going to call late in the evening for 1 bath towel when we'd already brought 4 of our own beach towels.  We had 2 a/c units, one in the kitchen area and one in the bedroom.  They got cold and stayed cold quickly.  The floorplan and furniture set up were odd and not necessarily conducive to what you would use a particular room for.  The TV was was mounted to a wall, that would you could a) watch from one wicker chair or b) watch with your head sideways from the couch.  In the bedroom, there was in fact a queen size bed as stated.  Unfortunately, it was set up sideways in order to make it fit in the bedroom.  Instead of sleeping with our heads against a headboard, we slept with our heads against a wall.  There were not blinds on the back door leading out from the bedroom, just a gauzy curtain.  No shielding from the morning sun.  There was little storage for our things - we had expected a dresser at least.  There was one tiny closet, from which we were able to hang some of our clothes, but it was stuffed with about 5 huge pillows on the raised part where you might set a bag or something.  Ultimately, we dug clothes and things from our bags daily rather than being able to stow them in a dresser.  When we booked, we were told that the grotto like setting of the hot tub was private.  Our 'grotto' was easily viewable from the two neighboring cottages.  Private in my mind means not in plain view - it should be described as personal hot tub, not private.  There needs to be some wasp patrol - we had an active wasp's nest on our back patio, so enjoying the back patio was a no go.  One of the back deck chairs was missing a cushion, and some old fencing like material was just laid against the back deck.  One of the cabinets had a window drape just randomly thrown in.  The shower door was completely off its railings. It has been this way awhile, as the linoleum is starting to pull away from the shower wall due to the long term leaking water.  Also missing were smoke detectors.  There were outlets, but no smoke detectors. There were 5 missing vertical slats from the sliding doors, which 1 or so would be okay, but that was a bit much.  The kitchen window was cracked as well. The lack of storage, odd layout and the lack of maintenance on some things detracted from our stay.  Overall, our stay at Serenity Farmhouse Inn was okay, but we intend to try elsewhere for the amount of money that we paid.  I hope that their maintenance improves as it is obvious that they put a lot into getting the cottage built and decorated."

                "description": "We arrived at 9:30 am in order to be there early for the 10:30 am Wine Tour pickup time.  The staff was so gracious and welcoming.  They informed us that the White Buffalo Bungalow was ready and we would be able to get settled in before leaving for the wine tour.   White Buffalo Bungalow was just breath taking from the private drive to the private jacuzzi.  The room has a full kitchen and had a bottle of welcome sangria to begin the pregaming before the wince tour.  The shower was amazing and the soaps, shampoo/conditioner smelled so good!   This was a Wednesday so we were lucky to be on the wine tour with only one other couple.  Jodi is such a pleasant and inviting soul. She got asked about each person's preferences as to be able to personalize the tour and pick which wineries she decided to take us too.  Jodi is so knowledgeable of the town and the wineries.  The lunch she provides is just amazing.   The pool area is so nice and calming.  Again it was the middle of the week and we had the pool to ourselves which was great.  Breakfast is brought to our room by about 9:45 each morning and was so good. (We were the last delivery.)  I was able to walk around the property 1  1/2 times and get a mile in each morning.   If you are not wanting to leave the property stop by HEB and pick up food to prepare in the room.  This was such a wonderful  experience I am already planning to go back next year."

                "description": "I am absolutely in love with the little Poets Cottage we stayed in last week. I really appreciate all of the attention to detail in the beautiful antique linens, fresh flowers, pillows, seating areas, bath tray etc. I could go on an on. It was a beautiful and relaxing retreat. It was in a wonderful central location for day trips to State Parks, great Texas BBQ, cute little towns and wonderful back roads. The view from the pool is spectacular. Nothing quite like a Hill Country sunset or sunrise either.   We really enjoyed the big Jacuzzi tub. It would have been nice to have a shower for quick mornings, but we made do. When the neighbors used theirs, their jets were so loud we could hear them. We could also hear the man's booming voice at times.   Their breakfast was amazing and presented in such a lovely way. I wish we could have gotten it a little earlier. I think 930 is probably perfect for a leisurely vacation where you sleep in, but we were up and hitting the roads early. We did wait around for it one day and I am so glad we did."

I came across it while searching on Reddit and made the best deduction of having dinner there for my 28th birthday!  Our waitress was the NICEST person I've ever met. Super kind, didn't rush, had great recommendations and allowed my boyfriend to surprise me with two little cakes.   Everything on their menu hits the spot but I got the fettuccine dish and my boyfriend got the penne vodka (which he claims is the best he's ever had). The drive is a bit long from ATX but 100000% worth it.  I will be visiting back when the weather is nicer to also enjoy the vineyard next door"

                "description": "Ordered to-go. Person answering the phone was delightful and friendly. I ordered the Daily Special Mahi Lupo. The vegetables, broccolini, tomatoes, and artichoke had a very nice flavor. However, the brocollini was served without trimming the huge stalks which were too thick to eat so you really didn't get much brocollini. The bread was stale. The oil for dipping was great. The mahi was disgustingly undercooked and slimy. The fish didn't flake, it slithered. If they fire grilled it, it jumped out of the fire real quick and was almost alive. I tried to nuke it for a minute but it just didn't work. I spent close to 50.00 for a meal I mostly couldn't eat. I love the setting, the villa feel of the place but I can't spend that kind of money for a bad meal. To-go orders are even more important to get right than in-house since there is no chance to replace it or remedy anything. I am a sushi fan and can eat raw fish, but this was like nothing I've ever seen. I prefer my fish dead before I eat it. Come on guys I pay you guys to catch the fish AND cook it for me!   Sorry, my picture are too big for Yelp and I am too tired and disappointed to try to fix that."

I had the Brussels sprouts as an appetizer and they were way too salty. The main was the risotto which was so interesting with the garlic probably wouldn't order it again but it was flavorful. The service was so slow but he was extremely friendly so we appreciated the service. I would dine here again in the summer for a glass of wine in their outdoor area."

The driveway was hard to see coming off the road but I suppose this is due to the \"dark sky\" community. Albeit, Some extra signage would be nice.   We ordered meatballs as an appetizer and these were delicious! The garlic toast that comes with this dish is soooo tasty!   Focaccia and oil is complimentary, wish the bread was softer and less greasy but it was free..   We split the taglierini portofino. It was the right amount! The scallops in the dish was perfectly cooked, the shrimp may have been over seasoned but the lemon butter slightly cuts the seasoning.   Over all, We spent about $80 for our meal and 3 drinks.  We were pretty satisfied! Thanks for the great service and delicious Italian!"

We had two of the local wines and they were so light and fresh for lunch. They made accomodations for me since I'm a vegetarian too. Picture is two of the meals we got- the lasagna and the Alfredo pasta."

                "description": "We brought food from here to a table outside the winery nextdoor.. with wine from the winery. I think this is your best bet if you're looking to eat and be away from crowds (for COVID).  I have to say all the food was good. The linguini was my favorite, followed closely by the mashed potatoes. The breads (focaccia and garlic) were each tasty, i could eat that focaccia all dayyy.  The lasagna was good, a bit heavy for me, though.. but what do you expect with lasagna!  I'd probably skip the Caesar salad next time..  While not my favorite Italian food ever, the grounds are beautiful, and it's a great place to bring a date or some friends and have a picnic style meal with some wine ;)"

                "description": "This place is a visual feast--a beautiful building of European flavor with a substantial Vinyard nearby, surrounded by beautiful oak trees, and beautifully maintained gardens.  While it is not easy to get to, it is the only gourmet restaurant I know of that accommodates helicopters.  (We arrived by car.)  We have met Austin friends here several times and the food has always been excellent, but we all agreed that it is now even better than we had remembered it from pre-covid days.  Warm bread came early with a plate of olive oil and herbs for dipping.  The antipasto plate and the fried calamari were both excellent, with a spicy dipping sauce.  Our friend loved the pasta dish with sautéed scallops, and the 8 ounce filet that my wife and I shared  was the best of our eight decade lifetime.  We will be back again and again."

                "description": "Driving to Trattoria Lisina from Austin is always a fun field trip out into a totally different part of Texas. No traffic, windy two lane roads and there you are, in a vineyard in the middle of nowhere. I'd have never guessed a place the size and class of Trattoria Lisina would be nestled in hill country like this.  The inside felt distinctly Houston/Dallas vibes: much more corporate and big scale than a little mom-and-pop, but in a good way. Nice and air conditioned with plenty of space too. Now for the food:  The focaccia they serve with garlic/herb olive oil is OUTSTANDING. I could have eaten it all night, so so good. Like fools we ALSO ordered garlic bread. The garlic bread was toasted baguette slices that were burnt and dried. No bueno. Also: how is one bread item the best thing on the menu and the other maybe the worst? Strange, but anyway, don't get the garlic bread when you have garlic oil and bread in your lap, overflowing. The calamari was ok but the entrees were amazing. The osso buco was SO TENDER and so full of flavor. It came with a little marrow spoon and was a huge portion. My husband got the crispy duck with polenta cakes and cranberry salsa and he was a big fan too.   The service was so nice and sweet and the setting was beyond stunning. I really liked my time here and would definitely take guests when they visit too!"

We had the meatballs, crab appetizer, and bread service appetizer. All were very good. I really enjoyed the meatballs. For dinner we had the seafood pasta and the osso bucco. Both were okay and could've had some more flavor. My pasta was a bit bland. Food portions are large and we were too stuffed for dessert. Service was good."

                "description": "First ever dining experience at Trattoria Lisina.  We we did for a special occasion, a \"mile stone birthday.\"  We drove 1-1/2 hours to get there!  Let's start with negatives (which I don't normally do!).  The most expensive menu item, aside from the bottle of wine, was a pistachio encrusted red snapper filet.  The fish was 2x over cooked, and was tough as leather.  The main problem was it's a filet, skin on, blood line still intact.  As a seasoned Gulf fisherman and chef, I know you need the blood line cut out of the filet, even the fishing guys on YouTube get that.  Great piece of fish, tough to cut even with the knife provided.  It's not all about presentation.  Issue raised with waiter (Joseph S), and \"he could have the manager come over to discuss.\"  As a waiter, when the dish is bad, take it away and redo!  The craft cocktails were OK, not worth the $14-$15 price tag.  The star of the evening was the calamari fritti, which was great!  Fresh, hot, tartar and marinara sauces were on point, terrific.  The veal osso buco, the best in TX, by far!  There's something about fresh bone marrow!  Dessert was the tiramisu, which was awesome, until James S added to the bill.  Overall, Trattoria Lisina is a \"destination\" restaurant, but for the $$, it's not worth the hype.  Enjoy one of the Mandola locations in ATX, the food is better and the price tag is 80% less ..."

                "description": "Super cute, cozy, and clean BandB. One of the more reasonably priced places in Wimberley. Located right off the Square so easy walking distance to restaurants, shops, and the creek. I recommend Kiss the Cook (souvenirs, kitchen gadgets, coffee, etc) and Wimberley Cafe (good burgers and pie). The courtyard is beautifully decorated and relaxing. Plenty of FREE breakfast and pre-packaged snacks available even during COVID (cereal, Nutri-grain and Nature Valley bars, Chewy bars, muffins, coffee, orange juice, apple juice, pudding packs, fruit cups, yogurt, chips, milk and water for $1).  Stayed in the Maeson room. You have to exit the home into the courtyard to access this room, but I liked the privacy. Very comfortable king size bed, fresh linens, very spacious room w/ mini fridge, microwave, and tv, not much counter space in the bathroom though. Hosts were incredibly nice and welcoming. I would return!"

                "description": "My sister got married last week in Wimberly, TX. Our family thought, \"this is so random\". Neither of the families lived there and most of us had never heard of Wimberly. Then my sister said she had booked us at The Square Inn and gave us room arrangements.   I had flown in leaving MD at 4 am then getting to Dallas and then drove an hour. It felt like it was 5 in the afternoon but in reality it was 11am.   We walk into the Square Inn and was greeted by the owners. It never even hit my mind from the crazy traveling, check in was at 3 PM. To be honest I didnt think about it till others said there hotels would not let them early check in.   When meeting the owners, it felt like family. It almost felt like we were all coming home. They were so great. They let us in early and was cool enough to say, \"we need to run out before the others come, you are in charge.\"   The whole place was beautiful and amazing. Every room was perfect for single friends, to my other sisters and my crazy, but loveable nephews. Mr. Loyd one of the owners was like a natural grandfather with letting the boys run around but also telling them to close the door to keep AC inside. Lol  My favorite spot was the court yard. It looks like something out of a movie. Plus when it rains you can sit and watch the rain hit the roof. It's so peaceful.   So on top of a friendly, welcoming, beautiful space to stay and socialize, they also cook breakfast. Let me tell you it was the best food I have ever had at a bed and breakfast place.   We could smell the bacon at 6 am. Yum yum   So hands down this is place to stay in Wimberly. Its walking distance of all the cool shops and places to eat in town."

                "description": "Cons: * There were mosquitoes CONSTANTLY flying around our room. We never left the door open, so I don't know how they kept coming in. (This was the biggest con) * When we placed the \"service our room\" card on our door, no one ever came to fix the bed or resupply fresh towels. We were gone for like the whole day, and no one came, so that wasn't nice * The water pressure in the shower was too hard * The bathroom floor would get soaking wet anytime we took a shower because the curtain wouldn't stay closed all the way to prevent the water from going outside the tub. * When they gave us the wifi password they spelled it with a capital T, but really it was all lowercase, so we had a hard time getting the WiFi to work until we called the front desk.   Pros: * it is within walking distance to all the little stores and Wimberley cafe. * the staff is friendly. * The price of the room is reasonable   They just need to fix all the cons listed, and I think they would have a fine place to stay. Very unique and quirky. Also, I do think it would be nice if they had cable television."

We were lucky to have made reservations at the Square Inn.  This place is quaint and hip at the same time.  Our room/suite was large and clean and really comfy.  The staff and owners were great and accommodating. We had to leave early due to the weather so we really couldn't enjoy all of the amenities, but we r definitely going to return. The Square Inn is a great choice for being close to the Square. Lots of great places to walk to and enjoy. Can't wait to go back and we will absolutely b staying at the Square Inn.

They took 20 mins to show up at the front desk when we arrived. they are charging us for damages they refuse to show us documents of. i went back and forth emailing the so called staff there and she told me she didn't have time for my problems. when I asked for her bosses number she gave me her fiances number. which, big surprise was no help because he would only side with her. he said hes the gm and theirs no higher position then him which is a lit because every gm has a boss and while we were there a lady was talking to them about things they needed changed who i'm assuming is Marcilia B. the owner. also the couple who runs the place was arguing so loud while we were there we could hear it from our room, when i went to see what was going on i saw her yelling at him.There was NEVER anyone at the front desk the whole time we were there and they lied about their medicine variety they claim to have. I'm pregnant and can only have Tylenol which the claimed they had in their \"large variety\" which only consisted of off brand aspirin. when i emailed them asking for documents all they did was argue with me (a customer) instead of trying to resolve the problem. I don't recommend  to anyone to stay here or waste your money because you will only get horrible service. DO NOT GO HERE WASTE OF MONEY."

                "description": "My mother and I spent one night at the Square Inn. They were extremely accommodating even though we could only spend one night when they normally have a two night minimum. The room was very spacious,  decorated perfectly and very clean. The inn was fully booked but you wouldn't even know it because it was so nice and quiet. We felt as though we had the whole place to ourselves. The owners are so very nice and informative. The inn is walking distance to many shops and dining options. We weren't able to stay for breakfast but it smelled delicious. We will definitely be going back!!"

It was very quiet at night and our beds were very comfortable.  Also, you can't beat the location for walking to the shops and restaurants."

                "description": "Myself and my fiancee recently visited Square Inn, and were very pleased with our stay.  The Lauren Room was clean, with warm, rustic interiors and a fabulously comfortable king-size bed.  The patio located just a few steps from our door was spacious; nice place to hang out before venturing to either Marco's Italian or Cypress Creek for dinner (both restaurants, by the way..  wonderful).  Square Inn is walking distance from some truly amazing dining, along with quaint knick knack shops (soaps, candy, etc.)-- not to mention you're swimming the Blanco, or tasting at Wimberley Valley Winery, in just a few minutes' drive.  Can't beat that.  Which reminds me: amenities included a big-screen t.v. in the common area, a decent library of DVD'S, an Xbox 360 game console with games, and complimentary wine in the afternoon and evenings.  Really, really nice being able to wind down for the night with a movie, and a glass or two from Duchman Winery.   Marci, our innkeeper at Square Inn, was very friendly, and courteous, even during a fluke front-door locking mechanism malfunction which resulted in our having to wake her up."

                "description": "This is a quiet little place with 6 rooms.  The innkeeper, Marci, serves breakfast every morning in the common area.  According to her, this place is a labor of love, and it shows.  The beds are comfortable and the atmosphere is peaceful.  I will definitely be staying again next spring.  If you are visiting Wimberly for the Square, the inn is literally a stone's throw away."

Also ordered a bottle of the rose and loved it, refreshing, dry. Do order the charcuterie board, it should not be missed because it contains a very flavorful assortment of local meats and cheeses. Highly recommend!"

I've been a member of the wine club here roughly two years now, but yet have I had the pleasure of joining them for the \"Sunset Dinner\"! It was so peaceful and relaxing. I definitely will return and I totally recommend. Ask for Lisa, Mark's wife, she's pretty cool."

                "description": "First, the Driftwood Bistro is on the grounds of Driftwood Estates winery, just off RR 12 south of Dripping Springs. There are several things to be said about that. First, be prepared for the rough, rocky driveway up the hill to the grounds. Once on top, though, the vista is splendid, especially as the sunset rolls across the hills beyond and the flats below. The grounds are lovely and spacious and pleasing. It is an exceedingly pleasing setting.  Beyond that, the Bistro is on one side of the hilltop and the wine house on the other. The Bistro doesn't have a liquor license, so you have to walk across the grounds to get a glass or bottle to go with your meal. An inconvenience. Their wines are middle of the road, and the selection of wines by the glass are very limited as far as whites go.  The Bistro has a pretty experimental and ambitious menu, with creative choices and options. We had the Caribbean Shrimp and Rice and the Open-faced Stuffed Avocado. The avocado dish was superb, with the featured avocado just the right level of ripeness, tender grilled chicken and a picante that was dynamite. The salsa Fresca and crema helped create a very satisfying entre. The flavors both blended and contrasted with each other. A very nice choice of a cool dish for a summer evening. The shrimp dish, on the other hand, was disappointing. It was tepid, to start with. And the shrimp had a very fishy flavor. The sautéed squash was credible, but overall it was disappointing.   Service was cordial. Lexi,our server, was very warm and welcoming and attentive. It was not her fault that the shrimp wasn't the proper temperature   The Bistro gets a 'maybe' on this visit, with hopes that they will improve on speed out of the kitchen and address that glitchy separation of wine bar and restaurant. The place has much going for it, and, if they can up their game, it will be a killer destination."

Buy your wine at the Winery and walk over to the Bistro for a great outdoor lunch with awesome views. (They can't sell wine at the Bistro)."
