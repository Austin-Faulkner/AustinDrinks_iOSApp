When you visit the old fashioned and margherita is a must to start.   It's bring your own food or snacks and according to Scott the owner food trucks and live music are coming soon.   C'mon by and have a beautifully hand crafted cocktail."

                "description": "Decided to try this place out because it was a local distillery. we will be back time and time again. We wanted to buy a bottle for the upcoming 4th of July weekend. and we got to try 4 of their selections. The texagave, gin, triple session and whiskey. I was happy with all of them.  Texagave is their \"tequila\". I thought it had a great taste and would make a great margarita. My wife, who is a tequila drinker, wasnt too fond of it, but I loved it and it would make a great add to any bar.  Gin. It tasted twice as good as Tanqueray but with half the bite/harshness. we bought 2 bottles. Will be back for all the Gin needs.  Whiskey. If youre a fan of Gentleman Jack youll love this! super smooth and mellow. I thought it was good (im a bourbon drinker), just not the Super Oaky flavor that Im used to. too mellow for my taste.  Triple Session. This was by far the most impressive and different spirit I tried. Think of a triple sec (orange and sweet flavor) but with actual alcohol in it. I think it is 41% and it tastes fantastic over ice, not to harsh, not to sweet (by triple sec standards) but just right. Cant beat if for less than 15 bucks a bottle at total wine.  I cant wait till I try the rest of their spirits. Go in and try them, you will not be disappointed!"

Scott (the founder) was very welcoming and showed us the different spirits that they had to offer.   The TexAgave is perfect for people that like tequila, the 17 Whiskey is great for the bourbon drinker, and Whit's Gin is really tasty too.  I didn't have a chance to try all of them but I'm sure the others not mentioned are great.   Some of us ordered the Bill Pickett Bulldog which was made with their JavaGave Coffee Liqueur and it was like Kahlua and Milk but way better. Highly recommend that drink!  Most of their drinks are $4!"

                "description": "My wife and I stumbled across this place on a Sunday.  The owner,  Scott,  happened to be inside,  noticed us reading the stuff on the door and unlocked the door,  invited us in for a tour and taste of all their products.   We've been serious fans ever since.   I've had everything they make and all of their products are GREAT. My current favorite is 17, a bourbon,  but that is a limited run.    For Christmas, I got several people to go in for me and buy some 17 to give out as gifts.  I also bought their products available at participating liquor stores as gifts.  I distributed them to about 8 people total.  It was a mix of 17, Leanderthal Vodka, TexAgave, Triple Secession and Javagave.  Some recipients were serious liquor connisuer's,  others just liked a cocktail now and then.  All thoroughly enjoyed what they got and added it to their regular liquor rotations.  Leanderthal has since opened a tasting room where you can get cocktails made with all their products,  and are free to bring in outside food to munch on,  as they don't necessarily have food on site.  Although Scott has a creative work around with that by having a food truck occasionally.   They also give samples of all their products as well.   Their craft cocktails are GREAT!  And they are very affordable for top shelf cocktails.    If you like any type of liquor, Scott has a great version of it.  Everyone there are super friendly too.    Great place to go and hang out.   Only downside is you can only buy 2 bottles per adult every 30 days.   Awesome place!!"

Friends and I tried most of the menu between the four of us and every drink was great. Their liquors are unique and delicious. I love any drink that uses whole, natural ingredients- no mixers in this place, and who can beat $4-5 drinks that taste this good?!  Making it BYOFood is so great, I'm only worried that this spot will get so popular that it will outgrow its space. Can't wait to go back"

Walking distance of 'bring your own food' deliciousness. QUIET! No loud distracting music. This is now going to be my monthly getaway. And my next move? Write to my congressman to change the law prohibiting me from purchasing more than two bottles from these guys per 30 days. Distributers, get lost!"

The stereo system was bumping, and Daniel, our amazing driver, had no issue with us turning it up to 11.  Our group was most guys in their 30's and Daniel gave us good recommendations on spots to check out that were age appropriate.  In between spots, Daniel drove me to a gas station to help me restock on beer. He even came in and helped me carry and load beers into the coolers.  Great communicate from Daniel from beginning to end, and he someone found the perfect spot to pick us up on busy Rainey St at the end of the night.   Great value and great experience.  Highly recommend."

We were staying in the adorable town of Wimberley so I researched tours in the area.  Jodie's Taste of the Hills Tour got great reviews and went to wineries close to the Wimberley area. The day of the tour ended up being chilly and rainy. As soon as Jodie pulled up with her spectacular shuttle-like van she was out like a flash with pretty umbrellas for us! We went to 3 different wineries which we thoroughly enjoyed! After the first one, we returned to Jodie's vehicle and she had a gorgeous tray for us of cheese,  sausage,  crackers,  grapes,  olives, dips.....simply divine!!! The tour was also just the 2 of us and we loved that Jodie still did ALL of this for a tour that I believe takes up to 12 people! The next time we plan a trip to the Hill Country we are going to do one of Jodie's Beer tours!! We had such great conversations with Jodie too! Thank you sooooo much for the GREAT time! Sooooo much fun!"

She recommended the best of Driftwood and ended up going to Driftwood Estate Winery and Vista Brewery. We spent around 5 hours commuting, tasting, and even an impromptu cellar tour. Thanks again, Jodie! I highly recommend Taste of the Hills to everyone."

                "description": "Amazing tour!!! My wife and I came into Wimberley during Spring Break to relax from teaching and this was the perfect trip to do so! Jodie made us all feel like we were old friends, even though we had never met anyone else on the bus.  She was very detailed with the stories of each winery, and explained all the different varietals, answering our every question along the way. The bus was very comfortable and clean, and she stored each bottle we purchased until the trip was over, but we could have had the bottles on the bus had we chosen to.  The wineries all seemed to know her, so they were expecting us and were incredibly friendly. We were not rushed anywhere, and still managed to make it back into town to enjoy shopping on the square.  My wife and I were pretty hungry by the time we had lunch, since we didn't have breakfast, but the tapas style lunch was perfect for the glass of wine we purchased to have with it. The lunch was delicious and filling.  Overall this was an amazing experience and I will be recommending this tour to everyone I know."

Jodie is such a pleasant and inviting soul. She asked about each person's preferences as to be able to personalize the tour and pick which wineries she decided to take us too.  She is very knowledgeable of the town and the wineries.  The lunch she provides is just amazing. By the time we were done I felt like I had made an incredible new friend.

We were fortunate enough to have great people touring with us, and it made the tour all the more fun.  She prepared the best picnic lunch I've ever had.  Sugar Shack cake balls, meats, cheeses, crackers, hummus, a goat cheese something served on crackers (that I LOVED, and I hate goat cheese), spinach feta rolls, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something.  She was fully prepared for everything.  Boxes for the wine we bought, umbrellas in case in rained (it didn't), plenty of water...this wine tour couldn't have been more perfect if she tried.  Thanks, Jodie!"

She provided an excellent variety of foods including a hot portion and gluten-free (just in time `cause I was lit after the 1st vineyard). The three vineyards for that day were selected based on the wine preferences of the tourists that day (A+ perk). We never felt pushed or obligated to buy wines, but we all did because they were very good (!), and Jodie kept our purchases organized and stored for us. She also gave a good background on each vineyard and on the Wimberley area in general. We learned a lot about Wimberley and wine and were able to get tipsy knowing Jodie was an excellent driver of her comfy bus. And have you been to Wimberley? That hilly countryside is beautiful!"

Our tour was originally scheduled for 10:30a, but got pushed back to 1:15p due to shuttle trouble (we had the option to receive our money back, but actually liked the later time).  We stopped at three wineries, including Driftwood Estate and Duchman Family Winery.  The views at all of the wineries varied, but each were unique to their locations.  Jodie provided an amazing picnic-style lunch, including a charcuterie (meat and cheese) board, chicken salad, nuts, walnut and feta salad, grapes, chocolate cake balls, bottled water, etc. At the second stop, Jodie was kind enough to call in people's orders to Salt Lick BBQ and had it all ready to take home by the third stop.  We can't wait to return again!"

She gave us a lot of background information on the wineries as well as the town of Wimberley. She had a delicious assortment of snacks for us to munch on while we rode to and from each winery. She helped package our wine purchases and brought us umbrellas as it started to rain. She even went the extra mile, literally, and drove us back to our hotel since it was raining as we had walked to our meeting spot earlier in the day. We had another couple on the tour with us which was really nice since we had people to mingle with. It was a very personal experience and I felt as though we were all just great friends spending an afternoon together. Who needs Napa, everything is better in Texas!!! We will definitely be repeat customers."

I don't know if the business has just gotten bigger than the owners can handle but communication was subpar. It took several calls and emails to get answers sometimes.   At our first tour, Kathie took tons of photos and would pose us at the wineries. This tour, we had to prompt her. It was a cloudy day so not the best for outdoor pics but I was disappointed we took most of them ourselves or had to ask her to take the pictures.   Our tour was April 11, it is now almost 2 mths later I haven't received the few pictures we took. I emailed twice and have finally heard back that the SD is apparently not working. I'm not sure why I had to email to find this out, seems like this info should have been divulged as soon as the problem presented itself.   I hate to downgrade the star review but my second time with this company just wasn't as epic as the initial tour I took with them. The wineries all seem to love this company though."

DTWT was very accommodating, scheduled the wineries we wanted to see, ordered the lunches, and then confirmed our selections a couple of days prior to our tour. At the last minute after visiting with a couple in our third stop, we changed our fourth stop to a different winery. Jason (our driver) was happy to accomodate us. My only regret is that we didn't choose a few wineries a little further out of town, so we could spend more time in the limo listening to our Willie Nelson songs. Jason was awesome, and I highly recommend this tour."

                "description": "We started researching half-day wine tours for my BFF's bachelorette party several months in advance and chose this company because of its good reviews and cancellation policy (full refund up to 7 days in advance).   First, the bad news. The booking process is way more arduous than it should be. My initial discussion about the tour plans happened over the phone, so I asked for a written, e-mail confirmation of what we had discussed - specifically how the deposit and refund policies work. It took me more than three weeks to get that first e-mail confirmation of our booking and deposit payment. I then went back and forth, back and forth, back and forth with the company, hammering out the details, like setting a pickup location and our choices for the winery stops. Many times, three weeks would pass and I'd have to make multiple attempts before I would get a response to my e-mails. Sometimes, the responses would be incomplete and we'd repeat the process of trying to get information confirmed. Seriously a pain for an experience that costs $129 per person.   Now, the good news. The online payment portal for each attendee was a breeze to use and eliminated the need to handle money all through one person. As for the actual tour itself, we couldn't have asked for a better experience. Our driver, Bobby, was on time and wonderful on the day of the tour. He was funny and polite and had good knowledge of the area. Also, very importantly, he was a good and safe driver! The Mercedes bus we took was very clean and spacious, and they provided water, cups and napkins. They also allowed us to bring our own food onto the bus. The three wineries we visited, Driftwood Estate, Duchman and Fall Creek, were all accommodating and fun. The views were lovely and we never felt rushed and made it back on time. It was raining when we got back to our car, and Bobby was so nice and helped us get our stuff back into our car in the pouring rain.   All in all, despite a wonderful wine tour, I'm not sure I would recommend this company, only because I spent way too much time hounding them throughout the booking process. While the wine was excellent, I NEEDED to drink after dealing with their horrible communication. Discover Texas Wines should strongly consider re-evaluating their communication practices and hire more people to keep up with the demand for their service. It's the only way they will stay competitive in the long-run!"

However, Mike (magic mike) completely turned a ruined weekend around. He was so nice and fun he sang to us and played guitar. I have never met a more generous and kind person. It might take you sending 3 emails to get responses from the company but definitely use Mike for your tour!"

He picked us up on time, was incredibly friendly, and funny even though we were a bachelorette party and knowing the possibility of it getting crazy with 7 girls. Seriously, request Roy. He made the trip a blast. There was cold water for us in the bus. Oh did I mention it's a Mercedes bus? Super nice! An AUX cable was available to play our own music too. The selection of wineries was amazing, perfect mixture between red and whites/dry and sweet, so every one of us could have something tasty. The drive was beautiful and not too far out of Austin. Overall, I am very impressed with this tour and the wonderful employees. Would definitely go again."

I made the reservation back in January, gave my card for deposit and was told I'd be emailed a link for everyone to pay. Over the next two months I called and emailed asking about the link so my friends could pay their part and I was repeatedly told they were having issues. Okay fine, no big deal- I also emailed again saying we can just pay the day of if the link wasnt working and never received a response. The day before our tour, as I was driving from Dallas to Fredericksburg I get a call from Some guy at the company and he seemed very annoyed with me saying no one had paid yet. Um.. I'm sorry I didn't realize you finally sent it after months of my asking. (He had sent it the day before calling me to tell me no one had paid) The vehicle I requested was not the one that showed up. The driver Julia was late bc she did not write the address down correctly. We also had 3 girls cancel last minute, so we were down to 5 instead of 8. Considering there minimum is 5 I wasn't expecting that to be a problem but Julia felt the need to bring it up multiple Times as if it caused some inconvenience for her. Rude people, horrible communication."

Roy was a true gentleman and really took good care of our group all day long, making this a truly great experience. Noel was very helpful in booking us, even with a last minute addition to our party. I will be using these guys again in the future, and would recommend anyone who is looking for a first time trip to do the same."

Organizing a full day wine tour for 50 people in the Texas Hill Country may not sound like an easy task, but Noel at Discover Texas Wine Tours made it smooth and most importantly, unforgettable. His main goal is to make sure everyone is comfortable and has a good time! Most companies were not able to host a group this size, but Noel made it happen. He made sure our bus was the best he could find, worked to have a lunch catered for us at one of the stops, set up private tastings with many of the wineries to accommodate a group our size, even stopped to let one of the guys who didn't drink wine buy some beer. I can't say enough good things about Noel and how hard he worked for our group. I highly recommend him and look forward to another tour with him soon!!"

We stopped in on 3 different wineries and Kim had made superb choices in each spot; from the wines to the view to the suggestions on what to try and how to make the most of our samples so everyone could try as many as possible (thanks for that tip, Kim!).

He would check in on us during the winery to see if we needed anything or have any questions, and he would offer to help us take multiple pictures.

From the minute I called to book to the minute I said goodbye to our driver the day of the tour they were fantastic.   So when I called there actually weren't any times available. They worked with me to make sure they had a tour time and sprinter available for our group of 6. I had a million questions; they were patient and kind.   Our group was 6 but one of my friends asked if we could add an additional person. Reached out to TTT and they said sure no problem. Literally 3 HOURS LATER I got a call that another girl tested positive with covid and wouldn't be able to come with us obviously- they were so nice and made the switch back to 6. Very grateful for their exceptional customer service.   Day of our driver Bryant was early which was great! Got on the bus and let us have free range of the radio, answered any wine questions we had or any questions about Fredericksburg. He was a fantastic host. Always texted 15 minutes till our time at the winery was up and took as many pictures as we wanted. He was so sweet! He also made sure we were never thirsty or hungry. Which for a group of girls is very important- smart man! Haha   I've heard things about other companies having hidden fees and people getting charges after leaving Fredericksburg and we had none of that. Texas Tipsy Tours was very transparent with all of their pricing and they had no hidden fees.   Thank you TTT for making our trip perfect. You won't regret booking with them."

When I initially started inquiring about a tour a few months ago, many of the companies only offered private tours for a minimum of 4 people. However, Texas Tipsy Tours offers small group private tours (i.e. 2-3 people). This was perfect for me. She also made planning our trip so easy, and she promptly answered all of the questions I had.   On the day of the tour, she picked us up from our hotel in Austin in an Infiniti SUV (it was very clean too)! She even made a pit stop for me at a CVS on the way to our first winery. Throughout the 6 hour tour, she made sure we stayed on schedule. She even let us change a stop last minute because we wanted to check out a brewery!  One thing that was amazing was the comfort she provided! She allowed us to pick the music, provided phone chargers, and let us control the AC! She even opened our doors for us AND dropped us off/picked us up right in front of each place we went!  Overall, I highly recommend Texas Tipsy Tours, and I will definitely be back!"

I have taken quite a few van tours around the hill country and Texas Tipsy Tours sets themselves apart by not just being drivers but they truly host you the entire day. I will ALWAYS use this company going forward. We did a private charter from Driftwood to Austin, TX and back and Keaton our driver was a delight. He made sure we were picked up on time and each of our stops were easy and flexible. We did a mixed tour around Driftwood and Dripping springs the next day and our guide Eric executed the BEST DAY for us. He even picked up on what we were liking and recommended a change to our final stop to Vista Brewing and we were SO glad he did. At each stop he made sure we had plenty of water, snacks and chairs to enjoy the gorgeous venues. This is totally above and beyond what we would have expected from a driver. Courtney was so easy to work with and she helped make recommendations for our group ultimately making our weekend get away FLAWLESS. I promise if you don't use this company, you're wrong."

                "description": "AWESOME! I worked with Courtney at TTT to plan my Husband's 30th birthday brewery tour. It was as easy as getting on the phone, explaining what I wanted, and Courtney took care of literally everything else. We picked the breweries we wanted and even included a food stop. She coordinated the bus pick up, drop offs, schedule, and even reserved tables for us at each stop. I love that we had our own bus (very nice one, by the way!), and had the flexibility to create our own tour based on beers and food my husband liked. It was the perfect Saturday in Austin! Payment was very easy as well - they sent me an invoice to my email and I was able to pay directly online for everything. Highly recommend, and thank you Texas Tipsy Tours!"

                "description": "Texas Tipsy Tours was absolutely wonderful. They curated a wine tasting for my best friend's bachelorette, and were so helpful and knowledgeable. Courtney and Eric are just the sweetest people! Would highly recommend if you're looking for a relaxed tasting without the hubbub of big party buses, AND if you're looking for a more personalized experience with people who can really throw a party. Fredericksburg can be confusing because of the many, many options, so Courtney's expertise in the wineries proved incredibly helpful. Highly recommend!!"

We selected the premium wine tour and stopped at 3 wineries and picked up lunch at Hye Market.  The entire experience was well thought out and planned thoroughly.  Courtney is one of the owners and helped me figure out which wineries to taste.  Keaton was our driver and he was great!  I would definitely recommend this tour company."

                "description": "I rented a party bus through this company a couple weeks ago. In the beginning, Robert was extremely accommodating and friendly. And our driver, Terrell, was great. We got dropped off at COTA for a show and had a great time!  But where it turned south was at the end of the night. I texted our driver 30 minutes before we needed to be picked up (like he requested) and he said no problem. Then we left the concert and were walking to the pickup spot where I gave him a call. He said he got in an accident but would only be 20 minutes and I said that's fine. 20 minutes roll by and I gave him a call again, no answer, but texted and said it would be another 20 minutes. We ended up waiting in the cold for almost an hour and well after most people had left COTA. Multiple people in our party ended up just taking ubers because they didn't want to wait. The whole point of a bus is so you don't have to wait.  The next day, I texted Robert saying we would like a refund for the extra hour we paid for waiting that we wouldn't have used if we had been picked up on time. He said he would call to discuss but never did. I've now sent him multiple emails - mind you, being incredibly nice about it. All I asked for was an hour refunded back - not the whole thing, not even half. But still no response.  The customer service level of this company is terrible should anything go wrong. So hire them at your own risk."

We had rented a party bus on pretty short notice to take a Bachelor Party to and from Lake Travis and Robert and team were amazing.   It was also Prom weekend so the schedule was packed for them but they still took care of us and worked with our schedule.   Our boat ended up staying out on the water longer than scheduled which through our plans all over the place and Robert was there waiting on time. Given his packed schedule, the driver did have to leave without us but Robert made sure to get me in contact with another service and they sent a bus over right away.   All in all, it was an incredible experience!"

Missing panels inside of bus missing or duct tape together.  Another party bus parked next to the one we had and it was so obvious how terrible looking our bus looked.   Can't believe owners would let this bus represent their company. Hope they use our $700 toward getting it fixed.   Driver was pleasant."

                "description": "I'm incredibly frustrated with this business.  We had spoken a couple times in the months before I decided to book and I initially felt great about potentially booking with these friendly people.  When it came time to book I called them and was told, once again, that our requested date was open and we talked out an agreement.  The owner tells me we're good to go, and that all he needed me to do now was to send him my information so that he could get a contract sent that same day.  I'd explained to him that I was booking this bus ride to and from a party boat, and that I would be booking with them that day as well.   SO, I get off the phone and send my info.  I call my party boat folks to let them know I've just confirmed my bus, and I'm ready for a boat.  I book with them based on my discussion with these guys and put down $400 to hold our reservation.  It's been two weeks since I last spoke with this company and they have ignored my calls, texts, voicemails trying to figure out why the contract hasn't come through.  Our event is next month, and at this point I've been researching new solutions, and unfortunately the new solution means I can't use the same boat company, and therefore I've lost my $400 deposit.  I did not have this money to lose, but after being ghosted by this company I guess I have to take the loss and move on.  They seem like nice people, and it takes A LOT to get on here and write a negative review, but this has caused me a lot of stress and I want to prevent this from happening to anyone else.  I hope at some point I find out a reasonable explanation and can revise this review, but not counting on it.  We'll see I guess."

But how is that supposed to work when you have a huge group? I called austin nites party rentals for a few reasons 1. I love puns and 2. I'm am austinite and 3. My group was over ten people and we wanted to go out and have nothing to worry about. Great party bus, great personable driver, great experience definitely reccomend these guys!!

                "description": "BOOK WITH THIS COMPANY!  Robert did a solid job taking me and a bunch of my friends to Lake Travis and back on July 4th. His price was WAY lower than other companies I called, being the ONLY one that actually sticked to his regular prices during this busy day. He arrived early and was 100% responsive to my emails and phone calls. He arrive early to pick us up and was extremely friendly and professional. He helped us carry our coolers and accommodate everything on the bus.  The bus itself is amazing. Seats are stacked in two rows facing each other, which is great for dancing and socializing, since you are actually facing half of the crowd. The sound system is also very good. I almost feel that the bus trip was even more fun that the boat.   In summary, Austin Nites Ent. is the best on price/quality, Robert and his wife are responsive, professional and friendly, and the whole experience I had with them is positive. Would highly recommend anyone to use it, and will definitely consider using them again if I ever need to.  Thank you guys!!!!!"

I called about 10 other companies looking for fun and safe travels with almost all of them being ridiculously overpriced to take advantage of the prom goers. Robert was very accommodating, professional, and had awesome rates. He called two days before the scheduled time of arrival to check in and verify everything was still good to go. He asked if there were any changes in the amount of people and offered a bigger bus just in case. Our drivers, Patrick and Joe were awesome! Patrick called me early the day of to verify everything and let me know he'd be there at 8 and then called again when they were almost to our pickup location. They arrived right on time with an awesome bus just for us. He had coolers with ice, a flat screen tv, music system, AC and even a bathroom in the back. What more could you ask for? Part of the evening was spent at Graham's Central Station in Pville. We didn't realize prior that Graham's doesn't serve food anymore and had to order pizza to the bus. Patrick gladly retrieved our pizza and brought it to us when it arrived. We all had a blast, felt safe and were taken care of. Highly recommend Austin NItes and shout out to Patty PartyWagon, if you had a Yelp page, I'd write a review for you too."

Sam, the owner and driver, was unbelievable. Very accommodating, great driver, and super chill.   We planned to hit up the Salt Lick on the party bus and then venture around to some breweries afterwards. Sam made sure that the group got where we needed to be on time, had great suggestions for breweries, and made sure we were having as much fun as possible.  The bus is great. Fit everyone comfortably with enough room for a cooler in between all of us. Sam had her playlist turned up or she would hand over the AUX cord and we could play our tracks as loud as we wanted. The whole experience was incredibly laid back and worry free. I would absolutely recommend Cool bus ATX to anyone that wants to have a great time with a big group in Austin.   On a side note, if it is Sunday, make sure that you buy beer on Saturday because they don't sell it on Sunday before noon.   Thanks again, Sam!"

We started at William Chris, headed to Pedernales and ended at Augusta Vin. The 15 passenger van was great for our group of 11. They offered water and took care of checking us in at each winery. David was a complete gentleman and carried all of our purchases and secured them in the van while we enjoyed our time tasting the different wines. He even dropped us off downtown so we would be on time for our dinner reservation."

A 15 passenger VAN showed up with a dent in the side and ripped seats. We were told we could bring coolers. We were only able to fit 8 adults in the van with our two coolers- no way we could've had another person in the van. None of the wineries had been scheduled yet and the ONE we had specifically requested was not available. We had to scramble ourselves to find wineries, in which we were promised everything would be done ahead of time. The meat and cheese tray that was promised was a small tray that was bought during the tour at a convenient store to feed 2 people. Our driver was great, however the owner did not deliver what was promised and we were highly disappointed. There are plenty of companies to choose from, and I would NOT recommend Open Range."

He picked us up from San Antonio, drove us up to Hill Country and around to 3 wineries.  As this was my first Texas wine tour, he did an AMAZING job of helping us select which wineries would be a good fit for the group.  As we had a decent amount of guys with us- he suggest Garrison Brother's Distillery which ended up being a HUGE hit!  He was extremely professional, courteous and just an absolute delight to spend the day with!  He also has a wicked funny sense of humor.  He was also very accommodating and ordered and picked up lunch for us so we could continue to enjoy beautiful Hill Country.  I would use him again in heartbeat and highly, highly recommend him to anyone wanting to enjoy Texas Hill Country!  Thanks David!"

Greg, the owner (and D'Ann's husband) arrived on time and drove us to 3 wineries where we were able to enjoy a nice, relaxing afternoon. Greg was so friendly, helpful and accommodating.

I wouldn't have changed any of that part. But, once the day rolled around we were met with a hiccup. The driver, not David like I was anticipating after multiple conversations, arrived in a mustang for 5 of us. Obviously that wasn't going to work so I was offered by the driver only to cancel or reschedule. Our trip was planned around spending our day out and about so cancelling wasn't an option for us. After a phone call to David, we were assured our day wasn't ruined just a bit delayed. The driver left and showed back up with an SUV and away we went. The driver wasn't interactive and she didn't seem to even be having a good day... It happens I get it but come on. Anyway, we made the best of our day and enjoyed ourselves. When we were dropped off, I tried to pay but she said to get with David. No problem but I did have a problem with her then saying that she'd go ahead and take the gratuity and that the standard is 20%. I didn't even know what our total cost was to figure 20% but asking for the gratuity before I even paid for the day was in poor taste. We did go ahead and tip, and well mind you, because that's the kind of people we are. I ended up calling David and finishing out the transaction and once again, he was a pleasure to deal with. Overall, we'll use them again because I appreciated David that much. But, I'll definitely make sure we don't have the same driver. 5 stars for David but 4 stars overall for the above mentioned."

Throwing a surprise weekend is stressful enough but Woody was SUPER accommodating especially for being so last minute.  There were many tours that I could've chosen to stick with but Woody was so authentic about his services and was a person of integrity when it came to what he offered.  He personally picked us up from our little hotel we were staying at and drove us to all three of our tours. His tour bus was super clean and we all had a blast! He even offered to pick up some cheese and snacks at the HEB close by to have on the bus if we wanted! I really appreciated Woody taking the time to answer my numerous phone calls with questions I had as this is my first Bachelorette party I threw.  I HIGHLY recommend using Woody if anyone wants to have a great time and looking for someone to trust. I will be booking with you again Woody, thank you so much for everything!"

If you come across Fredericksburg Uncorked Wine Tours, stop your search and make the booking.   Organizing a wine tour for 18 girls as part of a bachelorette party was a breeze with Woody, the owner/operator of Uncorked. He gave great advice, offered competitive pricing (especially for the expectant mothers/non-drinkers in our group), and was easy to communicate with. Woody was incredibly patient during the lead up to our tour, and then was a funny, gracious, and attentive guide during our wine tasting experience.

I called him Friday morning at 8:50 hoping I'd get a call back before the 10 am tour and I did ten min later and I was able to get on his first tour . I honestly called three or 4 more tours throughout the week and left messages and he is the only one that called me back. Not only did woody come through, he came through at the last minute when I thought We weren't going to make a tour.  He was funny , knowledgeable and overall a great guide. He even recommended a few things that weren't apart of the tour (Alamo Springs Cafe) which we ended up going to and was delicious.  Lunch was not included but the place we went to was pretty great for a sandwich . I'd hang out and grab a beer with woody any night !  Thank you for making my boyfriends birthday a good one !!"

He responded to my call right away and set us up with a 4 person private tour plus lunch. We all had a great time with lots of funny narratives. If you want to see a different side of Texas wineries, just call Woody. He will definitely hook you up.  What a great day with no worries."

                "description": "Woody was nice at the beginning but there was miscommunication about lunch and he decided to take it upon himself to charge my credit card without my permission. I was upset and apparently he was too so he threw customer service out the window. I never agreed to Woody keeping my credit card information on file after he charged the wine tour for 11 girls (almost $1,300).   The driver Tommy was nice but he did nothing special and didn't know the basics of Woody's business. Had he known even a little bit about Uncorked Tours, there wouldn't have been confusion about lunch.   As far as the wine tour: William Chris and Lost Draw were my favorite wineries. Hye Market pretended we weren't there half of the time. Pontotoc was greedy with their pours.   Woody was very unprofessional and difficult to work with at the end. I would not recommend him. Book early to get the highest rated wine tours (2-3 months prior)!"

I called the number provided on the website and had a great conversation with Woody. He set up the perfect private winery tour for me and my friends on Sunday, since Saturday was full. It was a really great and memorable experience and I would definitely consider doing it again! We had our own spacious limo that we could sip on wine we brought with us, as well as some we purchased at the wineries we visited, while driving from one vineyard to the next (drive time between each location was max. 15 minutes). Overall a great experience!"

The transportation (van) was very clean and well-taken care of. We had the van to ourselves on the couple's tour but it can easily fit a big party!  Booking a couple's wine tour on their website was super easy (and I'm sure it would be for big groups too)! The date availability, cost estimate, and customizability is spot-on. The moment you book, they send you a comprehensive list of wineries and distilleries (!!!) with rankings of the view + wine. They also have great options for add-ons, such as a charcuterie board or stopping by for lunch mid-wine tour. Love that.  There's no doubt I would choose and recommend 830 Elevated again for any future wine excursions in Hill Country. Thanks again, Brayden and Deb :)"

From start to finish everything was so easy and customizable to what we were looking for while planning our annual girls trip. Prices are incomparable with Five Star treatment on a PRIVATE tour. Right after booking we got an email with a list of the area wineries and restaurants that had notes and ratings so we could choose where we wanted to go. This is a private tour so Brayden picked us up right in front of our Airbnb and we were off. We toured four wineries and he kept us on schedule but never rushing us. After the tours we opted for the night service so he dropped us off on Main Street so we could grab dinner, sing some karaoke and when ready to be picked up to end the evening just had to shoot him a text and he was there. We just cannot say enough good things about this company. Do not second guess - book with Brayden and Deb"

I believe they were on the city website as a recommended tour, but also Google directed me to them. Either way, I am so glad it happened this way - our experience with 830 was indeed elevated!!! The customized tour that Deb set up with me over the phone was exactly what my husband and I wanted - a distillery, a brewery, and a winery that made you feel like you were in Napa. Without even knowing us, Deb helped picked the perfect places for us to enjoy. Communication up until the tour and the day of the tour was prompt and courteous, always with our best intentions in mind (example: Deb texted us and offered to pick us up even earlier than planned due to the heat at one of the outdoor locations). The drive in between locations was full of great conversation, and we were thankful they provided cold water for us. The van was immaculate and the drive was very comfortable - I didn't know the luxury that a private vs public tour would offer! Deb was so knowledgeable (she's a local, of course!) and so sweet with helping us newbies figure out what to do. Her service went above and beyond, and she made us feel like celebrities. It was an absolute pleasure to work with them - do yourself the best favor and book with them!!"

They're filling a niche most tour companies aren't by providing an affordable private tour option for couples. They were great. Small, young company. They don't have deep knowledge on wine like veteran companies but they are personable in that they also tour wineries themselves and can share their inputs."

Here's my story-   I booked with this company over a month in advance prior to my trip to Fredericksburg for my fiancé and I's anniversary, as well as his birthday. After booking, the company was very communicative for the first few days. After the first few days, I did not hear a word from them until the week of our trip. I had told them a month in advance which places we wanted to go. The week of, they inform us that Augusta vin is not taking people for reservations. Which was fine, we went ahead with the other vineyard they had suggested. We had booked for a Saturday. That Friday at 3:00AM, they had informed us of a change of driver due to a family emergency which we completely understood, and now that our pickup time had changed to 11:30AM instead of 1:30PM. I wake up to that email Saturday still understanding, and we changed our plans to be at the pickup destination by 11:30AM. We are waiting there over 15 minutes for them to show, and no one does. We call, leave voicemails, and still hear from no one. 30 minutes passed, they send a TEXT MESSAGE informing us they aren't showing up for the entire time and that we are on our own for the entire day. LEAVING OUR PLANS FOR THE ENTIRE DAY RUINED. Incredibly horrid communication from this company. DO NOT BOOK WITH THIS COMPANY!!!! I seriously am understanding that situations happen in life, but they had guaranteed us a driver for the day regardless of what had happened. I was truly heartbroken to have not received a personal phone call from the company, instead they just send us a text that they are not coming. I have NEVER written a review for a company before, but this needed to be shared. We discussed the situation with multiple locals in the town, no one had ever heard of this company. Whatever you do, save your money and time."

Allison took amazing care of us and Dan, the owner, gave us the history and was very congenial! Besides wine they distill and age vodka,  whiskey, and bourbon. I did wine tasting and my husband did whiskey tasting and of course,  we bought wine and vodka to take home with their signature wine glasses!! We so enjoyed our visit to the Thirsty Mule Winery! It is a must see and a place to stock up on all your wine needs! Not to mention their distilled and aged vodka, bourbon, and whiskey!! Check them out! It is worth your time!!"

                "description": "Let me tell you, I've been to so many wineries in the area surrounding Austin and this one by far is a true gem.  Do not judge this place by its exterior. Immediately when we came inside the tasting room we were met with a warm welcome. The menu here is deep and they have something for everyone here. Saturday's they have wood fired pizzas which we were told people come out here just for that. We will definitely be back for it!  We are in the middle of our tasting as I write this review and already I'm blown away by the Cabernet they have here. Beautiful and oaky; my first sip I just know I'm in trouble with this one! The Tempranillo has a wonderful nose to it and is nice and clean, easily could drink a bottle of this in a sitting. The Tannat was just lovely. Here are the stand outs though that we were pleasantly surprised with: Sweet Dreams, the port wine which is absolutely delicious and the Sparkling Muscadine (Sassy Mule) which is dangerously good! Fun fact, the Sparkling Muscadine is made with a local wild grape.  Amazing hospitality, zero pretentiousness, incredible wines, please visit this place!!! You're in for a real treat here."

                "description": "I really wanted to enjoy this place more, because I love supporting local businesses, but it was just ok. Nice outdoor area with goats, donkeys and chickens and plenty of space for the kids to run around, but the whiskey and bourbon were very young and just didn't taste good. The women said the wine was average, but nothing amazing. The jalapeño margarita was good, but the Old Fashioned was the worst one I've ever had and couldn't drink more than half of it. 3 stars may even be stretching it, but since their local, I felt obligated. Truly a 2 star. ‍"

                "description": "A decent spot to stop and try a couple of the locally produced wines.  Another spot north of the Colorado that goes for the 'homey' approach to wine making and serving.  Pretty, family friendly atmosphere on the outside, with a photo-ready spot next to a life-sized fiberglass mule. (To my surprise the mule does not have a name yet.)   Inside, it looks like someone's house that's been converted to a tasting room.  That's a net plus, and there's a nice gift shop, but hopefully the management will get rid of the bright and ugly banks of fluorescent lights!  Service was fast, but the ladies behind the counter profess little knowledge about the wine and are surprisingly brusque, even while serving relatively few customers.  I've noticed this same critique from a couple other Yelp Reviews, making me wonder if this is just a personal style of theirs that's off-putting to some.  Regardless, it's oddly out of place in such a friendly area as Central Texas.  The wines are a mixed bag.  A chardonnay made from California grapes tastes surprisingly sharp and 'raw', but that may be the intent since it wasn't aged in oak.  The sweet blush is passable at best. However, the sparkling cranberry is excellent.  Worth a visit if you're in the area, but save room for the vastly superior Pillar Bluff and Pilot's Knob fare.  Some tips:  1) Watch for the turnoff from 183, it's pretty sharp and takes a downward jog!    2) The flights, which run $10 for 4 tastings, are half off on Wednesdays and Thursdays.  An excellent bargain all around."

The wood fire pizzas (I believe they only offer it on Saturday) were delicious, we had the brisket and pepperoni pizzas and it was the perfect amount to split between 4 people. Lovely gift shop, too! The wine is delicious and they have just about something for everyone including a stocked bar. Donkeys/mules and goats on the property are definitely a plus for the aesthetic. Will definitely be visiting often from now on!"

                "description": "We drive into Austin quite a bit on 183 and finally decided to stop in when it was not over 100 degrees.  Typical Texas winery decorations and gift shop, however \"Distillery\" was added to their location recently.    We gave the distillery a shot, or tasting.  Of the 5 we tasted, none were remarkable.  If you like that \"moonshine\" taste, this is for you.  They've tried to infuse maple and peach into a couple of their distilled spirits, stir clear of those.  The shop was okay, typical winery gag signs, towels, Pinterest type stuff.  Quiet a few people were there enjoying the weather, which leads to this: Get More Waitstaff when it's busy.  Two ladies selling gift trinkets and doing a full bar of tastings is S L O W.  We couldn't get the person doing our tasting to come back and acknowledge us, so we dropped cash on the bar and walked out."

                "description": "I came here for the first time over the weekend with some out-of-town guests. I did enjoy the bottle of wine I bought, but the employees were not very helpful. I don't know much about wine, so I asked them to pick out the closest wine to Pinot Noir as that's usually what I drink. Now I at least know the difference between white wine and red wine, and was surprised that their response was for me to order a white wine...  The ambience is decent, but they are limited on their indoor seating which is a shame because I'm sure more people would come and enjoy the live music."

                "description": "The only reason this winery deserves three stars in my book is because it is located semi-underground as it is built into the side of a cave.  You can get the feel of voyaging underground without having to pay an extortionist fee for this privilege. You will not be seeing the stalagmites and stalactites. Nor will you find a sleeping bat.  However, you can get a little buzzed and feel a lot of hometown love- although you might want to turn a blind eye (and ear) when they try to explain where their grape varietals are from, or when they try to up-sell you into their wine club.  Another neat feature is a glass-cased collection of old and unique wine openers. Think of this place as a grown-up quirky museum with a corkscrew twist and you will not be disappointed."

                "description": "This winery opened up last week in Liberty HIll. A mere 18 minute drive north of Cedar Park, Thirsty Mule is bringing the wine country closer to home. The owners are the same owners as the popular Georgetown winery.   The building once was a home that was built in 1979 and before Thirsty Mule Owners got a hold of it, it sat empty for many years. The tasting room which is backed up to a cave is on a nice plot of land which backs up to a creek. The completely remodeled the building and now has a long bar, several tables for enjoying a glass of wine and a banquet room that can accommodate about 50. Outside they have lots of picnic tables shaded by tall trees.   The wine portfolio is well rounded. Currently they have 2 whites, 4 reds, 4 sweets and a dessert wine. We ordered a flight each which runs $10 for 4 tastings (2 ounce pours). You can also purchase a glass of wine for $7 or buy  bottle to enjoy on the property or to take home. Between the two of us we tried the Pinot Blanc, Cabernet, Merlot, Malbec, sweet blush (strawberry) and the dessert wine which is called sweet mule. My four favorites were the Pinot Blanc, Malbec, and Cabernet. The Pinot Blanc was fruit forward at first but has a dry finish. The Malbec had some spice to it, we liked this one enough that we bought a bottle. The Cabernet had hints of bell pepper both on the nose and by taste. The blush makes for a good patio sipper but a tad sweet for my liking.   They plan to have live music soon and the patio is dog friendly. We had a great time meeting Scott during our tasting and enjoyed the tasting. If you stop in make sure to peak out the windows to get a glimpse of the limestone \"cave\" and the etched in date from the original owner."

                "description": "Pretty bad wine.  Nearly all of it.  I can't bring myself to go back.  I've gone to most of the pre-2007 wineries in Central Texas.  One star for the building.  The inside is really nicely laid out. One star for the impromptu musicians giving the patrons a nice selection of sounds.  Zero stars for the uneducated staff.  Seriously.....they rinsed my glass with water when going from white to red.  NoOOOOOOO!!!!  Don't do that!!!  I guess I didn't believe that after several reviews condemning that action, they still did it.  I would have protected my glass a little better.  Did a white or two.  Not good Did the Tempranillo.....not good.  Much better at any other winery I've tried. The 'ports' were like syrup.  Now, I know that Port is going to be on the sweeter side.  But when it pours practically like corn syrup, then I just can't do that much sweet.  Disappointed.  I had hoped that a winery closer to my house would be a fun getaway.  Not.  I WILL still buy the ports at the shop in downtown Georgetown, though.  Those are good."

                "description": "After passing this winery on Highway 183 several times, my husband finally surprised me with a spur of the moment decision to stop. I was very curious about a central Texas winery that offers a Malbec. I was not disappointed. It is a dark inky glass with a nice strong spice. The finish is long and jammy. It is not the best Malbec I've ever had, but for a local Texas winery, I am impressed. The Malbec is what convinced me to purchase the membership. The Cabernet did not disappoint either.   The grounds are lovely and the underground tasting room is nice when it's not shoulder to shoulder crowded. Most wonderfully, this winery is pet friendly and welcomed my Chihuahua with open arms and a savory dog treat. She liked it there as much as I did. They also offer a vast array of vinegar and olive oils. I have not tried them yet, but it is on my 2016 to do list.   When I am craving a weekend in Fredricksburg, but can't get away, the Thirsty Mule Winery is the perfect way to spend a Saturday."

It is by far the best wine I have ever had. The scenery around the winery is beautiful, the staff is super friendly, and the wine is incredible and delicious. They have types of wine from the dry reds to some sweet white and there \"sweet dreams\" wine is to die for! Everything is reasonable priced and has impeccable quality. I have to say if you are looking for a beautiful place to hangout and drink some great wine. You have to check this place out and inquire about there wine club it is SO worth it."

It really does not look like much from the outside but my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try based on the reviews and we were not disappointed! We easily made a reservation on the website and came in at 2pm on a Saturday. They took out temperatures at the door and we were seated quickly.   We decided to go for the wine tasting first, 5 samples for $15 plus a stemless logo glass to take home! We really enjoyed trying the wines and enjoyed all of them. Our favorite was the Blanc du Bois because it was light and crisp but had a unique fragrant flavor from the floral notes and the apricot.   My only gripe was the reservation was only 45 minutes. I wish it could've been around an hour, we didn't get a chance to finish our wine or our charcuterie but it's not too big of a deal since we just took it back home. We also got another bottle of the Blanc du Bois to take home and they gave us a cute wine bag for the two bottles.   We will definitely be back again to try the rest of the wines!!"

Do not despair as you pull into the generic industrial park hard off of Anderson Mill Road in the CP. Walk-in past the small lobby area and step into their beautifully decorated tasting room.  Since we were the only patrons we received VIP treatment from start to finish.   We opted for their premium tasting menu and selected all reds. I'm not a TX wine fan but Dylan, our sommelier, expertly guided us through our tasting and as we concluded our wonderful stay my mind was changed.   My favorite was the Alexandar Valley Cab will more than suffice if you enjoy a big traditional Cab with a strong finish.   Their Spanish Mourvedre version is deep and rich and has a surprisingly strong finish,   There are a number of \"light\" reds as well. We were not fans but appreciated the flavor and balance of these wines.   Bent Oak does offer cheese plates and other small plates to accompany your tasting. Check their social media as they have live music on certain days.   Wonderful wine, an intimate setting, and passionate knowledgeable folks equals a 5 star experience."

                "description": "This was a real treat.  We looked for winery that was open before 4pm. We were staying in San Antonio and wanted to visit Austin TX. We found this place by searching best wineries near Austin. When we 1st arrived, it looked like a little store front in a strip mall. When we entered it was a whole different story. We were greeted by Debbie and Bryan who both turned out to be extremely gracious hosts.  They have wines grown in TX and CA. The TX grapes are grown in the High Plaines near New Mexico where it is warm during the day and cooler at night. I decided to do a tasting with only the TX wines.   The TX wine menu had 5 wines for the tasting menu. Started with the Chenon Blanc (quite nice with a buttery smoothness), proceeded to the Blanc de Bois, then the Roussanne (my least favorite), then switching to the reds starting with the Sangiovese and finally to the tempranillo.  The Tempranillo was my absolute favorite.    What really made this experience so nice was the wine Ambassador Debbie. She is just the nicest person who took good care of us. She also has a very nice sense of humor. Bryan was also very nice. He helped me pick out a few stainless steel wine stoppers. Bryan gave us great restaurant suggestions for Austin and San Antonio.  Do not be fooled with the entrance on the outside. It is misleading in the size and the value you receive on the inside."

                "description": "My experience with this winery has been amazing to say the least! Took two of my really good friends here today both who require wheelchair accessibility and felt very comfortable in the atmosphere. The reservation made ahead time was set up easily and the communication was quick and efficient through email. They were able to recommend a table that was best suited for us all to feel comfortable. It is very rare to actually be able to talk to the owners/wine makers about their products but they were the ones serving us the tasting! It really was a special experience not only for me but for my friends that have not gone out socially since the pandemic. Thank y'all so much for the inclusive atmosphere and making it such a memorable experience, we had a blast!"

                "description": "What a hidden gem! We were sitting at home on a Friday night, trying to find something to do. After a quick yelp search, we saw there was a winery up the street and open late. We decided to take a trip and check it out.  Driving up, you start to question if you are going the right direction but just keep going.   You walk in to this office center and are welcomed to the most friendly staff and environment.  Rarely do you get to sit down at a winery and speak to the head wine maker.   What really makes this place different is the fact that they have California and Texas wines. I'm no expert, but I've been told Texas grapes just don't compare.    The prices are great, and the options are plenty.  This will definitely be the family visit spot in the future."

                "description": "Wine: Only tried one wine, the tempranillo. It was fine, not as bold as they usually are. I smelled some of the whites, and they smelled very sweet so I passed. Didn't even look at pricing because of what the snacks cost.  Snacks: wow, expensive. Tried a bunch of them with a group, overall not worth the price. Particularly the truffles. It was $27 for a teensy box of 9 pieces of terrible chocolate. Waxy texture, did not melt when you eat it, chalky, bad flavor. Dark chocolate is my fave, so that's not the issue. Who knew chocolate could actually be yucky? It came from next door, glad we didn't go there after.   Service: very good, sweet ladies.  Ambience: not good. Outside it just looks like a store front, inside is super dark, no windows, and looks like a Kirkland's from the 90s.... everything is red, has fringe, pretty cheesy. Not eclectic, just ugly and full of stuff."

                "description": "Living in Austin, this winery is located in our backyard. It's nice to be able to drive just 20 minutes and enjoy a good glass of wine, and meet the people who made it. I now have a place for out of town guests just spending the weekend to take a sip of Texas wine.  They focus on creating quality wines sourced from Texas and California grapes.  They do not blend grapes sourced from the two states together.  When you drink a bottle of Texas sourced wine, it is 100% Texas, and vice versa. Bent Oak has been around for about 3 1/2 years, and from what I have heard they are starting to find their stride.   When you enter the space, you will walk through the front gift shop to the back tasting room and production area.  They have gone to amazing strides to make a warehouse space homey. It feels like a Texas hill country family home.  We were warmly welcomed, and they even let us take our three well behaved dogs into the back area to sit and enjoy a tasting with us.  Everyone here was friendly and knowledgeable.    I was pleasantly surprised by the consistent quality of all their wines available to taste.  You can taste up to five wines from their menu.  The Blanc Du Bois was one of my stand out favorites.  There wasn't anything I didn't like on the menu.  I am not a fan of Chardonnay's but their California sourced Chardonnay was good.  Their reds were a bit young, but the Mourvedre from the Texas High plains was tasty and my favorite of the current options.  Medium bodied but with spicy fruity rich tones.  The Sangiovese was satiny smooth, but just needed some time.  I actually enjoyed their Texas wines more than the California options.    Clearly there is a reason why their wine club membership has a waitlist.  It's just a great group of people to hang out with.  It felt like being with family, and enjoying a great conversation over a nice glass of wine.  They are located next to Delysia chocolates towards the back of a warehouse area.  Wine and chocolate neighbors?  Yep, it's an amazing pairing."

We finally mustered the courage to go have a look inside this warehouse looking building.  What an incredible surprise!  We were warmly greeted and led into the tasting room where our eyes grew wide with wonder.  Themed tables, lounging areas, decor and a scuttle of people enjoying some of the most spectacular wine ever!    Everyone in there was so nice and the server we had was very knowledgeable.  My daughter promptly made sure everyone knew I was celebrating the 20th anniversary of my 30th birthday!  Our wine expert quickly informed the wine maker \"John\" and he came over to wish me a happy birthday and give me a taste of a special \"not on the menu\" wine.  All I can say is every single wine we sampled (8 in total) was superb!  I walked out after buying 4 bottles and was extremely happy!"

                "description": "My daughter gave me the gift of her time, along with a 3-course meal and wine tasting, to honor a special occasion. We decided to make this a weekday outing, to minimize traffic and the possibility of large groups being at the winery.  We were promptly greeted and seated upon arrival. The dining room was largely empty, and we had superb service. This was our second visit to the winery, and we plan to return.   We tasted 7 wines in all, 3 of which were paired with the November menu of panzanella (a bread salad), fennel-crusted pork tenderloin, and cannoli. The wine pairings were excellent.   We were not big fans of the panzanella. It seemed to need additional ingredients to make it more interesting and less dry. The main course, however, was fabulous. The pork medallions were crusty and flavorful. The linguine accompaniment was wonderfully garlicky, making it almost possible to ignore that the pasta was overcooked. And the cannoli was excellent. I think of cannoli as a finger food; these mini cannoli were made pretty with their presentation but more messy to eat because of the chocolate sauce. The cannoli were served with a very good port wine.   All in all, we had a very nice meal and enjoyed the wines... which we drank. No spitting for us! We are not connoisseurs, but certainly enjoy good quality wine. Some of Flat Creek's are very good indeed.   This was not a cheap excursion, but the 2 hours we spent there were worth it. This would be a great place for a romantic date, and also worked well as a mother-daughter excursion. Flat Creek has other dining options that include pizza, and there's a disc golf course on the premises. Do make advance reservations for your visit, as this isn't a large establishment and can be a long (but pretty) drive from the Austin area."

Carmen was a priceless part of the already amazing experience, she was so friendly, enthusiastic and helpful! Ask for her to be your server if you can!

                "description": "It hurts me to write this review. We truly want every small business to thrive. My family and I went to the Vineyard on a Friday afternoon for an intimate celebration of my husband's birthday with our mom, dad and children, it ended in my 5-year old little one being verbally attacked by a man in the pavilion, who identified himself as 'the owner'.   We decided to try the disc golf course, and we loved our experience with Casey, he is a gem! Very knowledgeable about disc golf, and very accommodating. We let him and Madelyn (the owner's wife) know we were celebrating a birthday. The course was fun, but ridden with fire ants, red ants, sticker burs and bull nettle. It was not the polished experience we were expecting. But still fun for our family.   We finished disc golf, and returned to the pavilion around 6:00pm.  We ordered a large dinner, but since we were not offered to sit in the main seating area, we sat under the outdoor pavilion. We were in the pavilion for less than 5 minutes, and the adults arranged tables so our family could sit together (there is no waiter in the pavilion so we had to move tables on our own). During those few minutes my two small children were playing under the pavilion, not causing any harm or damage, just laughing and trotting around like kids do outside (he is 5 and she is 7).   Out of no where a man started verbally attacking my 5-year old. This man who looked to be in his 70s, was sitting at a table drinking bottles of wine with 2 other people. He continued to yell at the top of his lungs scaring me and my babies. They came running to me asking me why the man was yelling and whistling at them. It broke my heart. A complete stranger was attacking them for no apparent reason.   After protecting them, my dad and husband approached the man who was yelling the obscenities. This is when he identified himself as 'the owner'. He told us our children were 'out of control' and we needed to get them under control. I asked them what they were doing to display out of control behavior, and he didn't say a thing, besides he had guests with him and they were disrupting his evening. My father let the man know if we were going to be patrons of his business, we would not tolerate his verbal abuse of our 5 and 7 year old children. My father also told him, \"We don't yell at our kids like that and if he had a problem with the way our children were behaving he could have stood up and walked over while we were arranging our own tables and told us in a normal tone of voice the problem he saw.\"  After the incident, the man sat at his table continuing to drink wine for 45 minutes, and sadly never came back to our table to apologize to our children for scaring them because of his obscene behavior. As we left, both of my children continued to asked why he was so angry.   We now understand this pavilion is in 'the owners' front yard. On this evening Rick (the owner) had been drinking with friends and our family was interrupting their evening. His behavior not only made us feel the most unwelcome as paying customers, but was abusive and completely out of control, especially as 'the owner'.  We should have been able to have this conversation with the business owner. Unfortunately, he left the pavilion to go back to his house, and did not return or offer an apology.  ***Update in Response to Owners Apology Below***  Your apology ends with 'resolve any confusion or fears the children had regarding why they were reprimanded'. The main point of why this experience was so horrifying: No one should ever reprimand a 5-year old child, except that child's guardians. If there was an issue with a child's safety, that concern should have been directed to the guardians who were standing between the children and the owner. Never should a stranger, much less a 70-year old man who is consuming alcohol ever 'reprimand' a child, ever! Of course of case the outcome was severe harm to the child, in this case, our 5-year old was not in severe danger.  Regarding the excuse that you 'witnessed dangerous behavior, and you had to immediately intervene': If there are components of your business that are dangerous to patrons, you should immediately remove these hazards, so that they don't become a safety issue. If you feel your deck boxes are not safe, you should store them in a storage facility where patrons do not have access.   Regarding your comment that 'you wish to leave discipling to parents but are forced to intervene when there is a safety concern': We were a party of 4 adults, and we were less than 10 feet away from our children. While we were bussing our own tables and arranging furniture, we were not aware my 5- year old sat on the 'deck box' and got down by jumping off. This type of 'danger' (i.e. sitting on a sitting area, and jumping off something that is no more than 2 feet off the ground) should not elicit the response of 'discipline' by a stranger, or 'immediate' intervention."

We started with wine tasting followed by a spectacular wine pairing with each course. We hadn't really considered Texas wine as equivalent to Calif wines but we were wrong. All of the wines we sampled were great and because of that we ended up heading home with 14 bottles! The owner even stopped by to ask us about our experience which we gladly shared. Definitely worth experiencing this adventure."

                "description": "My husband and I were staying in Marble Falls for a few days and this winery was suggested. Flat Creek Winery had a nice outdoor patio.  The inside seating was small and very loud so we chose to sit outside.  There was only one guy taking orders.  He was very nice and tried his best.  But, he needed help. My husband and I each chose wine tasting (we got 4 samples, but we didn't get to choose what we wanted to try), a glass of wine, and a pizza. We got our wine tasting and glass of wine immediately. We waited about 45 minutes before we got our pizza.  The pizza was delicious, but our wine was already gone.  Probably will not go back."

The 4 of us did the pizza and tasting package which is the way to go! Sherry was delightful and chose our wines based on what WE like, not a set list. The chicken Florentine and the sundries tomato artichoke pizza are both recommendations. 10 out of 10"

Beautiful location and building. Plenty of parking.   Inside tables by reservation only. Nicely separated, no issues being close to other guests. Not the same for reception or table service.  Server was pleasant, but had zero concept of social distancing, no mask and was right in our faces each time we had an interaction.   Menu/tasting a little confusing. Basically you prepay $40 each and get whatever you want from the menu, including wine to drink there or to go. Most wines were available for tasting pours, but not all. Some wines good, some not so much. Liked the primitivo the most of the many we tried.   Very nice for the setting and service. Great set up for limited capacity, but they really need to work on wait staff protection."

The baked Brie was great, but the \"roasted\" Brussel sprouts were truly just steamed and served on a sizzling cast iron skillet -- definitely NOT roasted. It honestly was a let down as \"roasted\" truly didn't mean roasted. The wine was great, service was great.... But food was just mediocre for the price."

During a weekend getaway to the Marble Fallas area from Dallas, we planned a day of wineries in Hill Country and Flat Creek was at the top of our list based on recommendations from friends. We wanted to experience the 3-course lunch but due to social distancing rules, reservations were hard to come by. We figured we'd take our chances and arrive as soon as they opened, and we were in lunch! We were able to be seated indoors right away by Madeleine who was just a delight! There was just one other party enjoying lunch, so we felt very catered to. Our server, David was also wonderful.  Even after our lunch, Madeleine brought us over to the outdoor patio area and gave us a couple of complimentary tastings of her a few of her fave white wines.  Hands down, our best winery experience. We bought two bottles and will be back soon!"

However this past Friday, the owner and staff went way over and above! Our son wanted to propose to his girlfriend and he wanted it to be a surprise! She loves pizza and wine so we \"planned\" that day to have a late lunch at the winery. It had been inclement out the previous few days and the day of the weather was looking iffy. The staff worked with us on a variety of scenarios just in case. The afternoon turned up sunny and warm! We were to \"meet up\" them a little later so they headed to the winery for lunch. The chef made a heart-shaped pizza (one of the surprises) and the staff came up with the idea of putting the ring into a small to-go box so he could bring it to the table without her knowing. I had also dropped off a bouquet of flowers for staff to bring out after he had proposed to her. The photographer found a great vantage point, the pizza was made, he picked it up along with the ring, he set the pizza down on the table and opened it, got on his knee and proposed to her! After she said yes and they hugged and cried a bit, the staff brought out the bouquet, we showed up and the photographer took more photos, onlookers awww'd and cheered! It was really an over and above day for everyone working at Flat Creek Estate! Thank you for helping to make my son's proposal so special!"

Flat Creek is a special place for us as we saw the sign for it during our Miata club drive back in 2007. I contacted them a few days later, set up a tasting for the club, a bunch of us drove out there and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The vineyard itself and the architecture are fantastic, and it has grown a lot since they opened.   Everyone who works there is extremely friendly and helpful, the food was always tasty, they have a lot of fun events, and the wines are truly delicious.   We enjoyed it so much that we kept going back, became friends with the owners, and got married there in 2011. Flat Creek was very accommodating as we wanted it to be on a specific date that was the Sunday after Thanksgiving, and they made it work.  Our wedding video showcases the vineyard extremely well so if you want to watch it, you can click here. https://vimeo.com/34645652 We are biased of course, but our friend did an amazing job on it and we love to revisit it."

They don't advertise on the Texas Hill Country Wineries website (where I normally research wineries to visit) so I was very lucky to come across it. Really great wines and super friendly staff. Not to mention a ridiculously sweet winery dog named Blondie. Misty took great care of me and I had a lovely time sitting on the property enjoying a glass with my picnic lunch."

We did a red tasting and loved all 5 of the wines! Our favorites were the first and last! Everything ranges from a Pinot to a heavy cab... they have charcuterie broads to munch on while tasting. They also have live music on certain days... The vibes were friendly and so relaxing! Ashton was super friendly and knowledgeable about the wines. She made our whole visit pleasant with her bubbly personality.  We will be back this weekend to hang out more and drink more wine!  Everyone inside behind the bar was nice and friendly! Super refreshing since we live in the city. Texas hospitality at its finest. My husband had so many questions about the origin of every wine and sweet Ashton took her time answering all the questions and didn't once act bothered or in a hurry. Thanks Ashton! We will be back!"

Now, at the moment their wines are imported mostly from California as their crops are coming in and from what I understand they lost their crop to the snow storm this year ... it was still good wine!

Texas wine is much like people's opinion of Paris, France: you either love it, or you abhorrently hate it. With that being said, this vineyard is loved and adored by my family. The staff is welcoming and down to earth...unlike some tasting rooms, that we've been to, that judge us based on how we pronounce vognier (pronounced vin-yay) we say: Vog-Nerrr. The charcuterie board is seasonal and contains goodies from patrons who hunt and family members who dabble is chocolate making. Come and sit out back with the beautiful tree and take tons of Instagram pictures to show off to all of your friends. 7 Lakes is a firm 10/10. Come for the tasting, and stay for the chocolate and red Zinfandel.  Update: I went to the bathroom, note to self..drink more water, and they have Meyers hand soap and lotion! Some may shrug and say, \"so what?\" But those that understand what Meyers is, will appreciate what I'm saying :)"

                "description": "With soft openings since July, this tucked away jewel located north of Bertram is going to stand out as a top quality fine wine destination in the northern Texas Hill Country.  Jerry and Janis Horne's path to a winery career began many years ago with a casual conversation and visits to California wineries. That passion and love for what they do has matured into a beautiful estate vineyard and wine tasting room. The vineyard itself has been a work-in-progress for that last two years.  They currently have about seven acres (hmm, seven again...) of grape vines with a mix of Mourvèdre , Tannat, Vermentino, Alicante Bouschet and Souzao planted.  Tasting some of the grapes from the Souzao vines was an 'OH MY' and then some experience! Bob Young and Ron Yates are some of the winemakers helping them out on their first start.  Current wine selections have grapes sourced from California and Texas.  For the whites, the 2017 Chardonnay (Lodi) is aged in stainless still and exhibits great minerality, good acids, and a clean crisp taste! For reds, 2017 Mourvedre is sourced from the Texas High Plains AVA and shows off some great earthy notes. If you like Zinfandel, then you'll do somersaults over this Lodi 40+ year old-vine 2016 vintage. It smooths out quite well with lingering notes of jam.  Got Alicante Bouschet?  7 Creeks does with their 2017 High Plains release. The garnet color is wonderful to gaze at with a touch of leather aftertaste. Don't forget to also try their Alta Mesa AVA sourced Souzao.  If you love red wines and appreciate great meat parings, the 2015 Souzao vintage will have you hooked!  Scheduled for release in the fall, will be a Tannat, a Muscat Blend, and a superb Syrah Rose'....worth a return trip! And what's a quality wine tasting with the bubbles? The 2014 Cuvée Blanc de Blanc is sourced from Lodi Chardonnay and made in the \"Méthode Champenoise\" way.  You can taste the greatness in every bubble! With some nice estate homes being built nearby, as well as, proximity to the booming Liberty Hill area, wine traffic will not be a problem here.  Stop by and enjoy their great hospitality!"

What a surprise when our friend was denied to have a beer( he brought it before with the staff permission). Manager and waiter approached us in louder voice. Our friend decided to leave and when passed along the waiter, he said our friend spitted on him! I doubted! He suffers from aphasia and is unable to speak! The waiter acted in the most unprofessional manner and told us to leave the place! He was rude, and humiliated us in front of other visitors!  It was my worst life experience ever! Please, be careful when you choose to have a beautiful day at this winery! It is a very unpleasant place!"

There were lots of empty tables but I thought people must have reservations. We were seated in a room with wine barrels everywhere. We were the only ones there. We were brought water and the server said she'd give us time to look over the menu. Another lady was seated in the room. We told the server we were ready to order. She walked away. A few minutes later she seated a group of ladies        She ignored us. She came back to the group of ladies and took their order ignoring us and the other lady that was seated after us. We had been waiting 20 minutes. We gave her another 5 minutes and walked out. The other lady that was seated after us walked out also. She got tired of being ignored also."

                "description": "Beautiful property and friendly staff but do not go until the renovations are completed.  You will be disappointed in the limited menu and seating.  Also, if you are a first timer, NEVER order wine by the glass.  We did and at $14/glass for their cab, the pour looked light.  We ended up buying a bottle, taking it back to the room and pouring each glass exactly to the fill line they use.  We got just barely shy of 6 glasses out of one bottle!!  It is ridiculous that they are charging $14/glass and pouring under 5 ounces.   If you end up drinking a full bottle by the glass, you are paying about $80/bottle.  As nice as the property and staff are, we will not be back because of how they are cheating guests without their knowledge.  If you want to make it right, either change the glasses or put the exact pour on the menu."

They had great meeting space for a group of 12 and we had the necessary AV/ conference call support one would expect for meetings.   However all the other benefits are what made this place stand out. First, we got to stay overnight and the rooms are stunning. They are super comfortable and look very high end, and the morning and night views are amazing.   Second, the food is fabulous. The chef is top top notch. Seriously every meal was amazing. Fresh, seasonal, tasty...did I mention it was amazing?  Third, the grounds are stunning. The patios, walking trails, picnic areas, outdoor spaces and the pool area are gorgeous. This place has a country feel to it, so it's perfect if you need a break from the city and it's not a far drive from Austin.   Finally, our team building activities were so fun!  We had a private wine tour and tasting. We also had a team building \"cook your own dinner\" event and it was so fun. The main chef was there to teach us and of course the food was amazing.   While my first visit was work related during the week, they do offer brunch, wine tastings and tours. They also have a stone oven pizza that smells heavenly when it's fired up with pizzas. I am definitely coming back with my girlfriends for brunch!  Give it a try!  I think you will love it."

                "description": "My husband and I visited the Vineyard at Florence last weekend while we were visiting family in Georgetown. They had given us good reviews about the place, so we were excited to try it. Upon arriving, we were thrilled about the beautiful buildings and landscape surrounding the vineyard. As we walked inside, things took a turn for the worst. There were about 5 people standing around the bar talking. A women with pink hair (I assume the bartender) was standing behind the bar with another worker(a man with a beard) leaning over the bar WHILE SHE WAS RUBBING HIS HEAD! I was immediately disgusted, not only by the unsanitary action but also by how unprofessional this was. A young girl walked over and sat us, and I watched through the window as the bartender made drinks after without washing her hands. We ordered a bottle of wine, so we didn't have to worry about her dirty hands making us drinks (although our server, a tall man, WHO WAS GREAT, offered us the new house cocktails). The food was great, the wine was delicious, and our server won us over, so we would try again, but the staff needs to be trained on both professionalism and health codes."

We especially liked the gym and the pool facilities.  They had a limited menu because the restaurant is under renovation. However, the food (and wine) was delicious.  Every staff member we interacted with was pleasant. The waitress that served us for dinner and breakfast was fantastic and gave good recommendations.  I would like to come back in the spring or fall when it is not too hot so I can explore more of the property. Keep up the great work!"

The Hostess was very confused and keep trying to seat my party outside on a picnic table in the hot sun.  It was not crowded therefore I was confused on why they would not work with me.  They finally set my party outside.  The wine is great and the menu for food is slim and very costly.  I will not go back."

They said kids are more than welcome, and they have small bites to eat until their full menu becomes available in 2 weeks. So we hopped in the car and drove 45 minutes to get there, only to be told that the entire property was closed to the public for a wedding and there was nothing at all available for non-wedding guests. If you've ever been a parent to hangry toddlers after a 45 minute drive, you'll know how upset this made us. It's a beautiful property and we were looking forward to spending some time here, but this has left an awful taste in our mouth and has de-railed our entire day, so we will certainly never be returning."

I was really looking forward to the charcuterie board. My friends and I ordered 3. I saw them all come out with everything on them. One of the guys working there said they had to box them up for picnic seating. That's fine but when we got back to our picnic table I realized the olives and Brie cheese were missing from all of our orders even though they were on the plates before being boxed up (which took an extra ten minutes). When I went back to ask I was told they ran out. I mentioned they were on our plates to begin with and then I was told \"yea but it was a small amount.\" I was then walked away from. I guess they decided to put part of our order on someone else's plate that was getting more formal service. Considering we were the first ones to order  and paid the same price as any customer, it was pretty crappy.  We also paid $10 per slice of quiche and it was super tiny."

They have a delicious selection of red wines, white wines, only 1 dessert white wine, and sangria.  They also have a café that serves pizzas, cheese boards, and more.  We sat in the back where there was a live band performing, rolling hills for the backdrop, and a nice breeze during a hot, humid summer day!  Perfect!"

The last couple of visits, the cheese tray has become smaller. Less interesting g, and 100% skimpy. Today's wine tray, now on a much smaller board, was a sincere rip off at $20.   Wine club free glass of wine each visit perk has now dwindled to a glass of wine (simplified selection) at $5/glass.   They are clearly having financial problems or simply greedy, and do not value their guest experience. No more will I recommend. Asked hubby to cancel the wine club: I gave sour grapes. There are WAY too many wineries to choose from."

Accommodations were clean and upscale, worth staying the night for sure.  We liked all the wines, especially the whites, rose' and the Cab's.  And food was simple choices, but solid.  However, they are renovating a main building that I belive might be house an expanded the menu.The rolling  vineyard with tuscan buildings was a great setting.

The wine tasting was nice. The tour isn't really worth it in my opinion as it seems it was al about trying to get people to book the venue rather than giving us a history of the wines. We took a tour in Napa valley and this one was vastly different. So don't do the tour but definitely do the wine!"

Met an old friend here tonight who I haven't seen much since she moved to Austin while I was here for a work trip and we had a fantastic time!  The wines are tasty and the winery has some great indoor and outdoor seating with fantastic views, way up on a hill. Definitely go check them out!  I've also reached out to the management to see if I can get wines shipped back to my home state of Georgia!!!"

We hung out outside and enjoyed the beautiful weather while watching the lovely scenery. We ordered the center cut ribeye and it did not disappoint. Also, best truffle mashed potatoes I have ever had! Adrian, the Chef, was beyond magnificent- he took the time to listen and we really enjoyed his cooking and conversation"

Great spot for couples, and also pet friendly (saw some families with their dogs). Would come back!   Of note, during the afternoon there might be some mosquitoes in the outdoor area, but they were kind enough to provide us with insect repellent."

                "description": "When we first arrived here, it was a bit confusing on where we were allowed to park as there were to signs indicating a designated place for cars - we ended up just driving all the way up the hill and parking alongside the roundabout next to the entrance of the winery cabin.   We had a reservation for right when they opened, and luckily so - it became extremely busy later on in our visit, so be mindful if you're planning on coming here that it's popular!   Staff is extremely friendly and attentive - they accommodated our group and let us even switch some tables around since we were the first there.   El Gaucho has a smaller wine list than other wineries I've been to, but they also had a food menu that was unique to others.   Provoleta ($12.50, +prosciutto $2.00): Comes out on a hot skillet plate with some slices of bread on the side. Really flavorful in provolone, obviously, but the chimichurri gives a nice addition to the dish. Felt like the addition of prosciutto wasn't worth, however.   Empanadas (2pc - $12.50): They have an option between beef empanadas, or a black bean and plantain empanada. I tried both and they were delicious in their own ways. Some people may stray away from the non-meat option, but I quite liked it! I believe they served this with the same chimichurri that was on top of the Provoleta.   Light Flight  1. Chardonnay: Their description is 100% correct, if you don't prefer Chardonnay, you might change your mind after trying this! Super light and refreshing, really easy finish. 2. Chardonnay Reserve: Huge jump from the Chardonnay - seemed to taste more full.  3. Malbec Rose: Really great end to tie the first two together, the sweetness is subtle but still noticeable.  They have a lovely outdoor courtyard/backyard patio where more seating is available, but unfortunately the day we went, it had just rained meaning most chairs were wet. I would highly recommend trying to come on a sunny day as I think it'd be beautiful!"

Honestly, I wouldn't spend the money on it, nor ever come here  again. There was only one lady working and no one helped us out at all.  They were originally going to set up something \"special\" since it was our honeymoon and it was not special at all. They were charging us $175 for literally a bottle of cheap champagne and a bowl of crackers and cheese. For what we paid for and what we got I don't recommend it at all."

With out-of-town guests, no rain date, florals, and catering coming hell or high water, we had to roll with it.  I can't say enough good things about the team and how we worked together over a couple of weeks.  Everything from planning to last-minute setup changes (from the outdoor patio to the covered patio) and serving exceeded my expectations. Their willingness to do whatever they could to make our rainy day 25 person event a success and smile while they were doing it was phenomenal and refreshing. Our guests had a good time and loved the wine!"

Contact them about setting up a tour for a really unique, awesome winery experience. They wines were great and cheaper than if you go further down 290 to Fredericksburg.

Owners are also on site and so knowledgeable. It's hard to meet people that are so dedicated to high quality grapes and quality oak. I've been to a few wineries around lake Travis and this one is my favorite by far. The wines are dry wines. They are not sweet!  Definitely worth a drive here!"

The chenin blanc and rose had enough buttery and/or spicy notes to be enjoyed during the winter. Their reds are impressive as well. We liked the Temptation. They do tastings and will throw together a mean cheese board. The day we went we got a spicy pepper jack that was lovely. There's plenty of outdoor seating, abs that's where you really want to be to soak up the Hill Country views."

The staff are laid back and not pushy. We usually enjoy one bottle on their awesome deck. It sports views of the hill country and on a nice day is tough to beat. They also allowed us to bring our own snacks and set up our own charcuterie board. This is a major plus for me as some wineries don't allow this. Don't change this please; for me it easily earns 2 stars on its own.  Really can't think of anything bad to say. Great experience and hoping to make a third visit!"

They are wine lovers so my siblings and I wanted to take them on a wine tour discovering what the hill country has to offer.  We came across this winery after searching numerous lists and reviews, and can I say we were more than delighted by our experience.  From the start we were amazed at the breathtaking location.  The cliff side view evoked a sense of peace and tranquility that we thoroughly enjoyed while sampling the delicious wines. Chip had such an infectious personality introducing us to the different blends while also interweaving many funny anecdotal stories related to each bottle.  It was a very different experience from other tastings, where our guide gave a more dry delivery of the wine selection not invoking as much feeling toward specific blends.  Not only was Chip a great ambassador for your vineyard, but the pièce de résistance was Doug's tour of the barrel room.  Doug's breadth of knowledge and true passion for wines made us appreciate more not only the wine but the vineyard as well.  It is always so exciting for us when we encounter other individuals who have such heartfelt passion for what they do.  We were a captivated audience from start to finish, and truly felt like we were talking to an old friend about our love for wine.  The years of hard work and family incorporated into growing the winery shows and was so refreshing to witness.  We drove back home and couldn't seem to stop talking about the winery and how great of a time we all had. My parent's loved the trip and now have a wonderful memory for their anniversary.  We've already been discussing future trips to come and enjoy dinner in the barrel room, so we will definitely be back!"

                "description": "They say getting there is half the fun! That's definitely true of Hawk's Shadow Winery, accessible only by narrow ranch roads that wind through some of the prettiest parts of Texas Hill Country.  The end of the drive is just as pretty - the patio offers plenty of shaded tables with sweeping views of the surrounding hills.  Since it was 100º when we visited, we opted to sit in the equally impressive, air-conditioned tasting room with high ceilings and glass doors that roll up in more temperate weather.   The premium tasting will set you back $14 for six wines.  I enjoyed the white wines the best.  The 2016 Juliette Riesling and 2015 Luna de Oro orange Muscat blend were both clear and crisp. The 2014 Temptation tempranillo was on the hazy side.  My server also gave me a bonus tasting of the 2013 Wild Child, a syrah blend that I really liked.  I ended up taking a bottle home."

                "description": "I wanted to visit Hawk's Shadow due to the highly rated reviews on Yelp. Could this place really be as good as they all say?! It is! It just may be my new favorite winery around Dripping Springs/Driftwood.  TASTING: Tasting menu offered good balance of 3 whites + 3 reds ($14 for 6), all distinct in flavor. All were high quality - smooth, dry, great finishes and easy to drink. I was impressed with every single one! The Cab Blend (Fortitude) was my fav. Pours were a decent size and several different people served us; each gave a detailed flavor profileandhistory on the wine, which I always appreciate. What I enjoyed here that is different from other wineries is that they give you time to enjoy your tasting and savor each wine. Not once did we feel rushed. It was relaxing to simply chill on the patio, feel the nice breeze, take in the view, and slowly sip while chatting.   ATMOSPHERE: 10/10. Its a bit of a drive and more secluded than other wineries in area, but SO worth! Views are top notch. You can enjoy the panoramic picturesque Hill Country backdrop from indoors (glass windows from top to floor) or outside on the covered shaded patio. You feel like you're out in the middle of the country on a nice retreat away from the hustleandbustle of the city.   SERVICE: From the initial email where I made a reservation to the minute I left the winery, I felt well taken care of. Hawk's Shadow offers excellent customer serviceanda warm family feel. Staff is really friendly, courteous and engaging. I loved the personal touch of the owners walking around to greet customers/chat- definitely tops other wineries in terms of service.   Everyone in our group loved Hawk's Shadow and I will definitely be back. They offer the same gorgeous panoramic views as Driftwood Estate Winery (arguably, even better), but have WAY better wineandservice. So, if you're thinking about checking out Driftwood Estates, skip the crowds and check out this hidden gem instead!"

Service was great, everyone seemed helpful and knowledgeable. The dog was hilarious, he kept coming by and looking for food. The atmosphere was relaxed and very conducive to enjoying a nice glass of wine. We enjoyed the Tempranillo and suerte rojo. They had a great selection of wines. Definitely recommend."

                "description": "The greatest hospitality! Feel like I just allowed to get tips, education and experience without being put down. So many of the \"wine road 290\" wineries feel they are too busy or prestigious to speak common \"wine\" language. Not here! We called ahead, as recommended by website. The GPS was accurate. A beautiful hilly route- just trust it!!! We were greeted -Sunday afternoon-as the Hawk shadow team was just cleaning up after a grape stomp. They invited us in to the warehouse to see the 14 vats at different stages of processing. It was very interesting to see the D stemming and the foam on the top of the juice. Sam then gave us a tasting. $16 for 4 wines and $20 for 6 wines.  Very Good blends with the different combinations from regional wines and Canadian Texas grapes. I loved the \" tuck under \" cellar. You take the spiral stairs down to the basement to get the \"barrel room\" experience.  The name Hawk Shadow is very heartfelt as well. The winery is named after their horse, hawk shadow who passed away in 2007.  In addition to the very spacious tasting room they have two different levels of patios and you can have awesome events there as well overlooking the beautiful Hill country. It's really worth the drive from San Antonio. Thank you Sam and Hawk shadow. I wish more wineries would realize that your total experience is based on not only the taste of their wines but how you are treated! Thanks and we'll definitely be back!"

                "description": "My new BFF.  A friend suggested we stop by while we were in the area.  This vineyard exceeded all my expectations; what a wonderful experience we had. Perfect patio for sitting and sipping some of the best wine Texas has to offer. We sipped a good deal and it was all great. Had a hard time choosing what was coming home with us.  This just ensures that we have to come back to get the rest, and then some. Barbara was a gem, very knowledgeable and easily shared that knowledge.  Sam , another asset to the team; great enthusiasm for his craft.  Chip is a delight, and I must say best shirt award! If you are in the area, this is a must; you will be glad you visited"

                "description": "If you want to get your Irish on...or just get it on with wine and spirits I can think of no better place and space than Flanigan's.  We recently stopped there because of curiosity and commonality.   You see my wife's maiden name shares the unique spelling of Flanigan, usually written as Flanagan.  What's in a name?  Everything!     The warm and open interior belies Flanigan's outward warehouse like appearance.   Turns out the space was a set location for The Newton Boys, repurposed to look like a 1930's era hotel.  Yes, you too can walk in the footsteps of Matthew McConaughey!  Beyond the atmosphere in abundance the lovely Mrs. G reports the wine was fabulous, good enough to compel her to buy two bottles of their Chardonnay.  We shared a deliciously diverse cheese plate, reasonably priced at $14.00.    The venue offered live music with a troubadour alternating between Irish folk songs and cowboy tunes from trail.  So if you find yourself somewhere between Liberty Hill and Llano, consider a stop at Flanigan's in Bertram.  Flanigan's is fantastic!"

                "description": "The Grandmas are working their way through the Texas Hill Country Winery Map and are having the time of our lives.  Recently, we went \"off map\" and discovered a delightful gem, Flanigan's in Bertram, TX.  Flanigan's was built in 1904 and still has intact its beautifully crafted grand staircase.  The rest of the building contains movie set modifications from the movie, \"The Newton Boys\", which starred Matthew McConaughey.   The true charm of Flanigan's is Ted, who lead the guided wine tasting.    Through most of the wine tastings we have tried so far we have gotten the run of the mill run down of the various wines and then left on our own.  Ted led us through an informative and delightful wine tasting experience.  We learned the history behind each wine as well as the shape of the glass can alter the taste of the wine, (riedel.com/en-us/shop) which is something we has not learned in our previous wine tasting adventures. Ted also told us about the history of the wine, the story behind each wines name, history of the building, the movie that was shot there, and so much more.    We also were delighted to met the owners of Flanigan's, Drs. Kevin and Dana Flanigan, and had the pleasure of spending a few moments with them talking about their business and our mutually favorite vacation spot, Alaska.  Unlike other wine tasting venues, Flanigan's also offers a guided Spirit tasting which one \"regular\" sitting at the bar near us warned, \"It will put you on the floor\".  Flanigan's also serves custom cocktails and tasty, made in house appetizers and sandwiches.  Be sure to treat yourself to a wine tasting paired with a special Sunday Dinner.   Take a look at their menu here: flaniganspirits.com/wp-c...  Flanigan's is a must visit for wine or spirit lovers. While you are there make sure to ask Dana about the significance of the hummingbird in their logo and found throughout the building.  don't forget to go upstairs to checkout the Hollywood set modifications and to checkout the cozy lounging nooks.  We simply have not experienced a better wine tasting venue than Flanigan's."

                "description": "Fantastic place, and while we came for the local potato based spirits we got a lot more than we expected.   Old fashioned decor and historied (get them to tell you about how the place started). Nice little flower and herb garden out front. We came on a Friday around 5 so it was pretty quiet.   We ordered the spirit flight and an Irish Whiskey Smash (tasty!). Our server (who was the head gardener as well - neat!) was personable, professional, and very knowledgeable while he guided us through the flight of neat/bloomed/rocks tastings. We also talked with one of the Flanigans on the liquors themselves when we had some more in depth questions on the processes and techniques. Ask about their water and filtering!  We've been burned with some Texas distillers and winemakers before, and with something so unique I frankly was expecting a semi-pretentious bust. But this is great stuff and a good price to boot. Give them a try if you're in the area!"

The whiskey was delicious, unfortunately is was a Sunday and we couldn't purchase a bottle. The food smelled great! We just had breakfast so we had an appetizer that was perfect for us.  Highly recommend. Also, there is a market beside the distillery that is very cute. I got some plants from there."

We were greeted by Kevin and Dana Flanigan (owners) as we walked up up to the beautiful old-fashioned wood bar and the beautiful surroundings of the former home of the Griffith Lumber Company, where you get lost in time with the a slight feel of the old west.  Quit an exquisite location, where the owners made us feel special that included a lesson in fine wine tasting by Kevin that will forever leave a lasting impression on us.  We have been to wineries all over the US, but Flanigan's is by far the best one thus far.  Just a short driving distance from our home north of Austin, we will definitely bring our friends and family for wine and a snack.  A hop and a skip just northwest of Austin, it is a must visit location."

                "description": "Nothing like an early 20th century building in a small town to help set the mood for your wine tasting experience.  \"Iron Star Hall\" is the location of owner's Kevin and Dana Flanigan's winery.  Over the years, the two building sites have been a lumber store and post office.  It also served as a setting for the movie, \"Newton Boys\".  The interior is quite spectacular and does have that 1920's feel and look of the movie set hotel and bar. They've been opened since September of 2016 during the last Oatmeal festival and have been serving up some good wine and spirits along with some great story telling.  There are currently five wines available for tasting.  During your tasting session, Kevin will guide you through his sommelier experience and make sure that your sight, smell, and tasting experience is well done.  Along the way, he may tell you some interesting stories and jokes to help keep things lively.  The 2015 Viaggio is a dry white blend of 50% Muscat Blanc and 50% Muscat Canelli.  It's loaded with citrus aromas and some tartaric acids.  Ironically, as you let it linger, it does smooth out for a nice finish.  The 2015 Rose' is made from Mourvedre.  It has honey and cranberry notes and is perfect for these 100+ degree days in Texas.  The Bear is a 50/50 Merlot and Sangiovese blend using old world style techniques.  It is tannic with a long finish.  The Slainte is a new world style of 35% Malbec, 35% Mourvèdre, 9% Petite Sirah, 12% Petite Sirah, 6% Tannat, and 3% Alicante Bouschet.  Everything but the kitchen sink, right? It is quite fruit forward with some tobacco notes and is well balanced.   Last is the Marmalada.  It's a sweet blend of Chenin Blanc, Viognier and Merlot.  Chilled, this makes a great light bodied wine that is smooth and refreshing and delightful for summertime sipping.  In addition to the wine tasting, there is a spirit tasting to do, as well.  Trust us, Kevin won't let you out without trying them.  We might have to setup a separate blog for these, but you will get the level of quality tasting experience as you do with the wine and some good stories from Kevin.  This is a nice addition to the Bertram area and is worth the stop on your way out to the Hill Country.  Cheers!"

                "description": "GF and I both came in at 1pm on a Saturday afternoon via a prior RSVP to meet Ron Yates himself and do a full tasting experience with him as our server. This experience was amazing!  The indoor tasting room is large and open, welcoming and chill. Adorned with many award-winning wines of theirs that number beyond what I could count.   We got front-of-house seats together and begin our tasting journey through several whites and reds and sparkling wines. After what had to be 10-12 wines, we honed our picks down to the 'cabernet claret' for my GF and the 'tandem' red for me. However, not one of the wines we tried did we both truly feel we hated or disliked. Normally 1-2 are an easy pass but frankly, every wine we had was very good. My GF prefers sweeter wines across the board so the fact that nearly every wine she had still pleased her was saying something.  Ron was a top-notch host and server for us. His passion and love for wine is all but very clear in his conviction to his craft, knowledge of wine science and methodology, history of the business origins, name creations and labels to the wine bottles... all of it is an adventure with him as the animated storyteller of his wines and how the grapy goodness in the bottle got there and what you can expect to experience when it hits your lips.  I have to mention that they host an annual chili cook-off event every last Saturday of Feb with live music, 15+ chili contenders, and wine tasting all day long. It's their most successful event to date each year. When he spoke of that I made plans to be there for that for sure!  Ron and the team have a solid handle on this wine thing that is for darn sure! We only barely looked over the vineyard grounds so next time we come back, its gonna be charcuterie board, wine and time out in the vines for sure!"

                "description": "I am working on a plan to visit all of the Hill Country wineries at some point. I purchased the Christmas Wine Passport to help me with this in December, and Spicewood was one of the vineyards I passed through. The experience was good. The facilities were beautiful, and it was a peaceful place to chill and relax. I got there shortly after opening, and there was only one other couple there, so I was able to get my tastings quickly and easily. The wines were good, especially their dry sparkling, but I was not moved to come home with anything. The selection I was offered was more heavy on bolder reds, and as a matter of preference I would rather have a good mixutre of reds and whites. Nevertheless, this wouldn't be a place I'd cross off my list. Their tempranillos were quite tasty, and I did like their dry sparkling wine."

Beautiful outdoor patio seating or you can sit inside. They have 2 tasting menus to choose from for $15 each. Hubby went for the bold reds. They don't have all white tasting but our amazing server let me taste all the sparkling wines which was so fun! The sparkling Chardonnay was my favorite. Hubby's favorite was independence and tandem.  They have charcuterie boards ($25)  or you can bring your own food. We got the charcuterie board and had a great selection of cheese."

                "description": "Upon arrival at this gem a couple years ago, we had our doubts. The few Texas wines we had tried were subpar in our view. Spicewood's offerings opened a whole new chapter in our wine lifestyle upon completing that first visit.  When we first entered their tasting room, we noticed a plethora of wine award medallions on display. Being a volunteer on the Houston Rodeo, I was especially pleased to see many Rodeo Houston awards. But that wasn't all - Spicewood has awards from wine contests all around the country! Hmmmmm...  As we proceeded through our tasting, we were immediately impressed. Texas wine? This good? Yes, indeed! So good, in fact, that I joined their wine club without hesitation and remain a member to this day.   We visited again yesterday and enjoyed complimentary tastings of six nice wines and picked up our wine club orders from the past couple of quarters. We sat on their patio overlooking the vineyard and remarked how we are so happy to have found this spot. Oh, and the people working here are gracious and genuinely friendly.  Spicewood is a tad off the beaten path, but definitely worth the trek."

We came out on a Sunday morning got a couple of tables for our family and did the $15 tasting--6 pours but all around 14% Alcohol. Most are only sold on site from what I heard.  Great for families. Nice slow pace; bring whatever food you want they welcome it."

Of course things were a little different with Covid going on but everything was spaced out and carefully planned out for everyone's safety. When we arrived Ron was in the porch helping the guests with their wine selections. He is always very nice and makes everyone feel at home. It's always nice when the owner with everything he has to do remembers your names. After our picnic we got to sit in the Wine Cellar which was awesome. Highly recommend visiting, enjoying the scenery and trying out all the great tasting wines.   Hats off to Ron and Crew!   Adrian and Cyndi"

We love wine and enjoy going to new areas to try tastings so was really excited to try this place based on their reviews but my husband and I were sadly disappointed.   I will say however that they do have an option for an estate tasting that goes for $30 which could be amazing but we decided to pass on it."

                "description": "Hmm...it has taken me over a week because I hate to say something bad about someone's business. Last Monday we stopped here after a fantastic visit to Marble Falls. We felt...tolerated...at best. We were met by 3 huge dogs who barked incessantly upon our arrival and throughout the visit. When the host finally came out he didn't offer up options for the tastings like we've experienced at other wineries. I'm pretty clear on what I like and had some ideas of wines I'd like to try with the intent of buying enough bottles to make a case of assorted bottles upon departing. The owner, who has great reviews on Yelp, either wasn't there or was busy. We didn't see this person. But we pushed through the tasting, cut it a bit short, and left much, much sooner than we'd ever imagined we would. My intuition upon arrival was to just leave. We should have done that.  This is our experience. And it just wasn't pleasant. We were the only guests yet felt we were in the way.  Hopefully, for others, their visits will be more aligned with this place's other more positive reviews."

                "description": "This vineyard has a broad range of varietals for producing their many wines.  Some are very surprising like their Tempranillo Rose, Mourvedra, Cab, and Pinot.   Since they seemed to blend grapes from outside of Texas with estate, gives their wines a different character than most I've tasted from Calif and Washington for the same grape varietal.    For non-wine items to consider, the staff is super friendly and knowledgeable, dog friendly, indoor and outdoor seating with a nice babbling brook adjacent.   They do have an event facility and would make a nice venue for any type of occasion.  They have a hearty cheese plate that won't disappoint.  I would not use the spicy cheese however."

                "description": "I was pleasantly surprised by Spicewood Vineyards.  Spicewood was originally founded by the Manigolds.  Their vision was to make wine only from estate grown grapes. They were smart when they planted their vineyard.  They analyzed the soil and only planted grape varieties that would thrive in their soil.  Nine of the original 17 acres planted by the Manigolds are still producing fruit. For Texas that means something. That means wine sourced from grapes growing on vines that are now 24 plus years old.  Ron Yates took over from the Manigolds and is now the owner of Spicewood, and with wine maker Todd Crowell is making some good Texas sourced wines.  They now have thirty two acres planted on site, and partner with other Texas grape growers.    I like that the tasting room is a bit off the common path. That means it is away from the hustle and bustle of other Hill Country wineries.  The tasting room is spacious.  It has a homey lodge like feeling that is very inviting. They also have a beautiful tree shaded outdoor space.    The staff here are like family. They are knowledgeable and friendly.  I tasted through a selection of their vast options available. I found them to be well balanced.  Surprisingly I liked their Sauvignon blanc along with other of their wines."

                "description": "My experience was a 4-5 like many of those you will see here. However, our lovely day was ruined when one of the resident dogs or a customer's dog charged us aggressively while I was walking with my 10 month old baby in my arms. I cannot be sure if it was a resident dog or a guest's dog, but it was one of the gray colored Blue Lacey's).  Regardless, the dog was unprovoked by us. I had to hand my baby to my wife while I tried to protect them from this aggressive dog, hair bristled up and darting in at me aggressively as if to bite. Luckily it didn't bite us. The dogs owner chastised me for reacting strongly in defense of my wife and baby, which really frustrated me. We immediately left and I will not be returning. I wanted to post this in case a child is attacked by a dog on their premises in the future. It is documented and the owners have been informed that their aggressive dog or lack of leash laws are creating a liability and awful experience."

                "description": "I'm badly remiss in not posting a positive review for almost a year; what's more this is one of my personal favorite wineries in Texas Hill Country.  It's time I corrected this.   Spicewood has one of my personal favorite tasting rooms; while on the inside it's nothing special, the outside grounds and seating mimic an upscale, modern country house that I could see myself living in (*cough cough* once I win the lottery *cough cough*).  There's also a cool little stream they have running through the place so you can hear the sound of running or falling water when you sit to have a sip.  Nice touch.  Spicewood's won a bunch of awards for various wines but the two standouts IMO are their 2013 Syrah and their Riesling, which has a fruity taste and a magnificent green-apple crisp bouquet.  Note: As of May 2016, their site does not show the Riesling for sale, so I'd call ahead if you want to taste it.  As an added bonus, it's only 10 minutes away from It's All Good and Opie's, both of whom have some of my favorite BBQ outside the Austin area."

Their mixers are not what you might think - they are made with wine and real fruit - no \"sugar water, artificial flavor\" here. It's the real fruit that makes them not too sweet, and you can blend it exactly how you want just by adding anything from straight water to spiced rum! My wife's favorite is the passion fruit for the summer - she mixes it with HEB 1877 mineral water. We also picked up a spiced dark chocolate and raspberry - to mix together!  The staff is very helpful and super friendly!  They can show you how to mix different cocktails for different tastes - like a raspberry Moscow mule, or a grand sangria.  If you are looking for something truly out of the ordinary, this is your place!"

                "description": "Where's my sixth star, I mean, glass of wine?! ;) Tucked away in the north Austin hills, this place is a gem, worth trekking over for if you have any excuse to be anywhere near it.  This is the type of place that a group could enjoy, a wine beginner wouldn't find intimidating, and a wine snob could also find something to please their pallet. Good selection of all types, but not intimidating.  THE STAFF ARE ALL SO FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL! I was given a few suggestions from the owner, and they were all so spot on, I loved every one I tried.   Love the clean but welcoming decor, and how everything feels approachable and interactive (Glasses for sale, books, etc) and there's even some outdoor seating for those feeling a fire pit (if memory serves correctly, but the night I was here, the rain kept everyone inside).   Bring some girls, a group, or just stop by on your way home for a friendly wine bar with the coziness that makes you want to curl up and order an entire bottle and chat with folks."

Sloan + Parker was the perfect place to catch up with my girl friends. We shared a bottle of Napa Cab, a charcuterie board and delightful conversation with the hosts. The decor is great, ambiance is fun and it was overall a nice experience. Sloan + Parker is a much needed addition to Steiner Ranch!"

We moved here about 15 months ago and haven't found any amazing wines we enjoyed until today! Don't know if anyone else has had this issue in finding great wines, particularly Cabernet, in Texas, but we have! We came in and were welcomed with open arms and amazing conversation! In depth information of wines and tasting until we found the right glass to order.  After 15 months of living here we have finally found our \"home\" in regards to wine and friends! We will definitely  be back and can't wait to experience all they have to offer! Down to earth people and an experience you won't regret.  P.S. the decor is amazing!"

It is obvious that this area needs something like this.  As a woman owned business, I am happy to see it thrive.  Deep into Steiner Ranch, I am not sure people who live outside of the area would be seeking it out but worth the trip if you are into wine and want to check out the space.  Could be a good place for a celebration.  Steiner probably has enough people to support.  Rose, white, red, bubbles and brews.  Cheese plates.  You can buy bottles to take with you with various mustards, jams, etc in their pantry. Glad I got to experience this location and wish them all the luck moving forward."

I appreciate that the wine list is ever changing and that the employees all do an amazing job with recommendations and descriptions. There is also a pretty large price range so you're able to choose a glass based on how much you'd like to spend, which is great for their range of customers. Now about the decor/atmosphere: I'd like to have my home designed to look similar to S+P. It's fun and new and modern but elegant and sophisticated at the same time. I wouldn't change a thing!   My favorite time to go is on a chilly evening. I love to be curled up by the fire on the patio with blankets (provided by S+P) and a big glass of cab with live music playing in the background. Come on! That's heaven!   Do yourself a favor and follow them on Facebook. They host great events, my favorite being Sip In SWEATS. You will not be disappointed!"

My friend and I were greeted promptly and given an overview of the wines for our flight-sampler. We scored a small table. This was a huge win as there are limited seats, I believe up to 25 seats. The staff checked in on us as we tasted our way thru the wines. When we finished tasting, we bought a glass of our fave wine and continued to walk through market days on the square.  Anywho, if your walking the Georgetown Square, stop in for a tasting and or a glass or 2. Cheers."

After a more upscale experience in a different tasting room on the square, it was pleasant to ease into this more relaxed space. We were promptly greeted by the hostess, who became our server, and perused the menu of wines. $10 each for a sampling of 4 wines. Nice price, and fitting to the setting which would have been appropriate for beer as well. Neither of us remembers which wines we ordered, except for my two port samplings, but neither of us was overly impressed either. My ports were good, if extremely sweet and fruity, and the wife liked 2 of hers. She was disappointed in her first choice, which was the most expensive wine on the menu as priced by the bottle.  We didn't buy a bottle, nor would we return if we ever visit Georgetown again, but the ambience and carefree environment did add to an overall relaxing day on the square."

This is a great spot for a date night, girls night, or just an afternoon with a small group of friends or family. The actual vineyard is located in Rockdale Texas- this is just a small tasting room right on the Georgetown Square.   For $10, you can taste 4 wines. My spouse also got 4 tasting, so in total- I got to sample 8 wines. My favorite was the Big Tex which is aged for 9 months in oak. A full bottle will set you back only $24. Create price for the quality.  I also love their Viognier, I love white wines- and this was so light. I would casually sip this on any warm summer day. One thing I didn't love their fruity wines. The Blueberry and Blackberry wines tasted like they used artificial flavoring. The couple next to use was absolutely loving the blackberry, so maybe it just wasn't for me. Totally fair.   They also have cheese and crackers available. I feel like any wine tasting isn't complete without a good cheese plate. Unfortunately, we had dinner plans right after, so I enjoyed my wine cheese-free.   I absolutely plan on coming back here soon for some wine + cheese."

Any day of the week. And I know from experience.   I don't bother doing the tastings here - I know exactly what I like. Their unoaked chardonnay is butter and smooth. After that I move over to their pinot noir - which isn't too sweet but not so dry that I need to carry in my own water bottle. I do not drink fruit wines but my sweet lil granny does and she swears by the pomegranate and blueberry.   You can buy gifts and chochskies here. I always like to pick up a few bottles of wine before I had home to visit family. Their wine club is probably the best you can be apart of in terms of benefits.   I would really like if they would provide bread so that we can try the olive oils. Probably smart that they don't do that or else all of us winos would use that as food. :)"

                "description": "Well my accidental tourist day continues and I ended up here, alcohol y'all!  Never knew anything about Georgetown except that it was an annoying mile marker on Interstate Hell-35 indicating after driving north for an hour you have gone nowhere.  Low and behold there is actually an ancient town square buried in there somewhere. So what else to do but gravitate like a bee to flower and find the alcohol. It's here and it's called wine.  The place is filled full on a steamy June Saturday afternoon. Saddle up to the bar and start in on the tasting. I was in a red mood and took 4 tastes.  The chambourcin was an interesting new grape for me and it was deeply dark in color yet light on the tannins. It was nice but I like tannin and the Tempranillo delivered on all counts.  It was a nice pit stop and I recommend it if you accidentally end up touring the square of Georgetown."

He was very unwelcoming. We had to ask him questions he just didn't give us any information about the winery at all or the wine club. Must have been a bad friday for him.   I passed on getting a flight b/c of the wine guy. I got a glass of a red blend to go so I could shop around the square. The wine was fantastic. I was going to buy a bottle but found another place on the other side of the square."

                "description": "Barons Creek was our first stop on a planned wine tasting adventure around the square. We were greeted by our sommelier Tom, seated, and the tasting process explained. Tom provided a charming mixture of highbrow wine knowledge and light humor as he took us through our tasting journey of 5 red wines. The wife liked all of the wines, and I liked all but one (a tempranillo). Never fear! Tom is here! Tom saved the day (and the Tres Primos reputation) by pouring us an extra taste, but instructing us to first chew a chocolate-covered coffee bean before pouring the wine across that bean in our mouths. This somehow transformed the flavour into something amazingly pleasing for us both!  We also ordered chicken empanadas, which were surprisingly delicious! For some reason we did not expect such flavor and complexity from a wine bar's kitchen. The empanada crust was crispy and flaky, with a filling of chopped chicken, onions and seasonings that burst into the mouth with each bite. This was no Tex-Mex kitchen empanada. Hats off Barons! Hats off!"

Barons had more of an uppity vibe to it, so maybe I wasn't picking up what they were putting down from the jump as I tend gravitate toward a more casual atmosphere... especially when it comes to wine tasting.   They were nice and helpful here and poured us a cup of Tempranillo and Crazy Train on our way out, to drink while we walked around the square. Both good wines but did not justify the price tag for us."

The staff present were quite nice, just busy. We were allowed to buy wine to self serve on the back porch and were welcomed to be inside the tasting room or outside which was near the vineyard - very nice out there.  Their vineyard was planted in 1999. That may be a little unusual for the immediate Austin area. The vines and the grounds are very well maintained.   As far as the place, it is beautiful. It has the feeling of Napa but with Austin-area live oak trees.  The property borders Lake Travis though it is barely visible from the tasting room area. There's an exclusive members only area that is on the lake.  We purchased the Claros Reserve which is a Norton grape (hybrid) and is the grape grown on the estate. The wine was surprisingly excellent and cost $35.   I think that, with a reservation, this would've been a superior experience."

The property is absolutely gorgeous - I mean you can truly just sit and relax for hours while you take in the stunning view. I had made reservations but we arrived a tad bit early and Liz was happy to accommodate us sooner. I'd like to take a moment to offer my sincerest appreciation for Liz as she made this experience so memorable for us. It was our first proper wine tasting and she truly took the time to explain every single wine to us - notes/scents to look for, best food pairings, explaining the difference in textures, where the grapes are from - I mean the whole nine yards. She even showed us the safer, beginner way to swirl the wine to really delight your senses before tasting. I had added a cheese board to our reservation which we thoroughly enjoyed! Liz was patient with all of our questions on the wine (and cheese), had a wonderful sense of humor, and just a lovely personality to deliver a phenomenal package of customer service. Every single wine we tried was delicious! We took home a bottle of Claros but we seriously wanted to take home one of each. If we weren't relocating soon, we would 100% have signed up for their membership. If we get to visit the area again, we will definitely stop in. I highly recommend visiting!"

Disappointing, because we drove out of our way and had our young daughter with us. Were hoping to have a nice little picnic. Waste of time. It would have been nice if it were posted on the website. It was a beautiful vineyard!"

                "description": "Came here for wine tasting and was very impressed with the vineyard. We were staying at Horseshoe Bay Resort and were deciding between several vineyards to try in the area. I'm really glad we ended up trying Stone House. We decided to sit on the patio for our tasting. I tried the classic tasting and my dad tried the reserve tasting. The wines were mostly from Australia. They had one of their house wines on my menu. I thought the quality of wines was very average. We also got a cheese board which was really good.  The area was picturesque and we were allowed to go down to an area for wine club members. They had an enclosed outdoor area for members only with a view of the lake.  Overall, if you want to go to a vineyard with great views, this is the place to go."

She welcomed us and gave us a nice toast of something bubbly and told us about the vineyard and its owner, Angela. The wine of the month was Angela's Wish. I was having a particularly emotional time with it at this point because my beloved grandmother, Angela, passed away recently and had wanted to visit this area. I, of course, had to get the wine of the month so I could keep that bottle. I told Jaramy of my grandmother and the significance of the name of the bottle and she listened with an open heart. My group also got a nice charcuterie board and sat outside. Though it was pouring down rain, we still had a lovely time conversing with others and enjoying the view."

                "description": "My family rode the North Pole Flyer, not so much for the Santa stuff since we have no children under 10, it was more for family fun. And it was a fantastic experience. The train was actually pretty cool, I've never been in a proper train before, I mean, it was old fashioned but still just a really really cool experience. We paid for the private suite and it was worth it, we also walked throughout the train which was a bit old west feeling. My favorite part was walking between cars to see the view unencumbered by windows.   We walked through all the cars (like most people on the train did) to see what the other cars were like. The giftshop car was the nicestest with big windows and plenty of room to walk around while balancing yourself on a rocking and rolling moving train.   Some of the private rooms give you an idea of what is was really like to ride a train across country with a sleeper car, teeny tiny shower, and narrow hallways. It was such a great experience.   Not sure why people complain about the views because mine were fantastic! I mean, c'mon. We live in Texas not Denver. I know what the hill country looks like. There's no mountains but where the hills meet the sky is expansive. It was beautiful."

We loved all the fun facts the volunteers had to share about the train cars and lifestyles of some of the riders back 100+ years. The sunset was magical and the night portion of the ride was really neat, having the moonlight illuminate the tracks in front of us. One of the cars is a dedicated gift shop/concession stand with a variety of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages to choose from. Everyone we came in contact with was so kind and made the experience that much more memorable. Overall such a great time - we would definitely book this experience again!"

Dirty cars, dirty seats, dirty windows with bleak scenery outside and Santa who gives a broken whistle. That is all for 2 hours trip. Even an obsessed with trains 4 years old was bored.

                "description": "We had a great time on the Beer Train last night that was advertised as a sunset tour that was 2.5 hours long.  Note that you have about 45 mins moving time, then 40 mins stopped for the engine to be brought from the back to the front and then 45 mins back again. You don't really see much of the sunset, and you aren't moving for 2.5 hours. They also assign seats ahead of time, some of the cars were nicer and louder than others, so just depends what you're looking for. The association was responsive on social media when I had questions, staff and crew on board were all very friendly. They dont really follow any of their own posted rules about masks, no personal coolers, etc. so just something to be aware of- but I think this also varied by car. Overall we had a great time and would go again!"

Fortunately for me the plague was in top form. Was in the area looking for sustenance and 'Steam Train Association' showed on the map so I figured to pop in for a quick viddy before lunch. pulled up on a nearly empty lot, a shackled gate, and a locked door, the sign had the now common 'Closed for Plague' message which softened the blow of discovering \"...that the train and rail yard are not open for public tours or photography\" which meant the entirety of the museum was contained in the double-wide corner space in the strip. There's nothing inherently wrong with scenic train rides on vintage rolling stock, I've done it before and it's OK but that's just not my cup of meat. I was here for a bit of museuming but there was no museum to be had - nor postcarding nor touchable cars nor engines :-( sad face"

                "description": "My husband and I went on the Hill Country Flyer for our anniversary weekend and we were in the \"Rippling Stream\" train car. The Train itself is quite impressive and was my first time on a real train not subway. The First Class Coach option was really nice and the seats were spread out along with social distancing, we felt really comfortable. My only complaint was it was VERY cold outside and though they are climate controlled, it was really cold the first half of the ride - coming back was much more comfortable. I also wished the lay over time perhaps had been 3 hours to provide a little more browsing time in Burnet. It would be cute to do music in each train car from the era the train was made. Ours was built in the late 30's so it would be a nice little touch that's simple to do! They had complimentary snacks and drinks which was a plus. Can't wait to do it again in a private suite!"

                "description": "This was an excellent experience. We took the train from Bertram to Burnet for one of the special events (Wedding Oaks wine trip). The staff was friendly and seemed very knowledgeable about the history of each train car. If you have a chance to walk to the very last car and look out the back, I definitely recommend taking in that view. I would have loved to take a longer trip and will look for other chances to ride.  The website is a little hard to use. We would have really liked a private cabin for our trip but didn't see how to book that on the website.   I wish the volunteer in our car would have been a little less Chatty Cathy when we weren't talking about the ride. It was a bit of a distraction from our enjoyment of the ride. Also, riding during COVID was a bit out of our comfort zone already so we were sad to see at least two volunteers wearing their masks covering only their mouth, not their mouth and nose. The website goes into great detail about precautions and that is a basic one not being taken. (That being said, they did a great job with social distancing and I felt like the train was very clean.)"

                "description": "Enjoyed my first ASTA experience today.  Here's my recap:  - Purchased a First Class Lounge ticket so I had my own room in Rippling Stream  - Train left the station on time, arrived at Burnet on time, and left for Cedar Park on time.   We were only an hour late reaching Cedar Park because a car thought it could outrun the train, but it could not.  Once the accident reporting was complete the train resumed.   - Personal note:  I am a train nerd and love riding trains, so my threshold of being annoyed on a train is higher than most.  This will affect my review below.    THE GOOD:  - clean cars, fun to walk in between them, and if you're without children, the adults only first class cars are a must - Rippling Stream and Nambe.   Otherwise with kids, I would recommend the Maurice Beckham or Eagle Cliff.    - the trip itself is smooth and the volunteers are friendly and helpful.  You can tell they enjoy being there, informing and helping others.     - Burnet has an abundance of antique shops if that's you're thing.  Also the soups at the downtown coffee shop are wonderful.     - The shootout show in Burnet, while not having a worry about winning any acting awards, is fun for the kids and has a good ending.  They could trim some of the fat from it, and make it a more concise / engaging story - there were a few too many awkward pauses.  But I applaud the folks who are likely doing this for free.  And the kids loved it.     THE NOT SO GOOD  - The scenic ride - if you're from the area this should not come as a shocker - is not that scenic.  There's a great bridge over the San Gab river but otherwise it's unremarkable trees, backyards, roads, and strip malls.    But again, none of this bothers me that much because I'm on a train relaxing.    - Burnet:  This is a sleepy, very conservative town.  One sign to deter thieves in a store said, \"We got an alarm.  We got video.  We got guns.  DON'T BE DUMB.\"    While the downtown is a short walk from the train station, 2.5 hours here is way too much time unless you love antiques.   There isn't much else.   And as far as lunch goes, I highly recommend walking a bit farther past the first couple restaurants or else you'll have long wait times.   I went to a deli just a couple blocks away and it had no line.      - Announcements:  there are few.  Nothing along the way to alert you to landmarks or scenic opportunities (there is really just one, the bridge over the river).   But it would be nice to hear more than the pre recorded departure / arrival ones.    - The warm soft drinks:  no one wants green tea or apple juice at room temp.  There was literally an ice bucket next to these (but for scoping ice).  A second one to put these beverages on ice would go a long way.    - Lack of variety in snacks:  for a first class experience, at least more than the mini lemon cakes and mini cinnamon rolls would be nice.  Some savory, perhaps?   - chairs in the RS lounge car are what you'd find at your local dentist's waiting room.  I expected something that would at least remain comfy for 1.5 hours at a time.      OVERALL. - for the price I paid, it's 4/5 stars.  I knew the scenery wasn't going to awe, so most of my ranking is based on the train experience inside.  The quibbles above are all minor; chill the drinks, add some pretzels, get someone to donate an old leather chair or 2, and be a bit more chatty with us.    Those who really ranked their train ride low usually fall into the following categories, so please take them with a grain of salt:  - a/c sucked because it was Austin in the summer (hopefully fixable but not all that surprising) - solution is to go when it's not hot, the 60 days out of the year it's under 99 degrees.  I also think they have ironed out most of the a/c issues by now.    - Burnet was terrible, Burnet food was terrible, etc.  It's Burnet.  There's a reason it's not as well known as Fredericksburg.  You walk a bit father to get away from the crowds, you cross check their list of lunch spots they give you when you board  with a quick glance of Yelp reviews and you roll the dice.    - scenery sucked, super ghetto, etc.   Maybe because I grew up in St Louis, but using the word ghetto here is laughable at best.  It's junky, yes.  Unkempt, sure.   And truly, if you live in the region, you should know better than to expect breathtaking views.  You've driven on 183 east of 35?.  Same views.   If you're from out of town I could see valid point here since the website pushes it hard that it's scenic - but us locals know how much lipstick you can put on this pig.   So go check it out!  But go First Class if possible.  And be flexible about being home on time; like with any train, delays can happen."

                "description": "We rode the Hill Country Flyer which departs from the Cedar Park station and goes to Burnet, Texas,  where there is a two-hour layover so that passengers can disembark, do some shopping or grab some lunch or both.   Before leaving, the Burnet Gunfighters put on a show which is free to passengers, although they do accept donations.   The scenery leaves a lot to be desired, however that is not something that the Steam Train Foundation can control, they have a designated track and can not control who builds subdivisions or places gravel pits along the route.   If you are looking for a beautiful scenic ride, this probably isn't for you.  However, if you want to experience riding on a passenger train, and learning about the history of the railroads, it is a great experience.     They are very careful with social distancing and we felt completely safe riding the train.  I spoke with a couple of families that had young children and they loved it!   All in all, I would recommend it as a very enjoyable way to spend the day."

                "description": "I rode the Sunset Express on 5-29-21 with my family, while on a trip to visit Austin. I'm from Southern California (this is important later). The scenery was certainly nice in some spots, but not enough. The sunset was awesome, but the experience wasn't that great. We paid for first class and rode aboard Eagle Cliff. Some basic drinks and snacks were provided, but the train was understaffed. No attendant for our car. One very sweet elderly volunteer was doing her best to handle two cars at once. I decided to offer to help, which she was very appreciative of. She said it was great that I wanted to help and so I did. I helped stock drinks and snacks as well as stocked ice to keep the drinks cold. Later on, a female volunteer who looked to be in her 40s came up to the counter said \"Sir, you cannot be back there, what do you need?\" I explained the situation, and she kind of had an attitude. I was informed in a rude tone that I had to be a member to help, and was given no thank you. Being that I live in Southern California, there's no way I could really be a member. While all this was happening, the AC in the car was doing a very poor job at keeping the car cold. It was unbearably hot in there, and everyone in the car was complaining. The excuse given was that the car is vintage and has a lot of runtime. The car was very original, and you could tell. That roughly translates to \"we don't have the money or people to keep this car in tip top shape, and we don't have the money to upgrade it\".  Eventually, my family was re-seated to the Rippling Stream. That was much better, but it didn't change the overall experience. Cherry on top was we were over an hour late returning to the Cedar Park station.   Not worth the money."

                "description": "We also did the Xmas Polar Express train ride. Tickets were about $50 each. We also went with a friend and their kids too.   I'll give this train ride 4 stars. The kids were excited to see Santa and the ride was slow at times.   To start, one of the first things was a balloon guy. Ours was awesome. He was funny and overall entertaining. He had me laughing my @ss off.   Next came hot chocolate... it's hot chocolate.   After that was, singing Christmas Carols. They had 2 girls from McNeil high school. I felt sorry for them. They were nice, but they couldn't just get our car interested in singing.  A few of us sang, but overall it was a failure. I'm sure adult beverages if allowed/served would help the spirit. Great job to them but our car was mostly interested. It probably didn't help that they gave us a cookie just before they arrived so everyone was stuffing their face.   After that was story time, the lady reading the Story was animated and funny. Kudos to her.   She visited just before Santa.   Then Santa came. We were in one of the last cars so his visit was a bit rushed. He was nice and gave everyone a wooden train whistle.   ***********The entire operation is run by volunteers. So I'd like to thank all of them for their time!*******  This was he first time my son was not afraid of Santa:-)"

Super We stayed in the Turquoise Room, which consisted of 2 tables, 8 chairs and two smaller windows. Staff was super friendly and knowledgeable...Once the train started the conductor came in to room to announce that there we several open seats in the main car...everyone got up and left leaving the wife and I in peace...Not that we are anti social, but it was peaceful to say the least...Good to catch up with each other, as we both work different hours...Truly not much to see on the way up...but it was a great ride....AC did work, not great but tolerable...I see in other reviews there were issues...You have freedom to roam Car to Car once the train gets rolling...and the train does turn around in Burnet...hard to explain, but it does...and we were able to see the other side of the tracks on the way home...Plenty to see and eat in Burnet...Our Car/cabin also came with free snacks and drinks...which is a great perk..as the snacks in the concession stand were quit expensive...The trip was worth it for us and will do it again next year with the granddaughter.."

                "description": "This review is based on my customer service experience with Zena, not the train ride itself (although I may come back and give an update!)  Zena is a lifesaver. Not literally, but she has made my train experience 2x as good. I bought a Groupon because I didn't even realize there was a train experience in Austin. After the headache of scheduling, our trip got canceled. Zena came in to save the day. She mailed me another gift certificate that expired in a year (vs the next week per my Groupon) AND she gifted us a little extra!  Sounds great, right? Unfortunately, the GC could not be redeemed online. After multiple tries of calling in (and getting a forever ring - no pick up), I was getting irritated.   I emailed Zena back asking for her advice. She wrote back in 24 hours and apologized for their phone service. She even offered to reserve me herself. After a few back-and-forth emails, she answered all my questions and got us all squared away.  Our train ride happens this weekend and I can only hope that the experience is similar to Zena's customer service."

                "description": "It's such an adorable idea - volunteers running a historic train line on weekends to give people an authentic experience. But the train is slow - really really slow. The view is simple and unmemorable. The FandB in the first class is simply a cinnamon roll and lemon cake with tea. They do have apples and oranges as well. The trip back was painful - we stood in the concession cart the entire time because the A/Cs didn't work and it was triple-digit hot on a September Saturday. Even my 5-year-old nephew, who is obsessed with trains and knows all there is to know about them, wasn't engaged in this ride much. Thankfully, we had carried board games and our own food so the ride to Burnet was okay but the ride back was really terrible."

                "description": "The most horrible rip off of an experience I have ever had. I bought 4 tickets for the VIP lounge which included treats and drinks and a nicer car, it was none of those things. The food offered were store bought generic cookies and the drinks were either warm apple juice or water. The car lost the A.C. capacity on the return from the small town with nothing to offer and did not even have the gun fight reenactment due to the extreme heat, now imagine that extreme heat inside a metal sardine box. I invited my 72 year old father and I was genuinely worried we would have to rush him to the emergency room upon arrival. I chewed the place out for their false advertisement and putting the elderly and children at risk in the extreme heat without AC.   In summation, do not buy tickets to any of the events this was a horrible experience. I got my money almost a month later, and I will never return and I will warn anyone thinking about ever going to one of these fiascos."

We booked tickets on the Sunset Express trip. The Staff was all very friendly and knowledgeable.   You are able to bring your own drinks (non alcoholic) and snacks which is a plus. They do have a concessions car which is nice.   To us the trip was not as much about the scenery as it was the experience of a mode of travel long since gone."

Just jump off the train, and there you are.  Each train car has it's own characteristics, but take my word, spend the extra money for the air conditioned cars.  We had a chance to walk through the other cars, and even on a beautiful spring day, you can tell a big difference walking into the cars without A/C.  We rode on the City of Chicago, in a table for two, which had great views.  There was complimentary water, tea and snacks on our car.  The volunteer, Barbara, was informative about the train, wildflowers, and announced points of interest on the route."

                "description": "My family and I took a ride on the Hill Country Flyer and this a brief overview of our experience and I recommend you heed this review well.  ----------------------------  I visited and rode the September 7th 10:00 am to 5:00 pm ride to Burnett going out of Cedar Park Wirth the Austin Steam Train Association and I'd like to share my experience that day.   To begin the train left 20 minutes late from the terminal when it was communicated the train would be leaving promptly and on time consistently. Which is fine although it did negatively impact the quality of time spent in Burnett and exploring the town which was a key experience in the advertised outing. Another large disappointment was the lack of the advertised western gun fight. We saw no mention of it, nor display of it. Apparently that was another misrepresentation of the trip. It was advertised we would have two hours to explore downtown Burnett and have lunch. This was barely enough time to visit a local restaurant flooding with business from both local lunchtime and other passengers. With barely an hour in Burnett without enough time to eat we actually had to leave the restaurant we were at in a manic frenzy without eating, apologize to the staff at the restaurant for our rush due to this,and return to the train. Then upon returning at the specified time we still not even begin the process of departing until nearly 30 minutes past the time we were told to return! The. On the return trip we didn't even get above 10 mph on the speed making for a grueling and arduous journey back creating an atmosphere on complete misery on the entire train. On top of all of that the trains expected time to return was 5:00 we did not return until after 5:30! This is insane it officially help derail our entire vacation plan and helped out more of a strain on our time off. Meaning we had to rush and adjust our original plans.   Another issue with the experience was there little to no a/c in rear car named Rippling Stream on a day with temperatures rising above 95 degrees! Although the next car over had perfect a/c with a lower priced ticket. Paying for six tickets @55 dollars to sit in the heat in pool of our own sweat was not the idea of a luxury car provided by marketing materials. We actually had to use the pamphlets provided to make fans in order to be comfortable during the ride and continuously go into the other cars for refuge from the sweltering heat. Upon informing staff of the issue we were told once the train is moving we can go to other cars and stand in the cool air to gain some reprise from the heat.This is insane as we bought out the entire private room to have a bonding family experience we certainly were unable to enjoy. Also this car represented itself as a purchase of an adults only car ticket and children were running through the car. We wanted an experience that would supply with a relaxing adult atmosphere that was negatively impacted by this not being enforced.   Another major concern of mine is lack of communication from staff with the private areas of the train. Announcements regarding safety, departure time, arrival, landmarks etc were unheard in the private room and no effort was made by train personnel to inform us of anything. We were left alone with no information about anything given without having to seek out an attendant regularly. To mention with sound there was also an almost constant excessively loud screeching noise as we moved along at a slugs pace that I feel each passenger will hear in their nightmares of this ride for years to come.   This experience wound up being more stressful due to the previously mentioned circumstances causing our trip to be unenjoyable. Due to the dishonest representation of a truly climate controlled car, and times for departure misrepresented. Unfortunately this is not an outing that we would attended again or recommend to others visiting the Austin/Hill Country area. This is not something we would recommend for anyone trying to relax or enjoy a vacation."

There is a winery and a brewery on site so everyone likely has an option they'll like = Best of both worlds. They have plenty of outdoor seating, which you could choose to sit in the sun or under the trees in the shade. We split a glass of rose and their sweet white and I would recommend either one.

                "description": "Completely unacceptable management. For about 2 hours a group of individuals where shouting at two tables, yelling sexually explicit language, swearing profusely, and were clearly unable to drive. At a place that prides itself in a family atmosphere, where kids are running around playing in the grass and trees, this is completely unacceptable. I am looking forward to management/ownership response to this review. In a region where wineries, breweries and distilleries are a dime a dozen, plenty of opportunities to take my business elsewhere when we come visit.  What should really concern the owners and management about what happened at Bell Springs is the fact that:  1) The Hays County sheriff was called after the incident because it was so egregious. Enough of these reviews and they will be lining up outside the parking lot for DWIs.  2) The staff (7:00 pm on 6/19) did absolutely nothing to cut off a clearly over-intoxicated group that was negatively impacting people around them  3) The staff's response (blonde and burnette hostesses), ver batim, to the vulgar language and rowdiness was \"free speech\" and \"you are the problem - I know those people\".  Fantastic - best of luck in your future endeavors . Your stellar response caused one of our group to cancel their wine membership."

We sat up on the patio with our dog and enjoyed a lovely wine tasting. We chose the solo tour which was $15 for 5 generous pours of delicious wine. All the staff we interacted with were very friendly and helpful. The one low point is the food truck. We got the currywurst for $10 which was good, but not a large enough serving for the price. The more upsetting part was the pretzel we got (also $10, which is very expensive). The prestel was small, hard (even though it was supposed to be a soft pretzel), and flavorless. The mustard cheese dip did its best to save it, but it wasn't enough."

                "description": "I have been here numerous times and always had an awesome experience but today was the most unacceptable experience I have ever had ANYWHERE. I was here with my family, parents, and my brothers family with a total of 5 kids (not unusual to see kids here). While here, we became aware of a group that was likely overserved and using foul/vulgar language that we tried to ignore for a long time. Once we heard the phrase \"fat c*ck\" at a ridiculous volume my husband asked them to please keep it down, which resulted in a huge altercation with various threats/insults from their end. Despite their behavior management still allowed them to stay. What's worth noting is multiple people had already complained about this group and others joined my husband in attempting them to quiet down- so they were affecting loads of people at the winery. Eventually things calmed down and the argument broke, but as we were leaving they said loudly for us to hear \"I'm so glad that douchebag is leaving\" so I gave them the finger as I was walking away (I will concede this was adding fuel to the fire but I was so fed up at this point) and they screamed to me \"FUCK YOU MOM\" across the grass. Managements response? Free speech allows them to say whatever they want. Apparently this nice hill country spot is going for the dirty 6th vibe. Save your money and go somewhere with enough pride to expel those who can't keep it together while I use my own right to free speech to notify everyone this place doesn't care about their patrons."

                "description": "I am a resident of Dripping Springs and have been a frequent patron of Bell Springs Winery. I found this family-friendly venue to be welcoming and beautiful. It was for this reason that I suggested that my kids, with their families, join my husband and me for a Father's Day celebration on Saturday evening, June 19th. When we arrived just before 5 pm, we found a good picnic spot in the shade near the bag game. We all noticed, or rather heard, a very boisterous group of 12 to 15 people sitting near the brewery. As the evening progressed, and I am assuming more alcohol was consumed, the group became louder and more profane. We attempted to ignore them, but soon it was impossible due to the volume and the increasingly prevalent and disgusting language. At that point, and because we had 5 young children with us, my son-in-law went over to the group and respectfully asked them to turn down the volume so that my Grandchildren would no longer be exposed to words like \"F*ck and C*ck\". He was immediately met with a barrage of personal slurs and threats. 2 staff members (2 young ladies, one light-haired and the other dark-haired) working that evening came over to the group, however, incredibly, the inebriated party was allowed to remain on the premises. Shortly after, every family packed up and went home, including our group.  When walking to the parking lot to leave, a particularly vile young woman yelled obscenities at my son-in-law and daughter. I turned around and went over to the group. When I arrived, I was also barraged with a variety of slurs and called a \"C*nt\". Once again, the 2 female staff members came over to the table to intercede. At this point, the dark-haired staff member shared with me that she \"knew the group\" of offenders, which helped me understand why these folks had not been asked to leave. If you happen to know staff, you can act like filthy pigs, with the knowledge that your actions will have no repercussion, regardless of the profoundly negative impact on everyone else looking to enjoy wine and food with their families.  To add insult to injury, staff had the unmitigated gall to suggest that I was the problem, not the drunk and vulgar group. When I questioned staff (dark haired young lady) why they permitted such obnoxious behavior from any patron, she suggested that hurling profanity toward others was protected under free speech. Staff continually suggested that our \"conversation was over\", indicating that they wanted me to leave. Clearly, the privilege of free speech isn't applied equally to all patrons visiting Bell Springs.  In the past 15 months, I have recommended Bell Springs to dozens of family and friends. Now, I plan to exercise my right of free speech in every forum available to tell acquaintances and strangers alike about my experience, advising that Bell Springs is not worthy of anyone's patronage."

You know Grape Creek's wine is good: they earned almost 2 dozen medals, including three Double Golds, this year at the prestigious San Francisco Wine Competition. And their wins encompass all styles, with Double Gold wins for red, white and Port. My Tasting Ambassador, Sandy, was exceptional! As we talked, she discerned my tastes and made a couple of recommendations that turned out to be spot on. She was knowledgeable and responsive, and a delight to talk with. Having been to many tasting rooms and wineries in the Texas Hill Country as well as from the California wine regions to the New York Finger Lakes, my experience at Grape Creek exceeded my expectations. Highly recommended!"

Since they made us split up our party of six we got two tables that were close together. Apparently management had a problem with my girlfriend and I orienting our chairs towards our friends table so we could all talk to each other and came and got in our faces to tell us we have to turn our chairs around and face forward. What is this kindergarten? The wine was alright, but definitely not good enough to justify the $40 per bottle price tag. I've found better bottles at HEB for under $20. Don't waste your time or money. There are plenty of other wineries in the area of the same quality that are more affordable and less rude"

It is absolutely delish and my go to red for my collection and for gifting to friends.   While the main building itself is somewhat small and doesnt offer the option to sit downstairs (GC....this is overdue), there is a members only room available upstaird with views of the Gtown Square.  The patio however is the reason people gravitate towards this winery. There is live music, nice fans to keep you cool in summer and heaters for the winter.  My only dislike is the changes hours...it closes at 6:30. Far too early and down the street are alternatives that stay open til 9 or later."

Although... standing in line when you first walk-in did seem a bit off, it was merely just a way to help usher traffic through more efficiently. Luckily, the line went quickly or this would probably be a different type of review, as someone * wink wink* who doesn't do well with lines for absolutely anything, except that one Prince concert 30 years ago.   Needless to say, we came, we tasted, we joined the wine club and now we are big fans. Especially of their Rose of Malbec. That deliciously tasting watermelon jolly rancher (without the sugar) wine has changed wine drinking for me and completely justifies the $30 price tag."

We had previously been sitting there calmly, not being loud or offensive in any way - it felt very abrupt and extremely rude.

When select the button to speak to the tasting room, their automated service starts all over again. Yes, I can email, but for a simple question, picking up the phone should be an easy option as well.  Also, the times on yelp versus their times on the phone are inconsistent. That needs to be updated.  Bottomline, they lack communication.  It's really annoying and frustrating. I plan on canceling my wine club membership and going elsewhere due to the experience that I've had."

It's going to be a quarterly experience for my wife and I, which includes a 6-sample tasting or half glass each visit and access to the upstairs member only area. We went on a Saturday around 5:00 and it was busy! The wait for the tasting was only a few minutes since they fully staffed the counter. I think I saw them doing 5 couples or groups at a time.  She told us that we can order delivery from Gumbo's around the corner or bring in any food that we want! The offer live music on the weekends on the patio and dogs are welcome out there. The member only area was packed with people, so it was a bit hot, but had comfortable couches and chairs, many windows overlooking the courthouse and town square, and some salespeople offering tastes of the Owner's Club wines. I only took off a star because the member's area was hot and could use some more seating and a server would be great since it takes a while to get another glass or make a purchase by standing in line more than once.  The had quite a bit of wine related merchandise, cheese, olive oils and vinegars, and cookbooks downstairs."

It is a nice storefront on the square in Georgetown, which is a terribly cute area if you haven't been.  Got my free member glass and took it out on the back patio to enjoy.  Plenty of tables and shade there and some light classic rock, which made for a nice relaxing atmosphere.  Also I went upstairs to check out the members only lounge.  There was nothing free being handed out there food or sipping wise, but it was a comfortable place with lots of leather chairs, and if the winery was crowded, I could see escaping up here.  The wine itself is very good, something for every palate, even the dry red drinkers like myself.  If you are into wine at all, stop by and do a tasting, and I think you will be happy you did.  I plan to come back anytime I'm in the Georgetown area again."

People everywhere with no special lines for members Or any direction other than a sign that said everyone get in line.  Not sure the value of paying to be a member for this space.  Also a 21 and over rule in the tasting room. Most serious wine folks have kids.  Seriously reconsidering our membership and if it's with it. My suggestion would be to expand as quick as possible if you're that popular. Otherwise, do away with memberships benefits and just open to the public.  4 stars because the wine is amazing."

The GM proceeded to stay late with us and show us the absolute best of the best mead I have ever had. He was amazing the bartender was amazing and if I ever re-vist Austin this is a must have on the to do list. Do NOT miss out on this amazing experience. Do not go to Austin beer works this place is literally 10x better if not more."

Unfortunately, they do not allow dogs inside. As a dog owner who lives in the brewery district, this establishment is simply off my list anytime I go out with my little gal.   I do love this place but it's hard to give a perfect score to a place I can't frequent. Especially when they have ~10 competitors in a 5 minute radius and none of them share the same policy. As a result, I am updating my review from 5 to 4 stars."

There seems to be good social distancing. There's hand sanitizer on the counter. Growlers are a possibility as are CDB sodas. The people are friendly and seem to know about the beer. I only discovered this place after the pandemic it started so I've never really spent time inside. But I've been sitting on my own porch enjoying it quite a bit and when things get back to normal I hope to spend a few hours at Adelbert's."

The neat thing is that they have artwork that's for sale on the walls. The art adds character and is a large variety of different themes all from local artists.   No good is served inside the brewery but there is a really good food truck on the outside.   The beers are amazing and you can sample before you buy.  Liked this brewery and beers are very creative."

They have a food truck outside with I think chicken I usually just get the fresh popped popcorn it's delicious and great to snack on while drinking beer. They have a Nintendo Wii with Mario kart and two old-school arcade games they also have a Foos ball table and darts. There's also boardgames that you can check out with giving them your ID, an awesome place to hang out with friends, kids and dogs!"

They have an outdoors area that's shaded for those with doggos or who want to enjoy the heat and eat from their food truck. I had the Triple B, which was surprisingly crisp and floral for a belgian. They had a variety of beers which I wanted to taste, but we arrived late with one hour to spare before closing. That just means I need to pay another visit to truly enjoy the place.  They have a private parking area shared with neighboring businesses and strong wifi. The best part is the indoors games like 4-player Mario Kart (WHAT!), darts, and a bunch of board games. They also give free stickers, plus our lady taptender that day was so kind and welcoming."

However I checked out their site, saw they had some wine options and a food truck--so I happily tagged along. The bartender who greeted us gave us the rundown of everything. Served us with a smile and was very informative about the beers, of course. I had a great bottle of pinot grigio while my friends enjoyed the various beers available. I had a great time checking out the art that they have on the walls for sale. We also played a game of jumbo sized connect four and Mario Kart on the big screen. A large collection of board games are also available to borrow while hanging out enjoying your drink in the taproom. Very cool place, warm vibes. Great food truck on site as well.  Definitely will return soon and bring my beer drinking friends."

Get the wristband if you're a first timer- only $15 for six \"half pours\" which are definitely more like 3/4 pours haha  The mango wit, naked nun, and hibiscus saison are AMAZINGGG.

They've got a bunch of cool artwork from local artists, giant Jenga, a foosball table, and live music to keep you entertained.  They also have great food truck options during Taproom hours.    $14 for 6 half pours and a free pint glass is a pretty amazing deal, especially due to the quality and content of the beer.  If you're into light, crisper beers, try the Naked Nun or the Philosophizer.  If you like the darker stuff, the Black Rhino is your friend.  They also have some great sours!"

                "description": "Three words: Belgium style brews! Oh my goodness, where have you been hiding from me Adelbert's?! This is by far one of my most favorite craft breweries in all of Austin, if not in the United States. For those of you that really know me, you know that I L.O.V.E. Belgian beers...so much so that, yes, I traveled to Belgium JUST for the beers (okay, I ate some mussels and saw some pretty cool stuff too, but...). For those of you not in the know (no insult meant for those who are), Belgian style beers are pretty high in ABV, so amateurs enter gently. Just looking out for my Yeeps! :D  Adelbert's doesn't look like much at all from the outside. Tucked away in a warehouse district, it can a tad difficult to find, particularly at night - just look for the little white lights and the picnic tables outside. Park, walk through the plastic flat \"doors\" and you will discover a beautiful huge space with stacks and stacks of barrels, merchandise for sale, lots of local art hanging on the walls to purchase adds to the ambiance; plus games to play such as giant Jenga, foosball, and darts and that's one fine outing.   But the beer! Oh my gosh - the beer. Handcrafted at its best. So amazingly fantastic and such a great deal. On your first visit be certain to buy the 6 half pour (really close to full pours - yay) tastings for $13. You get to keep the glass and get $2 off beers when you bring it back on your next visit. Regular prices range from $4-6 a glass, which is phenominal in the first place for such high quality ale.   ALL great, two personal standouts for me were: *Flyin' Monks Quadrupel: 10.9%ABV, aged in rum barrels with hints of spice, deep, dark, and lovely. *Philosophizer Saison: An easy choice. 7.8% ABV, very mild carbonation with a hint of pepper. Fantastic.     To add some icing to this already oh so sweet find, the founder and brewmaster Scott and staff cannot be any more friendly or knowledgeable about the beers and brewery.   Highly highly highly recommend. Simply doesn't get better than this IMHO. Cheers!  TIPS:  *The brewery has a license so you can take a large bottle home for a reasonable price of about $9 to $12, which is average. They also sell retail at area Austin locations (visit their website for exact locations).  *Tours are available (see website for details).   *They typically have a food truck on site on Saturdays.  *Fido friendly pergola area - not allowed inside."

                "description": "Ya'll are probably already aware of my latest and greatest obsession with collecting pint glasses from assorted breweries. For our first stop in Austin, we stopped by this unassuming warehouse. As we walked in, the live jazz band was jammin' and the beer taps were flowin'.   Michael and his bearded friend were fantastic bartenders. I really appreciated their hospitality. Michael instantly could tell I was new to this particular brewery and proceeded to explain the process to tasting their beer samples. He even noted that I had a minor with me and offered a brewed hibiscus tea for him. They really cater to all ages! We paid $13 for six half poured samples from a souvenir Belgian tasting glass. One yellow wristband later, my siblings and I were playing ping-pong and giant Jenga in the back of the warehouse.  The stringed lights on the ceiling made it feel welcome and homey. They had a wall of local art for sale ranging from $30-$300! I had my eye on a Sinatra painting, and as luck would have it, it was indeed the $300 piece lol. I stared at it longingly for most of the night, but couldn't bring myself to throw down on it. My favorite craft brews of the night were the Naked Nun and the Philosophizer. Brilliant names and great hoppy flavors.  Once it got too muggy in the taproom, we ventured out to get some grub. The food truck of the night was Emoji Grilled Cheese. (See their yelp site for my review) It was mouthwatering and delicious. We visited a couple other breweries throughout our trip, but Adelbert's was my all-time favorite.   Thanks for a great time!   -xoxoxo"

Mango flavor is not as present as I like, but the hint of it is good enough."

                "description": "The owners, Kenny and Gail are an amazing couple. Kfire is the result of many hours of their passion and love and years of planning. They are not new to the Texas wine industry.  They previously owned Lakeview Winery and Tasting room. Their dream though was to have their own space, production site, and vineyard.  Which led them to break ground and open Kfire.  They have a small tasting room, production pad, and have planted several rows with different varietals.  The local wine aficionados are most excited about the Tannat that they planted.  They also have a beautiful outdoor stone campfire circle, made out of the limestone they displaced when planting their rows of grape vines.  The tasting room is small and quaint. Kenny is a retired fireman, and you will find touches of former fire fighting equipment and artifacts throughout the tasting room.  There is also a nice selection of cigars for purchase.  You can do a tasting of five wines of your choice from their vast selection.  They have three whites, a couple reds, and a variety of fruit wines to select from.  I think the tasting was $10-15.  If you buy two bottles of wine, they will waive the tasting fee.  The bottle prices are reasonable.    Currently their wines are made from grapes sourced from Texas and other states.  They utilize some varietals in their blends that are not common to find.  It was great to experience something different. All of their wines were OK, except their Viognier was my least favorite.  The wines are approachable and ready to drink now. The whites are on the drier side, and have a nice bright acidity profile to it, which makes it pair well with food.  My favorite of the red was the Spotted Dog, a blend of Cab/Merlot/Montepulciano.  Out of the fruit wines, I enjoy the refreshing and bright Rhubarb wine called the Cadet.  It tastes like a great rhubarb strawberry pie, that is tart and light on sugar, and not too sweet.  The also have two other fruit ones to select from, the Tropical Isle, and Texas Brigade (Blackcherry).  They also have a small selection of three different food items to select from.    I am excited to see what the future holds for Kenny and Gail."

The wines are light and lovely and the experience definitely one we will repeat.  We joined the wine club and had a glass sitting out on the wonderful patio overlooking the vineyard.  Definitely worth a trip!!"

Definitely worth a drive to visit and check them out."

                "description": "Giving this winery 3.5 stars. Pros: Friendly knowledgable staff, good wines (i tried Cab blend and Sangiovese-both quite good. The Sunday we were there, they had a sax player who was very good. They also had a food truck with so.e delicious Cuban food.  I was not impressed with the washer and horseshoe pits. My recommendation would be to hire a landscaping firm to upgrade these areas.  There is not much else to look at so some landscaping seating and shade would go a long way. Also, the food truck service was very slow.  My last comment is that the bottle prices seem high so I didn't buy any wine.  I hesitate to mention this however as the wine was good and I have no understanding of what the owner's cost is to produce."

The customer service can't be beat and no matter what type of wine you like you will find something in either whites, reds or the sweets. I cant say 1 bad thing about kfire!

Kenny is a retired firefighter and thus the inspiration for the name of the winery.  A great wine tasting and overview of the facility was awesome.  Looking forward to the \"Winetastic Affair\" (a wine/food pairing) on Sept 22 between 3-7.  As Ken states, if you know any firefighters, have them bring us their department patch and receive a free glass of wine.!!"

It would be okay to play some music as it's awkwardly quiet due to the lack of patrons.  Finally, the people at the counter seemed annoyed with people overall.  Another couple in  the parking lot stopped us and asked if we had the same bad experience so it was not just us."

Glad we stopped at this place after seeing a sign off the side of the road and following a winding path down to see this gem.  Very homey vibes with a great patio for outdoor seeing that just has a fantastic view of the hill country. Decently priced drinks consisting of either gin or vodka.  Seating is pretty limited inside, but the outdoor space is just amazing and honestly makes the experience really that much better. I'd highly recommend 'The Bullfrog' with vodka. Tasty drink, but not overpowering and has a nice kick (smooth vodka that doesn't burn like gasoline).  P.S. They have some cool looking merch! Make sure to take a look at their terrariums...they are wicked!"

However, this time I made a trip purposefully to stop in.  I am glad I did.  Frog Pond is a family-owned business and passion project. The entire family was behind the bar the day my friend and I stopped in except for mom and I think a daughter.  The family owns the land and has slowly overtime built the tasting room and production area themselves.  They currently make a vodka and gin.  They offered us a free sip of each to determine which we would prefer in one of their handcrafted cocktails.  Both had a nice flavor profile that blends well in cocktails.  Their cocktails were creative and they mentioned the family came up with the recipes together.  The cocktails were delicious and very reasonably priced.  Their space has a fun modern 50's theme.  They have an outdoor patio you can sit back and relax on a nice day."

It's very obvious that a lot of careful thought has gone into this place. The actual distillery is incredible. The whole place is just beautiful. Even on a scorching Texas Summer day, there's a strong breeze out on the porch.  It's a very \"Austin-esque\" type place, down-home and friendly. Although I don't drink, my wife enjoyed a cocktail very much and we bought a bottle to take home. They had some nice lemonade and infused water for me too.  Great design of the logo, bottles and everything. Really worth stopping in if you're in the area or just feel like a nice drive from Austin."

We started off at another well known distillery down the road and googled what else was close by and found this awesome little spot with a great view. They make small batches of vodka and gin at the distillery and make a few different drinks to try. Their porch was a great place to hang out while playing giant jenga and relaxing. I noticed cornhole as we walked in as well. We watched deer randomly wandering in the distance. The drink I had was great, a cranberry vodka fizz, so I had another. The indoor space is fairly small and the patio could fit maybe 30 people comfortably. It was not crowded at all when we were there on a Sunday afternoon. We'll go again next time we're in Austin!"

I am very happy to say that the product that they are offering, not only the liquor, is amazing. They couldn't have picked a better location to place their distillery. The hills of Texas, day or night, make relaxing on the patio with the variety of gin and vodka cocktails that much more relaxing. The bright pops of color when you venture inside of the distillery are such a delight and really made my girlfriend and I feel happy to be in such a welcoming place.   The gin was delicious and I plan to buy more bottles very soon. Don't think that my lack of praise for the vodka means that it isn't good (I am just not a fan of vodka..rough nights in college) but I definitely suggesting venturing out to this family run, local organization. You will not be disappointed."

You get a card that's tied to your credit card to swipe or tap and then you have access to the wine you swiped for. Then you can get as much or as little as you want. It's a great way to try and explore new wines (and mead and some margarita inspired wines). Then you can load up on your favorite (what I did), or continue exploring. Really, two great options. Also, the guy working there was nice and very helpful. I've been telling people about how much I enjoyed coming here and recommending it.  Don't park in the paid parking next to Wanderlust if you can avoid it because it's stupidly expensive. Use that money on a Lyft or more wine."

Cute inside decor with so much local art, and a bad ass patio in the back with a food truck that serves authentic Italian food! The food truck owner was extremely personable and kind! He even gave us the breakdown of the different methods of how to cook pasta in all regions of Italy.   FYI, even though this is downtown, there is a private parking lot."

The original location off 35 is so so cute the moment you walk in. I will say the location at first struck me as odd - but the moment you walk through the doors you are transported into this little artsy wine oasis.   The wines on tap are so fun to browse and the wall art is so Austin it makes you think you can buy them (i mean maybe you can?!). The seating is ample indoor AND a outdoor to give you any desired vibe. Will absolutely be back!"

                "description": "Found this place by chance. Stopped since we saw it served wine. We were happy to see that it was a serve your own wine type of place. Wine on tap is such a great idea.   They give you a card that you use to get your wine. You get charged by the ounce. They do have happy hour. They have a good selection of wines. For those that don't like wine, they have a handful options (margarita, old fashioned)   The place is cute and they have a nice outdoor patio. They had a food truck the day we went.   Con:  - the wine comes out pretty fast, so you have to be careful as it can add up quick. If you want to taste first, be quick at closing it.  - there's no way to figure out how many ounces you are serving yourself."

You could tell they were glad we were new.  They truly have great enthusiasm for their jobs and this business.  A new product even arrived and we were informed we came at a terrific time!   It was so easy to tap my Wanderlust card and release the wine. There's a great variety of wines to choose from, including wines from France, Spain, some sangrias and hard lemonade. Warning: make sure all the taps are closed before you insert your card. I didn't see that one was turned a bit and wine started trickling and money ringing up on my card.  Because it's not very bright, I didn't see the wine flowing. Lesson learned!   There's an interesting room off the patio for private events.  I'm jealous I couldn't pop in!   Happy to see the food truck. Mmm: truffle fries and bruschetta!  You MUST come visit this location!"

                "description": "What a cool little concept and space to drink wine in downtown Austin. Came here during happy hour last weekend with some friends and was overall impressed with the wine tasting here. There whole gimmick is you you can try any of the wines on the wall tap and your charged by the ounces you drink. I will warn you use a light touch on the taps as I learned the hard way the first try. Most of the wines were half off during happy hour which makes for a great deal and I also liked that there was a range of wines from across the globe and wasn't specific to one region. They also had patio seating an Italian food truck in case you get hungry. The only downside like most places downtown is the parking but I heard that's less of an issue at their east side location which I'm excited to try next!"

Wanderlust charges by the ounce and although it adds up pretty quickly, if you're able to pace yourself, you can have a whole evening of fun. I got out of there spending well under $50 for two people, so we really didn't go all that crazy.  Try a million different wines and mixed drinks! they give you a card at the entrance and it just rings up your total, then they charge you on the way out. We had an issue with a bunch of cork settling into one of our glasses and they were able to remove that pour from our tab. The only thing is that it's hard to keep track of your favorite pours because there are so many options.  There is also a ton of space to sit. They have inside seating/lounge tables, there is outdoor seating and there's also an additional event space which you can sit in. We sat in the event space with a large group and it was so comfy. I would love to return!"

When you walk in, they give you a separate card that you swipe before each one of your pours. I liked it because you could pour as much or as little as you wanted and it gave you the opportunity to try different wines without being committed to a full glass. Honestly, it reminded me of those self-serve frozen yogurt places. I also really liked the outdoor area - it was a great place to hang out with friends and we had a great time taking photos at the photo booth.  The only downside was that it was more expensive than I was expecting. They give you the price per ounce on the screen, but once you start pouring, it adds up VERY quickly. I could have spent the same amount of money on a way nicer and fuller glass of wine.  Overall, I enjoyed the concept and fun vibes. Would love to come back during their happy hour or something when things are half-priced!"

                "description": "\"Froyo for wine\"; Fun idea, smooth process, nice spot, bit pricey.   It's a charge by oz place, like Froyo with all of the taps requiring an RFID card that you get by associating with a credit card at the front desk. Place the card on the reader and pour what you want into your glass. They have over 50 different styles, including mead, white, red, dry/sweet, and some wine-based cocktail style drinks.  They typically range from $1-3+ per oz so you'll probably come out with a $5-10 glass (4 oz) which is pretty comparable to most places.  There is both indoor and outdoor seating; interior is mostly couch seating and outdoor is patio/bench with faux grass. You can also bring dogs. The outdoor is a bit noisy, especially since it backs to another bar and is right under 35 so it was nicer indoors than out.  I don't usually drink wine because it gives me headaches and I certainly felt it the next day even after just 2 small glasses; possibly because of tasting so many different kind, so beware! Nice for trying something new but possible to get sick if you're mixing so much."

I appreciate the way the wines are labeled in clear groupings so it's easier to just walk up and find what I'm wanting more quickly. They also have an Italian food truck in the back patio area. The truffle Parmesan fries were great and the pasta dish was a good portion. Lots of cute photo ops and decent areas of seating. I will say this location is much smaller and literally off the busy highway but still the experience they offer is worth checking out."

When you come in you get a card with your name on it that unlocks the tap. As you fill your glass it shows you how many ounces and the cost in real time. I loved this idea because I got to try many wines before committing. You're allowed as many glasses as you want at a time so I recommend doing a flight! There's indoor and outdoor seating with a food truck out back. I signed up for their rewards program and will definitely be back!"

Red blends, dry white blends, bubbly, mead, etc. You name it, they have it!  When you arrive they swipe your card and give you another card, something like a hotel key card. You use this key card and swipe it before each self serve wine glass pour. The screen next to the tap will show you how many ounces you've filled up your glass and how much for the whole glass. The screen also shows how much each ounce of wine costs. Maybe I'm getting old and outdated but this was some cool technology! Probably the coolest, unique payment system I've ever seen!   There is a food truck on site with some seriously good pasta and appetizer types.   I can't speak to the parking situation since I walked from my location but I do believe there was a small parking lot."

The fun part is you get to see how much you are spend at the same time! The funny part is if you're focusing on your glass pour (just to get it just right) you might look up after a while and notice your tab is $$$ after many many \"maybe just a little\" drinks. I love everything about this small space as well. It is very cozy and perfect for a girls night or a date night. We will 100% be back."

The restaurant is surrounded by shops like coffee, ice cream, clothes , candies, photo hub and a lot more. BUT the most magnetizing place here is the view of the lake and the sunset.   Food: The food was not that special but became one because of the view and people/person you are with. Honestly if only the food we rating here, I'll give 3 not bad but not good as well.   Also expect long wait/line for the restaurant. While waiting we roamed around so we didn't really got bored. There's lot of shops and artist that offer their services like, caricature drawing."

It has always been amazing, and they have expanded it considerably since the fire. The outdoor decks are sprawling, so many places to take in that view. And y'all, it had the absolute most stunning view of Lake Travis.   I just lost my father and was in need of an escape and some fresh air. Today I brought my dad's convertible mustang out (I MAY have gone kinda fast) to have lunch on this perfect blue bird day. I definitely felt his presence out here with me.   My server was so friendly and had the best customer service. I really enjoyed her serving me. I ordered a swirl margarita and chips and queso which were delivered quickly. For lunch I had a mixed fajita with steak and shrimp, refried beans and the fixings. Food was delicious.   I love the art they have installed around the restaurant. Really gorgeous bronze sculptures and we'll appointed gardens.   Thank you for a perfect experience."

                "description": "The Oasis is great for outdoor dining and has an amazing view of Lake Travis, especially during a sunset.  A couple of weeks ago, I visited Austin for a quick weekend getaway.  A small group of us came out for lunch and we didn't have to wait long because it was an early lunch and the weather was a bit cold.    PROS:  Even though the water level was a bit low, the view of Lake Travis was AMAZING!  Make sure to sit outside to be able to enjoy the view.  During the summer, it's worth it to make reservations during the sunset to get the most out of your experience.  The wait staff are super friendly and are attentive to all your needs.  CONS:  I will echo some of the other reviews on here and say the food is mediocre Tex-Mex at best.  We ordered the shrimp tacos, fish tacos and beef fajitas.  The tacos are decently seasoned, but the rice and beans are a bit bland and the dish overall was a bit cold.  The fajitas did come out nice and hot and the meat was seasoned well.  I will definitely be ordering the fajitas for the next time.  The drinks and desserts we ordered:  an Irish coffee, the Fantasy Chocolate Cake (which is a flourless chocolate) and the flan.  The Chocolate cake was surprisingly delicious while the flan was a bit too thick for my liking, but the flavor is really good.  The area surrounding the restaurant also has eclectic artwork to look at as well as small retail shops to explore.  Due to Covid each store has limited hours so you may want to call ahead to see if they're open.  Overall, it's a great area to sight see in Austin.  Especially if it's your first time."

To my surprise it was something grand. Absolutely gorgeous views of the lake and the more upscale houses Austin has to offer.   My brother and my parents had had a bite to eat prior to coming here, but I had not. I went shopping a the Domain and they had gone eating. From what I have heard, The Oasis is good for drinking, but not so good for eating. Their food is honestly sub par at best.   We ordered some drinks and chips and guac for the table. But I wanted something a little more in my stomach. I got the grilled shrimp tacos. They were good. But I have definitely had better. The only thing was that they were super spicy. I was not expecting them to be that spicy. All of a sudden my tongue was sweating and I was uncomfortable with that.   This is a must stop for the views. The views are outstanding. But the food was not the best. The mojito I had was strong. It was like one sip and I was already feeling it."

                "description": "The Oasis on Lake Travis is one of those tricky places where you have to average out the good with the bad to get a good idea of the place.  The good:  No question about it, the sunset is second to none, awesome views, awesome picturesque scene, and just about all of the outdoor seating has a great view of the scene. An additional positive, is the parking.  Easy to get to, plenty of free parking for the complex they are in, and even has valet parking if you prefer not to walk the 100 yards to the restaurant.  The not so good: I don't want to say the food was necessarily bad, it was just mediocre Mexican cuisine with a relatively small selection compared to your normal Mexican place.  To go along with the mediocre food is a price of about 1.5-2x what you would typically pay, but again you are here for the view not the food. The service also was not bad, but I think \"nonchalant\" would be the best way to describe it.  So the real question, would I recommend it? Yes I would but just go into it with the right mindset that you are going for the view, you are paying for the view and you will not be disappointed!  I would probably not go back if I am in Austin, but I am glad we went once."

                "description": "I don't get the hate. Are the prices high? Yes, but you're paying for the view/ambiance, not necessarily the food. Having said that, the food quality is pretty good and the service has always been good for me (though we are admittedly only there for weekend lunch service since we always have kids).   My shrimp tacos were well flavored and a good (yet not overflowing) portion. Menu wise they could definitely work on their beer selection - need more craft beers and some varied selection of beer styles."

                "description": "My friends and I wanted a nice dinner on one of our last nights in Austin. We got to Oasis on a Sunday night about 45 min before sunset and were told the wait would be about 30 min for outdoor seating. We ended up getting seated in like 15 min. The views here are truly unmatched and pictures don't do it justice.  We went to Oasis with the mindset that we were mostly going for the views and not really the food, given the reviews. However, we were actually pleasantly surprised that the food wasn't that bad - overpriced, yes, but not terrible if you get things other than the tacos.  We got quesadillas and burgers. The quesadilla was very tasty and came with some guac, salad, and even queso! My one friend got the burger which was good but a little overcooked. The fries it came with were perfectly crispy and seasoned.  Service was good - our server was running late initially, but sent someone over to give us some waters. Afterwards, they were attentive checking in on us.  Overall exceeded our expectations, especially on a busy weekend. Would definitely come again!"

                "description": "The views you get from this restaurant are incredible! I highly recommend sitting outside.  I've been here a couple of times, but for some reason today was extra tasty! I just ordered a cheese quesadilla, with all the toppings on the side, and some chips and queso. Both were delicious! Honestly, they were the best cheese quesadillas I've ever had, and this is coming from an extremely picky eater who lives off of things like cheese quesadillas and cheese pizza; I've tried a lot of different cheese quesadillas and these were THE best. Tons of cheese, and the blend of whatever cheeses they used work so well together. The queso was creamy and rich. I couldn't get enough of either!!  The service was super quick and I didn't have any issues with rude behavior, like I see a lot of in the reviews. I guess it just depends what day you go? I came on a Sunday at about 3pm, and there were plenty of tables along with fast and friendly service.  The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because I do agree with other Yelpers on the pricing being a little high. But only for certain items. (Check the menu out online beforehand if you're curious)  I definitely recommend you try this place at least once and judge for yourself on whether it's worth while or not; it definitely is to me!"

                "description": "The views of Lake Travis from The Oasis make the trip here worthwhile. Definitely seems like a touristy spot serving very average Tex-Mex. Our server was excellent despite the kitchen messing up our order and how hectic/busy it was even for a Thursday night. Food came out before the drinks, and the children's' food came out much later than the adults' food. The shrimp tacos were surprising good (4/5). The fajitas weren't bad (3/5) but due to the current onion recall, it was missing onions and just didn't feel the same. I had the frozen mango margarita which was strong and not too sweet.   Food: 3.5/5 Service: 5/5 Views: 5/5"

                "description": "At Oasis on Lake Travis the view is absolutely breathtaking and super relaxing to enjoy the Sun and view. First time here and this place is jam packed with people before dinner rush. I came here around 4:30pm and all of the outside tables were full. The wait was about 45 minutes. I went to get a strawberry margarita at the bar and walked down to the below deck to enjoy the view. It was so relaxing!!! (The strawberry margarita mixture was extremely sweet and over priced. Personally I wouldn't order that again.)   Skip forward to being seated to our outside table.... Everyone was packed in the area with tables and seats like sardines in a can. I had to be careful not to hit the person sitting behind me when fulling my chair out. It was not a comfortable setting at all. I ordered a cheese burger with fries and queso with chips and salsa. The salsa was pretty tasty and the chips were super crispy! The queso needed to be more cheesy. It's melty but oddly isn't cheesy enough. Very strange. The burger was a one star. Not well seasoned and lacking of everything. It was very very very sad. The fries were crispy but came out cold. Service was really great! Our waiter was top notched and provided excellent service. He was attentive and checked on us often. Five stars for service but the food was subpar for such a beautiful view. If you are a foodie and came here for the food.... You will be disappointed. If you don't care to eat and just want to get a over priced snack and drinks to enjoy the view ... this maybe your place."

The food isn't the worst but it's not the best. I'm sure time of day matters. We went earlier in the day so I'm sure that's the best the experience gets. The server was nice and attentive. The fries came cold which was surprising as they just opened less than an hour ago. However, the ambience is good and I know the pandemic tanked many businesses who are struggling to provide staffing which impedes service. When we visit restaurants we have to remember we are still in a pandemic and businesses are recovering."

The menu is small and pretty basic, similar to Tex-mex diner food. We had guacamole and queso for appetizers and shrimp tacos, classic burger and steak fajita for entrees. We also had drinks Tropical Depression and Margarita. I was not impressed by the menu, the taste of the food (lacked flavor) or the drinks (lacked liquor). The service was good and the view. I'd recommend only for the experience but I would not go back."

The food dint look appealing and the drinks seemed over priced. The outdoor is really good overlooking Lake Travis. Awesome view but the food and drinks are not that great. Service is okay. It took them a while to realize we were seated and waited to be attended to. I would recommend skipping this place, bring your own food and enjoy the free views from the adjacent building!"

There is limited seating inside in the AC.   If you are a fan of the Netflix series you will get the \"don't worry it's his sister\" statues that greet you as you arrive.  Their bourbon is on point and it makes for a good old-fashioned. Plus 1 did not care for her initial cocktail a Cosmo. Her second drink was a Cab that for the price point was an excellent wine. It had legs and a smooth finish. It reminded her of a Josh Cab.  There is a pizza parlor on site. We did not partake but it looked like a pretty darn good thin crust pizza.  Barkeeps are friendly and knowledgeable. A return trip is definitely on the horizon.  Pro tip: It's a hard turn at their entrance on a fast stretch of Hwy so use your blinker!"

Treaty Oak is the kind of place that you want to spend the entire day at, and you totally can! What I love about it too is that it's a massive space with so much to do while on the grounds. It even has a playground where the kids can play, and an indoor space with plenty of TVs to watch football on game day.  We started off with a tasting, which you can either do Gin or Whiskey. I actually highly recommend the tasting, it's only $10 a person but gives some great background on how each different flavor/bottle is created and made. You also can put the $10 towards a bottle if you end up wanting to buy one to take home.  We then went into the bar area and got drinks, which is a huge variety of cocktails! They have plenty of picnic tables, and multiple boards for cornhole on the grounds. The restaurant on site it BBQ and was amazing! We got the brisket sandwich and pork sandwich and loved them both. What I also loved about it, was that there's multiple places where you can get drinks, foods, etc. on the grounds but your tab stays open for everything. Love this place and highly recommend making a day trip out of it if you haven't been!"

                "description": "Treaty Oak Distillery in Dripping Springs is a great Texas distillery getting most things to make their bourbon and gin from around Texas. It has great covered patios and outdoor space throughout the property with a delicious restaurant- Alice's Restaurant, a tasting room, and a covered bar/lounge as well as an outdoor stage and small playground. We did the tour and tasting which allowed us to see the inner workings of the distillery. Cody was an excellent tour guide answering all our random questions as he showed us around the distillery. And I bought an old barrel, which I have wanted in my house for quite some time. I would highly recommend you get over there...today! Such a great time. Thanks Treaty Oak!!"

                "description": "I want to give this business a better review but unfortunately they had some major issues.  We went last weekend on Sunday and there was a sign to scan the QR code the for menu, we waited in a long line to order food, once everyone got to the cashier she told us that only the brunch menu was being served (it was like 2pm or something).   So everyone had to quickly change their order!   Talk about poor communication!! It should say on the menu very clearly what's being served.   Then, I tried to order vegetarian nachos but my cashier told me they were sold out of beans and that I should just get chips and queso instead, so I did. THEN my brother in law who ordered after me got his nachos which were vegetarian bean nachos (not meat like he ordered). I said \"they told me they were sold out!\" Again, bad communication.  Then, my brother in law ordered sangria and got a big pitcher, my dad went to order the same thing and they gave him HALF the size. So weird and confusing.   This place seems very confused internally and each worker seems to have their own message.  Also nothing for gluten-free vegans on the menu."

So much space for you, your kids, and your dog! Bring the family! LoL  It was actually recommended to me at my last stop, and I love me some bourbon and whiskey so it was a no brainer. However, if bourbon isn't your thing they also have options for the gin, vodka and non alcoholic lovers in your group! Something for everyone I'd say!   That being said, I took off a star mostly because the line was stupid long. They definitely could have, and should have had more than just one single file line for us to get a drink, I spent half my time in line.   That being said though, once I got my drink and was able to enjoy the drink and the vibe it was great! They have live music and a restaurant if you get hungry and I ended up getting the day tripper drink! I loved it, it was so good. I will definitely be back!"

If you don't get the brisket nachos, you're making the biggest mistake of your life. But don't eat too much, or you'll be too full for the delicious drinks!   The vibe is relaxed, the food feels almost TOO good for the rustic setting and the live music is pure Texas charm. I could stay here all day!"

The food at the restaurant was pretty decent, if a little expensive. The staff inside the restaurant are very friendly, but it all seems very inefficient.  The reason for the 3 star review is really that both of the drinks we ordered were cocktails that are premade and then dispensed. They were....ok? A little too sweet and a lot too weak. I couldn't taste the whiskey/bourbon in either of them. For $9/drink at a distillery, I just expected better drinks made to order and I left feeling disappointed. If we had known the drinks we ordered were batch cocktails, we would have tried to order something else, but there was nothing on the menu to denote that."

I'd been invited out there for a friends birthday and the idea of heading all the way to Dripping Springs on a hot Saturday afternoon to try bourbon (which in general all tastes like burning to me) wasn't really my idea of a great time. Man, I was wrong. First off, they have a wide selection of spirits, everything from gin and vodka to wine and beer. The setting is bucolic with wide open spaces and clusters of shade trees. A friendly staff, great bbq (try the brisket nachos) and some tasty signature cocktails (try the Pineapple Express) made for a great afternoon that turned into a lovely evening. Did I mention they also had live music? I will be back."

Just about 30-40 minutes outside of Austin lies this beautiful distillery. There's so much space and more than enough seating but even on the weekends this place can get pretty busy. As for food you can expect Texas bbq from this place as I tried both the brisket and Turkey which were both very good. If your not a booze person they also have their own in house wines and beer but if you do like a good cocktail I'd recommend hill country dreaming. Im anticipating come back here to check this place out in the evening for some live music or Sunday brunch!"

Parking was ample and so were the picnic tables! We didn't do a tour but put our name in for lunch at the restaurant, Alice's. It was about a thirty minute wait on a Saturday around 1, which really went unnoticed because we just grabbed drinks at the Cocktail Bar and sat in the open seating area until they called us saying it was ready. There was live music, lots of space and tables , cornhole, and you could go do a distillery tour too.   The bartenders were helpful in finding a gluten free drink option for me, as well as our waitress at Alice's. Our waitress was especially friendly and attentive--didn't get her name but a recent HS grad going to UT! She made sure to ask about gluten and dairy free options for me, and there were plentiful. Everyone devoured their food and were happily satisfied. I had a delicious club sandwich on gluten free bread with some salt and pepper chips. SO good. I also loved the white sangria.   All in all, I am so glad we found it and the bride said it was the perfect way to spend our day. We definitely will be back!"

On my search online, I found Texas Hill Country Olive Company in Dripping Springs. The timing might not have been the best since the arctic freeze affected the olive trees. We did see both mission and arbequina a year and a half old olive trees. Under the shade of the oak tree and a breeze, we sat to listen to Cara (one of the owners) share the history of how their family business started. With a brief visit with the resident chickens we headed indoors for the abridged version of the mill tour. Finally understood how extra virgin olive oil is made and not to ever buy light olive oil!  After the olive orchard and mill tour, we joined the tasting tour ($10). There were so many varieties of olive oil and balsamic vinegar and flavor profiles similar to wine tasting. I loved getting to combine the balsamic vinegar with the olive oil and tasting with the bread and apple.  It was fun shopping at the store. Goodness with making choices though! I knew I definitely wanted their olive-based products.  Next time we'll have to stay and enjoy some lunch."

                "description": "You know how back in the day folks had a milkman? Well, I wanted a piece of that nostalgia but don't drink milk. What I do consume a decent amount of, though, is olive oil, so I went about getting myself a mOOn (yes, I did just combine man and olive oil and no, I'm not ashamed of it).   Really, I was low on olive oil and missed my window for my grocery delivery so took the opportunity to support local and explore Texas Hill Country Olive Co.'s offerings.  The website is super easy to navigate and they have a wide variety of olive oil and vinegars, along with bundles of multiple if you don't know where to start. I received my order within a two-day window during the week from Xmas to NYE, without opting for any expedited shipment, so that was a lovely surprise.  I am a fan of anything chili or jalapeno, so I opted for their jalapeno-infused OO, along with two standard olive oils just to have on hand. The 100ml bottles run $12 each, not including shipping (my 250ml that I usually get from Imperfect Produce is $4.79), so a pretty stark contrast in price. I used the jalapeno on popcorn the other night, as well as toasted bread, and it didn't really have any kick to it, which was disappointing. I was hoping that for the price, it would be a boombastic flavor ball, so I could justify its purchase and continue to patronize from my mOOn.   I am so happy I could support local, and maybe if I visited the estate, I would have a better appreciation for the product, but as a stand alone, I most likely won't be ordering again."

                "description": "The place is really not worth visiting unless you're coming out for the tours. It's a gift shop where you can already buy mostly everything online to begin with. The restaurant menu is terribly overpriced for what you're getting on the plate. Think margherita pizza but at the size of a standard flour tortilla.  My recommendation is to save your money, go straight to the olive oil section in the store, buy in bulk, go home and create your own tray of olive oils and eat it however way you want to enjoy it.   The olive oils are exceptional by the way. Infused garlic, rosemary and sola stella were my favorite. If you're into balsamic, the strawberry infusion was a surprise crowd-pleaser in our house.   3/5 stars for the giftshop/restaurant location. If this was a review specifically for the olive oil, I would rate it much higher."

                "description": "I don't understand this place. It is basically a gift shop and a small restaurant. I wonder where the olives come from to make their myriad of products? Doest seem like the olive tree orchard is producing enough olives for more than a few martinis! We were greeted kindly at the door but there is really nothing to see here. We were expecting an opportunity to sample some of the products before purchasing but no tastings were offered or on display. So we are back to the fact that you drove here to enter a gift shop. Hmmm  p.s. I see after reading reviews thst perhaps large trees died last winter which is sad. It also appears that tastings are offered here but the kind lady who greeted us did not mention them sonperhaps they are scheduled or have been stopped for covid so check before you come so you aren't dissapointed like we were."

I bought several gift boxes for friends and colleagues; everyone was very excited to receive them. They also sell pesto artichokes in a glass jar packages with a cute wooden spreader. Shopping locally was a personal goal of mine this year. I thought this place was perfect! They gifted me a box of very delicious butter pecan cookies when they rang me up. I ate all of it in two mins... couldn't even remember what brand it was."

                "description": "Beautiful property although the olive trees look like they didn't survive the snowpocypse. You can walk around the property. Staff are very friendly. Supposedly the owner picks the grapes and they have a few types of wine that gets made somewhere else. Can't tell you how it is since I didn't feel like purchasing a glass or bottle. They don't do wine tastings anymore although there is a sign out front.   Their olive oil and balsamic vinegar was tasty on fresh bread. The flat bread was just that... flat. To a crisp. The margarita flavor meant some cheese and basil but not really any tomato flavor. Wouldn't recommend the flatbreads. It was a good idea but poorly executed."

I am in LOVE with this spot.  I went last week for my Birthday with Brother and Sister-in-law.  It was wonderful.  The olive oil is probably the best I have ever had, I ended up buying a bunch of olive oil after lunch.  We sat for two plus hours, eating, drinking and just enjoying the scenery.  We were so incredibly lucky because the weather was amazing, and there was a beautiful breeze so it was cool and comfortable.  We had a variety of different sandwiches and anti-pasta...everything was to die for!  I can't wait to go back.  What an incredible GEM."

We bought bread and olives and had a flight of olive oils to taste with small pieces of bread. They serve wine and beer too. The bistro had already closed but we will definitely be back. The staff was friendly and informative. We even walked into the olive grove to see the baby trees up close. The Sicialian olives with garlic are amazing. We also bough feta cheese olives. The caramel sauce we bought went great with Frederick peaches we bought on the way home. We also had some delicious Gelato which was cold enough to take to go."

                "description": "This was our first visit to Texas Hill Country Olive company. The employees were very friendly and explained the ordering process. We were able to snag a couple rocking chairs on their front patio and enjoy the beautiful weather. The Salumi plate was one of the more interesting charcuterie boards I've ever tried. The cheeses were on point, some sharp and others soft with herbs and spices. It could have used a bit more jam and crackers overall. The view off the porch was worth the stop itself. Would definitely recommend trying when in the area and I'm sure a tour would be fun when the trees are in season. I was disappointed they didn't have olive oil tastings going on due to Covid, but I also understand."

We've always wanted to do olive oil tastings and orchard tours in Italy, so were happy to find this until then. Unfortunately, due to the pandemic they aren't doing tastings at the moment. You can buy all the oils, as well as many other foodie items in their store. They also have a bistro with a nice menu, we came after eating lunch so didn't get to try anything. We tasted a few wines and thought they were okay, a little too acidic for our palates. The highlight was walking through the orchard and seeing the olive trees. I'd like to come back before the olives are harvested."

We did the orchard tour which was ~45min of walking around the olive trees and learning more about the process of growing and processing olive oil, as well as the different varieties. Our tour guide was great - very friendly and knowledgeable!  The tastings are cancelled due to the CORONA restrictions but we had a lovely lunch in their shaded outdoor patio. Highly recommend the olive oil and olives platter.  Speaking of COVID, great to see everyone wearing masks and the business itself enforcing the regulations. Felt very safe walking around and eating there.  And, of course, we couldn't leave without purchasing some of the delicious extra virgin olive oil and balsamic (which is not made there but commissioned from the special region in Italy).  Would highly recommend, especially if you have friends or family visiting in town. It's a short 40-50min drive from Austin."

We arrived for an early lunch and got their charcuterie board to split along with an egg salad sandwich that came with a salad. It was a cold day out, so I ordered a cup of the tomato basil soup as well. OH EM GEE this is the best egg salad I've ever had!! It was Mayo-free and used their garlic olive oil instead. I got a bottle to try and recreate it at home. The grounds were beautiful. There was a pumpkin patch along with all the vegetables they grow on site. The employees were all so friendly as well. If you're ever in the area, swing by and give them a visit! It's definitely worth the trip."

The view of olive trees covered in fruits for an upcoming harvest, the cute shop with must-buy oils and breads and cookies and the super friendly staff set us up for great expectations. And they surpassed them. The focaccia was light and airy and flavorful- a combo of traits i wasn't expecting in bread. The side salad with its basil olive oil lightly coating the freshest greens left me longing for more. So i bought the oil. We split some Flatbread and a muffuletta and both were scrumptious. I tried to talk my husband in going back the next day but we had to get on the road. Make this place a stop. It is kid friendly too. I never knew how beautiful olive trees were but it made me want to grow"

We barely heard from our waitress/hostess the whole time we were there.   The wine was just disgusting and overpriced. Of the bottles we purchased, the pinot grigio was the only decent one, which wasn't even made by this winery.   There are MANY better options, who actually enjoy and appreciate your patronage...keep driving!"

I never got the receipt. Saw the charge on my cc bill which did not seem to make sense. I emailed them and then called them requesting a receipt to be sent to my email. Apparently, when they charged me, a 20% tip was automatically added by default to the TOTAL (including the wine bottles that I purchased) . Not just to the tasting. I called and spoke to them Bc I felt that this was not appropriate. I don't mind tipping on the service but on the wine bottles that I am purchasing to take home?? I was pretty much told by the staff tough luck. I have been to many tastings in the past and this was definitely new for me. It's not the end of the world but it's the principles..you know. Definitely will not be back and would not recommend to anyone."

                "description": "Beautiful estate. The owner came over and talked to us and was so sweet and pleasant to talk to. The woman, Lauren, who walked us through our tasting was equally as sweet, friendly, and knowledgable of all their wines- which were delicious. Very light reds, European style. So if you're into more California/west coast style wines, it'll be a bit different for you. If you're looking to do a large party I'd recommend giving them a call in advance to help set up for your group to give you the best experience possible. Large space, beautiful building, yet feels very cozy. Definitely a great spot to hit on your day trip through wine country in the Hill Country. (Their Sangiovese and Cab 2015 were incredible.)"

                "description": "Nice little place but nothing to really write home about. We arrived on a Saturday afternoon and unfortunately there were at least 2 bridal parties there.  It was very loud in the tasting area and it appeared they had only 2-3 people working.  They mentioned they had not expected such a large influx of people.  They did their best, but it was very hard to hear and they were bouncing back and forth between a lot of people trying to pay and split checks and do pours, etc.  Yes, the pours were very small and it was $15 each which is kind of pricey for that size and the wines that to me were very light.  I like bold flavors, not fruity and these were not bad, but not worth the price for me.  If there had not been so many people and it be so loud it might have been a little better, but we will not go back- crowded or not."

The wines we tried were unique but not to justify paying 28-48 per bottle, yes it's \"small batch\" but if they're that much the tasting should be comped."

                "description": "Was out in the hill country this weekend with a friend just meandering around during our staycation. We stopped at Jester King before this and just looked for cool places nearby when Solaro Estate popped up on the map. Wine, closeby? Sold.   Since we'd never been there before, we each decided to do a tasting so we could try their 6 best wines. Their whites were crisp and refreshing, but I didn't fancy any of the reds. I usually love pretty much all reds and favor them much more than whites, so there's a good chance my tastebuds were just all out of whack this weekend.  When we finished our tastings, it was raining cats and dogs out, so we decided to have a full glass of white and sit outside to watch and listen to the rain fall on their tin roof patio. It was glorious, even when the rain got so intense that literally everyone else who was outside went inside to hide from the aggressive mist. Since my friend and I are classy AF, we were in workout clothing and makeup-less, so we didn't mind the rain one bit. It was extremely peaceful, and seeing the gorgeous rows of grape vines behind the veil of rain was a memory I won't soon forget.   I'll be back for sure!"

                "description": "I just recently moved from Switzerland, and was surrounded by fantastic wine tasting experiences.  I was nervous about trying Texan wine, but started my Texan wine experience at Solaro after having read many different experiences about the local vineyards around the Dripping Springs area.   The tasting room is located in the vineyard, which is great. I love that this is a small production place, with a family oriented feeling, and the staff are knowledgeable about the wine and production.  I guess the owners can often be found in the tasting room, but just happened to be away the Saturday we went.  They often have events, and we were enjoying one of their Saturday live music events from 2-4pm.  They have a great indoor and outdoor seating area full of charm.    For $10 per person you can enjoy a tasting of their varietals.  There was nothing that was bad, but from the tasting list, I enjoyed the Miscela Bianco the best. After enjoying all their selections, I signed up for their annual wine club, which was a great deal, and then was able to taste some of their higher quality more expensive wines, which were great.  I look forward to going back and touring the vineyard, as a benefit of being a member.  We also signed up for the grape stomping that will be taking place in the next couple of weeks as they need a bunch of people.  What a great opportunity to be part of a grape harvest!  I could have spent several hours just hanging out here. I only wish they had some food to enjoy with the wine and music.  Next time I will remember to bring my own picnic.    I am very happy to have been proven wrong regarding my concerns about Texan wine! Thank you Solaro!"

I would come back again but not to fast for many wineries are available in the area. Very expensive for average wine. I felt my husband and I were having to hear a full explosive bragging about the winery and we didn't have the time to sit and enjoy our wine. We ordered the small plate of cheese and breads very tiny late serving us and felt they are money hungry and desperate to sell you anything over inflated and sadly I have to tell it like it is reason for my review to tell all what is happening at this winery.SO if you feel compelled to come to this winery visit and try to enjoy your wine over a not so interesting view. Furthermore the owner learning I write reviews on Yelp made it clear we are not taken seriously. Wow what a blow."

At first glance, this place looks promising, but by the end of the day my party of six all felt robbed by the service and awful wine tasting we endured.  We spent less than 10 minutes at the winery and at $16.50 each for five tiny pours, we all wondered if we would have been better off going to Walmart and buying a bottle of $16.00 Yellow Tail. So disappointing. Don't waste your time."

It's a shared space with Wine for the People, just off Fitzhugh Road, which is quickly becoming a brewery/distellery/winery Mecca.   Whether you like white, rosé, or red, CL Butaud has what you want. Light and clean white wines. Crisp, but not sweet rosés. Love the BIG, BOLD reds. The Grenache and Tempranillo are both awesome! My favorite is the Cease and Desist, a 50/50 blend of Syrah and Tempranillo.   We've been tasting wine for years near and far. This is the way it should be done. Best experience ever. Reservations encouraged. Get your own picnic table outside and enjoy your stay. The sommeliers are friendly and knowledgeable. The winemaker, Randy Hester, will likely visit with you and share his philosophy and insight into the process. 100% Texas grown grapes.   Dog friendly. Outdoor games and food trucks forthcoming. Did I mention I'm so happy they've opened a tasting room!"

                "description": "I soooo enjoyed my wine tasting at Texas AVA, which is a shared tasting room with CL Butaud and Wine for the People.    First, the outdoor space is great.  There are about nine picnic benches, well distanced, and most of them are covered/in the shade so you aren't baking in the Texas sun.  There were also nice design touches and little decorations, such as  tablecloths and flowers on the table, so the space felt very picturesque.  Next, there are three options for tasting: all CL Butaud wines, all Wine for the People wines, or a \"duo flight\" so you can try wines from both winemakers.  I brought my mother with me to the tasting and we decided to both get the duo flight.  I enjoyed all the wines we tasted, but my favorites were the Sparkling Chenin Blanc (Wine For The People), the Pa Pa French Rose (CL Butaud), and the Carbonic Petite Sirah (Wine For The People) (we added that last one on to our wine tasting, even though it wasn't included in the flight we chose).  What made the tasting even more special, beyond the outdoor space and the wines themselves, is that both winemakers were on site and pouring the wines.  We had the opportunity to talk to each of them, which made our afternoon feel like a very special experience.  You can tell they both have such passion for their wines and their passion is infectious.  We ended up buying five bottles of wine and I'm seriously considering joining one or both of their wine clubs.  If you are looking for a spot to hang out with friends and family and taste great Texas wines, I highly recommend visiting the Texas AVA tasting room.  I've already told my friends about it and I am planning another visit very soon!"

We tried both CL and Wine for the People and there was not a bad wine to be had. We organized a large group to celebrate a birthday and they took great care of us. We were impressed by both the wine and the service. Thank you so much to the lovely staff and wine makers there!"

                "description": "Finally I was able to make it out to the distillery with my good friend early on a Saturday so that we could get some direct tasting vodka notes from Deep Eddy themselves rather than me taking shots at bars around Austin.  Parking was easy for us but do note that we showed up around 11:20AM on a Saturday so we didn't have any issues.  The later you arrive parking could be a thing and you may have to wait/stalk someone who is leaving to get a spot. Also as the day got later there were many buses and charter vans parked in the front and roundabout chilling out as the company they are driving around are inside getting down too.  Cocktails in a paper cup runs $8 with plenty to choose from the menu that is thoughtfully laid out in sweet, sours, spicy, etc. A nice mason jar with the Deep Eddy logo is $12 and slightly larger.  Do know that they will not refill your mason jar after you buy your first one so be prepared to be clanking around the distillery with your extra mason jars if you keep going the $12 route. Also be careful with your glass too - I saw many people let that mason jar slip out of their hands and the mason jar just crash on the concrete floor. So sad! Also frozen drinks / cocktails can only be purchased downstairs so be ready to wait in a little line if it is busy.   Loved the areas to sit inside the tasting room and even in the 2nd large downstairs area.  The pillows, decor, and the small touches around the sitting areas on the first floor are super cute and selfie-worthy.  I can imagine in the winter, with the large fireplace going, this space is cozy AF!  We didn't go outside at all as it was super hot in July but it looked like there are plenty of tables, shade, and seating for some large groups both in the front, side, and back areas.  After 2 cocktails in a mason jar we were feeling a good buzz and knowing we still had to trek back home (south Austin) we cut it off there. By the time we left around 2pm the place was buzzing with people, all 3 bars had 10+ waiting to be served, and I wasn't planning on waiting to close my tab in a long line.  I was super surprised to find out you can close your tab at the merch area with the cashier there so don't fret and add in that mug, stickers, shirts, bar additions, and Deep Eddy cool pool lady in red signage to your basket to check out while you close out your tab. You will save yourself some time and be out of there in a jiffy!  We plan to come back especially now knowing they are opened on Thursdays at 11am!!!!"

My favorite is probably the peach vodka and they have many cocktails to choose from. We went on a Sunday where there were local vendors there too as well as live music. Head to Dripping Springs for the great tasting room. Unfortunately, the distillery near Buda is not one that is open to the public, so the tasting room is where to go."

                "description": "Like I was saying earlier, I find tasting rooms gimmicky and this one is a perfect example of it.   We chose to come here because I have deep respect for Deep Eddy as a company for their commitment and contributions to the local community. They've gone above and beyond again and again. Respect!  The tasting room is a large hall, with flights consisting of tiny cups of flavored vodka. You don't taste the actual spirit because the fruity flavors are so sweet.   The \"Colombian\" food options on-site is a joke. It's an old school concession stand (movie theater of the 80s style) with heat lamps keeping nacho chips warm on a folding table. Don't expect tacos or empanadas.  The space, both indoors and outdoor, is quite large. And they have a cute performance stage inside.  We stayed a total of 15 minutes."

Bartenders are very friendly and fast but the drinks are simply made and during Covid they are all touching the mint in their hands by smacking it. Id rather a gentle crush/roll in a glass... felt a bit gross (others commented too).  Wish there was live music Saturday afternoon at 4  Games outside like giant connect 4 etc  Parking- gets full on weekends so a bit tight  The decor was cute  Sheriff at the door to handle anyone getting a little too cray"

The set-up is gorgeous and feels so clean when you walk in. You get a behind the scenes taste of where the best Texas vodka comes from. The staff was kind and knowledgeable. They answered any questions we had about the drinks. I ordered a $10 flight and my Husband got the Orange dreamcicle drink. You have the option to get your drink in a mason jar as a keep sake.  There is a great gift shop on site, so we got matching shirts because we are cheesy like that.  There was a delicious food truck out front that had Vegan and Meat Eater options available. I like that they cater to both.   There is so much to do in the surrounding area. We went thrifting and enjoyed the nature that Hill Country has to offer."

We are already big fans of Deep Eddy's vodka and all of their flavors, so we had no doubt we would enjoy our time there. The cocktails they serve at their bar are innovative and refreshing. I ordered the Spring Sling and he ordered the Austin Mule. We both enjoyed the drinks next to the patio where they had multiple groupings of chairs spread out on the lawn. Other than drinking, there's not much else to do here, but it's definitely a lively place to enjoy a drink with friends! Our bartender was also very kind and helped us choose the right cocktails for each of us."

The weather was perfect and they have a nice little patio area. The spot is family friendly meaning you can bring your kids, but there isn't a lot for them to do except run around in the patio area. I would have liked if the patio area was fenced off and not open to the parking so I could relax a bit more. I had to keep a close eye to make sure my kid didn't wander off. I enjoyed both of the drinks I tasted and would definitely stop in here to explore more of the tastings, but will likely leave the kid at home next time."

All the staff is friendly and easy-going. Everywhere including the bathrooms were incredibly clean. The cocktails... the cocktails are downright amazing. They're inventive, delicious, and fresh. You're going to have a hard decision to make no matter what kind of drinks you like... I actually ended up ordering two at once because I couldn't decide! On the way out, we stopped at their little gift shop and man do they pack that area with goodies! Talk about variety and options. The shirts are awesome and made very well to boot, and they have tons of other merch. I left with a soft tanktop, a wicked fun tin can that I plan on using for a cactus or succulent vase, a magnet, and a collapsible dog bowl! We'll be back every chance we get. Loved it, loved everything, love the vodka."

The whole group willingly gave our ID's for inspection and the birthday girl's ID was \"questionable\", so she was taken to a cop car by a Sheriff, put in the back and questioned.  While Maddy was at the cop car getting her ID verified, the rest of the group had our full drinks/cups (that we paid for and were able to take home), snatched out of our hands. We all requested a refund for the drinks and were denied??  After the Sherriff verified that Maddy's ID was real, the manager proceeded to threaten tresspassing charges against us??

While the great state of Texas has opened to 100%, this place seems to have missed that memo.  We literally got yelled it for actually standing up at our tables and told that if we do stand to have a mask on.  Additionally, we got yelled at for moving a table.  The guys exact words were \"I'm picky where our furniture is placed.\"  Additionally, if you want to get a beverage, you actually have to MAKE A RESERVATION just to go in get one.  That is ridiculous!  By the way, the Hays County police are on site to enforce all of this over-the-top nonsense.  Most of us stayed for a single drink and then left for better and more fun pastures.  It's obvious that this place has forgotten all about who the consumer is and how we should be treated.  Not only will we never go back, but I am never going to purchase any of their products again.  By the way...the Jeep community here in Texas is very tight-knit and we will talk..."

After a refreshing morning at Krause Springs, we headed to Iron Wolf Ranch and Distillery for lunch and drinks.   They have a wide variety of spirits with several award winning ones. Tiann was great in making our drinks! I had the New Fashion made with Hotscotch (a little sweet and spicy). My husband had the Luna-tic made with vodka and several fruit juices. We enjoyed the drinks while we waited for our lunch from Craigo's. We ordered the specialty pizza (sausage, pepperoni, green peppers, mushrooms and onions) and barbecue wings. Truly phenomenal pizza and wings! We also had the Giddy Up Mary with horseradish-infused vodka and Wild and Tea, an Arnold Palmer with bourbon.   We'll have to come back another time for the tasting and meet Luna, a wolf adopted by the family (she's usually there on Fridays). Most Saturdays they have live music. Definitely check their calendar online."

Hahaha kidding but really this place was awesome, even though it was a day with drizzle still enjoyed it! First off the staff is beyond sweet, so warm and welcoming! The drinks were great and good price! Such a fun vibe with good music. Very mellow way to spend a Sunday afternoon. So happy they had a kids area because both my 8 year old and 2 year old had a blast and stayed busy so I could enjoy a delicious Bloody Mary. They have awesome lawn games to keep busy and a delicious pizza food truck parked on site. We will for sure be back!! Do yourself a favor and pay it a visit it was a lot better than most of the distilleries I've visited."

It has one indoor bathroom and one little pizza truck -which the pizza was Okay- the kids play area is huge tires with again NO shade. Please don't even say you have a play area when the only thing they could climb on are tires that would give them second degree burns. The solo artist singing was probably the only good thing as we also got 3 different drinks and didn't even finish half of it because it was gross."

Very shiny stainless steel still, immaculate polished concrete floors, easily the fanciest metL building I have seen!    And they have good liquor!  The tasting is informative and interesting, even if all of the idetails on the fancy bottles is a bit overwhelming.  But the real wolf is interesting.   Try it al!!  The Giddy'Up (horseradish) vodka is better than it sounds - and it makes a fantastic Bloody Mary!  Several things were good, but you must BUY this - it is excellent!"

My boyfriend and I did the tasting - $8 for a taste of 4 spirits with 6 to choose from:  Corn Vodka - hint of sweetness and great consistency Clear Molasses Rum - not my kinda thing but this was good.  Citrus forward Gin - also not my type of spirit but I actually really liked this. Clean and fresh - perfect for Texas summers! Horseradish Vodka - you really must try the Bloody Mary with this. Yum!  Hotscotch - butterscotch pepper whiskey. We loved this so much we are bringing a bottle home.  Iron Hot - cinnamon pepper whiskey. Good if you're into cinnamon spirits.   We also had two drinks. I had the Bloody Mary with horseradish Vodka and my boyfriend had the wild tea (Arnold Palmer with bourbon). The owners have big plans for this facility and you can tell a great deal of thought and planning has been put into this establishment and spirits. I look forward to watching this place grow and develop. I'll be back next time I'm in the area!"

Nice taste. The other had the special, The Irish Wolf, it was good.  Found out there isn't a full bar, so they are making drinks out of the liquor they distill.  They are engaging, entertaining, try to sell you a tasting but don't oversell if you don't show initial interest which is nice. You can take a tour if you get the tasting.  Great areas all around the distillery to just hang out with friends and chat, or play games, chill and listen to live music or wander around the grounds a bit. Beautiful location to be out in nature. Family friendly place, folks were there with their kids and everyone seemed to be having a good time."

We originally stopped because the BBQ food truck they have on the premises is rated very high, but the liquor turned out to be the real star. Hubby partook in a liquor tasting that cost $10 for multiple samples.  They have some very unique flavors that I've never heard of anyone incorporating in a liquor before.  I ordered a bourbon and lemonade drink that hit the spot in the Texas heat.  This was a Mecca for bachelorette parties and large groups of friends.  There is plenty of room on the property to spread out and enjoy the weather.  They also host concerts on their stage next to the tasting room.  They are planning to expand their offerings here, so stay tuned as to what they build!"

Small but nice distillery has tours and tastings with a large outdoor area for hanging out and a stage for occasional music acts. I didn't play but the frisbee golf looked great.  Rum, gin, fireball, and few other mixed spirits to sample.  I personally liked and purchased the gin. Low juniper the way I like it.  Odd wild eye logo is off putting but very friendly staff."

I had found them via some post on Instagram.  I am very happy we were able to spend time with them.  Anthony gave us the tour but Logan was there as well.  They give you a taste of both of their products while explaining their history and their process.  They have grand ideas on how to move forward as well.  Both men have full time day jobs.  They have done everything for this company.  Including building the building you are standing in.  Extremely interesting.  We have gone to a few distilleries and the tours can be a tad repetitive but this one was very enjoyable.  We are grateful they took the time to give us a tour.  Every minute they are with you they are not working on their business.  I wish them nothing but success. Worth your time if you are in the area and can get an appointment."

The Casitas are so comfortable, spacious for a studio and had all the basics.  We enjoyed evenings on the patio.  We checked out the common area and walked the area---bonus we meet the sweet resort cat!  We will definitely return, hopefully this fall when it's a little cooler and we can enjoy the firepit.  We felt secluded, but close enough to wineries, breweries and restaurants.  We cooked steaks on our grill for our Anniversary and enjoyed a wine tasting at Hawks Shadow, literally around the corner.  My only suggestion (not a complaint) bring a sleep mask if you need dark to sleep late."

                "description": "Our family stayed in #8 and #10 (2 bedrooms each) November 19-21, 2016 for our daughter's wedding about 3 miles down the road at Heritage House. We were very pleased. The McRoberts were helpful and kind from the moment we made our reservation in June until after we had checked out.  My wife and I plan to return in the Spring of 2017 for a fun little getaway.  Our cabins had only been opened *very* recently (a month?), but everything was in order with one exception: both showers in #8 were barely more than lukewarm. They just needed a slight adjustment and this was taken care of very quickly (surely we were actually the first guests to stay in #8). The bathrooms had *plenty* towels and shampoo, conditioner and bath gel was provided.  The kitchen was well stocked with cups, plates, silverware, etc.  The beds were comfortable. The heating unit was a little tricky to figure out and so we were actually a degree or two warmer than what would have been ideal but we will know how to operate them next time.  There was little to no landscaping in place yet but we knew we were staying at a very new facility.  The gorgeous weather we enjoyed that weekend made the lack of landscaping a non-issue for us.  However, there is no asphalt on the property.  The roads and parking areas are crushed stone(?).  I don't know if that would be messy or not on a rainy weekend.  The outdoor furniture on the covered patios is very nice and makes for a very relaxing place to hang out when the weather is good.  Another nice touch is the use of keypad-operated door locks.  It's nice to not have to keep up with a key.  The surrounding area is authentic, beautiful Texas Hill Country.  The Dripping Springs area is booming as a wedding destination but the hospitality industry is lagging way behind the demand for lodging.  So, Hill Country Casitas should have no trouble attracting enough guests to be more than a little bit successful."

                "description": "Absolutely LOVED this place! We recently got married at a venue nearby and had our guests stay at the Casitas. We ended up renting the entire property, so it felt very secluded and private. The whole property was breathtaking! Each Casita was beautifully decorated with spa-like bathrooms that were stocked with all the toiletries you would need, comfy beds, and private patios. The private fireplaces at each Casita was such a great bonus, they were perfect for the cooler weather. The pavilion had a fully equipped kitchen with beautiful views which was great for our rehearsal dinner. Mary and Rob were so great! They made sure our stay was stress-free and relaxing. We were beyond impressed with everything. We will absolutely be back for our 1-year anniversary! Thank you for making our wedding weekend beyond exceptional!"

We rented out all 10 casitas for three days for a mini wedding getaway. I had some funky ideas about what I wanted to do for my wedding and Mary at the casitas was a big part of that. She was amazing. The owners pay crazy attention to detail, they responded to my million emails quickly, and made our stay out there super easy. It is the perfect place to stay whether a romantic vacation or a fun weekend with a big group of people. There is a volleyball court, the most amazing fire pit, an outdoor kitchen that is jaw dropping... I could go on and on. Don't miss out on staying at the casitas! I know we will be back!"

We stayed in #1 and were very impressed with the cleanliness, décor and fabulous mattress and bedding.  Mary obviously splurged on these things and my husband and I were very thankful for the restful sleep we had because of the quality of the mattress and pillows.  We loved sitting on the porch, exploring the property and playing with Frank, the Casita Cat.  Mary was a wonderful host and even brought us freshly brewed coffee and tea when the power went out during a severe thunderstorm.  We will definitely be back soon for another restful weekend in the beautiful Texas Hill Country!"

                "description": "My husband and I stayed in the #1 Casita on Honeymoon Hill at the Hill Country Casitas this past weekend (12/2-12/4) and it was wonderful!  The Casita has a ton of windows with incredible views out of each one and this particular casita is very secluded and romantic.  Also romantic is the free standing tub for two and the dual head shower!  The facilities are dog friendly and our dog had a great time.  It was raining over the weekend but it was still a great get-away and we just enjoyed the outdoor fireplace most of the time.  It is only a short trip from Austin but you feel like you're miles away.  Each Casita has a kitchenette, very nicely stocked with essentials, which makes it convenient if you want to cook.  We stopped at the Salt Lick on the way out there; picked up some BBQ and enjoyed that all weekend.  The winery across the street, Hawk's Shadow, has some great wine for tasting too."

                "description": "Hill Country Casitas located in Texas Wine Country!  It's a hidden gem...an oasis of tranquility...And, so close to the finest Texas Wineries!  I recently stayed in Casita #7 solo the 3rd weekend of November.  The Casita was an absolute love nest!  Beautifully finished...And, luxuriously appointed.  The Casita begins and ends with a lovely porch - including seating and a wood burning fireplace.  It can be quite the gathering spot or place for quiet reflection.    From the porch the Casita has two double door entries - one to the kitchen and living room and the other to the bedroom.  In the morning I enjoyed drawing all the curtains and opening the double doors from the bedroom.  The views were spectacular.  The kitchen has everything you need - with the exception of an oven (you'll find that in the pavilion - plus, there are gas grills on the property as well) and groceries.  The owners do go above and beyond by supplying spices, olive oil, coffee creamer, tea.  Prior to my arrival - I purchased fruit, veggies, salami, crackers, cheeses, olives, and water.  This was great with my wine!!!  The living room is quite comfortable with a lux leather sofa for relaxing chats....but, I spent most of my time out on the lovely porch.  The bedroom is a dream!  The comfortable bed with bedding that had the perfect weight!  I haven't slept that well in months!  The bathroom is just beautiful!  Dual Sinks and Dual Showerheads...Can I say love nest again?  You must try the wonderful toiletries (the scents are amazing)!  Make it a special day...enjoy a picnic with a glass of wine - I did!  Mary and Ron have placed their heart and soul into Hill Country Casitas and it's easy to see!  I can't wait to visit again!!!  What I loved: The accommodation was self-catering and private.  I enjoyed company and also had an opportunity to enjoy just me!  Absolute relaxation!  It was an opportunity to \"check out\" vs. \"checking in\" to a commercial hotel.  Recommendations: Fly into AUS and rent a car and be sure to arrive prior to sunset.  Don't purchase the toll package - it's not necessary.  *When returning your car to AUS stop at the Shell off Hwy 71. https://www.aroundairports.com/map/?iata_code=AUSandtoaddr=2453+Highway+71+E+Del+Valle%2CTXandname=Shellandcat=gas  Stop at H-E-B grocery store for provisions (you will not be close to a store).  *H-E-B is a full service grocery store and pharmacy that happens to be a Celiac's gluten free haven too! https://www.heb.com/heb-store/US/tx/dripping-springs/dripping-springs-h-e-b-611  Recommended Wineries:   Kuhlman Cellars had the most impressive wine tasting.  It was very informative with regard to food pairings - Ask for Oscar.  Special Note:  Call ahead and they will accommodate for food allergies. http://www.kuhlmancellars.com/.  Barons Creek Vineyards had the best tasting wines. Special Note: Picnics are allowed!  http://www.baronscreekvineyards.com/  Compass Roads Cellars has \"Charles!\" I still have hearts in my eyes! https://store.compassrosecellars.com/"

Wood burning fireplace and since they are her favorite, S'mores and coffee. Best bathroom of most anywhere I've stayed. Big comfy bed with a view. Kitchen just the right size. And the pavilion area is gorgeous. Loved sitting in the La Capilla (little chapel). Loved the Hawk's Shadow winery around the corner. I'll come again when I can stay longer!"

                "description": "I recently had the opportunity to spend the night in one of these lovely Casitas. Needless to say the experience was delightful. The small touches throughout exemplify hospitality at its finest, from the binder with local info and hotspots, the ice cold water in the fridge, and to the cream, sugar and coffee so thoughtfully provided, it was the little things that made the stay so much sweeter.  They say the stars are big and bright deep in the Heart of Texas well that is so true out in the middle of the Hill Country. After spending a lovely evening next door at a local Winery (yay, Hawk Shadow!)  listening to some lovely music, I spent some quality time staring into the universe, enjoying the solitude.   I had a wonderful  night's sleep on the most exquisite sheets that smelled so delightful. The silence was quite deafening in its totality out here in the countryside. I know there were other people on the property but it did feel like an oasis. I woke up refreshed and spent the morning watching the sun rise over the hills with a hot cup of coffee in my hand savouring the crisp fall morning. While the property is still in the process of blooming, Mary and Ron were the consummate hosts, making sure I had everything I needed to enjoy my stay. I am looking forward to returning in the future for a much longer visit."

Friday night, however, our car sprang a gas leak, and we had to cancel. We were pretty bummed to be missing what seemed like a good weekend trip, but what bummed us out even more was that when we tried to reschedule, the staff at the Inwood Estates Vineyards at The Vineyard at Florence told us that they were going to pull the fine print on the voucher and tell us that the deal was subject to forfeiture if we didn't show up for our reservation that day. I know that it was included in the language that I agreed to when I bought the voucher, so that's why two stars instead of one, but really? I know that online voucher customers don't give you the highest profit margin when it comes to customers, but I always thought the whole point of offering those deals as a business was to gain new customers, not lose them. And lose us they did. I don't expect the red carpet, but just a little friendliness and understanding for an unexpected snag. By contrast, we also had to bail on a movie at the Alamo Drafthouse in Austin because of the car, we gave them just 30 minutes notice, and they comped us two free tickets, told us to reschedule for any time we like and wished us luck in getting the car taken care of. That's how you treat a customer like they're wanted, not by telling them they're not welcome unless they pay you again."

Was supposed to have some wine and cheese education( the wine was extra and stated so on the coupon,so we knew to expect that). The event was supposed to start at 11:30 but started at 12:05 so the guy doing the class could joke around with a cowroker and set up what should have been readied for us. The guy knew next to nothing about wine and read from a piece of paper in a monotone. My husband is a cellar master and couldn't believe some of the stuff this idiot was saying. They then gave us a sandwich in a plastic box that I think came right from HEB, since it included one of their brownie bites. Included were 4 old grapes and 6 almonds, 2 ounces of tasteless macaroni salad. I would have thought they would want to showcase their food since they told us they were planning to do some dinners. They do have some nice wines  but you can get much better treatment at many other vineyards in the area."

(And yes - there are some ghost stories - look for the skull built into the rocks on the wall!) There is a nice outdoor area as well, although it was windy, so I opted to stay inside.   We came on a quiet weekday before Christmas, so I was able to get a tasting right away from a really friendly man who was eager to answer my questions and tell me about the history of the winery, the building, and the wines. My favorite wine was a dry white called Bridal Veil, and there was a big selection for all tastes, including some very sweet wines, which I did not try, as that is not my thing.   The winery has three locations, and I think each are different, so I may branch out and see how the feel is different at each place."

They explain when you arrive that you have three options to choose from. 1) A flight for a tasting 2) Purchase a bottle 3) Purchase a glass. We chose to do the sweet wine flight and the white wine flight. I surprisingly preferred the sweet wines over the white wine flight. The sommelier was friendly and was working with 3 other groups at the same time until another person showed up to help him. Overall, we had a good time.

Once we arrived at the winery, however, it seemed like no one had a clue we were arriving even though they had a sign on the door saying they were closed for the event. They were closed specifically FOR THIS EVENT. There was no one to greet us when we arrived. The place looked completely deserted. One lady finally showed up after maybe 10 minutes and started taking orders....slowly. After 30 minutes, a man showed up to help.   Due to COVID there were two boxed options for food - sandwich or wrap, with a choice of chips. For the life of me I cannot understand why they did not just bring out all of the boxed-up food and hand it over the counter as we ordered. Instead they each ran back and forth between the register and kitchen area grabbing one box at a time and then going back for chips and then going to get the wine.   I wish I was joking. It was so disorganized.  We also could not order glasses of wine which I understand (again, COVID). We ordered two bottles, each of which were retrieved on separate trips, two sandwiches (more running around), and chips (more running around). THEN we were told if we ordered a 3rd bottle, it was a 15% discount. Cool. We'll drink that, no problem, add it on. We were cashed out without getting the 3rd bottle and had to ask for it (more running around). Then I asked to use a wine opener so I could open my own wine (more running around.) Really? You're a winery. Why do you not have a wine opener in your pocket already?    We were sent upstairs where \"everything is set up already\" but without wine glasses or napkins. We had to go back downstairs to get wine glasses. The indoor seating was not sufficient for the amount of people present, and it sucks that part of our group had to eat outside in 105F heat.   There was a representative from the winery on the train. It would have been nice for her to ask us in advance and then call over to the winery and tell them how many food items were needed, given that there were only 2 options.   The wines are good, there's a nice selection. It would be nice to go do a tasting some time but I am really concerned about how they would be able to handle a crowd doing tastings rather than one eating premade sandwiches from boxes and opening their own bottles of wine."

Back porch with outdoor seating, second floor with both indoor and outdoor seating. Beautifully restored and decorated.   Five tasting flights are available. Our was $15 each. Our host Ray was a delight and he really showed warm hospitality!"

                "description": "The wine is great, but the service is poor. I have been in three times now, and the last two times it has just been an older gentleman working. It took me 40 minutes to just be able to purchase three bottles of wine when there were only two other small groups doing tastings in the room. I stood there at the counter without being acknowledged for 30 minutes and when he finally did acknowledge me it took him 10 minutes to put three bottles in a bag and ring me up. I hate to rate this winery 2 stars because the wine really is great, as well as the atmosphere, and we had great service from a very nice lady the first time we were in. But if you see an older gentleman working and you want to be served within your first 30 minutes, I would go somewhere else."

                "description": "We walked in on Labor Day because they were open, many places were closed today, so we thought we'd go in and grab a glass of wine. A little over priced, so we decided to choose a bottle. There was one lady working, Annie, who was definitely caught up talking to some members to our right who were in the middle of a tasting. There was no \"welcome to wedding Oak winery I'll be with you in a minute\", or anything.   We were disappointed that there wasn't much ambience here to enjoy our bottle. Only one place to sit inside and the patio was Meh.  But whatever, bring on the wine.  We decided on a bottle and we thought she was going to open it right then and there and serve us and be done. But instead, she walked over to the members to our right and proceeded to talk to them for a while before taking them upstairs for a tour or something. We waited downstairs with nobody to help us for what felt like 7-10 minutes.  We were talking about maybe going somewhere else because the customer service was terrible. We waited another five or six minutes and we decided to leave. We're not gonna pay $38 for a bottle of wine, that we can't even get a little taste before hand to see if we like it and where there's no ambience. I get that it's Labor Day and staffing is low everywhere, but come on at least give us some recognition that we're even there!! We ended up over at 7 Creeks Vineyard which was amazing! It had the ambience, it had the vineyards, it had the enormous oak tree with plenty of seating outside, and it also had the tasting of our wine, before buying a bottle. Customer service here was excellent. We're so glad we pivoted!"

We sat outside in the lovely fall weather, enjoyed some acoustic tunes by a talented duo with a female vocalist, and tried several cocktails -- all of which we enjoyed. My friend tried the frozen Bartender's Choice which was like a frozen apple cinnamon cocktail, and I tried the Comanchero, the Yipping Coyote, and the Rugged Flower. Each were so smooth and well-balanced. This place not only makes a flavorful Sotol with a smooth, clean finish but transforms it into mouth-watering mixology masterpieces!   Aside from the bus loads of out-of-town tourists who looked like they were part of an Instagram filter for an \"Ashley/Ashleigh\" compilation (complete with brimmed hat, scarf, and boots), this place is a must-visit if you're in Austin. Couple it with a trip to nearby Fredericksburg and you've got yourself an amazing day!"

Very Instagramable location with the truck outside and the silo.   PARKING I went when it was pretty busy. I found parking but I did have to wait for like 5 minutes so cars could clear the road. It gets pretty tight once the parking spots are all full. It's all free. A lot of cars parked on the road. Just be careful crossing the road.   FOOD When I was here they only had one food truck. The options were limited. The prices were a bit too high for the food options available. I didn't try it out. My friends ordered a few things and they felt the food was just ok. I'm not sure on the current food status here.   AMBIANCE  They only had outdoor seating when I was here because of COVID. I sat on the covered outdoor seating which was great since it was around summertime. It was HOT! Really cute tables, friendly/helpful staff, and live music! I don't remember his name but there was a gentleman playing guitar and singing. He was fantastic!   DRINKS I ordered 3 drinks. The first two were the Comanchero and the third was The Copperhead. I'm glad I stopped there. They are strong!   I'm giving it four stars because I felt like the size of the drinks didn't coincide with their prices. I hope I get to stop by here again. It's a bit of a drive for me. It's a really beautiful drive though. Keep kicking butt y'all! I want to try everything!!"

I wish I could steal the décor and put it into my own home. Both the inside and out were so inviting, I don't know how someone could go and not spend hours enjoying the ambiance, food, and drinks. What I thought was so cool about Desert Door was that they educated you on what you were drinking and the history of Sotol. What I did not know, is that they are actually the only Sotol distillery in the US.  We started off with the Sotol flight, and two drinks. Although we did enjoy tasting the Sotol by itself, it was a lot to start the afternoon off with! We also ordered the The Copperhead (my personal favorite of the day), the River Rita, and the Sotol'd Fashioned. I loved each drink but the copperhead was definitely the star of the day, which was a Sotol version of an espresso martini. They also have a food truck on site serving out very unique food. We ordered the tacos and vegan \"queso\" and both really surprised us by how unique and amazing it was. We loved this trip out to Desert Door, and will definitely be back."

But every rule has its exception, or exceptional. Desert Door is a destination in itself. Beautiful southwestern interiors and stylish furniture. The space is cozy but didn't feel crowded, though every table was full. They do have a large patio for outdoor seating and bigger groups.   Now, the sotol. I had never heard of it and didn't know what to expect. The best way I can describe it is an agave spirit, clear, between a vodka and a tequila in its thickness/smoothness. In plain English, it's delicious.   We did the tasting flight, which was a great way to get introduced to a new spirit, followed by a round of cocktails. The cocktails were excellent and reasonably priced.   They also had a lovely food truck on site but we didn't have enough time to try it."

Had a difficult time deciding which one to get but our attentive and extremely friendly waitress, Nicole strayed me the right way with the Comanchero.

And they sure know how to do a cocktail, too! I got the River Rita and it legit blew my mind.   Sit and stay awhile, listen to the live music on the patio and if you need to cool down, the interior is a WHOLE mood.   Be sure to visit their gift shop to buy an adorable handmade clay shotglass (SO CUTE) and a bottle of their famous Sotol.   The staff was also astoundingly friendly and the kind of people you want to hang out with."

The spinach and mushrooms were well seasoned and delicious.  The Caesar salad was amazing. The dressing was delicious and the chicken on top was perfectly grilled. The flavor tasted like it has been brined for a while--perfectly salty and tender.  The brown butter cake was not very good and the fries were just alright.  Overall, food: 4.5/5 Service: 4/5  Very pricey but you pay for high quality ingredients."

                "description": "I was seriously disappointed by my experience here at salt and time which had been highly recommended to me by a friend. They missed pretty much every mark in terms of a good dinner experience. Let me elaborate.  We got there an hour before closing around 8pm, and were going to try to get in and out quick and didn't want to make them stay too late after closing. Well, we didn't have a choice because right off the bat we had to wait for menus for probably five minutes, waited another 10 for the waiter to come take our order, and when we finally placed our order probably 20 minutes had gone by so we put our whole order in at once.  We ordered the little gem Caesar-type salad, a ribeye (MR) and Teres Major (mr).  We waited (literally) 45 minutes for our salad!!! Waiter kept telling us it was coming and at the 40-min mark he asked \"you guys still haven't gotten your salad?\" Seriously!!!? It's your job to bring it to us and we've asked you about it three times now!  Keep in mind the restaurant was nearly empty by now. When we finally got it there was minimal apology and he seemed very nonchalant like it wasn't a big deal and turns out it wasn't even little gems. I grow little gems and serve them at the restaurant where I work and was super excited for them but this was just a regular iceberg wedge. After 1.5hrs of waiting at this point, steaks came out. Sauces were all wrong and not what we ordered and my steak was over cooked! Clearly medium and not medium rare since my partners was cooked correctly, there was an obvious difference. But at this point, being checked on by our waiter was a ten minute affair so we just shut up and ate it because it was getting late. There were no apologies, no comps, and the waiter kept trying to push us on dessert when we clearly were ready to leave. Dropped the check and proceeded to say \"there's no rush!\" ... yeah no sh*t I can tell that's definitely a motto here. And on top of that there was automatic 20% gratuity. I usually don't mind that, because most restaurant that do auto-grat have good service where I would've tipped 20% anyways. but it should not be a motivator for the servers to not give a crap about their tables like it is here.   The steaks tasted good but for the price, the horrible service and the inability to get orders right, this place was a total wash. You can get better steaks elsewhere for a cheaper price, where you actually enjoy your dining experience. Maybe in the future if they got new staff or management this place could be a really nice restaurant but for now, I can't recommend it."

                "description": "Pretty miserable experience. There were at least 5 open tables when we sat down so they were not busy. It took 10 minutes for the waitress to give us a menu and immediately ask for our drink orders. 20 minutes later we get them. We've been here for 30 minutes and haven't gotten to place our order yet.   I order the $52 filet as did my friend. I ordered mine medium rare, he ordered his medium. His looked well done but he likes his meat well done so he didn't care. Mine however was completely raw on the inside. Not \"cooked rare\" raw. This thing was seared for maybe 10 seconds. It was also very tough. The waitress just dropped off our food and we were waiting for steak knives for 10 minutes until I walked to the hostess and asked for them.   I sent the steak back and it took at least 25 minutes to get it back. At this point so did not want to pay $52 for a reheated steak so I asked another waitress to grab me a burger instead so I could get the hell out of here. They come back with my steak, which was missing a piece, that had clearly been thrown into an oven or microwave to increase the internal temperature.   If you're coming here expecting an artisan or holistic steakhouse experience, go somewhere else. If you're looking for some $15 cocktails to drink in a gentrified strip mall butcher shop, this is the place for you!   My experience was so bad that I considered contacting my credit card for a refund. It was that bad."

                "description": "Came here on a burger recommendation. It was a nice little place for brunch. I don't if I was just bad at finding it, but apparently they only have the brunch and dinner menu on the weekend. The lunch menu is only offered on weekdays so if you're wanting to come here for the lunch menu on the weekend, you are out of luck.   But their brunch menu still does offer a burger, the Butcher's Breakfast burger to be exact. It's pretty much the normal Butcher burger but with eggs and bacon added on, and i think cheaper too. I got it medium and it was a nice, hearty burger. It was a juicy, steak-y patty and the brioche bun was quite soft. I probably should've just taken the bacon and eggs out and eaten it separately though. It got a little to big for me.   Beef fat fries are a must try though. Nice soft potato filling, with a slight crisp. I might be wrong, but I tasted a hint of cinnamon and it had a quiet deep fried donut flavor that I am all too familiar with. Very addicting.   Came here on a 1PM Saturday and there was no wait, but I do here it does get crazy busy during dinner times so make sure you have a reservation. Our server was really sweet. The place overall had a calm and chill atmosphere and felt very clean."

                "description": "Best burger in town without a doubt. My friend was singing it's praises for a while and so a group of us showed up all ordering it. Go figure. But it lives up to the hype for sure. It's basically made from trimmings from the butcher shop, so it's ground pretty fresh, seasoned well and honestly tastes almost steak like from the cuts, so highly recommend medium rare or medium on the burger. It's also massive, so no chance you'll leave hungry. Some fresh veg and a nicely toasted bun round off the sandwich. I would also recommend adding some bacon at least to your burger, as it's crisp contrast and who doesn't like bacon.  As if that's not enough, the sides there are also A+. The beef fat fries have a lot of flavor, but also thick enough that you can appreciate the pillowy potato inside. The what I assume house made ketchup adds some needed acidity to all the food but jives well with everything. The shishito pepper app is also really good if you can tolerate a little bit of burn.  Service is a bit on the slow side at the restaurant, so I would definitely recommend getting a reservation if you can but also being patient and just enjoy the decor and conversations with people. The appetizers came out same time as the food too, so waiting an hour for food at 1pm on a Monday afternoon sounds a bit long, but good thing we had good company at least."

Having worked in the industry I politely asked two people if I had been given a sirloin by mistake and they both said no. OMG.  All the servers were in a bad mood ... probably because of something happening with the restaurant. I thought outside would be charming, but it was full of flies.  The catchup was great, though."

                "description": "Brunch today allowed me to check another big name off my list. I heard their Butcher's Burger is the best in Austin, so with nothing else calling to me off the menu, I had to try it. It was ok, I think? It was so tall and hard to eat that it was hard to really process and appreciate the flavor. They cooked it right, but the runny egg made the bun slide everywhere and mayo seemed like overkill. The Beef Fat Fries were pretty good, but not so good that I felt compelled to eat the whole serving. My favorite thing was the Charcuterie Plate that we split before the meal, especially the summer sausage, mortadella, and unidentifiable pink pickles. My friends loved their Steak and Eggs. I tried a bite of a friend's French Toast and would have gladly eaten more! While we were waiting for our food, browsing the butcher shop was interesting, and I liked seeing what products exist even if I wasn't in the market to buy anything. Service was attentive. I'm already planning on coming back again sometime because I know other carnivorous friends will love it. But now it's time for an afternoon nap!"

                "description": "Absolutely loved our meal at Salt and Time. I got their burger and it was fantastic. Cooked perfectly medium rare, juicy as can be, and with a bun that really held up. The reviews don't lie. GET THE BURGER. Oh and the fries were bomb too.   My wife got the BBLT (beef bacon), and I have to say, it was the best BLT I've ever had. On top of favor, the portion was ginormous. Though, it didn't hold up as well as a leftover.   All in all, highly highly recommend, especially once they open dine in. The patio seating is nice but way too hot during the summer"

The flavor was amazing! Wow! I have a favorite burger place in Hawaii called Teddy's and so far I haven't had anything tipped that until today. I normally don't get my burger med rare but damn it was good! From the ketchup and the fries to the burger! I loved it! My first experience was great! Too bad I'm an out of towner!

First and foremost the Beef Tartare is probably one of the best beef tartares I have ever eaten in my life - the mix of flavor was just incredible, and the steak was perfectly diced! I could eat this everyday. Absolutely superb.  We also got the Cesar salad to start which was another hit. For the main we shared the Wagyu NY Strip, side of fries and broccolini, and the sweet corn agnolotti. My ONLY complaint was that there wasn't a larger portion of the agnolotti, delicious stuffed pillows of creamy sweet corn. Service was friendly and hospitable, will definitely be back!"

Covid brought the addition of the upscale butcher shop, complete with many house-made items, terrines and fine meats...very impressive selections.   During Covid they also expanded into a new patio for dining, complete with large overhead fans, which made a very pleasant setting on a warm evening.   My daughter and I enjoyed a really great Charcuterie Board, that included 4 wonderful house-made meats, accoutrements and sauces. We shared it and both loved it.  We also shared their absolutely delicious Butcher Burger, made from steak trimmings. It was cooked perfectly and served on a brioche bun with all the trimmings, and the best French fries we've had in a long time.    We will definitely return to this east side neighborhood gem!!"

I wasn't sure what to expect, but it didn't take long to realize that not only is Dale a great tour guide, he's also a very personable and knowledgable man who makes you feel like an old friend.   The points of interest were superb and the last stop we made provided one of the best meals I've had in my life and most likely the best ribeye ever.   The day lasted longer than expected, but it was a wonderful day and ended up being just perfect. We are planning to use his rental venue for a retreat in the coming months and looking forward to it. I highly recommend his services."

                "description": "First I would like to start with the facts.  1. We booked this tour months ago but unfortunately had to reschedule to a later date. (due to Covid19) This was not an issue for anyone attending the tour and the company got all $2800 paid for in full. 2. Yes $2800. We had 28 people in our group, It required two buses that were at their max capacity.  3. I would give a HUGE ZERO if I could.   The buses arrived at the pick up location 25 minutes early and expected us (all 28) to load up. Not all 28 people were even there yet. The male driver already seemed annoyed at this point.  We ended up pulling out at the agreed on time. When trying to leave the 2nd winery we couldn't. The drivers HAD LEFT and weren't there to pick us up. We waited outside in the sun outside for 30 minutes before they even got back.  But that unfortunately is not why I am writing this review   As we were loading the bus to go home the male driver said that would be charging us for a cleaning fee ($300) because someone spilt something on the floorboard. Pretty steep for a small spill that could be wiped up with a Clorox wipe but she agreed to pay it she sat down. Comments started to be exchanged about the steep fee and how the day had been complete chaos up until this point. The man began to get pretty heated and slammed the door. When he opened the door to his seat he said \"who the f**k spilt something in my seat.\" Nobody had spilled something on his seat. Upon looking at the \"spill\" it appeared to be sweat from Him. He continued to cuss and yell and eventually told us to \"get off his bus.\" We all piled off and the other bus also unloaded.  Now it is important to note the other driver said we didn't do anything wrong and that she didn't agree with how he was handling things. He told her he was in charge and that he would make the call. She became quiet after that. They ultimately left us there to find our own rides.  The male driver was rude and didn't speak unless spoken to the entire day. A beautiful day with amazing company was RUINED by this company and I will not recommend them to anyone!"

                "description": "I booked a birthday trip for 6 people, hoping to add 2 more. Dale told me I could book the trip for 6 and then add the 2. When I called to add the 2 he told me he would have to see if that was even possible. I didn't understand why after he assured me it would be fine and a sprinter van hold more than that. He had given the sprinter van to a larger crowd and downgraded us to an SUV without asking me (same price). I asked him when I would hear back and he said whenever he located another vehicle. I made some calls and found a better business who really wanted to host me and our guests. I called again to cancel with Dale and was told I am not the type of customer he would want. I guess a customer who wants to pay more money to add more people isn't good... very strange. Talking to a woman like that is not ok. I hope that he was having a bad few days and that he doesn't always behave like this, but I was really shocked how rude and unprofessional he was. Pros: I got my money back."

                "description": "One of the WORST experiences I have ever had with a \"wine tour\" company. I have been on many wine tours in my days, across different parts of Texas, and their unprofessionalism and lack of customer service and just blatant disrespect was appalling.   This \"wine tour\" had a total of two buses and a party consisting of 28 people. A group of people that I have known for years that have the utmost of respect and common courtesy for any company that they hire or work with.   From the start of our experience, both drivers were incredibly rude and unfriendly. The bus lacked any amenities one would think this \"Premier Hill Country Wine Tasting Experience\" would consist of.  The first winery.  * We arrived at the first winery at 10:48am to learn that the winery doesn't even open until 11:00am and that they WEREN'T expecting us at all... * Not the wineries fault. They were fantastic.  The second winery.  * Again, wasn't expecting us, causing us to have to sit at a tent down a road from the winery. Again, not the wineries fault, they handled it incredibly.  * When trying to leave the second winery, we couldn't. The drivers HAD LEFT and weren't there to pick us up. We waited outside in the sun outside for 30 minutes before they even got back.  The third winery.  * As we were loading the bus to go home, the male driver said that they would be charging us for a cleaning fee ($300) because someone spilled something on the floorboard. Pretty steep for a small spill that could be wiped up with a Clorox wipe, but she agreed to pay it. (*To clarify, open containers were allowed as stated on their website: \"Consumption of alcohol on the bus is allowed unless there are minors present.\") Minor spills like this are inevitable when providing a service as they do. Comments started to be exchanged about the steep fee and how the day had been complete chaos up until this point. The man began to get pretty heated and slammed the door. When he opened the door to his seat he said \"who the f**k spilt something in my seat.\" Nobody had spilled something on his seat. Upon looking at the \"spill\" it appeared to be sweat from him. He continued to cuss and yell and eventually told us to \"get off his bus.\" We all piled off, and the other bus also unloaded.  I know these times are hard, especially for small and locally owned businesses, and by no means and am I trying to make it harder for them; in fact, I am going above and beyond to support them. After yesterday, I do think that they need to take a step back and re-evaluate their actions and really think long and hard about what they do and why they do it. In the end, when providing a service, the client always comes first."

To be honest, the cost seemed a bit high at first but having never been on a wine tour before and I really had no idea. Afterward I realize it was worth every bit of it. Dale picked us up at our BnB along with everyone else on the tour that day and we were off to the first tasting.  He seem to know everyone along the tour and at each place they were very welcoming and grateful to have our group. It really was a fun time and we had the chance to try many different wines that we would not have normally picked.  Lucky for us it was a beautiful day and everything was just perfect. I would definitely recommend this tour to anyone interested in checking out some Texas wines, for a nice weekend getaway, or just to try something different.  It definitely helped that we had a good group of people who were also on the tour that day as well. It was a blast...I just wish we had taken more pictures."

He is rude, unprofessional, and has the audacity to 'hate mail' potential clients and I know I'm not the first one because I've seen the reviews! I don't have much else to say but be careful and do your research before spending any money on this place! The owner seems to not have a care in the world if it's not benefitting him. Also, be ready for rude phone calls and emails from Dale if he doesn't get his way. He was hard to get ahold of from the jump, not to mention I live out of town and couldn't wait for days in between responses. After not being able to make it to my appointment because he had failed to get back to me promptly, I proceeded on with my day. The next morning I wake up to the most rude, despicable email I've ever received. Just be careful and read reviews because from what I've read, if you want a beautiful wedding with NICE, FRIENDLY people, this isn't the place. I'll attach one of many emails.

Picked us up at our hotel in Fredericksburg, went to pick up lunch, and then on to first of 4 wineries. She took care of everything. Even loaded up our bottles/goodies in the back of the bus and kept the AC on to keep it all cool.  Christy went above and beyond to keep everything organized, she set up our lunch, picked up our trash, offered to take us anywhere we wanted to go, and she kept us on time to all of our tastings. We bought a bottle of wine at the 3rd winery and drank in the bus on the way to the 4th. Lunch was a boxed lunch bought at local deli (very good). Everything was included. Everything was professional. The bus was large and comfy. Highly recommend this tour company!"

                "description": "We paid nearly four hundred dollars and it was a joke. What was supposed to be a winery tour was a tour of places that sold wine. We went to a store in downtown marble falls, an art studio, a grocery store and at the very end an actual winery. This constituted our day.   This is NOT a day of going to wineries in the hill country. Everyone was disappointed on Valentine's day.   The guy who led the tour was nice but they clearly got kickbacks where we went.   When we went to lunch no one got their order and right when we were leaving this sandwich shop the tour guide asked, \"everyone went to the tasting room, right?\" We're talking about a sandwich place being a stop on the wine tour people.   Horribly disappointed. Considering tastings were at most $10 for each of the four \"wineries\" we went to, it was a rip off in value.  The company clearly avoided going to respectable wineries and instead went to dead end places where they could maximize their profit margin.   Avoid at all costs!!"

The van was comfy and well air conditioned and stocked with bottled water. Would definitely recommend!"

We visited four wineries and were treated like VIPs due to Dale's wonderful rapport with vineyard owners and staff.  Dale's knowledge of wine and  the specialities and uniqueness of each winery made the tour interesting and fun.  By the end of the day, I had not only made new memories, but new friends too!"

                "description": "We finally made it to the Wanderlust location on a Tuesday, ahead of leaving for a vacation, as were looking to spend a day just relaxing near home and day drinking. There are tons of choices of wine, and even more places to sit and relax! The staff explains the process to you, but after our first visit, we definitely realized there could have a little better thorough explanation, and notation made about the happy hour each day. My husband and I each received our own card for pours, even though we were on the same tab, so it's VERY easy to lose track of how much you are spending collectively, because your card only shows what YOU have spent so far. The choice to have small, medium and large pours is nice, because even though each wine has a description, you just don't know until you try it! There are several food truck options, but they don't open until later in the day. There are also some mead wines, and some non alcoholic options inside, as well as games to play! There are also dog-friendly areas and water bowls, which are always a plus for us!  Our only complaint was the staff; we arrived just after their posted opening time, but the door was locked. We walked around back, called out to anyone, and got no response. We left for a bit and came back and it was finally opened. We inquired about it with the long staff member after she finally appeared, after about 15 minutes of waiting, and she seemed to think we didn't know what we were talking about. And as I mentioned, the explanation was not very thorough, and we had to wait another 10 minutes to cash out because she kept disappearing. We chalked it up to an one-off thing, and let it go, but it was still quite strange. I would think busier times might be better!"

                "description": "This spot is like the original Wanderlust (put a credit card on file, and you get card to swipe for different wines on what is essentially as a pay per ounce buffet). With this buffet, you're paying more for the nice items, per ounce, though.  This location is larger, though, and more artistic both in the decor and the fact that they have performers there. Additionally, they have a larger selection at this location vs. the original location. That said, while it's a larger selection, there's less variety. At least when I went there they didn't have margarita-inspired wines or mead. If you loooove wine, then, this is the place for you (or if you're looking for a more creative atmosphere), but if not I'd recommend the other location."

Anyway, I am glad it is up back and running as Wanderlust.   Upon entering you can grab a glass of mead from the bar area or head into the winery to pay by the pour with your card. They have tons of wines to choose from to include sangrias. There are picnic tables inside and a small courtyard near the food trucks if you want to hang out outdoors.  They have a few food trucks on-site that will be opening soon. One of them was kind enough to pass out bread samples. I am gluten-free but my husband indulged in some delicious bread which he said was AMAZING.  Overall this is a cool little area with more to come to include a coffee place, brewery, and restaurant. I will be back for sure because the location is chill and the wine was good."

The bathrooms are beautiful and the place, although huge, is still absolutely comfortable due to the layout."

First off, the space is fantastic - huge lofted ceilings, seamless indoor/outdoor (perfect for COVID), visually interesting seating and art. The indoor portion comes loaded with comfy couches and armchairs which I can appreciate! A fantastic venue that I'm sure would've been much more vibrant during peak hours.  The service is great, really enthusiastic and knowledgeable sommeliers accompany with a great playlist. The wine selection here is decent, definitely a more robust and diverse selection than the downtown location.   Great location for large groups or a birthday party. Would totally come again (albeit on a busier night)!"

Large room has many picnic tables with transistor radios and manual typewriters adorning them.   Excellent selection of wine and sangria. Provides a great opportunity to try a variety of regions of wines that you would be unable to do in a restaurant setting. However, it is expensive.  I had less than a glass and a half and spent over $20.   There are 3 food trucks, but they were closed when we were there (Sunday).  This would be a great place for a group event or just a large group attendance (that happy hour people forget to RSVP for--this is the place to accommodate them!). It is so spacious in the main room.   Parking is an issue.  It's only available on the street: so carpool or rideshare."

My boyfriend and I came in after dinner one night to see the new location and grab a few drinks and I can definitely say that we'll be back. The wine isn't on tap just yet since they're still finishing up construction but there's still plenty of options and the staff is eager to help. We spoke to Ashley at the bar and she was amazing, she told us all about the building, the wines, events, and what was to come with the space. Not only was the wine great but the atmosphere is just unmatched. The building is decorated floor to ceiling with murals and graffiti art from local Austin artists. I can't wait to come back when the whole package is together!   COVID Precautions: Masks are encouraged and hand sanitizer was provided."

They also play a lot of hip hop/ rap which is not only refreshing but gives this place an authentic feel! There is only street parking at the Shady ln location so keep that in mind! Once you arrive you receive a Pour card that you can use to access each tap. They have white wine (Chardonnay, resiling,etc) and red wine varieties. They don't have food but there are separately operated food trucks! Overall I think the wine is a bit over priced but love this space for studying, exploring a creative outlet or chilling with a few friends. It's a VERY quiet space. There's outdoor and indoor seating. I will be back sometime I hope they host comedy or spoken word here... seems like an appropriate venue!"

The interior space is luxurious, and the outside sitting space is reminds me of a barn. You get the best of both worlds. I come here for the sangria, usually on tap #61 and #63, but by the time you're reading this, they may have changed the drinks. This could seem a bit pricey unless you go during a happy hour. When it's not 50% off happy hour on certain days of the week, then an average day will have 30% off from 3pm to 6pm."

We were sad when the Round Rock location closed down, but found this place to be a million times better. The decor is cute and thematic, with tons of inviting spots for seating, whether you're looking for a romantic spot for two, or some couches for a larger gathering. The best part is the staff - super friendly and helpful while we try to make the tough decision of what to drink or take home. The free samples help too!   Making our own batch of wine is a yearly tradition for us. We get together with friends to start the wine (which of course involves a good time trying the different wines first), design our own labels (or get help from W2W), throw a gathering to bottle the wine, then have bottles to hand out as wedding favors, Christmas gifts, or generic gifts.   We are club members, so we stop by at least monthly for a couple glasses of wine and to pick up our bottles to enjoy at home. Whether you're joining wine club, making a batch, or just stopping in for a glass or two, Water 2 Wine is a fantastic neighborhood gem. I only wish they were in my neighborhood!"

They make excellent suggestions whether you know what you're looking for or not. They can get you going in the right direction.  Sulfite free wine? Is my understanding. I don't know a lot about wine, but know that's a good thing to be free of. I can say the ports and fruity wines are a good dessert. My family and friends love the other wines."

                "description": "If you are a young couple, or an old couple, or an odd couple, and you decide you want a wine baby, you may be a bit worried about where, when and how to do that.  It's a big step and you should have nothing but the best for your Vino Bambino, so please look no further than Water 2 Wine, and Jenny in particular.  She is the BEST midwife for your wine labor.    We just had the best experience making, bottling and labeling our wine baby.  It was smoooooth sailing and immediately made me want another :)  When you decide to make your own wine, first, you'll get to sample the wines, ALL of them if you so wish.  I spent two afternoons sampling bunches of them and all the staff were generous and enthusiastic in helping me find which wine I wanted.  Then, you make an appt for conception.  It's fairly simple  and pleasurable.  Again, you can grab a glass of wine as you work, mixing the juice and water and yeast in a giant white bucket (Carboy), churning away for about 10 minutes and then your part is done for about 6 weeks!  The rest of the staff will ensure that your baby gestates comfortably and appropriately, testing its ph and sugars until its ready to be born.  Then the magic happens.  As the parent, you'll have full creativity in naming your baby.  In which case, you can pick any 3 images you like, decide the wording and color scheme and font of the label, email all that to Jenny and she'll print out the most perfect labels.  You can then invite a bunch of friends to witness and help in the birthing.  You can bring in all kinds of snack ems and the fine ladies at Water 2 Wine will immediately ply your guests with tastings of their wine and you can buy bottles (and bottles) to facilitate in the birthing process.  Everyone in your party can try their hand at filling bottles, corking bottles, melting the lid foils, and sticking on labels.  In the end, you'll have about 30 bottles of fantastic wine ( I recommend the Gruner!) to share and take home.    They make for fantastic house warming, business, wedding, new baby, Christmas, Hanukkah, etc gifts.  In fact, if you decide last minute you'd like to adopt a wine baby for Christmas, they keep a bunch already made and ready to label for your Christmas party or gifts.    Best thing was, our friends had so much fun and it was such a new experience for all of us that we WIN again as the hostess with the mostest.  And, even though I had grand plans of using this wine at our housewarming party, I doubt it'll last another 8-10 months so we may indeed make another baby next year.    Jenny and the rest of the staff really made this so much fun and interesting with all their cool contraptions and accomodated me with the music I wanted (got to have appropriate Edith Piaf wine birthing music!) and never left a wine glass dry in my group.    So grab your partner, in life, in business, in crime, and get to makin that baby! They're the best kind of babies, they don't puke or shit or cry and instead of causing you stress, they relieve it.  And in the end you'll have the coolest collectible bottles."

                "description": "Water 2 Wine has taken your normal wine drinking experience and given it a unique spin by providing you the keys to the winery and letting you become the vintner. You make your own batch of wine, create custom labels, bottle it, and best of all, taste the fruits of your labor. By having you do this work on site they are able circumvent certain regulations resulting in less sulfites and other chemicals than store bought wines.  I have been visiting Water 2 Wine for about five years and actually created a batch with my wife and we gave the custom bottles of wine away as gifts at our wedding. The gifts were a hit.   Water 2 Wine imports their grapes and juices from other vineyards. This is not uncommon for vineyards in Texas as most don't grow enough grapes, if any, to meet their own demand. When you decide to make a batch this is where you will start. You will mix the juice, and depending on the type of wine you are making will add flavors like oak.  After you make the wine it will go in the back room for fermentation where the staff will guide the wine along over the next six to eight weeks changing containers around six times.  About two months later you will come back and bottle your wine. You add your label, fill the bottle, cork it and shrink wrap foil around the top. Like a good chef test tasting food a lot of quality assurance goes on during this process. This is a perfect event to bring along a group of friends. Hopefully you end up bottling more wine than you drink.   You don't have to make wine. Water 2 Wine is also a spacious wine bar, with a large selection of wine, where you can stop in just to drink some wine. All of the wine is made on site by the employees. They don't sell food but you are welcome to bring in food to eat with your wine. There are plenty of tasting options or you can buy by the glass or bottle. The staff is very friendly and have been one of my favorite aspects of every visit."

Stop by and challenge the team to find you the perfect glass- they won't disappoint."

It's basically an outpost of the parent company in California. Based in Paso Robles, Graveyard Vineyards is a small producer. The wines offered are all grown and made in California.   We opted for the tasting. They offered 6 wines for $15. We enjoyed generous pours of 2 whites, 1 rose, 2 reds, and a dessert wine. All of them were very good! You can tell their not Texas wines (in a good way!).   The staff was incredibly helpful. They offered tastings outside and were very attentive! I would absolutely recommend stopping by if you're in the area.   If you can grab a Malbec, do it!"

                "description": "Our family was in town from CA and we decided we would go wine tasting locally and try some Texas wines. The wineries prior, all staff wore masks which was nice since we had a couple high risk individuals in our group. When we arrived at Graveyard, the outside was not impressive, not exactly the winery ambience. Once we got inside, the male was not wearing a mask (ok... fine... mask mandate lifted.... ) but he then told me I could take off my mask standing about a foot away, and I told him no I can't, we have high risk individuals. He then said to go outside for the tasting which we did. But honestly, who tells people to take off their masks or suggest they take off their masks during a pandemic? He has noooo idea of our health conditions, concerns or even has the right to even suggest on the matter. I was definitely taken back.  Once we went outside the table was just covered in pollen and debris and leaves. We were all so itchy from all the leaves under the table. Just no grooming or landscaping or care given to the on-site property. It was not a relaxing atmosphere whatsoever, as mentioned prior, a parking lot view/feeling.  The female local staff member had superb customer service, but again, in our faces pouring wine with no mask on. Out of the wineries we went to that day, this is the ONLY place where they were mask free. Although the mask mandate was lifted, we're still in the midst of a major pandemic and felt other establishments honored that respectfully. We felt very safe at all the wineries prior.   Grapes not from Texas.   Pros: Wine was good."

                "description": "This review is meant as an FYI to those people who are thinking about joining the Graveyard vineyards wine club.  Graveyard expects you to take three shipments and are unwilling to cancel your membership before you pay for, and receive three shipments.  I have received two shipments and did not want any more Graveyard wine.  When I reached out to the wine club, the response was \"you are asked to received three shipments; you've had two.  Your third one is coming up.\"  I am going to be candid here.  I just don't care for the wines.  I know others like them very much.  My sister, who lives near the tasting room in Dripping Springs, loves the wine.  There is nothing wrong with the wine; I just don't care for it and I think two shipments is enough to make up my mind.  I conveyed my feelings to the wine club manager and her solution was to downgrade me from a 12-bottle shipment to a 6-bottle shipment.  I really don't mean to knock Graveyard.  But my suggestion is to buy a case of wine and try it before you join the club.  I want to emphasize that there is nothing wrong with the wine; it just does not align with my tastes."

                "description": "Graveyard is a brand new addition to the winery community in Drip, having opened in late January. They are an offshoot of a parent winery in Paso Robles, CA. The wines they sell are all produced, bottled and shipped here from that operation. They do yet carry the entire CA inventory but do plan to increase the Texas offerings.   The wines available include a couple of Graveyard's more affordable blends - Paso Tombstone White and the red blend from that line. Both are pleasant, sippable blends at a very reasonable price point. The red was light slightly complex mix of common reds produced at the parent vineyard. They also stock Ascender, a credible Brut. Their estate Cab is actually very good- a lighter Cab with a nice effect on the palate.   The lounge itself is pleasant and airy without being pretentious. The staff, especially manager Adam, are all personable and informative."

It was a relaxing time playing checkers and sipping wine under the trees, though. Our server was wonderful and covid-safe. Unfortunately, one staff wasn't wearing a mask, even inside, but we didn't have to deal with him much. We really enjoyed the wines. I know they are based out of Cali, but it was still nice to get a decent sparkling wine at a Texas vineyard. They were all good, but that was a nice surprise."

                "description": "I wonder if it's a new winery. The parking lot isn't as big as others but the space is very nice, benches and tables under trees. The inside is small because it's in a cottage so there's a sign saying one group at a time. The wines are from California. You can do a flight for $15 or a glass. We all chose a glass (8oz pour) whereas a tasting is 6 oz. loved our reds. There's a sculpture garden to stroll. Lovely place for convo. Also we tried the fat boy cheese spread w ritz crackers and it's so good!"

Highly recommended spot for fellow enophiles! We will be back for sure."

However perhaps I will be a bit biased coming from California and having tried some of the best wines, the wine here is not something for a refined wine pallet. It's a cute little spot to check out and try out but not something that would leave you wanting more. Sauvignon Blanc was the best choice of the flight and the others did not leave me too excited."

                "description": "I keep meaning to post a review for this winery. My husband and I visited them a few weeks ago to celebrate a recent job interview. They have only recently opened up, so we had never heard of them before and were excited to try them out. They had a very cute tasting room with nice stone that also felt very homey. The tasting was $20 and you get to try 6 wines. $20 still feels a bit hefty for a tasting in Central Texas for me, but their pours were pretty generous and you're not being served by someone who looks like a teenager who couldn't care less about your experience (like what Becker has become). All of these wines are from Sonoma. Overall, we didn't love the tastings except for the Zinfandel and the Cabernet which were absolutely outstanding, but I don't typically love lighter-bodied red wines or most reds from Sonoma. The quality is great, but a few of the prices were just slightly higher than what we can personally justify - I absolutely loved the Cab but it was $60. The Zinfandel was more affordable at $39. Their Wine Club gives you 20% off purchases which is nice, but it is a 6-bottle quarterly shipment. The winemakers are the Parmesons themselves and we had the pleasure of getting to chat with them while we did our tasting. They are a wonderful couple who were very welcoming and lovely to chat with. We loved hearing their story of how they got into winemaking. I would highly recommend checking this place out!"

He then refused to take us home from the second winery which was an hour and a half away from where we live?? He said we were drunk even though 1. We hadn't even had 2 regular sized glasses of wine total and 2. Isn't that why you hire a driver?? So you don't drink and drive? He put his finger in my mom's face so close it was basically touching her nose. When my brother tried to calmly speak to him, the driver dramatically told him to back up because he was \"dangerous\" and started filming. The video he took will clearly show that no one was threatening him. The other people at the winery came up to us after and could not believe how he acted and that he just left us in the middle of no where. He also called the cops on us and then drove away laughing. What if one of us had a medical condition and needed to get home to take medicine? We had to call all of our friends to see if one of our friends could pick us up since there were no ubers / Lyfts.

The driver was dismissive of us from the start, we needed help setting up the Bluetooth speakers but he was clearly trying to rush us from the moment we got in the bus. At what was supposed to be the halfway point of our trip, the driver came into the winery and told the owner we were 'running late' and they needed to rush us out. This company had over booked themselves and instead of calmly talking to us to resolve the situation, they decided that abandoning a group of people - an hour and a half away from our destination - was the best course of action. The driver had also called the police after escalating the situation himself which was both unprofessional and a waste of the officers time. To add insult to injury, the driver was laughing while he drove away without us. We were lucky enough to have friends drive out and get us, but it was a terrible end to what was supposed to a fun experience. I would not recommend this company if you expect transport to be completed both to and from your destination."

First and foremost a wine storage facility grown into a tasting lounge and concierge service.  Vine Vault staffs a fantastic sommelier, Nicole, who is hands on with personal service and planned events.  Even more interesting is that it happens to be located in the old vault of the Bank of America building.  Inside the facility is the actual bank vault and the exterior vault door is a key piece of the decor as you enter from the garage.  Think of a cigar lounge atmosphere (sans smoke) for wine drinkers....leather club chairs, cozy atmosphere, glassware and some snacking options.  Perfect spot to participate in one of their wine dinners, host a client social hour or simply enjoy a nice bottle before dinner downtown."

One of my wineries in Napa shipped a case of very expensive Cabs to me via Vine Vault.  It was shipped from Napa on 11/5/18 and received by Vine Vault in Austin on 11/6/18.  Vine Vault then proceeded to sit on the wine until I went searching for it. It was finally shipped to me via FedEx on 12/4/18, almost ONE MONTH later!  NO RESPONSE from company or managing partner, one Elton Potts. I have no guarantee that the wine was properly stored, as temperatures in Austin in November were frequently in the mid to upper 70's and into the 80's on a couple of days.  I intend to return the wine to the winery and will STRONGLY suggest that they cease using this poorly run company."

Our tour guide, Ray, went above and beyond to make sure we had the best experience possible.  We stopped at both the birthplace and childhood homes of LBJ before visiting the Ranch, where we toured the home he and Lady Bird resided, we then spent a couple hours in the quaint German town of Fredericksburg where we enjoyed lunch and a little shopping.  Then a quick stop at Luckenbach Texas, where they were having a food truck festival and live music.  We were impressed with this tour and encourage others to give it a try.

Brewery has great propery and enjoyed the shuffle board.  **update - left bells springs and went to Nomadic Brewing in Austin, highly recommend that the food truck at bells spring offering cold hard pretzels for $10 to chat with the pretzel making pretzelista at Nomadic...jalapeño cheddar pretzel was amazing...hot, soft and paired with delicious side of grainy mustard for half the price of bells springs horrible pretzel offering"

The food truck run by Chef Massaro is a must. My husband and I ordered buffalo chicken, Korean bbq chicken, Cilantro dumplings and waffle fries. The food was beyond what I expected from a lunch truck, it is delicious! My husband and I will definitely be going back to order from Chef Massaro and if you go on Bell Springs Winery website, you will find the food menu and send a text with your order to Chef Massaro ahead  of time."

                "description": "I had a lovely few nights stay at Lucky Arrow. We traveled with friends - 3 other couples and their kids - and stayed in a cluster of four cabins. It was the perfect pandemic vacation: we were able to socialize with our friends and still have our own spaces, without being indoors together. I don't think I'd have enjoyed it as much with strangers staying in the cabin cluster with me, especially since each pair of cabins shares a hot tub (which was delightful to relax in!) and all four cabins share a fire pit.  The rooms were clean and modern looking, the beds comfortable, and the air conditioning great. They have basic toiletries and good towels. There's very weak and unreliable wifi at the cabins; I recommend you come here to disconnect. I had good cell phone service with Verizon. The cabins have mini fridges but no kitchens; if you want to cook, you'll have to grill outside. Bring your own charcoal and lighter fluid!  For shared amenities, there's a lovely outdoor pool, and a big space with a large fire pit, grills, and picnic area with tables and swings (and some covered seating if you need shade). The pool has a 1-foot area with lounge seats, and lots of nice floats. We visited during the week, and it wasn't very busy; our group spent a lot of time at the pool and were often there by ourselves. There's a small walking trail, too.  It is quite pricey; I don't normally spend this much on a hotel. I'm not sure if I'd stay again if I weren't going on a group trip (with pandemic friendly housing.) If you're going with a group, call and see if they'll give you group pricing.  Warning for those who are planning to spend most of their time in Dripping Springs drinking: if you visit on a Monday - Tuesday, as I did, most of the wineries and breweries (including Bell Springs, which is attached to the resort) are closed."

                "description": "Very little privacy and poor management. Had a grounds keeper hop, that's right hop, on to our patio while my wife and I were changing. Wife was and is still pretty traumatized.  Took us forever to find management to let them know we are out and they told us they would pay for our room at the holiday inn. They did not.  Recommendation to LAR:  If you are going to run a wedding at your retreat, maybe consider additional help managing the facility. Only having 1 worker who is trying to run a wedding at your grounds isn't going to cut it.  * to managements response:  You want me to call you again? I'm sorry, but your response to my review makes it sound like this is the first you have heard about this incident. Is this correct? If so, this is disappointing because that tells me you have not taken steps forward to improve."

                "description": "Came here for a mid-week staycation. We had the place almost all to ourselves since it was mid-week in September. The weather was amazing! We rented one of the breezeway cabins with views+hot tub+fire pit. There was firewood at the cabin when we checked in. We had a fire and hung out in the hot tub to look at the night sky both nights. It was so quiet and relaxing, exactly what we were looking for. The breezeway cabins are beautiful and fun! The pillows, sheets, and bedding were comfy. The breezeway two-seater swing was cute to sit in while sipping coffee. It would be nice if the room with the couch and wet bar also had soap and a couple dish towels by the sink."

                "description": "Lovely glamping space close to the Hill Country and within an hour of Austin, but ludicrous pricing policies will prevent a repeat visit. This spartan campsite with tiny houses and yurts (with a bathroom space shared with pool guests) offers a close to the city getaway with minimal amenities. But with a per pet fee of $150 PER ANIMAL plus a nightly fee, they don't seem to understand how out of touch they are with pricing policies of similar establishments. With two dogs under 20lbs, you're looking at $350 just in pet fees prior to any rental rates for just two nights, and therefore Lucky Arrow won't be getting any repeat visits from us."

This was the perfect place to unwind and still feel safe during all this Covid madness.  The check in process was all online, so we didn't have to worry about social distancing.    The rooms were so adorable and you could tell they really put time into every single detail to make sure you have an amazing experience.  We were able to sit around the fire pit, have smores and enjoy the quiet starry night with no city noise or much light pollution.    The location was beyond perfect.  It's just far enough away from town that you feel like you are truly on vacation, but there was still an HEB and tons of food options within a few minutes drive.  The gated access to the winery next door was a wonderful perk.  Highly highly recommend staying here!"

                "description": "There are few things more excellent than Texas Spring, and we were delighted to spend a weekend of the best time of year out in the hill country at Lucky Arrow during their opening weekend.  There is a central event space and bar / pool area at the top of the hill with yurts as well as more conventional accommodation tucked into the trees below. We stayed in a 'courtyard cabin' one of four arranged around a fire pit with a hot tub. Which was bright and airy with the squishiest mattress, soft sheets and plenty of space to set up our travel crib for our three month old son (they also have them there if you're coming from further afield and need to borrow one)  We spent the weekend listening to live music and sipping cocktails by the pool, wandering the shady trails, admiring the view and toasting s'mores on the fire pit.   Close enough to Dripping Springs if you want supper /HEB - but far enough out that the stars are super bright and the night is gloriously quiet. They're well-behaved dog friendly, so we'll be back with our (only moderately well behaved) hound. And for a yurt, I only peeked my head inside one but I'm desperate to stay in one soon!"

Only complaints were that there was no map provided, nor customer service available, so we had to drive around and try to find outlet yurt at 10pm. Which was fine - we found it fairly quickly. Other complaint is that it looks like the person cleaning might of got distracted and left the room, without putting the ac back together or bringing her cleaning towel. Also not a huge issue.

We were able to have our team join us here (from Austin) to prepare for fall + 2020 goals.  It was the perfect mixture of pleasure and work-- we were close to wonderful Dripping Springs restaurants, wineries and distilleries.  We stayed at the Ranch House were we could spread out and work on our planning during the day and hit up the pool for a quick break. And,  you will definitely want to hit up the s'mores/fire pits because-- yum!  In the morning, we had wonderful walks on the property and even did a mediation session out on the outlook during sunrise.  Incredible.  It would be the perfect place for a wedding ceremony!  I highly recommend a trip out here- I definitely want to come back for a weekend getaway in the yurts or cabins... they are so cute!  Oh and take a dip in the hot tubs!  All in all a definite 5 out of 5-- we will definitely be back!  A huge thank you to Michele, Eva and team for their wonderful service!"

While the food selection is not huge, mainly chips, snacks, candies, and ice creams, they do offer a surprisingly large selection of vegan options - Daiya frozen pizzas and desserts, Nadamoo ice creams, almond milks, non-diary creamers, Amy's frozen meals, oat milk canned coffees and more. While the interior set up is definitely a no thrills kind of place, it's a fun spot to wander around and find some interesting drinks and eats. Hidden gem for sure. Definitely would return!"

                "description": "So, if you've been paying attention and have read previous reviews, you know this much: the Flag Store (no one local ever calls it by its long and generally misleading name, \"Hyde Park Market, Deli, and Organic Grocery\") sells about 1,000 different beers (although it does not, as they sometimes claim, carry every available beer in Austin); it also sells flags, local soap, craft soda, and other weird and sometimes necessary oddities, and does so in a labyrinthine space that defies the laws of physics based on the view from outside.  All of this is true, of course, and weird, and wonderful. How many stores can you go to for a Jester King Farmhouse Ale and a plumbing snake with a grabber at the end to unplug your apartment's AC condensation drain? Probably not that many, if we're honest.  It is also true that you get to listen to Chopin while you shop, and that the owner dude speaks like seven languages and is really cool.  It is, unfortunately, additionally true that every bomber, six-pack, and twelve-pack of beer; every esoteric hardware item; everything that makes the place seem as much a museum/cabinet of curiosities as a store, is priced 25% more than other local places where you can get the same stuff. Unless I'm in the mood for some recondite brew that I can't find anywhere else, I'm just not going to pay $17.99 for a $13.99 box of beer. Their prices are $2-$4 over minimum retail on each and every beer they sell.  So go to the Flag Store, admire its pandimensional awesomeness, buy a beer that you've never heard of in all of your life. But realize that you're there for a show as much as a store, and that they know it and charge admission."

                "description": "Hyde Park Market (Flag Store) is a great place to stop for gasoline. They also have an amazing selection of drinks, snacks, sandwiches, and other items. You will be surprised how they are able to stock so many different goods in a relatively small space. If you are looking for something unusual (birch beer; soda flavored like lemon meringue pie or bacon with syrup; etc), there is an excellent chance that you will find it here. I would give five stars for the gasoline part of the business and for the huge selection, but will take off a star for the often high prices on the food and beverage items."

It's a maze with beer around every corner. At the end of that hops and grain funhouse...ice cream! Nirvana.  Apparently the only beer they *don't* stock is exactly the one we were looking for - Austin Beerworks Heavy Machinery Wet Hop - so that was kind of a bummer. And the prices are way high - nearly double - on things that ARE sold elsewhere. (A random dude later in the day was giving us a local perspective on the bottle shop lay of the land, warned me away from \"The Flag Shop\" and its exorbitantly high prices - I didn't snap til just now that I had already been there and come to that same conclusion on my own. .. duh! I *had* been admiring the flag-lined entrance. Lol, thanks fur putting my mind right, Yelp!)  Definitely worth a visit for uniqueness and oddball beers, if you're not opposed to shelling out a little extra dough for them. And ice cream. .. GO for the ice cream."

The suction cup didn't work, and almost literally 30 seconds after I left, I came back and asked if I could switch. The man goes \"I wish you didn't open it\" as if it were my fault, and refused to switch it out. Or even give me a new suction cup.   How on earth does anyone not open a product to test it????? The woman who helped me watched as this happened, and didn't help. I bought 3 flags, each over 5 dollars.   This business has no integrity. If they aren't willing to put up with the expected cost of defective products, then get out of business.   Don't come here. Everything is unique, but if you don't like it -- don't expect a refund, much less an exchange. They don't give receipts either, so good luck buy all their expired food.   Cheapskates."

                "description": "Is it weird that I kind of like going to the gas station here? Okay, so I don't like how often I need to go to the gas station. I'd gladly hang a jolly roger or six from my car's antenna if they'd sponsor my adventures in amateur hooning.   Honestly, though, this is a lovely store full of wonderful things.   This place has a little bit of everything. Food, drinks, hardware, office supplies, candy, etc., etc., etc. I found varieties of Amy's soups that I didn't even know existed. They have local munchies from places like Tom's and the Green Cart. The beer selection is beyond extensive, and that they have build-your-own six packs if you'd like a variety pack. There's a great deal of cokes, teas, kombucha, wine, and other potable potables as well. There are cane sugar cokes I've never even heard of at this place. And the candy? They've got everything from the usual standbys to gourmet chocolate to sweets you thought were only available overseas.   It's a bit jumbled up inside, but it's well worth the time to wander through every nook and cranny and marvel at the variety of stuff that you didn't know you needed in this little building.   There's a 10-cent/gallon discount if you buy a certain amount of stuff inside--excluding alcohol, cigarettes and lottery tickets. The prices for gas are usually pretty reasonable, especially considering that it's a Shell in the middle of Hyde Park. They take all the usual credit cards--at the pump, too!   Then again, I find myself walking inside for some tea anyway because it's a fabulous store and the staff couldn't be friendlier. I feel like the guys behind the counter get to know their regulars here.   The pumps can get a bit busy (and mind the drop-off at the edge of the concrete!), so if you're going inside and it's packed, it's always a good idea to move your car and park in front or to the side so other folks can have a space to get gas."

                "description": "I don't get why people still rave about this place.  I will look at it from a beer buyers perspective.  Yes, they have a large singles wall.  Yes, they have a large selection of beer.  Yes, they have been around for a long time.  With that said, I think the high ratings come from not knowing better and people who have always shopped there in the past.  They gouge on prices all the time.  They do not know their beer and how long beer should be good for.  You can find way out-of-date IPAs there all the time.  You will be overcharged from similar stores (think other gas station/specialty stores that are NOT Central Market or Specs).  When they try charging almost double for Prairie limited releases due to them being \"rare\" compared to other stores, you know the type of place you are dealing with.  They will gouge customers because a beer is \"rare\"....they do not care about who they annoy.  They survive based on people not knowing better.  Every 6 pack in there is $2-3 more bucks than anywhere else in town.  And people still will walk in and say how great it is.  There are much better places.  Please spend your money at a place that is not trying to screw their customers."

(I kid you not, this past week their gas was $0.10 cheaper per gallon than the station on 45th and Burnet that is less than a mile away). Next, the market itself, is just an adventure. They have shelves on shelves on shelves of food, wine, beer, chocolate, nick-knacks, and, oh yeah, the flag of every nation, state, military, and who knows what else. I really could walk around here for an entire hour and not see everything they have to offer. Though, if you are claustrophobic, the walkways are a bit cramped in order to fit all of these eclectic items into such a small space. The staff is incredibly friendly and make the whole experience even better!"

My husband's been coming here for ages to pick up good beer, and I was okay with it because he would buy me a little conciliatory gift of specialty chocolate when he'd guiltily spend over $20 on beer. They sell so many awesome, delicious chocolate brands here -- Vosges, Love, Toblerone, Justin's, etc. But what makes this place the best is that they sell coconut-milk ice cream in pints. The same brands you can find at Whole Foods or Central Market, but MORE FLAVORS. I'd go into WF and be disappointed that the only Purely Decadent brand coconut-milk ice cream flavors they'd have for sale were Amaretto and plain. BOO! GROSS! There are dozens of flavors here, the hard-to-find ones... cookies n cream, chocolate-chip cookie dough, mint chocolate-chip, chocolate peanut butter, and on and on. Cases of lactose-free ice creams, and not just Purely Decadent, but Nada Moo and So Delicious too.   If you are lactose-intolerant and need ice cream periodically, this is the place to go to, hands-down! Also, they're open super late, so if you miss getting a shake or your vegan ice cream from Sweet Ritual (catty-corner from the Flag store, across the street inside Daily Juice) you can just come in here and take a pint home."

I remmeber once buying a small container of ice cream for 7 dollars in here.That's my only complaint, this place is really amazing overall.

This store is that place.  I'm not sure who buys their wine, but whoever you are, you know your s**t.  This place has a small selection, but pretty much everything in stock is not only good, but a good value.  It is basically what I would buy in California by the case, and bring back to Austin on a road trip.  But without the road trip.

                "description": "My friends and I went on a wine tour for our friend's birthday party the first weekend in August and it was great!   From the beginning stages of planning, Francesca, (the owner, planner, driver, etc.) worked her hardest to make sure the event was personalized for our group. Fran was also very quick with correspondence and letting me know important information and what she needed from me.   We decided that the Wimberly/Dripping Springs tour was the best route for us since a lot of people had already been to Fredericksburg wineries. Fran picked us up at 9am in Round Rock (she'll work with you on your pick up/drop off site) and she drove us around in an air conditioned mini tour bus! Did I mention that the bus is BYOB?! We brought on our own ice chests and bags for snacks which was great for the 45 minute trip we had! Fran also has a DVD/CD player on the bus but we brought our own speakers for our iPod. She also had tips on wine tasting and a map of the wine country for us to take a look at on the road.   We went to three wineries and an olive oil orchard. It was so hot outside for the olive oil orchard that our group decided to leave early but the rest of the wineries were all inside and all of the staff at the wineries were so nice and informative. One of our friends even bought a case of wine from one of them! Remember to bring money with you in case you fall in love with one or more of the delicious Texas wines that you have to buy a bottle or two!   Fran also arranged for our group to have Saltlick bbq plates for us at one of the wineries! Our group pre-ordered either turkey, chopped beef, sliced beef, etc. We had our sandwich with potato salad, coleslaw, beans (the best beans I've had in awhile), extra delicious seasame seed bread, extra bbq sauce, Tiff's Treats cookies, Sweet Leaf Tea, water, etc. etc.! It was a lovely lunch outside at the winery. We were all so full! But all of that came in the price of the tour! Fran even got us a deal with a cake-maker and we had a birthday cake waiting for our friend along with candles to surprise her!  Fran and her business associate, Melinda, were with us during every tour and let us know when we needed to move on to the next winery. They really made sure we that were ok and having a great time. They even had patience to take pictures of us with our multiple cameras.   We all headed back around 4pm and returned safe and sound (and still pumped up from the awesome day) around 5pm. All in all, it was a great day! Fran really has a great business and will personalize tours for all types of groups. She's very professional and you can tell she takes pride in what she does and will go the extra mile to make you feel your group is top priority! We'll definitely be going back to try more tours with L'Avventura Dolce, especially when the weather cools down! Great job!"

We booked their bus for a winery tour for my bachelorette party, and they unfortunately ruined it (really by no fault of theirs...but still).  We were scheduled for pick up at 1.  At 12:30, they called to say that their bus broke down and that they would be an hour and a half late.  At 2:30, they finally showed up in an old, dirty van.  My group and I were squished together with all our things, and what's worse is that we couldn't really see or talk to one another.  The speaker system rattled and was distracting.  Also, since the wineries close at 6, our tour was cut drastically short, and we had to rush.  We also had someone who had to leave early, so in turn, had to miss the entire tour.    The only redeeming quality was the excellent customer service of the company.  Both the driver and the owner were truly wonderful and apologetic.  I know that these things happen, but I do think that having an acceptable backup vehicle is important."

Our host guided us on a tour of the Christmas lights in Wimberley, TX (at the EmilyAnn Theatre which was 9 acres of amazing holidays lights - one of the best light displays I've ever seen in my life) and in Johnson City, TX.  My friends and I had an amazing time, as did the rest of the bus based on the jovial environment (laughter, singer, and a showing of \"The Christmas Story\") created by our host and bus driver.  L'Avventura Dolce's Christmas Light tour will definitely be one of my new Christmas traditions.  Hopefully, other special events are in store for the future.   Cheers!"

                "description": "Two years in a row now, me and my peeps have used this company to chauffeur us around the hill country wineries.  Beautiful idea, that.  Depending on how many people you have and what kinda of car you want, they will tote you around in a shuttle bus, a limo, or even a stretch hummer.    What is sooo cool about this company, is that they are so laid back about every event you schedule with them.  They will let you bring ungodly amounts of food and booze on the bus or limo and you can get as loud and unruly as you want, as long as you don't puke in the vehicle.  Last year  got a little rowdy and alll the girls ended up pole dancing in the shuttle bus!    We always bring party trays of sammiches, cheese n crackers, and lots of easy to drink beverages, like box wine or premade mixed drinks. We have them pick us up at my house at 10 am and they bring us back at 6.  And in that time we are usually able to visit 5 wineries.  When you call to set this up, talk to Bob.  He will visit with you on the phone for a long time, finding out where you want to go and making recommendations on new places.  He is a real sweetheart.  The drivers have always been very helpful also in recommending places and in general by putting up with our drunken behavior i.e. pulling the limo into a convenience store to pee several times in route......  One more kindness they extended to me this year.  We had reserved the airport shuttle style bus again as we had 10 people on our tour and low and behold pulling up in front of my house was the stretch hummer.  I was a little nervous about a mixup but they said not to worry, the bus had a flat that morning so we just got upgraded....now that thing was pimped out!  Blue running lights inside, nice stereo system (I bring my own cd's), and glasses and cups lining the backs of the seats.  Only problem with the hummer is it is kinda difficult to get in and out of for older people or anyone with a gimpy leg.  Only 2 back doors and a steep step down.  Gotta crab walk if you are sitting near the front.  Small regrets compared to a great day of hangin with my peeps, sampling wine and enjoying our hill country."

Will was polite and professional and helped us pick out wineries to go to.  We went to five wineries and my girlfriend and I were a little drunk by the end.  We had booked five hours (12pm-5pm) but knew we had gone over that by 30 minutes and were fine with that.  When the driver wanted us to pay for the extra time he said \"Well, you went an hour and half over but I'll put it down as an hour and fifteen\".  I called him on it and said it was only thirty minutes.  He showed me his watch and for some unknown reason his watch showed 6:30pm.  My girlfriend and I both got out our cell phones and showed him that it was in fact 5:30pm.  He then backed down and charged us for thirty minutes.  At the time, I let it pass and even tipped him quite well cause his service had been good.  Later, when I was more sober, I realized that it was extremely peculiar for his watch to be an hour *ahead*.  I am pretty certain he was actively trying to scam us for an extra hour and don't appreciate someone trying to take advantage of me when I've had some to drink."

We had a white hummer limo pick us up from the home we rented in Austin to take us to four wineries. The driver was super friendly, and even gave us more time at the end of our trip to fit in one more winery.   10 of us fit comfortably in the limo. It was a great experience, I highly recommend!!!"

He recommended the 9 passenger limo and 4 of the favorite wineries- Becker, Massina Hof, 4 points and Mendelbaum   Becker was our favorite! The guys working were so fun and the place had delicious nuts, chocolate and live music. The wine was good, too ;)  Our driver, Eric, was awesome and we got upgraded to a hummer limo for free!  Don't forget to bring lots of snacks!"

                "description": "Found this company on Yelp. Last Sunday, I booked their party shuttle to take 9 women on wine tours for my sister's birthday. Their pricing is dramatically better than all the other companies I researched.  When they showed up, they arrived with the stretch hummer limo - free upgrade due to an issue with the shuttle radio from the party the day before.  Drive showed up almost right on time. Our driver was nice, knowledgeable and all the part-goers were very pleased.    I highly recommend you visit the wineries n a Sunday instead of a Saturday. We visited 6 wineries and had the place to ourselves at most wineries. In contrast, when I've gone on a Saturday, the wineries were overwhelmed, which meant you received no personal service and had to wait in lines - and thus you visit less wineries. Sundays and Bluebonnet Wine Tours are the way to go."

I reserved a party bus for last Saturday to take some girlfriends on a wine tour to celebrate my 25th birthday.  Everything was fantastic from beginning to end!  They were at least a hundred dollars cheaper than any other place I called, and I feel like we could not have gotten better service.    When I made the reservation, I estimated that we would have around 15 girls and Bob reserved the 16 passenger bus for us.  However, a few days before the event I realized that we actually had 17 people.  I called Bob (slightly panicking that he wouldn't have a solution) and was pleasantly surprised that he offered to upgrade us to a larger bus for no additional charge!  Happy birthday to me!  Our driver (Justin or Jason... I think his name was Jason) arrived 15 minutes early and was extremely patient with us the entire time.  I mean, what other guy could put up with that many screaming, dancing, drunk 20-somethings on a long car ride??  Jason was very professional but also very personable.  He even suggested a winery (Woodrose) that was not on our original tour - and I'm so glad he did!  Woodrose was very low-key and had some great live music (it was perfect for our first stop).    We ended up only going to three wineries on our tour (we were slated to go to four) but that was completely our fault - we just spent wayyyy too much time at each stop.  All in all, this was the perfect way to celebrate my birthday!"

We were staying about 30 minutes away, so it was great to have a ride for all of us girls.  We decided on Sat. to call them again for another night on the town and they accomodated.

NEVER AGAIN. im now scheduling our next limo service by asking first if they are associated with blue bonnet. HORRIBLE SERVICE! small parties beware!"

She immediately asked us what music we wanted to crank and encouraged all the \"wooing\" from the back of the van. She also offered to take pictures of us, scouted out the best locations for group photos and even took TONS of candid pics of us while we enjoyed the winery and distillery we went to. She helped with all of the logistics of checking in at each stop and making sure we were taken care of. She also let us make a pee stop on the way home...and overall she was just SUPER nice and was basically hyping us up the entire day, making sure the bride felt special and making sure we all had fun. By the end of the day we all felt like she was part of the crew. Thank you again Song!!"

I even received a call back in May while on a business trip from the shuttle service company asking if we would pay the overtime for Hugo because AWT had not paid them yet. We even tipped Hugo an additional amount for his extra time spent with us.   The response just posted (almost 4 months later) is also extremely unprofessional and misleading. We were promised a great time for a bachelorette party and were let down. Plain and simple. Those employed by AWT that we spoke with were rude as well. Secondly, I never said that AWT hosted prom events/transportation. I was told that the company that is usually utilized was completely full (by Brad) and that prom happened to be a priority and the school bus that was sent was all they could get us even though we were promised a party bus.   At the end of the day we were completely dissatisfied with the services offered by AWT. Calling a client a bridezilla (who in fact actually never spoke to any AWT employee), claiming your company has gotten PTSD from our group and falsely accusing our group to be racist by saying we told \"blackie to leave\" is unprofessional and disrespectful amongst other things said in response to our reviews. All of those involved would be happy to discuss this event again in a professional manner since you mentioned that we were offered a full refund when that in fact was not true. We were offered maybe $350 (I could be wrong on this amount since we haven't heard/spoken to anyone from AWT for several months) in return if we removed our reviews.  As a company you should take responsibility instead of blaming others for your mistakes that way you can fix the problem and do better for future patrons. Especially since there has been no money refunded at this point."

Sara was very informative and laid everything out, giving us a doable timeline for the afternoon we wanted. The itinerary we received gave us a good idea of how long to spend at each venue. There were only 4 people in our group, so we were able to do a very flexible hourly option, with appointments at the wineries.  Since we had less than 5 passengers, our tastings weren't included (informed that going in) however, that did not deter our experience... it was awesome! Buying a bottle of wine at each venue was very affordable when we split the cost among us.  George, our driver, was professional and friendly; and the limo experience was awesome! You might want to bring snacks just in case someone gets a bit tipsy, but most wineries offer food of some kind. Thanks Austin Wine Tours, for making me look like a champ with my high maintenance friends... I'll be back!"

I filled out an inquiry form and then was contacted right away. We booked a private tour for a couples trip. Alee was great in providing suggestions and making sure to fit what we wanted as part of the tour. We got to tour Hawk's Shadow, then had a tasting at Duchman and ended our tour with some delicious BBQ from Salt Lick, next to Salt Lick Cellars. Tom, our driver was so nice and flexible with our schedule. He reminded us of how much time we had but did not feel rushed at all. We'll definitely be booking Slowpokes for any future trips!"

After talking with her she designed a day that was diverse and showed us a number of new things in the Dripping Springs area.  Our day included several of the high country wineries, one brewery and a visit to the quaint town of Wimberly. We highly recommend this group over  other Austin wine tour groups as they create a very personalized day and made sure everyone enjoyed the stops.   Our day started with lunch at Homespuns in Dripping Springs - excellent start to a beautiful day!  The Bloody Marys are highly recommended."

Lindsey chose our wineries very wisely; we started with lunch at Crowson (whose owner will drop incredible knowledge on you), enjoyed a rainstorm and a glass of red at the beautiful Ron Yates, and ended with cheese and BOOOOM wine at Hye Meadow Winery. It was lovely day of booze, conversation, and sisterhood. And, yes, we loved Lindsey so much she became a part of our wolfpack. Lindsey was fun, energetic, and knowledgeable about the area. I would definitely do this tour again!"

She made a wine bottle with me and my moms photo on it with a sweet birthday message and quote.  She took so many photos of us, and really made us feel special. We were able to choose our wineries and she even picked us up and dropped us off at our BNB. She had the most amazing tapas tray, with cheese, mixed nuts, her special dip, crackers, breads and meats. She had this prepared and sat out for us at Wimberly winery,  halfway through the tour. At the end of this stop, she even had cupcakes for my moms birthday. I had actually called around different wine tours in the area and Slow Poke Wine tours offered the best value and I can tell you now, the best service. We wouldn't hesitate to do it again. This trip with my mom was priceless and so special. I thank you Linda for making an amazing memory for my mom and I."

We went to a beautiful winery to begin and enjoyed a lunch spread while there; then we went to a distillery with AMAZING frozen mint juleps, outdoor games and great scenic views; finally we ended at the olive oil and balsamic producer for more snacks and great wine. Linda was very attentive to us and did a great job of keeping us on schedule without rushing us, she picked us up around 10:30AM and we returned around 4:30PM. Hope to enjoy this tour again in the future, a very diverse experience that I think even the guys would enjoy!"

My now fiancée and I rode in the Model T Ford, which was all-original except for the brakes. I contacted Linda with any questions, concerns, and booking, and Linda picked up my fiancée in a Mercedes van.  We went to a great breakfast, and then David drove us around in the Model T Ford. The route was scenic, breathe taking, and beautiful.  The wineries we stopped at were great, and, the customer service from Linda and David was unbeatable.  They have a unique business that is more than just a van or limo driving you around to distilleries, breweries, or wineries (although they also have a Mercedes van option).  I am now going on another tour with them for a bachelor party, and they could not have provided more prompt replies to my requests for information related to travel, pick up at different locations, types of tours they offer, and pricing.  What a great business run by some truly nice and professional people who offer very reasonable pricing.  I plan to use their services again in the future."

He was super reasonable with pricing and sent along restaurant and sight-seeing options before our trip.   The day of, he was right on time and beyond courteous in helping us get all of our stuff to the van. He even stopped on the way for us to grab food and alcohol.   Since the weather was iffy, Alba made sure to let us know that he was standing by and flexible with timing so he could bring us back to town early if we wanted.   The van was clean and comfy. I'd absolutely recommend him to anyone going to Austin and hope to use his services again soon. :)"

We had a bachelorette party and because of the weather we had to change our plans -- not only was he super flexible and nice, but he had lots of great suggestions and helped us salvage the day with a lot of fun activities. He was really friendly, on time, and continuously checked in to make sure we were all comfortable and had what we needed. Not to mention was great about us listening to our own music and helping with literally anything! I would definitely recommend him for any group trips."

He was incredibly kind, helpful, thorough and prompt. He showed up fifteen minutes early at our place and helped us load into the car. Alba then brought us to a grocery store on the way so we could get supplies for the boat. He packed two coolers which we were able to bring on the boat - another big plus. And he was prompt and helpful in bringing us back home afterward.  As a bonus, he's incredibly knowledgeable about the surrounding area and was able to offer up tons of great suggestions. Last but not least, he's a really nice guy! 10/10, would definitely recommend Alba to anyone."

He took us to Dripping Springs and Spicewood for my Bachelorette party and we had a blast. Several girls said it was the best bachelorette party they had been to!!

Our experience with Jax, Ruben and Evan was great. They all know so much (interesting things) about Austin and their enthusiasm left me wanting to stay longer to learn more about this great \"weird\" city that I've grown to love. We rode around for two hours with 2 other couples in a van and it was perfect. The time flew by. I didn't want it to end. I would've loved hanging out with Jax, Ruben and Evan all day. Jax even treated us to gelato at one of her favorite food trucks in Barton Springs. How sweet was that!! We definitely will return someday to Austin to enjoy all there is to enjoy. Thank you, Jax, Ruben and Evan. It was a great pleasure meeting you all...truly!!!"

Jason loves what he does and he is a real people person. A trip down South Congress finished out our day with all the fun facts from our personable guide. We had the best day ever!!!

If others are saying good things about them, then it's probably worth trying. I signed up  the Real Austin Tour the night before and got an immediate confirmation. Their website says \"a city overview in just 2 hours\" which was perfect, but with a little mishap and trouble with parking, it ended up being around 2.5 hours. The van was roomy and clean, and a nice component of the tour, well, because less walking. I can imagine during the hot summer, the van with a/c would be the preferred way to tour around the city.   The tour took us through many neighborhoods and major sights around Austin. Enough that, I went back to many of the stops to explore further. There were many interesting facts pointed out and of course, the scary stories and legends make it all very fun and a bit silly. Stopped off at one of the cupcakes food trucks for a tasty treat, all included with the tour. If you're in Austin, this is a great little tour to see many sites in a short span of time."

                "description": "I stumbled across Personal Wine by chance when I was searching for a magnum bottle of Whispering Angel online. I had no idea I could personalize a bottle of wine online. I ordered the magnum with a customized label and the process was very smooth and easy! I never got a shipping confirmation email so I reached out to them and got a response pretty quickly. The package did arrive the morning after they guaranteed it would, so I would recommend giving yourself a few days as a buffer so you aren't in a pickle. The label looked amazing and the bottle was packaged in styrofoam so it was protected during shipping."

                "description": "I am not an avid wine drinker like many I know, but I am an avid person who appreciates unique products and great customer service.  I previously learned about Personal Wine at a local charity event where they had custom engraved wine bottles as gifts to help raise money for the charity; knowing this, it planted a seed in my mind to give them a try.  Recently, while in a crush of thoughts and ideas to get a gift I remembered Personal Wine. Committing to using them for my inspired gift needs, I decided that I wanted a custom label printed on two nice bottles of wine.  So, I went to the website.... and it seems that since the website was far too simple for me to understand [self-deprecating humor and honesty so you can laugh]... then I simply called them so I could speak about options.    In a short timely manner I spoke with their customer service and I was placed in contact with Michael and his customer service focus was a great relief and helped me sort out my thoughts for the logo, design, capabilities they have and much much more.  In the end and in the perfect storm of timing, I was able to get them what they needed and they were able to get me a perfect product by days end. It's not everyday that they can process things in a timely manner so fast, but the staff and team helped me out greatly. Michael even personally cut out the unique shape of the label like a skilled surgeon to meet my needs. (it was unique per my request)  I ended up getting 2 custom labeled bottles of wine and a pine box to present them in. It surely will be a unique gift that will not be expected.  If you are looking for a great gift that displays your personal style, I would try Personal Wine as they can pretty much match your wants and needs for gifts. Remember they are local, but they do deliver around the United States (read the website for details).  Additionally, I learned that they are also available for \"venue\" opportunities if you would like to have a private event, wine tasting, meeting space, etc. so just contact them for details. The space is really classic, comforting, and reminiscent of old school \"speak easy\" lounges with the great oak tables and comfortable leather seating.  Personal wine deserves the 5-Star rating for helping me meet all my gift needs when I needed it most."

                "description": "I ordered some custom inscribed wine glasses and was disappointed. The etching was so faint I could barely see it. The font and logos were also very small and badly proportioned. Dealing with Franco at customer service was like speaking with a 5 year old, he didn't listen and just kept repeating what he was trained to say, constantly talking over me and in denial. I didn't feel that the quality or design was worth the cost. The best part was after I told franco the product did not measure up to what was promised he did offer me a discount on future orders ? Again, obviously he wasn't listen. Why would I order more if the product was less than desirable. Denial is a river in Egypt, its a protocol at Personal Wine."

We have sent out a lot of corporate gifts over the years, as well as thank you notes, but the customized bottles of bubbly wine we sent through Personal Wine have been far and away the most popular gifts we've sent.  Ordering was a breeze. Ben Myers was a total gem and walked me through all of our options. We had a huge list of addresses we had to send to, and our order arrived well before the anticipated date. The labels looked beautiful and our customers took to social media to proudly show off their custom bottles of wine.  I honestly couldn't be more please with both the final product and the customer service I received. They are an awesomely rocking company and I would absolutely recommend them to any and every person who's looking for a unique, personalized gift for friends, family, and corporate contacts. Thanks so much Personal Wine!"

Got a few Pinot Grigio bottles personalized for one of my fav former co-workers for her birthday, and I was really impressed with the end of result. She LOVED it, and I seriously couldn't be more happy from the pictures she sent me after receiving the gift. The only criticism I have is that the templates don't necessarily align with the corresponding event--I picked a label for her birthday that was actually under 'Valentine's Day'--but it was easily remedied by a few font changes and so forth. There were a few templates that were perhaps misplaced or mislabeled, but that aside, the final product was an absolute gem. I definitely recommend this company for anyone looking for a thoughtful gift that resonates with fellow wine lovers!"

The recipients of the personalized wine and glasses absolutely loved them and admired the professionalism and wondered how it was done or where I got it!   They work fast and quality of work is high end. I wouldn't say you get what you pay for - I think that you get more than what you pay for in terms of wine, personalized product and customer service. They work to your needs and are very flexible and very willing to do what they can to get your orders the way you want them.   Highly recommended and will be ordering from them in the near future!"

I thought the writing was really small and was concerned that they wouldn't notice that we had made a personalized sticker. Another concern was the card that I ordered... it looked like somebody sat on it...it was on very thin paper and came in a sealed envelope all crumpled up... I am so happy that I opened it and took a look. This kind of thing just makes the whole gift look cheap...  I went out at the last minute to buy a card."

Not one of those scenes where people are there to be seen and you have to talk loudly to the person sitting next to you. This is a place where wine lovers go for a glass or two and relax and have some conversation. They have a nice variety of bottles and truly believe a wine expert could find a few that they love. The seating consists of over sized leather chairs and many leather sofas. They have a bar area and one really long table perfect for large parties or tastings. This place has cement floors and walls lined with bottles. No one expects you to arrive in a suit or anything stuff like that. This is a come as you are sort of place. The only prerequisite is that you like wine and are of legal drinking age. Oh one more thing you won't find this place over run by the 6th street crowd, this place is much more relaxed then that."

The wines do not have the chemicals that I don't think should be added. A wine should stand on its own!  \"Custom wine without the chemicals\"  Supremely good! I'm a wine snob as I was raised with it and also living and working around the world I was able to have some of the best wines in the world. No, I am not rich . Wines that are sent to the states are really jacked up in price and I was able to get what I wanted and bring it back. One thing I did learn is that you don't drink an expensive wine as a part of the meals but enjoy it on its own. I bought 2 bottles of Barolo to have with an Italian meal. It was a great fit. This little place has fulfilled the perfect fit! The lady who owns the place and makes the wine is quite nice and understand all of the above. I will be back!"

                "description": "I'm not a drinker.  I have a low tolerance for alcohol, and wine hits me particularly hard.  But I attended a group wine tasting here with a friend yesterday, and thus our tale begins...  I got there as the second serving of a six-wine tasting was progressing, and I was immediately struck by the smoothness of the wine that was being served at the moment, a Gewurtraminer.  Shortly after sipping that wine, I mentioned that I had almost no tolerance for alcohol.  Steve, the master of ceremonies for the tasting, told the group that Austin Custom Wineries did not add sulphites, the major cause of wine intolerance, into their wine as most wineries do for preservative purposes.  As a result, though the wines should be drunk within five years, the wines are eminently drinkable for even the lightest of weight drinkers like me.  Seriously, I can't even finish a bottle of beer (Shiner).  So I was able to partake in the tasting!  I didn't drink all of each of the wines, but I had more than I normally would have felt comfortable with (to avoid headaches), and I suffered absolutely zero ill effects.  It was amazing.    Also amazing: ACW's selection of dessert wines--ports and ice wines.  Maybe I'm just not a fancy wine connoisseur, but those dessert wines are drinkable and tasty.  And since they have no added sulphites, all I have to worry about is the alcohol content!"

                "description": "Was glad to finally visit this winery.  Met one of the owners.  He was very welcoming and gave us so much information about the wines his winery makes.  We tasted 6 wines for a $10 fee.  The grape juice is purchased and then the wine maker takes it from there to make several different wines.  The server gave generous pours to ensure we tasted the wines fully.  He used 6 separate wine glasses to ensure we tasted the different wines which I thought was nice.  Most wine places used the same wine glass to sample the wines.  We enjoyed visiting with the owner.  A very pleasant gentleman.  I really recommend visiting this winery with your friends.  If you don't know anything about wine, not to worry because the owner will make sure your wine tasting experience is a positive one."

While the recipes might have changed over the years, they never cease to bring a great selection out every year. The port wines have been some of our favorites, raspberry chocolate port in particular. My husband has always been a fan of their blackberry merlot. We moved north of Austin, but when ever we take a trip to south Austin area, this spot is a must stop! Don't forget to ask about their wine club too; it is a great way to sample the variety of flavors they bring out!"

The big charter bus picked us up downtown Austin and we headed to the wineries. I am not much of a wine person but after this tour, found out what wine I actually enjoy. Our tour guide was great and interactive with everyone on the tour and made sure we all enjoyed ourselves. Our bus driver was a pro driving those roads and I felt safe having him as my sober driver LOL. The BBQ lunch was pretty tasty and everything overall was great. I would definitely do it again."

The road trip there was very beautiful however finding the parking lot SUCKED!! Our truck 4WD barely made it down, I do not recommend going any further if you have a small vehicle because the lot is NOT paved.   The wait wasn't too bad. If you get stuck at the end of the line I recommend taking umbrellas!! There is limited seating on the bottom, so if you get stuck sitting at the top it's better to be safe.   The burgers grilled were delicious, the staff was friendly and funny and the music was pretty good.   Overall a very fun experience.   Ps. One toilet per boat and it's tall and nasty"

Our bus driver Tanagay was amazing the way she maneuvered that bus into the tiniest of spaces!  The wineries we visited.. Mendelbaums,Tejas, FatAss and Vinovium were just so beautiful, fun and so so friendly! Each winery had a rep that made us feel so welcomed when we arrived. The fresh Italian meal was amazing and so delicious! I will definitely book again in the near future!"

                "description": "I've been on two Texas Wino Tours so far with very different experiences!   2018: First tour I went on was a couple years ago, we had a great time from beginning to end! Bus ride smooth and seamless. Tour guide was awesome and energetic. I left this first tour thinking \"I'll definitely come back!\"  2021: This second tour was ROUGH. We went for my Bachelorette party for a wine tour out to Fredericksburg with a timeline of 11:30 - 6:30. Within the tour we were supposed to to visit 3 wineries, and Luckenbach.   Sadly, the bus driver ruined the experience by getting lost almost the entire day. Not only was she directionally challenged, but she drove like a NASCAR driver trying to make up for lost time; causing many people to become motion sick.   She somehow took a wrong turn in the morning, then we hit traffic from a wreck up ahead (I understand second part not her fault) we did not arrive at the first winery until 1:30pm. Stayed for about 40 minutes, then onto the next.   Second winery was great, had a BBQ lunch, atmosphere awesome and laid back. Stayed for about 1hr 15 minutes.  Third stop was to Luckenbach, we visited for about 35 minutes, then it was back on the bus at 5:15pm.   This is were it got a little crazy. Bus driver took a wrong turn and started going South, somehow ended 10 minutes North of San Antonio, then we were lost out in the middle of nowhere with no cell service.   It started to buzz around the bus that we were lost, and it took an 1 hr and 15 minutes before our tour guide even said anything over the intercom about us being lost!! Everyone was so annoyed because the tour guide proceed to say we could make it to the third winery even though the winery was about to close. (We would only be able to stay for 10 minutes) At this point it was 6:45pm already well past when we were supposed to be back in Austin.   Get ahold of this, we did not reach our drop off location in Austin until 7:50pm. At that point we were on the bus for 2 hrs a 15 minutes just riding around Texas.   Out of 8 hrs with them only 2.5 were spent outside.  It was sad to spend my whole Bachelorette party (especially on a beautiful day) on a Bus with terrible old music on replay, travelers in a bad mood, and everyone wanting to go home. :("

However, I went on Groupon to purchase their discounted tour for $200. That comes out to $50/person. When I went to checkout, they REQUIRED additional tasting room fees that came out to $140. (On Groupon, they write: \"Wine tastings not included but available for an additional fee\", so this is misleading.) In total, that comes out to about $85/person, which is MORE than they are currently charging per person on their website ($73 during their \"summer sale\"). Let me save you some time!"

We spent the last warm October day on a two-story party barge out on Lake Travis. On this tour we were able to sit back and soak in the sun.  This tour is BYOB so there was no shortage of beverages that my crew and I enjoyed. The vast majority of this boat tour, we were docked, which I did not expect.   Boat Facts:  This is a 4 hour boat excursion.  This boat offered a slide at the top of the boat for those who wished to slip and slide into the waters of Lake Austin. Float Noodles are afforded. The boat is Bluetooth compatible so you can bring your own music to be played on the boat speaker system. Burgers are made on the boat (albeit greasy ones).  At the end of the tour, you and your crew are given Texas Winos Schwag.   Synopsis:  My crew and I had a good time but I would not recommend this tour if you are looking to go around Lake Travis as the tour is fairly stationary. In addition, if you have an aversion to greasy or heavy foods (like the burgers prepared on the boat), bring your own eats like I did. Total spent for this outing (not including tip) $29.00. This tour is what YOU make it."

Richard is very thorough with his planning and provides you with all and any info you may need to make sure you have nothing to worry and have everything you need.   This is not the first time I have been to one of his events. I have been to a wine tour that I loved and those that joined me as well. Ive also been to a wino fest which was held at the sterling event venue and that offered so many wineries to taste from along with what you can pair them with. They have so many different events and tours that you cant go wrong with any of them. It depends on what you're looking for and what vibe you want plus you always get some kind of swag/souvenirs.   I definitely recommend you try one of his events. You'll enjoy it all."

They don't believe in playing swear words or music before the 2000's it just was kinda a bummer bc we had 40 people who paid $29 each for just a burger and a bag of chips and crappy music??????

                "description": "Do not recomment and will not return.  I had an amazing experience with Texas Winos in 2014. At that time, the tour was on a nice bus with friendly driver and tour guide. Based on this experience, I had recommended Texas Winos to many people.   Recently (2021) we were looking to do Fredericksburg winery tour so I again recommended to do it with Texas Winos.   The transportion was in a very uncomfortable van with water leaking/dropping out of AC unit that was attached at the back of the van.   The three wineries we visited weren't in Fredericksburg. Two were in Johnson city and one was in a location in between Fredericksburg and Johnson city. Other than the first winery in Johnson City we visitied, the other two wineries we visited didn't have vineyards in sight. They were just two big container area that seemed like where they store wine (so there wasn't any ambience of winery or vineyard. It was just a wine tasting). We didn't even take pictures at those two locations as there really weren't anything pretty or nice to take picture.  The lunch option provided was not the same as what was shown on the web site (there was no salad and the options were different). The lunch was provided at the second winery, which had a dog walking around table to table (begging for food).   Before the third winery, we were informed we will be visiting the brewery since there weren't many people joinning the tour (hence the small van like a super shuttle, the airport transportation van). However, we were only given 20min at the brewery although we were running early.   At the third winery, the driver decided to leave us (and note, there was no guide. So we were all by ourselves without anyone from Texas Winos) to pick up his neighbors from other winery (hence why we were given only 20min at the brewery). We were stranded at the 3rd location (which again didn't have any vineyard in sight to walk around or take pictures while we were waiting) just waiting for the driver to return long after the wine tasting was over. This eventually led us to get back to Austin later than expected.   I regret not checking reviews online before recommending this place. I had an amazing time couple years ago but it was the worst experience this time around. We were all just wanting to get back to Austin. There were many vineyards around that had nice ambience and pretty views but the second and thirs winery we went to were the ones that we honestly wouldn't have gone ourselves as they weren't really vineyards but just container area providing wine tasting.    Overall, not worth it."

It was a last-minute decision to book a bus so we ended up having two drivers, because they had to scheduled something at the last minute, and both were entirely friendly, professional and helpful. We wanted to find a bar with a mechanical bull and they helped us track one down. There communication was perfect, it was always easy to reach them and they were super flexible at the end of the night, allowing us to extend our trip for as many hours as we wanted for an hourly rate. In the end we only stayed out another hour, and they gave us the extra hour for free. Also, because it was a late booking, they offered us their 25 person bus for the 20 person bus rate.  The sound system was enough to give everyone permanent hearing loss and the dancing pole and hand holds proved to be incredibly robust and secure!  These guys are AWESOME, and I would DEFINITELY book from them again in a heartbeat."

When i asked him if he could please tell me his thoughts on how long the bus was needed for, etc over the phone because it was easier for me to do as I could not look at my phone at the time, he very rudely said \"I just don't understand why you can't just look this up on our website.\"   I do not think it is too much to ask to provide basic information over the phone, and the snarky, rude comment was completely uncalled for and one of the more unprofessional customer service experiences I have had.

Bench-style limo seating, hardwood floors, good sound system, and a pole for dancing.  My birthday guests were all impressed.   Service: Our driver Mike quickly answered every question I had in the weeks leading up to the event (and I had a lot).  He gave us an excellent rate, arrived on time, and was very polite and accommodating.  We were a loud, rowdy birthday crew, but he never seemed to mind.  The first toob place we visited was sold out, so he called another and even got us a group rate!    Overall: Very happy, no complaints.  I plan a few different party buses every year, and I will be using Sixth Street Rides from now on."

The deal was supposed to end before we were able to get the group together but Sixth Street Rides was very accommodating on extending our deal to March (2 months after the deal was supposed to expire).  Mike handled our requests including moving the date and giving us suggestions on where to go with complete respect and professionalism.  I received a confirmation the day before as well as our driver, Chris,  called us 20 mins before our pick up time.  We had a couple hiccups (including running late - as 15 girls tend to do - as well as running late at our last winery stop) but Chris handled it with the utmost patience and ease.    Honestly I couldn't have asked for a better company to use for our wine tour.  I highly recommend Chris and Matt over at Sixth Street Rides."

Just make sure you get a bus with an A/C. Other than that, no complaints about this company. Driver was on time (11:00), and took us wherever we wanted to go. We had the bus for 4 hours which was more than enough time. Spent an hour or so on the bus, got dropped off down town for 2 hours, then rode it for the last hour and dropped people off back in west campus. It was perfect!\""

                "description": "The staff was amazing. It was a little confusing when it came to finding the buses for the shuttle because the instructions weren't really clear. However, I'm giving this a one star because on the shuttle while performing karaoke the staff allowed a white passenger to say various racial slurs on the mic without immediately removing the woman away from the microphone, they didn't even attend to condemn or stop her. At the very least they could have stoped karaoke or stopped playing songs that allowed people to say those slurs so loudly and confidently. As the only black person on the bus it was extremely uncomfortable and dealt with inappropriately. Don't plan on ever using their services again."

                "description": "I had a terrible experience with Tour Austin. We had booked 2 tickets for a bus departing at 3:30 PM. Upon arrival (15 minutes early), we were told the bus was full. We ended up being forced to wait until 5 PM before departing and missed a good portion of the concert we were being shuttled to.  Additionally, we were separated from the rest of our group who had boarded the 3:30 shuttle seconds earlier. The concert began at 5 PM. It was clear that passengers who had booked later ticket times were given our seats on the 3:30 PM shuttle instead of us.   Upon departure from the concert, the bus location changed several times which caused a ton of confusion amongst the passengers.   To top it off, repeated attempts to reach out to Tour Austin to remedy the situation have failed.  They have continued to ignore my emails regarding the issues but seem to be able to still send me emails asking for a Yelp rating, so here it is...  Update: owner has reached out and refunded tickets"

They were very patient and answered all of our questions, did not rush us and gave us time at the various murals to talk about what was the story behind the mural as well as some local gossip! They were easy to engage in discussions about Texas, history, places to go, etc... we were looking for a street Art tour but we actually got so much more... the tour traversed the city so we got the flavor of how different each neighborhood is. They were very knowledgeable about music venues, restaurants and bars ... well worth taking this tour. Marty and Bette, NY, NY"

When we booked the trip no one said there would be an extra cost once you got to the shuttle in Fredericksburg so that was a lil confusing, but ok, disappointed but we can still enjoy ourselves. Wait 1st off, We left a little late but no big deal, then we get there and there is the extra \"no tell\" charge issues, no big deal. We walk the district have a great time back on the bus we'll within the time frame. However, the tour guide not only made us wait and extra 30 mins for 2 other ppl, but we had to sit through CONSTANT arguing about it. We finally leave and THE MOST repulsive individual strung together profanity from Fredericksburg to Austin in a non-stop fashion. The tour guide never asked him to calm down, or to show a little respect for other people in such close quarters....noooo he joined in. They talked about everything from carrying a knife to giving away 15 different types of \"weed!!\" I nor my friends and everybody we can tell in AUSTIN will EVER take Austin Tours again. I know we keep Austin \"weird\" but the amount of $ we paid for this trip should allow a certain amount of customer service. So sad- we are still PISSED!"

Understanding how chaotic it can be parking and then leaving when the event is over, we decided to hire a car service. We secured a nice Suburban with Watson Limousines of Austin. I briefly mentioned to George what we were celebrating. When he showed up to pick us up he rolled up in the Party Bus with flowers and sparkling cider along with champagne glasses for my daughter, with Imagine Dragons playing and lights going. It was so Awesome. It made my daughter's 13th Birthday something she will never forget. For anyone that has ever been to COTA, it is extremely chaotic getting to the stage and especially leaving. Normally, walking very long distances. George took all of that away for us. He dropped us off and picked us up at places that most services are unable to which put are walking to a minimum. He made our whole experience PERFECT!!! Thank you so much to George and Watson Limousines of Austin."

Most tours in other places just kind of lecture you but she was definitely more of an inviting conversationalist :) with Chris i was actually the only person that signed up for the tour so I got a more personalized view of Austin street art haha. His passion is obvious when he explains the stories behind the art and i learned soo much. I definitely recommend both tours because not only was it super fun but a car is the best way to see all of the random spots throughout Austin. Thanks Rose and Chris!"

After riding through various areas and get the lay of the land I was more comfortable driving around the city which was a big help for us.  I would recommend this tour to anyone traveling to Austin.  Take it early in your stay in Austin if possible.  Wonderful and worthwhile 2 hours."

I was surprised to learn new things about Austin - I thought I knew it all.  Enjoyed seeing the sights and learning the history.  We love Austin but now I realize how cool Austin is. Thanks to Bobby - he has a great sense of humor and made it very entertaining.  Even our picky teenager loved it.  We'll be checking out the other tours to see what's available.  Go, you won't regret it."

My driver clearly had everything under control, so I was able to relax with my friends and start the party as soon as we got on the bus!  Our kids were so jealous when they saw the cool bus their moms' were leaving them in!  Honestly, the bus could have driven us anywhere and we would have had a good time, but Santos' attention to picking great vineyards and James' attnetion to keeping us on schedule made everything perfect!  Our group was different than most -- in that we wanted to take it slow and just relax and were not too concerned about whether we made it to all three destinations.  We also had some nursing moms and wanted to be sure everyone was accomodated.  James was very accomodating and once I conveyed that we were more relaxed he made sure we had all the time we needed.  I also felt like the driving was very safe and overall the attention to safety was as it should be.  The price was reasonable, as well.  All in All, Keep Austin Wet made our vineyard tour perfect!"

Santos was so enthusiastic about hosting our party, which was a welcome relief as that is not always the response you get from tour companies when you tell them you're a bachelorette party--no matter how well-behaved you may be! Our driver, James, was wonderful and so helpful the entire day, especially at the end when we elected to add another hour and an extra stop; he catered his recommendation to our needs (gluten intolerant guests + casual interest in beer and liquor) and we had an amazing experience. You can't beat the pricing, but for what we paid our experience definitely exceeded every expectation. Thank you so much for everything, and we look forward to using you again in the future!"

                "description": "LETS MAKE POUR DECISIONS!   I am in Austin this week for a couple days. We are celebrating christmas as a family here in Austin this year.   My brother and I needed to get some alcohol for my parents before their arrival here tomorrow evening.   This store was very spread out and easy to find exactly what you are looking for. The staff is helpful too and they know where things are in the store too.   I have missed total wine as it is hard to come by when in AL due to liquidity laws. But we do have ABC stores.   I must say that they do card if you appear to be under 30. So myself, my brother and his girlfriend were all carded. But I am taking it as a compliment as yes I do look young.   I think my parent will be happy with what we got for them. :)   If you need an alcohol pick me up or a gift they have amazing gift sets too!   Wonderful experience here!"

                "description": "DO NOT USE ONLINE ORDER DELIVERY.  I recently learned a lesson using Total Wine and More's very ill-partnered delivery service.  Someone brought a wrong order in decent time to my house.  We noticed the erroneous bag together at my doorstep and she proceeded to take the delivery back to the store and my order is subsequently cancelled as I am informed by E-mail.  I wait an entire week and receive a refund 13 dollars less than my original payment.  I have spoken to customer service two weeks ago and they initiated a pass of my complaint to higher authority.  On my end, I have seen the same result as taking no action at all.  I am at a point now where it makes no more sense to spend any more time on getting my 13 dollars back as this as a fraction of what I can make spending that time actually working.  Total Wine online orders get all the thumbs down!"

                "description": "Thanks to Total Wine and More for being my go-to spirits supplier during the 'Rona.  I've only had need to use them for bottles of wine for special occasion during the pandemic. It's easy to shop online from their website to pickup curbside. Service is typically quick, accurate, and convenient. Curbside is free with a $35 order; otherwise a minimal service charge applies.  They were already my inside favorite based on the wonderful in-store atmosphere and experience. Being a solid citizen and not putting my health at risk to purchase adult beverages during the pandemic has won them a fan for life."

Came in here during Coronavirus and had a few odd items I couldn't find. An employee directed me to another employee who turned out to be the manager, and he personally walked me around the store and gave me his own personal opinions on which bottles to get. Amazing. This guy was super knowledgeable and helpful. I already love Total Wine as a brand and this location is now my favorite. I just wish this was the closest Total Wine to me!"

                "description": "If you are like me my drink of choice changes with the seasons, moods I have, and sometimes based on what holiday(s) are coming up. Total Wine is THE best place to come if you are like me - curious, excited to try something new, looking for some advice on what else I can try, etc then you have come to the right spot for your libations.  Ask any employee, I dare you, on what they suggest after telling them what you like. They will point you to some solid suggestions and even walk you over to that area where it is located. Total Wine has some very knowledgeable employees who are willing to walk you through the entire store if you requested that.   The prices are the best in the area for all of it - liquor, beer, wine, mixers, etc.  It's a one stop shop where you just might end up finding a cooler-than-the-one-you-have-at-home cocktail shaker or wine stoppers too.   Also, if you are looking to put together a gift last minute come here.  They have it all - bags, gift sets, tape, cute decor for bars, and whatnot here. It's super easy to roll up, park, and strut in to get a really cool and curated gift if you ask for some help."

He helped us pick out an islay whiskey and a flavored whiskey and I was surprised at how knowledgeable he was on them .   In short nice store and the service was friendly knowledgeable and descriptive. Thanks again to Andrew!!"

I like that they have so many choices for wines and also a huge inventory of distilled spirits... plus quality beers, craft and imports. They've kept up with the mezcal boom, to my joy.  And there's always excellent single-malt Scotch options.  All I'd like to see more of is Greek wines (Kourtaki retsina, please!) and Portuguese madeira.  I still have to go to Spec's for those.     A tip of the hat to excellent and helpful staff. I always look for Belle up front, she is a delight!  I hope she's appreciated, managers!"

My trip included finding a nice bottle of Rosé, bourbon and a few mini single serving bottles to sample. The staff was very nice.  For Texas residents they have a rewards program and a phone app."

My husband and I discovered Total Wine while living in California. Our store there was one that we went to every Saturday with our dog and we knew everyone who worked there. We were sad to be moving back to Austin because we didn't think there was a Total here. After a quick search, we found out there was this one on Brodie. We used to live north, but would make the trek down every weekend to see them. Now that we live south, we are there all the time.  We now have two dogs and they are the store mascots. Their picture is literally on the front door! When we walk in, us and the girls are welcomed with open arms.  Lisa is the best at working the wine tastings. She can tell you anything you want or need to know. Laurie is the sweetest and so helpful! Bob is always giving us the best recommendations. I wish I could name everyone, but will work on updating this review as I remember everyone's names. We feel like family when we are there. Total is the ONLY liquor store in my book. I have brought so many people to Total and they have nothing but nice things to say. They are helpful; if you can't find something they know exactly where it is. If they don't have it, they will see what they can do to get it in store. Their prices can't be beat! They are very knowledgeable; if you ask someone a question they don't know they will work endlessly to find the answer and store it for helping others in the future. I literally can't say enough about Total and their promise to hire amazing employees."

HOLY COW! Not only did this young woman have a deep deep knowledge of every varietal and suggestions on labels in a variety of price ranges- but she help me select a case of assorted wines, but wouldn't let me leave without one of her favorite bottles of Syrah.   When I was checking out at the cashier, she asked \"Gracie helped you, didn't she? She has an encyclopedic knowledge of wines and impeccable taste.\"  Well, I just cracked open that bottle of Syrah and BLAMMO. I'm hooked."

I even attended a sweet Yelp wine and beer tasting event there in Fairfax, VA about two years ago.Total Wine sold me at that event and I was able to get some of my favorite beers. I love the fact I could do a mix and match 6 pack of anything I wanted.   Anyway, I wasn't feeling like Spec's on this particular day and wanted to see how Texas does Total Wine and more. Texas does it right. I was in awe and bewilderment as I toured the store. I ended up with of course more than I needed but no worries there.   I will note I found something there called a pocket shot. A pocket shot is made of plastic and looks like a Capri Sun container. It would of have been great to take to ACL the other weekend. So if you want to sneak or smuggle booze in I recommend buying those pocket shots."

We needed rides for our Fredericksburg winery tour and Lake Travis boat party, and Jerral pulled through with punctual transportation at the best prices I could find!   Jerral was easy to coordinate with and even when there was a small hiccup with our ride back from the lake, he was communicative and very professional. He also went above and beyond with helping one of our group members re-park their car after we had already departed for the lake! The vehicles we rode in were also nice and clean.

It was definitely the highlight of the evening and I'm so glad he recommended it. The driver was on time and courteous, he had no problem stopping for bathroom breaks to and from our destination.

                "description": "Wow I can't believe I've forgotten to review here. I LOVE their beer and location. Always great beers on rotation and the flight tray is cool.  Only reason for the 4 starts is today we came for what had to be the 6th or 7th  time and got kicked to the outside patio for having a dog. This is ALWAYS the brewery I go to when it's hot because they allowed dogs inside. I've had every other bartender let my dog in, love on him and have had zero problem sitting inside with him. Even their Facebook has a picture of a dog inside. Today we were told that was never allowed and should have been told to go outside. We have also seen many other dogs inside during past visits. I hate inconsistent rules. Also, super sad that we'll have to find a new brewery this summer. It's too hot to be outside and my dogs nickname is the the brewery dog.  I'll still support them during cooler months-- but dog owners should know the rules have changed. Very sad. Wish they would have posted something about this change."

We got a selection of beers, I personally really enjoyed the Mango Crazy wheat beer and the Keyboard Gansta IPA. The service was also very friendly and they offered some samples if you are in between choices.   The taco truck outside was also very good! I highly recommend one of their loaded fries. The fries were perfectly crispy and tender in the middle, and super flavorful toppings. The tacos were also yummy and I'm a huge corn lover so the elote bowl was perfect.   I will definitely be back to try more of their seasonal beers!"

                "description": "It's been a hot minute since I visited Whitestone- I think the last time I was here was in 2016, when it was quieter and a lot more laid back.  Fast forward to 2021 - the city of cedar park and Leander are booming.  There is a huge influx of population. The tables at Whitestone are full, there is a food truck (which is awesome) as a permanent fixture BUT the overall customer experience has left me disappointed.  Maybe because it's a Sunday with lovely weather, the guy behind the bar is done with people, or, he isn't a people person , or, he just didn't like the way I looked? But man was it hard to get him to give me an effing beer without getting hateful glances. Yeesh. Im kinda scared of coming back here now!  That aside, im not really a fan of their beer selection either - the kolsch is OK but I've had better. I guess the biggest advantage is the proximity to both CP and Leander and for the people who live around here.  So, this isn't much of a review rather than a semi rant ?   Also guys- kids have a tendency to move around from one side of the table to the other. They're not capable of sitting still and neither are you. If you'd rather than families stay away, just tell us to our faces."

The ladies behind the counter are very nice and loaded with insights about the beers. There's a food truck outside that was delish!! (Tacos and burgers) the al pastor tacos were amazing. We did not try the burgers but from what I've seen/heard it's also very yummy! Whitestone is in a great location in Cedar Park, TX. We are heading to Balcones state park to go hiking but saw this along the way and had to stop in. I'm glad we did!"

                "description": "Stumbled upon this place while walking the area as my car was being worked on across the way. Walking in gave me comforting coffeeshop vibes, with mostly tables of small parties 2-3 drinking beer and socializing.  Having no idea what to order, staff made some recommendations for a flight that were all fantastic. My favorites were the Cuerno Rojo (lightly carbonated and very smooth) and the Continental Breakfast (heavier stout but tastes just like French Toast and Maple syrup). I had to do a double take that I wasn't just drinking syrup but the flavors were spot on!  I'll be back again with friends/family and hopefully get to enjoy the great coffee I was smelling as well!"

                "description": "Not sure where to fault this place, honestly. First time here and the three beers we tried were excellent: a nitro double IPA, an black ale, and a Czech pilz. The interior ambiance was dark, cozy, and perfect for an intimate convo, remote work, or even games with friends. I have two small children so helped myself to the outdoor covered and heated patio. The kids enjoyed the chips and salsa while we sipped our stellar brews. Excited to try the Leander location that is actually closer to us. 10/10 plan to come back, especially to try the coffee."

                "description": "Just wanted to update this one. Red Horn just gets better and better with age and has really turned into a community institution - especially during the pandemic when they switched to \"to go\" beers that we could all take out to the parking lot and drink while socially distanced. Fortunately those days are past us but I think I will always have a soft spot in my heart for this place that was a little bit of sanity amidst all the insanity.   As for the fare itself? The beers rotate and you can't  go wrong because they will always let you sample (I'm a strawberry pop-tart ravioli fan - and yes that's a beer). Pair that beer (or wine) with a meat and cheese tray or maybe a panini and you have absolutely nothing to complain about. They even have food trucks on most days...  Thanks for being here Red Horn."

                "description": "very cool atmosphere with both a brewery and coffee shop vibe mashed together without clashing. I got the Gordon Ramsey coffee and it was obviously made by someone who knows how to craft a latte. I do wish the flavor complimented the espresso more or punched above the espresso. It was too balanced, if that's even a thing. I will definitely return next time i'm in town to see what pieces of coffee art they come up with next!"

Outdoors seating is great but the generator of the food truck next door was unbearably too loud to enjoy outside, we did not even bother trying. I did not care about the live music either, we were yelling at each other to get our word across the table. We ended up leaving 30 mins after the live music started. That was a Friday night."

                "description": "We chose Red Horn Coffee after perusing local coffee spots for some good coffee. Red Horn was very highly rated and the photos looked like they offered genuine espresso beverages. Red Horn offered a number of non-dairy options so I would not destroy my stomach on my pending road trip. We ordered Americans with a half inch of steamed oat milk. The coffee was very smooth. The espresso taste was still solid enough that I knew I was drinking espresso. I.e. Not watered down at all. All-in-all a great cup of coffee that hit the spot."

                "description": "I'll be back soon!! One of the best coffees I've had, so good I had two during my short stay here. It's hard to find decaf that isn't boring and the decaf here is strong and full of flavor! I even purchased a pound of decaf beans to take home.   I pulled up and my first thought was that the vibe was more brewery than coffee shop and I was right, but I was wrong that the coffee would just be an afterthought. When I went on a Saturday early afternoon, there was a taco truck and people hanging out in the beer garden. Lots of bicyclists and not sure if it's a popular rest stop or because there's a bike shop in the same parking lot or both or something else. Once you step inside there is a giant section of beer taps and beer menu, and a small coffee and pastry menu. They also sell ice cream here which was tempting but I stuck to my americano and later a vanilla latte.   The inside has plenty of socially distanced seating as does the outside and I lucked out with a parking spot right out front. There's a large lot of shared parking for the businesses.   I want to come back to check out their beers!!"

You can get coffee, lattes, and cappuccino served anytime or also buy their beans to go.   They usually have 30+ taps of delicious craft beer which 10-15 being their beers with other guest beers also. They normally have cans to go and they will do growler fills as well. Its unusual to find a place that has both really good beer and great coffee but Red Horn is just that. There are a few slightly more secluded tables where I'll see people working remotely quite often. Most weekends you can find a local artist performing live music too."

Parking is sometimes limited but it speaks for its self on how many people love coming here. It's a great place to study, relax, and meet up with friends but get there before rush hour if you wanna snag a good seat inside. Clean environment and staff is very friendly! Also, great music"

Weeks later, I walked in with our service tiny chihuahua dog (since there's a sign that says \"we welcome service dogs\" so I went in and ordered coffee and as soon as I began to wait for my coffee to be ready so I could take it to go there is this man that was very abrasive behind the counter and I miss felt like I was in the principals office and he said that dogs are not allowed in the facility.  He was very abrasive embarrassing and in my face. I personally think if you don't allow dogs at all then take the service sign dog off the window. It's a shame because that's very close place for us to get coffee but I don't want to have that feeling again."

Great/fun selection, good prices, knowledgeable staff, and lots of picnic tables out to keep you spread out and safe. You can get snacks too, or play Starship Troopers pinball (Do You Want To Know More?!?). We had  a good time just chilling there on a Sunday afternoon.

Anytime you stop by, you'll meet either the owner or his wife and they are both nice and very helpful. You can pretty much buy anything they have in singles and they always have their inventory listed online along with the untapped rating for each beer, which I find very useful. They have a solid selection of local stuff and occasionally some more rare stuff as well. If you're immunocompromised, you can call your order in and they'll bring it to your car; they also have a very sanitary setup inside and require masks (of course) and make everyone use the hand sanitizer when you come in. We've been there about 5 times mixing that in with buying direct from breweries but I really love the diversity you can get while supporting local at the Brewtique"

The bottle shop that lived here prior (RIP) was great, but the new layout and even better beer selection really sets this place apart! Such a plethora of great beers and a cool little shop you can crack one open and enjoy it right there! Looking forward to my next visit!"

Owner(s?) seem to care a bunch, and have been available to point out new releases/limited beers, make recommendations, and take pics of my dog.   Prices slightly higher than other big retailers, but selection is much better (tip: check their Instagram for limited beers and new stock). Also, a good selection of CBD products for those interested. I have never hung around to drink there, but you can for a small per-beer charge if you want.   Hope this place keeps getting tasty limited beverages and doesn't turn into a vape emporium like the last one!"

                "description": "This is such a cool place! I planned an outing in Cedar Park with a group of my girlfriends. After our outing at the Ecuadorian chocolate factory, we needed a place that could accommodate a fairly large group of friends during lunch time on a Friday (a task that seemed.... yikes). I am very thankful I stumbled across The Good Lot on Yelp! I reached out to make sure The Good Lot could accommodate us, and they said \"Of Course\" and let me know that all of the trucks would be out on Friday.    When we arrived, we were pleasantly surprised to find several open food trucks and a large building (see, beer bar). People had their dogs outside and everyone seemed to be having a good time.   Between all of us, we tried every food truck. I personally got Four Brothers Venezuelan Kitchen. I am a sucker for good Venezuelan food. I got a Pulled pork Bowl with extra garlic sauce, black beans, avocado, sweet plantains, and all the fixings. I would definitely eat here again. I tried a few samples from other food trucks as well.   Everyone left super happy. This is a great place to go if you have a casual group looking for a quick bite and place to hang out.    The next day (Saturday), I swung by the dog park across the street and stopped by again for lunch on my way home. They have trivia nights, live music over the weekends, and happy hour all day on Monday. Please build another location close to Fort Hood. A copy and paste of exactly what you already created would be great. ;). I promise to stop by weekly."

So, it was midweek around 8pm and while the patio had plenty of folks and there was music going the food trucks were done and they weren't too courteous about letting it be known they were closed or out of food or closing up.   So, the taps were open which allowed me to try out a beer. The staff pouring were definitely friendly, letting me know some of their personal favorites on tap as well as letting me try some out. I did also appreciate that they had some NA options as well and I liked the kombucha they had on tap so much I had two more of those instead of the more adult beverage options they had.  If there was a way to have some of the bar staff cross train with the food truck staff it would make a huge improvement."

                "description": "The Good Lot is a wonderful addition to the CP area. Bring your kiddos and your hounds sit outside under the shade or on their covered patio.    Cocktails anyone? I was surprised at their expansive craft beer options. Check out their rotating taps at: https://thegoodlotcp.com/beergarden/drinks/  There are wine, seltzer, and non-acholohol options as well.  When we visited there were 3 food truck options; Yard Bird, Oink, and our favorite The Rice is Right.    Be aware on weekends and when there is live music parking will be a challenge. This has been a point of contention with the neighbors and according to the Good Lot, they are looking to expand the parking area.    Pro tip: Don't park in the adjoining neighborhood park 5 minutes away at the Veterans Memorial Park. Stretch your legs on the way there and work off that beer on the way back."

                "description": "As far as I can tell, The Good Lot only has 5 star reviews and for good reason.  It is a great beer garden with plenty of non-beer options as well.  I have always passed by the place and noticed how busy it is most weeknights and especially weekends, but I am certainly pleased with what it brings to the community.  Generally it gets pretty busy after 6PM until close, and parking can be difficult to find.  Carpooling or taking a rideshare would be the best way to do it in my opinion as I would hate to park in front of someone else's house in the nice neighborhoods nearby.  Certainly a parking lot expansion is something the owners are considering as that is my only issue with the place especially when it gets busy.  That being said, it is always a great atmosphere with a variety of food and drink options.  There are also always lots of dogs in the grassy area by the patio and it is nice to see how family-friendly the place is.  I will certainly be back and bring some friends in the future!"

                "description": "My daughter and I visited The Good Lot yesterday (8/8/21).  It's the new and hot food truck and bar spot in Cedar Park TX (2500 W New Hope). The Good Lot has a main building with a large dining area enclosed by glass garage doors that open and a bar that has numerous beers, ales, ciders, and craft sodas.  It's nestled among the oak trees. There is a nice amount of paved parking and gravel lot parking.   The Good Lot also has dining areas under the oaks along with a game area (corn hole) and a playground for the kids with a large wooden teepee for climbing.  They are dog friendly.   The Good Lot had 4 food trucks.  We chose The Rice Is Right that serves Korean inspired rice boxes and other items.  We ordered the crispy chicken box and the cauliflower box.  Both items were perfectly fried and coated in a sweet and spicy Korean sauce.  Flavor was amazing.  The boxes came with steamed white rice and a purple cabbage slaw.  The portions were large and more than enough food for us. There were other food trucks that served Mediterranean, Pork, and Chicken.  The menus look good and I will explore those in the future.  The Good Lot and The Rice Is Right are on 'My Keepers List'."

Most importantly the environment and the friendliness of the staff was exceptional.   During our visit we met the owners and their family and it was truly an enjoyable experience.

The beer selection was great, lots of locals including Whitestone, Hedgehog, Red Horn, Family Brewing and (of course) some lovely PHP Jellyfish on tap.  We decided to tried Yaadbird, since we hadn't had any fried chicken in a while. The lemon pepper chicken was on point, crispy, juicy, peppery, a 'lil salty, and everything you need in your fried chicken!  The property is beautiful and well landscaped. The lawn was amazing! It was so fluffy! When we first arrived we just admired the live oak trees and the quality of the grass.. Lawn lovers, you will understand...  The bartenders were very nice and very excited to introduce so many new people to the Good Lot. The owner was all over the bar, pouring drinks, helping staff, and checking with guests, seeming to have time for everyone.  We are looking forward to coming back here and trying the 3 other food trucks, along with the rotating beer menu. Hope they are planning to host more events, as we would love to do an anniversary party here at some point!"

I've been to about 20 pubs and bars in CP and this one stands head and shoulders above the rest. It's an open air (no AC but there is heat in the winter) with big garage doors that were open and a huge ceiling fan so it was comfortable. There were about 20 taps and 3 of them were not filled yet. I chatted with the owner and she said she was looking for ideas so my friend Greg gave her some. :)  There is plenty of indoor seating. Plus, there is a huge grassy area with picnic tables and even a fire pit. It's family-friendly so no smoking.  There is a playground for the kids and spots for four food trucks although only two were filled.   Beer was about $6 on average so not cheap but not expensive either. $1 off all day on Mondays.   It was an enjoyable experience and a really great ambience. I'll definitely be back!"

This place is non-smoking, dog-friendly (leashed) and kid-friendly, with a unique play area, six sets of cornhole, and plenty of shaded grassy area to run around in. Tables are wide and comfortable, and the entire patio was open-air, so social distancing is a breeze. We ate at the Oinkmobile truck (delicious) and grabbed local beers and ciders at the patio desk. We walked the fifteen minutes from our house, but it looks like they have a decent-sized parking lot and are working on creating more space. The only downside is that there's no ramp down to the grass/play area, but hopefully they'll make it more accessible in the future. Staff was super friendly, and I can't wait to come back for open mic night. Because yes, we'll be back!!"

Huge outdoor space with picnic tables plastic chairs or plenty of room to bring your own (even saw someone bring their own folding table). Live music was at just the right volume playing just the right kind of classic rock that doesn't offend and always pleases. Beer selection was generous and reasonably priced (not to mention $5 glasses of wine). Had a 50/50 burger at Oink and was BLOWN away. It's half bacon and half beef and all good. Loved it. The bacon Mac and cheese was also delicious but the portion was a little small for $9 (my only complaint of the night). Do yourself a favor and if you're up in the 613 check this place out!!!"

Once we got a drink, we were lucky enough to snag a table under the fans and the breeze was so nice. They had live music while we were there, which I believe will continue on weekends so that's fun. The lawn looked so nice, chairs to sit in, trees for shade, lawn games for entertainment! There were 4 or 5 food truck options while we were there and while we didn't get any food, all the food we saw coming out looked so good! Definitely recommend stopping by and checking it out!"

                "description": "Great beer selection! They really should get penny bags hung out because there are SO many flies. They would get 5 stars if there weren't so many flies.  For the owners- they may have different names other places- it's a ziploc bag with water and you put coins in and hang them. If you Google penny bag it will tell you they avoid them because it's bright (thanks Matt for googling!) but I like to think it looks like a spider web to fly eyeballs so they are trying to stay away from a web. Flies probably aren't that smart.. it's probably the light part."

                "description": "What a fun local spot here in the CP! Been wanting to come check out for awhile now and finally drive out last night and closed the place down!!! (sorry guys, we were the last ones to leave)  Parking is nuts so plan ahead and maybe carpool... We drive a jeep so we had no issues ... live music and plenty of smiling faces.. service was great, bathrooms were clean... dogs welcome! Plenty of good beers, wines and ciders... gals were so nice behind the bar.. offered samples and were super sweet... good folks, good music and good grub.... my son joined us and grabbed some food from the food trucks... cauliflower wings, shrimp fried rice and macaroni and cheese... so so good.... bring your chairs/ blanket to sit on because tables and chairs are hard to snag... the lines are long for drinks but they go fast.... We will be back for sure! We feel right at home here. If you like fresh air and freedom... come here.. if you are afraid of fresh air and human contact, probably should go to Austin and be amongst others who feel that way... Merica!"

I enjoyed the openness of this place -- there was a lot of seating that was not in the immediate proximity of others which was great. My only issue is the pricing -- I cannot pay over $5 for a Kung Fu Robot IPA when I can get it for $3 near my apartment. $8.25 for an Electric Jellyfish? I can't but I understand."

It gets crowded on Friday and Saturday nights when there's live music and it can be hard to find parking, so recommend showing up in the late afternoon if you want a good spot."

Family friendly spot (a kids play area with kitchen and all!!),good music playlist and eventually some live music. They just have snacks right now but eventually said they'll have a menu. Oh yah and coffee too. We got to meet Derek and his wife, the owners. This is such a great spot to go and work or to relax at after work! Will definitely be back and can't wait to watch this business grow.  We were having so much fun I forgot to take pictures! I'll update with pictures next time I go."

                "description": "Okay this is my favorite coffee shop in the Austin area period.  I love how big and spacious this new location is, but the coffee is WHERE IT'S AT.  Definitely come here if you're looking for the perfect date spot, study/get work done, or just to enjoy a nice morning coffee and breakfast.  We ordered a hand pour over, a Chemex, and a double espresso.  The double espresso came out first and this one definitely packed a punch - don't let the espresso size cup fool you.  If I was just here for the caffeine content, this one definitely would've done the job alone.   The hand pour over came out next and the presentation was super impressive!  They bring you the entire carafe with the dripper on top, so it's definitely a lot.  Considering this is only $4, you definitely get your money's worth!  This one was so flavorful and the fruity notes definitely stood out while drinking it.  Now the Chemex...just wow.  For $5, they bring the entire Chemex setup to your table and you pour our of it as you drink.  The fact that they trust their patrons with the Chemex really speaks volumes about how much they care about the presentation piece!  Looks aside, this coffee (I believe we got Ethiopian) tasted amazing and on-par with the pour over.  Don't let me forget the breakfast tacos.  This was such a treat.  I got the Migas breakfast taco and this one was stuffed FULL with eggs, tortilla strips, and pico.  It was delicious and filling and for $3, this one definitely hit the spot alongside the coffee.  I also bought one of their coffee beer stouts to take home...I believe it was the House United coffee milk stout.  If taking home, you either order beer in a Crowler (two pint cans) or a Growler (64 oz).  I can't wait to try their coffee IN THEIR BEER.  But most of all, can't wait to come back here every time I'm in the area!"

                "description": "Well-crafted beers and delicious pizza - what more could you ask for? Humble Pint is one of our favorite spots and a friendly reminder that Leander has a lot more going for itself than just a sleepy suburb.  Beer: As a former Austin proper resident and frequent brewery visitor, HP's beers are on par with the best of the best. Their daily selection is small but mighty. They typically offer one of everyone's favorite core beers: a blonde, a hefe, an IPA, etc. Also some sours or seasonals thrown into the mix. I appreciate that they focus on small batches that are incredibly delicious and complex.  Pizza: Bubbly, chewy crust that's on the thinner side. It's not wet or greasy. Holds its integrity to toppings with great flavor. Speaking of toppings, their mainstay pies are a beautiful blend of ingredients. Personal faves are the Mt. Rainier - sauce, mozz, pepperoni, mushrooms, hot oil, Kalamata olives, and fresh arugula - and the Willamette - sauce, mozz, pepperoni, and fresh oregano. The fresh oregano is a really lovely touch that even my picky 3-year-old appreciates.  Finally, because I'd be remiss to mention the kids, this place is definitely family friendly. But if you don't have kids then don't let that scare you away. It's actually pretty quiet and chill, perfect for a date or even to get some work done during the afternoon. They have large open windows that look out on a beautiful cemetery (it's cool not creepy) as well as an outdoor patio.  10/10."

                "description": "My friend brought me back here because he felt like he owed me for my previous truncated visit. My last time I slammed the beers I had and didn't get anything to eat.   My latest visit I had some time to sit, sip and savor. Who would have thought that having time to enjoy a beer would make it more enjoyable. I had the same amount of beers this visit that I did the last but I did get to go through it, get some thoughts.  I was feeling a little peckish so we got the shishitos, or rather I did. I ordered them thinking my friend would also dig in, but I found out he's not into just eating peppers even though I told him it was mild. While I did feel a little guilty about eating them by myself I felt less guilty as I ate through the well blistered, sweet/hot peppers which were all a good size. They must have picked out the runts, which is something other establishments don't. It made for the peppers to be more uniform and also all the peppers were blistered at the same rate."

It's kind of like neopolitian style pizza, but not as floppy. Chewy crust, great toppings. Look, I'm not a word smith, but it's really delicious, trust me. Easily top 5 best pizza in central Texas. The beer is f*****g fantastic. Seriously, every beer I've had here has been stellar. Their current stout is baller; I grabbed a couple of them to go, but wish I grabbed more. It's called like Into the Void or something. Whatever, it's awesome. Also all their other beers are solid.   P.S. If the owner is reading this, you should add some anchovies to the menu imo."

The pizzas are good but all only personal size and quite expensive. All in all this was a fun experience but not for regular visits at $15 a pizza for 12in size. The mix and match of original ingredients was delicious to try. I had the Mt Rainer and it was not terrible but had a slight minty flavor that wasn't my favorite."

Yes it's a brewery, but kids are welcome too. There are food and drink options for both the over and under 21 crowd.   -Dogs are welcome on the patio!  -They have a game bookcase where you can take one to your table and play while enjoying a tasty beer or a Mexican Coke.   -The master brewer knows what he is doing.  My husband home brews and knows some things.  He was chatting with the brewer/owner and they were both geeking out all about the different beers.   -There's always several different beers and beer styles on tap to try out. They even do flights if you can't decide on just one.   -The Humble Pies aka PIZZA are super tasty. We have tried almost all of them and they have all been hits. My favorite is the Columbia Gorge one with goat cheese and sausage. They are available after 4pm every day.   -They make great paninis and salads too. They are available starting at 12pm.   I don't do salads, but I can tell you the Italian Panini was DELICIOUS. My only complaint was it was too small because I wanted more of it because it was so yummy.   -The staff is so friendly and welcoming. It has a neighborhood bar vibe and is so laid back. It's a great addition to the area for sure.   The moral of the story is this place is a hit! Come check it out when you get a chance."

And quick.  So it was like an easy quick in and quick out for a school night.   it was counter service and affordable.  I feel like with 3 of us --we can't leave a restaurant for less than $120 after tip.  We left here for 1/2 of that with 2 drinks on the tab.    We'll be back!"

                "description": "Humble Pint is a great addition to the brew scene up here in the northern colonies. HP is located in the same strip mall area as Leanderthal distillery and Farm to Fork restaurant. This is the trifecta for me great booze, food, and brew.    The folks at HP are super friendly and beer knowledgeable. HP definitely has a Pacific NW vibe just check out the names of their pizza pies.     HP has a wonderful array of craft beers (there are ciders and non-boozy options as well) ranging from a light blonde to a  Belgium Tripel.  Basically, there is something for all.   Plus one ordered the Yard's Done Blonde ale and it was lite but flavorable. My Cascadian Dark Ale, was a deep brown ale that was not heavy and reminded me of a Brit porter. Cascadian hops keep the Pacific NW theme rolling!   We arrived too early for pizza (starts at 4PM) but we both ordered the Italian panini and it arrived warm and smothered with provolone cheese.  There was a healthy amount of chips accompanying our panini and neither of us was able to finish off the chips. We can't wait to return and try their pies.   When the weather is nice there is a patio that is covered and the inside dining is spacious and they are following all the restrictions.    If you are in the area do plan to stop by for a brew or two and a panini or better yet a pizza pie!"

The pizza kitchen opens at 4:00p and seems a little overwhemled right now as it's taking a hot minute to get 1 pizza, but it's all good because we have beer . The pizza was really good. The crust is chewy delicious. Can't wait to try a different one next time.  We're happy to have a new business like this here in Leander and think they'll continue to do well. We'll definitely be back to SUPPORT LOCAL!   Tip to biz: Please add those large rotating fans on your deck. It's TX, it's damn hot in heerr!"

The tables had plenty of space between each other to feel safe taking down the mask to eat and drink.   The drinks were great and it wasn't all just IPAs full of hops like other craft breweries. The pizza is easy to eat and not too thick to make you full, leaving plenty of room for beers.   Going to make this a regular place to wind down from the week. Great staff l, very friendly, and they make sure your satisfied."

The owners wife was behind the bar and he was doing other things. Anyhow, she made my friend and I feel extremely welcomed. She talked to us about the beer and just chatted with us. There was only about 4 other people/customers there. She told us that their kitchen didn't open till 4pm but that we were more then welcome to buy food and bring it in (which we did). We sat inside, ate, and had some beers. She (I think her name was Alisha aka the owners wife. Sorry If that's not your name) came the table and asked how everything was and if we needed anything. We had a great experience!   Now today, On our second visit (same friend), we had a horrible experience. After our first visit we knew about them not serving food till 4pm, so we ordered food again from Next door. However, this time the girl behind the bar (not the owners wife) told us \"outside food has to be eaten outside\". Knowing that it was super windy out, she made us eat outside. We were fighting the wind from blowing everything off the table. After we finished eating, we moved back inside to get away from the wind and the experience got worse. The bartender was just cold/kinda rude, none of the staff asked us how things were, the staff themselves weren't even talking to each other, and the overall vibe of the place was just cold. We were the ONLY ones there this time and we still got the cold shoulder.   I hope this place gets better because the place is cute and had potential."

Smiled and greeted when I walked in and guided me through the beer menu and the pizza menu. The pizza was fantastic. We got the Mt. Rainer.

                "description": "Drove by here today and thought I would check it out and I liked it! I ordered a Peacemaker Beer, an ale that tasted good. The next time I want to try the Blackberry beer. The name itself is appealing. Since it was close to dinner I figured I should order food instead of going home and cooking. I got the fish and chips. You can order the 2 piece or 4. I got the 2 piece with cut fries. It was cooked good. The fish was flaky and not oily. The pubs tarter sauce was good.. the fries were very good too..   The service was very good. There was a sign to sit yourself which I did and within 1 or 2 minutes my server stopped by to get me started. She showed me the ropes and got my beer and food quickly. I was really surprised at how fast my food came out. I can say it was just under 10 minutes but I was still surprised at the promptness. There was quite a few customers but the servers were on top of it. They talked to the customers as if they were family.   The place was clean and there was good parking. The beer menu had several types of craft and IPA beers. I'm  pretty sure I will return when I have time. My total cost including the food and beer was only $14, amazing! Thank you Dig Pub for being in Cedar Park and giving up another place to get a beer and some grub in a friendly way!"

My friend went through his mental list of places and came up with The Dig.   We arrived there and fortunately got there in time, it was a slow night and the kitchen was about to close so we quickly made our choices. I saw that they had Scotch Eggs and I'm a sucker for Scotch eggs, but unless you're a vegetarian/vegan what's not to like about an egg wrapped in sausage that's then deep fried?  I also ended up getting their Buffalo Chicken Sandwich because...actually why do you need a reason?  The egg was good, a little thin on the sausage side but the mustard dip added a little more savory. The sandwich had a good amount of spice but the sauce was pretty runny so it was messy but otherwise good.  They do have a lot of taps and I appreciate that they try to have a little bit of everything and focus on locals. I get that they have to strike a balance between locals who want a beer that's cold, yellow, fizzy and domestic and crazy whale chasing beer nerds that are into barrel aged, wild/lacto, hopheads but for my visit it was a little more on the tame side. I had a sour from Prairie and a local mead which was great and at the time, that was about it."

                "description": "This place is interesting. The right side of the restaurant looks pretty nice and lively and the left side of the restaurant looks like they gave up or ran out of money on decorating and just put a few tables out. They also have an outdoor area but no shade so I didn't want to sit out there unprotected, otherwise, it would have been nice because I had my dog. It was a bit busy so unfortunately had to sit on the left side (maybe everyone else there agrees the right side is better and that's why they all preferred to sit there). It didn't look or feel particularly clean and I'm a clean freak so I didn't particularly enjoy sitting there.   The service was fine; the waitress was nice. The food was pretty decent, but nothing outstanding or memorable where I feel I have to come back again. It was fresh though and I appreciate that for comfort food, it wasn't soaked in oil. I think the ambiance had already turned me off so I didn't enjoy my food as much as I would have it was clean.   They are known for their beer but I don't drink beer so take my review with a grain of salt. Clearly I'm not a dive bar kind of girl (unless it's out for drinks and bar hopping) but plenty of people are fine/really like those types of places so if you do, you'll enjoy this place. I'm not knocking this place and I would come back if friends wanted to go but I like more of an ambiance when I go out to eat."

I am sure it's not easy to find good help these days, and perhaps it's a particular challenge to find young people who display a modicum of tact and dignity these days.  Nevertheless, in that case the owner shouldn't depart and leave the bar to let it be run by insolent brats.  My friend agreed with me as we left that we would never set foot him The Dig Pub again."

The adults got the Thor's Hammer and BLTA with fries and the table shared scotch eggs and pickle chips for apps. Sandwiches were straightforward and tasty and the fries were thick but crispy outside and soft inside.   Scotch eggs were better than Renaissance festival... but could have more sausage.  Pickle chips were average bar food. Overall, good meal and fair prices!"

                "description": "Been checking this place out online for months now and finally got an opportunity to go in person today. Wow. What a superior waste of time! It makes sense now why it was so empty when we went in.  You would think that as we're just coming out of a pandemic, pub and bar owners would be over the top happy to have people show up to eat and drink their food.  Well, not this owner! I'm still in shock how rude he was to me and in so little time of me being there! His bar waitress was super sweet and answering questions as it was our first time there. The plan was to order some grub, and craft beer and go sit outside on the picnic tables on this beautiful Sunday.  I was into my second question about one of the brunch items, when he rudely interjected himself into our conversation by trying to answer my question for the waitress where he clearly had not actually heard my question at all. I then corrected him by repeating what I actually asked. He then tried to defend his ignorance by stating something else about the food they serve that was a complete contradiction to half of the menu items. You should of heard the way this guy talked to me, there was absolutely no reason for it, completely unwarranted.  Plus he made himself look like a total idiot in front of everyone and it was so obvious. The more obvious thing was that he didn't want our business. When I say our, it was my husband, 2 yr. old and me. Maybe he felt threatened by our kid? He wasn't misbehaving or doing anything crazy. The nice waitress was chatting with him and everything was totally fine. And then out of no where the owner was just a total dick to me!! So of course we left, I mean who would stay!? But that's exactly what he wanted, for us to leave. With pleasure, Asshole!  I felt bad for the nice waitress, she seemed to be in shock also. Sure hope she finds somewhere else to work since I can bet she gets treated like garbage.  Funny thing is that I can't even comment on the food or beer which is all I was yes to try. This guy should do the world a favor, sell the place to someone who actually wants business and go take a class in The Important of People skills in the food and bev business. Mean people suck and they need to learn how to be nice or just grow the F up."

                "description": "First of all, not family friendly. Took my daughter here for a dinner with our dog ... sat outside, and ordered a couple of burgers, and after a long day I wanted a couple of cold, craft beers. Perhaps I shouldn't have expected a family friendly atmosphere, but I honestly didn't think I had to think it through too much. So, a group of men in their 30s-40s began arguing about a patron sneezing , dropping \"f bombs\". The patron went in to get the owner. I thought \"ok cool, the owner will take care of this.\" Instead, of calming the situation, he comes out dropping \"f bombs\" of his own, bragging about how he's going to kick all their asses, and how big of a Texan he is. I asked if he could watch his language in front of my family, he ignored me. So, I took it as a way to teach my daughter that this is the definition of a bunch of men that are nothing but losers. I told her, this is not the way men that have any class should act in public. There were also plenty of other women around that didn't need to hear all of this male drama while they are trying to have an enjoyable evening with their families. The guy that actually started the whole thing apologized. Owner, Eric, you should be ashamed of yourself. Dude, have some awareness ... no one cares about how cool and tough you think you are while they are trying to have dinner and spend some time with their friends and family. The people next to me just got up and left, too. You were so caught up in your own ego, you didn't even notice. I spent $42 and still left your staff a 20% tip, mostly cuz I felt sorry they have to work for such a loser. Not sure what Texas you claim to have grown up in, but not the one my family has lived in for 6+ generations. We all make mistakes .. and I rarely leave reviews or waste any of my precious time on this kinda thing .. but this needed to be said."

And I was a little \"hangey\" having to wait a half hour to be seated. But it was worth it. The waiter checked back with us every few minutes (mandatory for a good restaurant). And our order was delivered hot and fresh in a reasonable amount of time (a little slow because they were very busy - but in a reasonable amount of time).  We had chips and queso as an appetizer. The chips were the thick, homemade type. And the queso was their own recipe with ancho cili drizzle, crema, some sort of pico de gallo, etc. Really good - exceptional.  I had a chicken sandwich. It had a lot going on (in a good way). It was not just a run of the mill chicken sandwich. And the sidewinder fries are fresh and homemade.   My wife had the watermelon, which she also said was really good.  Overall, some creative foods that were well executed, and on point service  Definitely give this place a try."

                "description": "I didn't love this place. I totally understand that with COVID, many restaurants have had to cut back their menus.   With that being said, it seemed like breakfast-y food definitely prevailed during our Sunday afternoon visit. Seeing that they do a Sunday brunch, I get it, but always pictured that included a few other options not focused around eggs or waffles.   My husband ended up ordering their burger (which isn't even obviously advertised as a burger), and said it wasn't anything to write home about. My mother-in-law had their chicken sandwich and seemed to be okay with it. Not much fanfare from my husband's stepfather or his girls.  I ended up ordering the chili and didn't have any major complaints. I would've loved to see more in the \"siesta\" part of the menu that wasn't a salad.   My other complaint was the noise. The music was so loud that we could barely hear each other across the table, which pretty much awkwardly split our party in half. At first, we tried to get past it by borderline yelling, but that got old.   In between waiting for condiments, I asked our waitress if there was any way to knock the volume down by a click or two. She mentioned that she would see what she could do, but that it wasn't guaranteed since \"people pay for it\". My brother in law ended up seeing the jukebox in the corner, and while that's fantastic, I don't think it's too much to ask to keep music at a reasonable level in a place where you'd expect your guests to socialize at their table."

Out of some Cabernets. They were out of everything we went to order. The server could not have been more kind and sweet. She said it was because they run out of a lot of things on Saturday nights so Sundays they're just out. Well, I did a quick review of the comments on this restaurant and this is apparently a running theme. 1. Shame on me for not checking the comments before we came, 2. Shame on them for not resolving this clearly on-going issue. I know times are tough, but just close on Sunday nights if you cannot have more product delivered. We finished our drinks and left without ordering dinner at all."

I asked for a menu and a beer. The bar tender let me sample one of the beers on tap. I liked it so I ordered one to drink. I also ordered a patty melt with tater tots. The burger was think and made to order. I had to cut the burger because I did not want a big mess from trying to get a bite into my mouth. The burger was juicy since I ordered it medium and very tasty. I can say it filled me up. The beer was cold, nothing better than a cold beer, well almost nothing.  The atmosphere was as most sports bars are, a little noisy but people seems to know each other and they were friendly. The bartenders were busy but kept getting those drinks. The servers were also busy taking food and refilling cups of the patrons. There is outdoor seating but it was one of those HOT Days so I was glad I was inside. The parking is decent but they share with several other businesses. It was not too far away from the entrance so no need to wear the sneakers unless you want to.  Thank you Republic Kitchen + Bar for being a good neighbor and giving us another option to dine in Leander, Texas."

The only complaint I have about it is that they put the bread on the grill to get grill marks, but all I tasted was burnt toast. They do the top if the burger bun the same but it's not as grill marked. So next time I will ask for them not to do that, I hate black charred burnt toast. My husbands burger was good as well and both the tots and fries were tasty and perfect portion. They have a big bar with a good variety. I had a Hell or High Water to drink, and will definitely order that again. Delish! And last but def not least the service was great! Our server Kelsey was attentive and very sweet. Definitely looking forward to the next visit...word is they have a good weekend brunch, so we'll be checking that out."

Overall good place to try, the service was good. They have tvs on but I'd recommend that they put subtitles on all of them so since we can't hear them we can at least read and know what is going on."

And steak? And Salmon? Yikes! We had chicken fried steak and the chicken sandwich. Both very good! Pictured is a yummy dessert! A brownie on top of graham cracker crumbs topped with a toasted marshmallow. Along side comes vanilla ice cream drizzled with caramel and dark chocolate with a drizzle of raspberry coulis and fresh raspberries.  We will try you again."

This was a quick first review and I want to come back for a meal. The Drinks are interesting and a good mix.  Pro tip - parking can get challenging in the evening. This strip mall has a lot of customers, early helps or enjoy the walk :-)"

I will say the staff needs a little bit more guidance because they always look lost or confused about their duties. Beside that it's a great small bar with food options for everyone!"

Tasted said salad and immediately my mouth was on fire. Asked waitress to verify if it was ranch and she says... \"oh we don't have regular ranch, just a spicy one...\" that would've been nice to know. I CANT EAT SPICY FOOD!! She proceeded to suggest I use another dressing to bring down the heat. Word of advice to owner... put the dressing on the side. I was sick all day from this incident.   Partner got French toast and it was amazing. Sadly we won't be back.."

                "description": "This was one of the worst experiences we've had in a restaurant in a long time.  The server was rude, the manager condescending (strangely, I don't remember him being so rude at Texican) and the place was dirty.  The table was sticky, and they knew it, even said there was nothing they could do about it because it was \"resin\"...it wasn't.  We ordered four entrees, and they came out in stages. The first ones to hit the table were cold.  The third followed five minutes later, and mine didn't show up for another five minutes, at which time I told them to just keep it.  The \"hash\" was runny and not at all hash, the scrambled eggs cold, bacon underdone, and no condiments available; when we asked for them, they acted like it was an imposition.    $92 worth of bad food and crap service.  Very disappointing considering the executive chef was wearing a Fox Hole chef's coat, and Fox Hole is one of my favorite places in this area; I assumed from the get it would be extraordinary after seeing that...I guess not.  Oh, and word of caution, when the server handed my fiancé the mobile payment device, she selected the 20% tip option.  Make sure you watch out for that...there is no signage indicating there is an automatic gratuity so the servers have NO business choosing their own tip amount.  Update: while we were out of town, we discovered my fiancé's debit card had been hacked.  Oddly, the odd charges started AFTER using the mobile payment device, which was WiFi powered.  I cannot stress this enough...BEWARE!"

                "description": "I finally tried this place and so glad I did! Went with some girlfriends for some much needed quality girl time. This was the perfect place to sit back, chill and enjoy great food and company. I really like the ambience of this restaurant. It boasts a laid back feel with the dim lighting, yet has an open atmosphere. I ordered the Grilled Atlantic Salmon and everything was cooked to perfection. The salmon was cooked on the medium side to my liking and request to the server. We also ordered the James Bowie Nachos. Keep in mind these are not the typical Tex-Mex nachos, but they were still delicious and flavorful with a hint of robust BBQ flavor. There is an option to add chicken or steak and we opted for the chicken...great choice! If you love spicy (I sure do), they have a kick to them, as they are topped with freshly sliced jalapenos. Our server was excellent! She was so friendly, accommodating and checked on us frequently. She alone deserves a 5-star recognition! Try this place that offers locally-sourced, high quality food with its own, unique flavor."

I guess that means I'll have to make up for lost time. We got the Brussel Sprouts as an appetizer. There was a sweetness to it with the apples and honey and candied pecans. So good! For dinner, I got the Pan-Seared Chicken and had to say yes to that when I saw that the chicken was on top of risotto, my favorite. The chicken was a small piece but very flavorful. I got the tots and also some chili which was spicy! Thanks The Republic, great place. I gotta get one of your large cocktails next time too."

They were out of fried salmon (odd bc they had the other way?) or I would have gotten that since you can basically get a shrimp taco anywhere. I'll definitely be back for taco Tuesday again. It was a little cold, I like my food room temperature so it was perfect for me, but I could see someone being disappointed in the temperature of the food. But I'm not knocking off any stars for that since that's how I like my food."

                "description": "Came here for dinner on Tuesday night 6/15/21 with some family. I ordered the El Cesar Chavez salad with salmon and when they food came out the first bite I took I was fishing a bone out of my mouth from the salmon. So I started to inspect the rest of the fish and found 3 more bones. I informed our waitress and she kindly had it re made but when the second salmon came out I once again found 2 more fish bones inside.   At this point I did not receive an apology nor did a manager come by to check in to if everything was okay so I asked to speak to one and inform him. The gentlemen came over and apologized but really did not seem genuine about it after I explained how dangerous it was that I found a total of 6 fish bones that I could have choked on. He also attempted to blame the chef for not cleaning it right and saying \"I always tell him to make sure all the bones are out.\"   Coming from the restaurant business myself and having my husband be on the corporate side of a big restaurant chain - I was very disappointed in how this place dealt with the issue.   Please check your seafood at this place - they clearly are not ordering boneless seafood or properly cleaning they're fish."

Anyway, cannot comment too much on food as we only had an appetizer and it was alright.   Beer and wine are served in a plastic now which is less than desirable. Not sure how it was pre-Covid.   Staff was fast and efficient but I don't think I could describe them as warm or friendly.  They weren't rude either.   Decent amount of variety. It's charm is that is local and has the hole in the wall personality.   We plan on returning."

                "description": "My review is mostly based on service.  I came here with the husband on a Monday night because I wanted a post-dinner beer. I marked this place in my bookmarks as a place I wanted to try based off the reviews. I generally try to be open-minded about my experiences at new places, but honestly I was just rubbed the wrong way here. We walked inside around 7 pm and I only noticed the list of cocktails on the wall behind the bar. I looked at the tap handles to see if I could tell what they had and the bartender finally came over. I figured I'd ask for something easy and see if they had Dos Equis on draft and was told they didn't with a snarky attitude that I guess he thought was witty or funny. I asked where the list of beers was and he stared at me and just pointed up...ok where am I supposed to be looking? OH. Apparently I'm supposed to know there are individual beer names hanging not only above the bar seats, but also sticking out slightly over the seating where you have to get up to see them. I tell him I haven't been there before and wouldn't know those were there. I order the beer he suggested (Alstadt Kölsch) based off of me asking for Dos Equis. He asks if I want to open a tab and I say no. His response: \"Only one beer?\" with what may as well have been an eye roll. You would think with me telling someone that I'm a new patron the attitude would be better. He probably doesn't care since A) it probably isn't his business, B) I'm sure they have regulars and C) he was probably in a hurry to come outside to vape with his friends on the patio that says \"No Smoking\".  Side note: if you want to sit outside be prepared to listen to cornhole games underneath the same covering as the seating which causes it to echo so loud you can't hear your own conversation."

                "description": "On this past Saturday, we made the adult decision to venture out as LB was open. We decided to visit as they were not busy and were following the separation guidelines. The service is always friendly and it was even better on this visit. Our guest puppy was treated to snacks and fresh water. We sat on the covered patio and watched rerun sporting events and just enjoyed being outside.   I've been an LB patron since day 1 and I remember when it was difficult to find a local venue that offered a large variety of craft beer options.  LB has changed a lot of the years as they now serve cocktails and their patio has been expanded. Venues come and go (see Sheas and AJs across the street) but LB has a loyal following and has remained our go-to venue to have a brew or two and some pub grub.   It's a misnomer to call their food pub grub as you can order a pretty darn good pizza, meatball casserole, fried calamari, artichoke dip, or our favorite their homemade fried pickles. Yes, they pickle on site!   Nice folks, great beer, good cocktails (check out their specials), and food."

The hurricane that I order that was off of there board on drinks that they made was not a good drink.   The garlic bread we ordered was overdone and almost fully burnt on the bottom.   We ordered pizza also. One side was barely done while the other side was burnt. They put a lot of Italian season on top the pizza after it was cooked. Some times you just get a bite full of seasoning, not good.  First bits we thought the pizza had a good flavor but the more you ate the pizza the less tasty it was."

                "description": "Seek and ye shall find. This tiny hidden spot in old Leander checks off lots of my boxes - but doesn't impress. First off. This is a nice place dont get me wrong. I have been 3 times now just to see maybe it was an OFF day. Good menu , sports , decent tunes. So - those are pretty solid. Let me start with the menu. Pub grub for the most part with $10 pizzas unlimited toppings. So- naturally this is what i ordered each time. Each time it comes out it looks amazing and I'm excited. Like a Pointer Sister ( I 'm so excited ) . But the pizza never tastes cooked. The dough is mushy. Not a big deal. NExt time around I tell them to leave it in a bit longer for me. Comes out -- same. Not a deal breaker. Just need to change what I am eating. My belly prob says same thing. Next lets move onto the staff. For the most part the lady running the joint is on point. Friendly- helpful and witty. The remainder of the staff is quite the opposite. I have noticed this during a lunch visit with us being one of 2 people in the place, and in the evenings like during the sports games and crowds. Just abrasive . Again- I'm not there to make friends. I'm there to have a cold beer ( maybe 3) watch baseball or the slew of people who still have to think if they need to be wearing a mask when they enter an establishment( smh). So - The beer. They have a pretty typical tap list with 1-2 silver and gold medal choices. I saw Aldelberts there last night.. sweet!. But behind the bar is a ghostbuster lunchbox treasure chest of cans and bottles. WARNING! don't try to figure out what's in there. Hard to see them all... and after learning  how friendly the bar staff(see above ) is - I gave up asking and went with an IPA. The crowds are not bad and for the most part follow distancing rules.. but - nothing enforced. This scares me. While I know its MY choice to patron , I would still like to see ppl adhere to the 6ft. Outside- good seating - tv;s good parking and over all fantastic. I will prob go back, just not order the pizza and maybe try and get a spy camera behind the bar to see the other options as -- that's what life is all about. Options. Thanks for eating with me today, and I'll see you next time.  -M"

Mary is a rock star. TouchTunes could be a bit louder at times but that's probably a good thing based on some of the music selections I've heard. Also have golden tee. Quaint little bookstore next door too. Easy parking."

Sat down at the bar and asked to move because a regular sits there. Ok fine. Told the game was on a certain TV. Once people started arriving the manager said she didn't have enough boxes to play the game I wanted all of a sudden. We had ubered to the bar and now are forced to leave. I guess there is a hierarchy in customers and you have to be important to be treated well. I'm baffled."

Something changed at the spot and for me no longer has that comfortable feel. Seems has if over serving is not monitored as you will have several loud and obnoxious folks who aren't being controlled.   This was the second night in a row that I was ignored while sitting at the bar and watching the bar tender hang at the end of the bar with is buddies.   What was once a nice calm place to eat and enjoy some craft beers is now a place for the high volume drinking and the vocally high volume people.  Bring back Luigi's for the food and leave everything else."

Their gluten free bun is the best I've had at a restaurant, it is nice and chewy and stays together.   The chicken sandwich was great, a huge chicken breast with lots of bacon and avocado. They do a \"first timer\" complimentary dessert of their chocolate dump cake, my husband said it was great!"

We came at lunch and though I was initially hesitant to bring in kids, there ended up being plenty off other families in there. The menu was upscale American. Given it was lunch time, we went with hamburgers and sandwiches. The main dishes were all really good and a decent portion (not too big, not too small). The sides we got were a bit under seasoned though. Lastly, there should really be a hamburger on the kids menu.   Overall, really enjoyed this place. Will come back for dinner to try more of the menu."

Despite both being relatively small, there's plenty of seating.  Choose from high-tops to semi-circular booths to high-back swivel bar stools.  And they have an outdoor patio as well, but not much of a view.   The League is a great place to meet a friend for drinks, a casual date, weekend brunch, watch Sunday football, or to just to ride the bar solo.    Excellent food with new, weekly specials, including a burger-of-the-week. On Mondays they have 2-for-1 burgers for dine in - can't beat that!  They also have cocktail specials to go along with their food specials (in addition to their menu and drink standards).  I wish they had a bigger beer wall, but the selection is serviceable.   The League is one on my regular spots and I've yet to be disappointed with their food, drinks, or service."

Sometimes we eat here and sometimes not.   Upside; Bartenders are always friendly and welcoming, they have great happy hour prices on drinks and apps. Also weekly food specials.   Food can be hit or miss. Between the two of us we've had everything on the menu. Club sandwich is always as hit and so is the spinach artichoke dip. Burgers sometimes a bit dry. The salmon is usually perfectly cooked. Fish and chips over battered and greasy. Prime rib sandwich is hit or miss.  Burger of the week this visit was Frito Pie Burger. I had the garlic butter grouper, which was a huge portion, but lacked seasoning on both the fish and couscous. Garlic butter was on the side, but was just melted butter with a chopped garlic at the bottom. No other seasonings.   We will continue to come hang at the bar and eat here occasionally."

I'd give her service 5 stars.   For our food we ordered the chicken fried pork chop, the full rack of ribs, the southern burger, and the kids Mac and cheese.   Our little guy loved the Mac snd cheese. It was decent and definitely not out of a box. It didn't come with anything else but was only $5.   Hubby had the Southern burger with truffle fries ($2 up charge). The burger was solid. It could have been a slight bit juicer but it was a good burger. The \"truffle\" fries were not. The fries were limp and soggy and sprinkled with Parmesan but had no truffle flavor at all. Actually when you picked up a fry the cheese all fell off too. Pretty bad fries to be honest.   Older son ordered the baby back ribs and enjoyed them. They were your standard fair. Similar to what you'd find at Chili's but they cost $30 and come with a side of mashed potatoes.  I had the  chicken fried pork chop. It was very over cooked and dry and was topped with jalapeño gravy but there was no heat or jalapeño flavor at all. The gravy made the pork chop less dry though. I subbed Brussels sprouts instead of mashed potatoes ($2). They lacked seasoning or flavor. I like the taste of Brussels sprouts so I ate them but they had no other seasoning that I could detect.   The food was all fine. Not bad but at their prices I would definitely not run back."

Fish n chips are AOK there are better fish n chips in the area but you can easily split this bountiful dish.   The League pours a good cocktail and their bloodies, according to Plus 1, are right up there with the best. There are rotating taps for you beer snobs (like me).  There is a patio off to the side and a good-sized dining room. It does get crowded hence our late lunch HH visits.  Pro tip during football season Friday nights are packed pre-game."

It all started with a very aggressive an unkempt server with a bad attitude. We ordered the burgers which came under cooked and had soggy buns on the bottom.   The server was very rude when we asked to have the burgers redone and later literally threw a to go  box at me !  The manager got involved and was very gracious to comp the meal ,but i will not go back again because of the bad experience with a terrible server!"

Right as we we're done eating, a truck pulled up behind the building visible from patio and there was a strong sewage smell, it must've been some kind of clean out. Horrible. Thankful we were done or we wouldn't have been able to finish our meal. The smell was horrible.  We'll be back and hope that won't happen at the very moment we're there."

Service was good and the place was small but cozy and clean.   We ordered the fish n chips and a burger with onion rings. The burger was fine, very average and a little bland. The fries that came with the fish were also ok but a little cold. The onion rings and the fish is the part I wanted to love but didn't. Taste wise they were good. However, they had so much batter on them it made me feel sick after just a few bites. I know these were heavy items to order for lunch, but the ratio of batter was just too much."

Poppers weren't really cooked, maybe they were just uber cold because they sat out, see below.  Order was to be ready at 6:58 and brought to my truck. I though ok they are behind...at 7:10 I went in and saw it just sitting on a table next to the door.  No clue how long it was there. They said I could just grab it and go.  Disappointing Brussels spouts we're amazing, the only reason they get two stars.   The last visit they brought it to my truck but the food was mehhh."

                "description": "I've been passing up some awesome food and beers for years.  Don't make the same mistake I did.  I Yelper plead with you!  I also learned two things I've been missing in pizza, too.  I've passed this place dozens of times.  It sits on the fringe of a west Austin neighborhood and several apartments/condos between them and 183.  I believe it is affiliated with a restaurant that has a place in Fort Worth, too, but I might be wrong.  What I'm sure of my first visit there was killer!  I'm planning on going back when I can eat and drink a whole day away!  They have a great outdoor area with plenty of umbrellas and we chose a table.  The server acknowledged us right away.  We QR'd the menu and by the time we'd made a choice of food our beers were on the table and cold (good pour on the Guinness, btw).    We ordered a pizza of our own:  Sausage, mushroom, green peppers and spicy marinara sauce.  Okay, first... You know how some chain pizzas you have the ingredients all coming off together leaving you with less than even a cheese pizza?  Not here.  Every thing is chopped into small pieces and spread evenly over the entire pizza.  Every bite comes with a mouthful of exactly what you ordered.  Second, put some of that marinara on a piece of canvas and I'd eat it.  The spices brought everything together.  We got wings too.  Golden Buffalo.  Perfect heat! Crispy.  Meaty. Those wings were gone so fast I was looking at other tables to see if someone had snatch a couple off our plate LOL  We were licking the hot sauce off the plate.  I'M DOUBLING THE ORDER NEXT TIME!  Great service, cool vibe, good food!  Did I get lucky or find bar food Nirvana?  I dunno.  I'm going to rock a five star and adjust as I need to, but I'm not going to deprive myself of another visit here for sure!!"

                "description": "Fun Neighborhood joint.  This feels like a place where you'd walk in and they'd say, \"Norm!\"...if that were your name and you were on an episode of Cheers.  The beer was deliciously cold served in a thick glass to keep it that way. The pizza was generously embellished with toppings, and the crust was above average. The service was timely and courteous. I really liked the outdoor patio. Part of it is covered with fans, and part was uncovered with tables with umbrellas. The only drawback is there's a lot of road noise. We sat at a table as far away from the road as possible, and it was acceptable noise-wise. When our world health situation is better, I hope to see all the tables filled with large groups of friends enjoying pints and pizzas. For now, come check it out with your close friends and/or significant other."

It was way more laid back then I expected (place is always popping outside!!) which was great, I'm not for the \"pay twice what it's worth because we are fancy pants\".

                "description": "My friends like this place, but I don't see the draw. The pizza is mediocre. Fortunately tonight I discovered their sandwiches are good. I got the Pourboy, with Fries. Everyone else in our group who wanted food ended up being in a sandwich mood, so the Chicken Parm sandwich got good reviews from two of the guys. The fries were well-seasoned and looked promising, but were a little cold and soft. Other times I liked the Fried Pickle Chips, but could only eat a few pieces before they got overpowering. It's not like we'd eat that many pickles out of the jar in one sitting! I think the server mixed up my friend's beer order. The final blow to this spot is that their outdoor chairs are wildly uncomfortable. I even brought my own seat cushion the last few times I came! This time it saved my butt, but my back still hurts. I'd give Pour House a 3.5 but I'm in a generous mood so I'm rounding up."

This isn't even the first time this has happened. On another occasion, I saw a rat running out from the KITCHEN and into the parking lot. It was disgusting. The owners of this business need to have pest control come in so that their patrons can eat without worrying about rats, and so their kitchen staff doesn't have to cook with pests. I've worked in the service industry and know this is no ones fault but the owners. Do better by your employees and your customers and get rid of the rats."

                "description": "At first glance, the interior of Pour House looked a little un-maintained. But, then of course, Austin. Where everything is underground. I was excited about the local beer list, though the stout selection was a bit thin. I went with Redhorn, a coffee stout that was a little short on stoutness for me. But, the flavor was good.  We ordered three 8\" pizzas to share: El Supremo, Hawaiian, and a Veggie pizza, providing plenty for two adults and two children. The pizza was quite good, as in Austin-good. I couldn't put my finger on it, but there was something unique about the flavor.    Our server was very good, personable and informative. We ate a late lunch, during which a growing number of what appeared to be regulars gathered mostly around the bar. The location is a bit secluded from the rest of Austin. But, it's near the technology district, where I was working for the day.  Parking was a little confusing because we approached the building from a side where the entrance wasn't visible. It's a private parking lot with plenty of space. Outdoor seating is available. Highly recommended!"

The environment was chill and not too busy during lunch time so that was a plus for us because we needed to be back for training within the hour.  Three of us ordered the Cubano and it was so tasty! I definitely enjoyed the pickles and pork amongst other fine ingredients they packed on that pizza! One of guys ordered the regular pepperoni pizza and he said he liked it a lot. The crust and dough of the pizza was cooked perfectly thoroughly.  There salads were delicious and portioned perfectly. When you arrive the parking is all in the back area pretty much, and you enter through the patio area. They have signs for you and that guide you to entrance."

Unfortunately, Jollyville is busy so you have to speak loudly to each other but there's not a lot Pour House can do about that.  At first, our waiter seemed like he was going to be a lot of fun but we quickly realized he was all show and no action. He forgot to bring one of our drinks the first time around and then we very rarely saw him after that until he was ready for us to pay the bill. We had to find a different waiter to order a second round of margaritas.  The margaritas themselves we're nothing to get excited about and seemed like they had very little alcohol. We ordered two orders of the fried pickles, though, because those were great! (And even here we had to flag down our waiter to place a second order and get extra ranch dip).  We will go back because of the convenient location and nice patio but we will have our expectations set appropriately."

The Canadian bacon, all so good. Also got a pita bread house made bruschetta. Wow, is that good. Diced tomatoes, with small cubes of mozzarella, and fresh basil. Deliciand shareable. Again I had the cherry limeade drink. It's perfect. The whole meal was fantastic. The waiter we had was super nice. This place is packed. So get there early. It's loud inside, but they have a large patio, but tonight it was chilly. No heat lamps. Parking lot is tight too. Been here twice and I think I took the last parking spot both time UPDATE: I've never been here for brunch, so today is the day! Chicken and waffles it is! I find chicken and waffles such a Southern thing, and I can't get enough of it. If it's on the menu, I'm ordering it. Their waffles are amazing. It's two small waffles with pockets of like brown sugar maybe? They have some kind of crunch to it. I didn't even use syrup because they just had a great flavor already. Chicken is tender and juicy. And it's a big piece of chicken breast. Bartenders are so Southern with their \"yes ma'am\" and hospitality. I always had a drink in front of me and I was checked in to make sure everything was to my liking. Pour House on Jollyville Road is such a great place to go alone or with a group. Their patio is outstanding, service is Southern as Southern can get. Always had a great meal, an even better cocktail, and the service is hands down Southern and hospitable. You have a great team here, this is my go to place"

Picked up 2 pizzas for myself and office manager. Her first response was that it seemed to be frozen pizza. I agreed. Pepperroni was sliced so thin it was almost tranparent transparent. Sauce and crust definitely seemed directly from the frozen section. My large greek salad was equally disappointing - very much so.  Counter staff was very friendly and courteous though."

The brussels spouts were tasty too.  My friend had the pastrami sandwich and she kept raving about it; the pastrami was high quality.    | Cocktails |  Again, a big win.  They were doing a bartender drink contest with several whiskey cocktails and I went for the Peach Tree.  Although petite it packs in taste and was not light on the whiskey!  | Atmosphere |  The patio is typical strip mall-ish.  It's nice that it is dog friendly."

                "description": "Service here was good and loved the bar area. Brunch cocktail selection was above average. The Vietnamese espresso drink and Bloody Mary were great.   Food is what knocks this down a bit. I got the biscuits and gravy which was wayyyy to much biscuit for the amount of gravy given. Getting the chicken added is a must.   The carnitas poutine was super salty. I get that both things are meant to be like that, but this was just too much. I wish there was more pickled onions and jalapeños to balance it out.   The happy hour menu and times looked pretty good, so I'd definitely return to try that out."

                "description": "First, this place is perfectly nice and probably worth going to again if I am back in the area but would easily be convinced to try something else.  My evening began with the Ancho Margarita.   Unlike some places this chili inspired drink isn't like drinking hot pepper juice and is delicious.    The fried cheese curds with ranch dressing were tasty but nothing particularly gourmet as a novice home cook could prepare this with the same results.     The disappointment came with the main meal.  The French fries were cold.   From our vantage point we could watch the kitchen workers.  They kept a big bowl of French fries that the kitchen leader would use to place portions on out going plates.   They rarely sitting it under a heat lamp, so they were cold and unmemorable.   This is probably the easiest and cheapest thing on the menu to prepare well.  The rest of the meal was perfectly ok, but noting that stuck out as particularly special.    The ambiance is nice, but extremely loud when there's a full house so you have to raise your voice to be heard across the table."

We had a little difficulty finding good selections on the menu. Citrus pancakes sounded good, but they were out of them. The Bacon Beignets were the highlight, warm, freshly made and tasty. Reuben was good, with nicely salted corned beef and delicious German slaw. Pimento burger was too rich for my taste. Service was good. Overall experience was good. Would be 5 stars, but menu was not great for us. If you find things you like on the menu, then you should try it out."

                "description": "The meal was much more attractive than it was delicious. Everything was fresh but lacked flair in the flavor department. This is the kind of place I would come to for dinner but I wouldn't bring anyone here to impress them or to treat them. I only say that because the impression of this place I got from the ambiance and the menu was that I would be in for a stellar meal. I ordered the Brie Burger believing the brie and the flavor profile would offer pizzaz but I was not razzle dazzled. It was just the feel of eating a better than average burger.  The carnitas poutine got me a little eager to taste more flavors as I had that to start.  It could have rivaled a couple of poutine offerings that I've had in Montréal aka the poutine capital of the world (sorry Quebec City).  I am happy that all the greens were fresh to round out the meals well.  I felt like portions and servings were well balanced.  If I lived in the area, I'd dine here again."

We were in no hurry so we had another beer and looked over the menu.  It was obvious that Oast was short staffed and everyone was doing double duty. Thank the pandemic!  Nevertheless, tHe staff was very friendly and the service was adequate.  However our burgers were not very hot and my pretzel bun was stale. The fries were very good. In better times, this will probably be a very nice dinner option."

However, it's laid back, chill atmosphere, and modern feel makes it a great spot for almost any occasion.  The food was pretty good. I did get something i could make at home. However everything was cooked nicely apart from the bacon. It was a little bit too charred for my taste. Potatoes were tasty, eggs standard, and the rye bread tasted more like a sour dough. But still good.   Mimosas were a good deal as well!   Overall we had a great time and most likely will return again!"

We came here because we found some good reviews on Yelp, but have to say I was a bit apprehensive about how long it's been since the last review posted for this place.   This restaurant seems to be a family go to place where people just eat and never care to leave a review.   This place a gem! We came in for an early dinner and were surprised by how good their food and drinks are.   I wasn't really found of the butternut squash soup but we were in the mood for trying so we did it.   I do recommend this place for anyone.  Specially if you are looking for food away from Downtown like us.   Enjoy!"

                "description": "Came here for brunch after church on Sunday. I must shout out Henry because his service was awesome. He was personable, friendly and efficient. His service gets 5 stars (and we made sure his tip showed it). We started with the bacon beignets which were not really like beignets. They were crispy on the outside and more like cake donuts on the inside. Only got like two pieces of bacon in the whole serving.  The food came to the table very room temperature. My father had to send his biscuits and gravy back to reheat (no one wants congealed gravy). My mom and I got the boring breakfast plate. I asked for my eggs over medium and they definitely came fried hard. Also the house cured bacon was bland and extremely dry. My Aunt's chicken cacciatore pasta tasted good and we liked the strawberry pancake we ordered for the table a lot.  Overall, service was the highlight but the brunch options are not worth a second visit."

The service was really good (and timely/efficient) and we enjoyed the covered seating outside. They had a great beer/cocktail/wine selection and had several drafts i had never seen before. The chicken and waffles were really strong, and the chicken was almost like hot chicken which was a pleasant surprise and carried the dish but no complaints there. The carnitas poutine and the Cubano were certainly enjoyed as well"

                "description": "Oasthouse has been my periodic GrubHub treat when my standbys on another delivery service aren't available for several months. What more does one need in life when brie pimento burgers and coffee rubbed carrots with green peppercorn ranch are on the menu? I don't even mind that my average order for one meal is at least 35-40.00 with delivery. Sometimes it's just worth it for something so yummy.   I was excited tonight to share an Oasthouse experience with my daughter and was pretty disappointed at both a mediocre meal and pettiness on my bill. Even though I was happy to spend the 45.00 plus 20.00 delivery charges and tip to reward ourselves after a strenuous and stressful day of work, I felt shortchanged pretty quick when I couldn't even see the pimento on my burger, got an overly dry bun and was charged 2.00 after the fact for some perceived \"extra\" change to my order.   Whether this was an upcharge because they were out of mashed potatoes (usually substituted for fries since I'm gluten free) and gave me the more expensive brussels sprouts. Or maybe they changed me for the extra pimento I always ask for (#swoon) but didn't get. Since they didn't say what it was for I'm left wondering.   All in all, my highly anticipated Oasthouse indulgence fell kind of flat on a day when I really needed it. I guess nobody's perfect."

Cool atmosphere and decent prices for food and drinks. We ordered 2 carafes of mimosas for only $8 each, which I thought was a great deal. They bring out your champagne and orange juice in separate carafes so you can measure out how much you personally want of each, which I appreciated.   I was not blown away by the food, but everything we ordered was still solid. Two of us ordered the all day breakfast plate that came with eggs, uncured bacon, a slice of toast, and breakfast potatoes. Everything was good, simply nothing stood out. The other two people in our party enjoyed their eggs Benedict and strawberries field salad. Good service and she stayed attentive the whole time we were there catching up. Overall, good experience."

He was able to give great suggestions for food and drinks. We've had the fried mushrooms (featured) and the Reuben egg rolls for appetizers which were both amazing! For entrees we've had the chicken schnitzel, cheesy meatball sub (featured), and the strawberry fields salad which were really tasty. My personal favorite is the chicken schnitzel. Other reviews mention the drinks being so-so but every drink I've gotten has been quality with the alcohol. The hotter melon was recommended by Henry and was very refreshing.

I would recommend for a chill brunch spot on a Saturday! Not too crowded at all and we were seated right away at 11:30. Our server Kayla was great!

I ordered the Truffled Prosciutto Bruschetta, consisting of creamy truffled ricotta, argula, mission figs and local honey topped by a generous dollop of prosciutto.  It was a dreamy combo of textures and flavors.  On the side I had the seasonal tomato soup, thick and creamy.  My husband was briefly disappointed when Megan reported that the ribs were sold out.  However, she recommended the Wagu steak and frites.  The steak arrived warm and beautifully sliced with a giant side of shoestring fries, delicate and just fried to perfection.  We topped off the meal by splitting a peach crumble adorned with vanilla bean ice cream - a desert to die for."

They have rotating specials, soups and flatbreads. The servers and staff are all very friendly and hard workers. I also bring friends here and they have all loved it as well! They have great deals on their happy hour and a good variety of beers and wine that are not crazy overpriced. I have loved everything I have ordered and they have great portion sizes! We usually come for lunch or dinner, but we recently had brunch which was also fabulous. I had the chilaquiles and they were amazing! The portions are also super generous so I've left with leftovers multiple times. If you're a sports person, they have a ton of really nice TVs and always have games on. I am honestly so happy this place is close by and will continue giving them my business! I would also like to add that like many places these days, they have also experienced shortages with staff and when that happens, we have seen the managers out on the floor helping out and also working their butte off! This restaurant has amazing food, service and is such a great place to have a nice dinner, go hang with friends or just pop by for a drink! Thanks for rocking it Cover 2! Oh and the Round Rock location is also awesome as I went their with a group of work friends once they also had excellent service and the food was equally as delicious!!!"

I like this place. The food is good the beer selection is passable and I can watch any sporting event live or read a book or both. But these two are killing the place for me. Ordered a beer and sat for 20 minutes with no one asking me if I might like to order food. Had to literally flag someone down to order a meal. That is not how this business works.   Wearing a mask under your chin until you walk up to a customer is not how this works either. And the tall one did that all night long. Now looking for a different place to spend an evening eating a meal and enjoying a beer."

                "description": "Horrible service today.  Sat in a booth for over 15 minutes while others came in after me and got their orders taken. Person who had seated me brought me a drink then nothing. Though a minimum of 5 different servers were standing right next to my booth.  I understand a restaurant may be short staffed but limit your seating if you cannot handle it.  I've had the similar experience here multiple times.  Last time I patron any of the restaurants in this local chain.  And \"the remedy\" after speaking to a manager when I asked for the check for my half drank coke...oh no need to pay for the coke.  FAIL ALL AROUND!"

Apparently you get service that way.   Literally just walked in and got sat, was busy due to a UT game no problem. And then we just sit and wait and wait and wait. The supposed waiter for our area literally helped everyone around us and kept skipping us. Idk if it was because we didn't have UT gear on or I was basically the only black person there at the time but ppl that just walked in the door got greeted before we did.   We just got up and left. There's no way the dude in the area didn't know we had not been helped as he purposely kept ignoring the table and was serving EVERYONE around us.   Terrible service."

The servers are polite and the manger runs around and works just as hard (love seeing that) all the food I've had is amazing.

We fancied burgers and thought that a sports bar would serve delicious burgers! What a mistaken idea!! We started with a cup of onion soup: it was edible, not delicious, a little strong on the acid side, but ok. Then came the burgers: a 3mm leather sole burnt to death!! Awful! Horrible!! My husband had to leave the restaurant and was sick in the car park!! The fries were smothered in fat... yak! The waiter on the other hand was a sweetheart!! VERY professional! When I mentioned it wasn't good, he immediately offered to comp them, which he did! I am tempted to say that he had been through a similar situation before, maybe several times!!! He didn't hesitate and didn't offer an alternative: he KNEW the food was bad! Shame on management to allow this to happen! It's a Burger after all, and we are in Texas!! Land of Beef!! Cover 2, I'm afraid you will not see us again!!"

                "description": "Cover 2 off research always hits the spot it's got the best shoe string fries I can't seem to find anywhere else in Austin . Even though they may just be French fries and not a main course there is something so satisfying about them . My favorite dish is the buffalo chicken sliders , I personally get the blue cheese on the side with ranch to dip . These are amazing and have the perfect thin not to thick cut of chicken that's battered nice and crispy but stays juicy tossed in tangy but not spicy buffalo sauce. The bread doesn't take over the sandwich so that's not all you get full on and is super soft . They also have a buffalo chicken salad that has a good amount of chicken if your not wanting a sandwich but need to cure that buffalo craving . I've only had the burgers other than that and they are equally delicious again especially with those shoe string fries that are always crispy .  This place is relaxed and a good place to have a beer while you cool off after a long day or just dining with the family.  The staff is pleasant and the deserts are huge . Well at least the brownie is . If you like bars and burgers are in the area and don't know what to eat stop in and try the buffalo sandwich it's my go to and recommendation for cover 2 . If not that than at least grab a beer and some shoe string fries and relax a minute ."

Today I stopped in for lunch and ordered the flat top cheeseburger that comes with Parmesan fries. Should have been a safe bet, right? It came out DRIPPING in grease that tasted truly awful. Even the fries, which are always good, no matter the location, were inedible, as they tasted like they were fried in oil that should have changed long ago. It pains me to leave food that I paid good money for, but that's just what I did after trying to force down a couple more bites I shouldn't have taken. I left 2/3 of the burger and most of the fries on the table. Considered complaining, and might have if the server had even asked how the food was, but she didn't ask, and she had to have noticed how little I had eaten. She just left the check by the barely eaten food.  I rarely send food back to the kitchen, and since this wasn't exactly fine dining, I let it go today. But tonight I'm regretting eating those two or three additional bites I shouldn't have taken. It truly wasn't fit for consumption."

Heading back, I swung into Cover2. I'm glad I did.  The greeting, Silvana as server, and the whole support staff weekend terrific.  I started with a cup of French onion soup. It was just a tad too sweet for my taste. I'm also a purist in looking for a single crouton under the  hood (of cheese).   The fries and prime rib sandwich were a pleasant surprise. I will typically keg wrestle you to keep the horseradish sauce off the plate. The sauce here actually was mellowed very nicely and didn't fight the meat. The fries were great! Nothing more need be said.   This was a terrific first meal in a new town. This might become my extended kitchen it was that solid of aa performance!"

                "description": "I stopped by after reading a few Yelp reviews and what a great choice that was. I had the good fortune to sit at the bar and have Miranda take care of me. If I started a bar or a restaurant she would be my first hire (better give her a raise, Doug)!  She's friendly, professional and makes a great martini. The hospitality industry needs more Miranda's!    Now to the place itself. Cover 2 has a nice, open concept with the ubiquitous flat screens located around the bar and restaurant - it is a sports bar, after all.  The people working there are friendly and attentive while the noise level is energetic but not overly loud.    The food.  The Reuben was honestly just okay. The corned beef to Swiss cheese to kraut ratio is off (not enough kraut) and the bread was cooked to the point where it was as stiff as a board.  It tastes okay but the potential for a better sandwich is definitely there.  Ask for fries - they don't automatically come with it.   The fries were good and - just to see for myself - I ate half the Reuben and then ordered the wings.  The buffalo wings are tasty - not the best I've ever had but certainly worth sampling. Pair it with the 512 IPA and you have a winning combination.  Overall I would give Cover 2 a solid 8 on a 1-10 scale. The kitchen gets a 7, the bar an 8 and Miranda a 1o I think my math is right). If you're looking for a good sports bar that's not too sporty this is a solid choice."

We went to see Ghostbusters Afterlife the Friday night after the premiere. Everything started out fine: we placed our drink and appetizer order before the show started. Got our mozzarella sticks and they were slightly underdone. Eh whatever, not a huge deal. Our beer and Bavarian Pretzel pizza were good, no complaints. However, the service not so much. On top of the fact our waitress took forever, she accused us of smoking in the theatre. I told her there was a vape cloud that came up on the row in front of us and I never saw anyone go talk to them. So maybe make sure you're accusing the right person next time. THEN our popcorn was burnt and we still got charged for it after letting them know. We'll keep going to Moviehouse in the future."

It wasn't exactly cheap ($150 for the rental, plus tickets and food/drink separately) but we missed movie theaters so much that we sprung for it. It was definitely worth it. The Alamo crew took so many precautions before and during our stay that although I was very anxious about the rental at first, I was able to relax and enjoy the show. Like others have said, all movie theaters are surely suffering right now and we need to support Alamo so that they're here when the pandemic is over. I love this theater chain so much, it'd be devastating for me personally if they were to close."

                "description": "I'm torn between nostalgia and the elevated level of service (and price) other theatres are offering.  This is classic Alamo.  It's like rediscovering your first car.  Fixed bar-style eating surface in front of the fixed seats, no leg rests or fully reclining seats.  The service was GREAT, albeit we were intentionally at a TERRIBLE horror movie (The Turning) that had maybe 10 people in the cinema with us.  Still, an employee could slack in that situation and they did not.    The screen and sound were good.    There was no lounge in the theater that I saw to relax and have drinks before or after the movie.    And, after many visits to other theatres, it was unusual not to have a button to press for service.  Rather, you physically put your order card up on the table for a server to see when they come by.  I was really concerned about this because I knew how bad the movie was going to be early on and drinks were part of the plan!! lol  But in retrospect, maybe having to physically check on the patrons is what made the service so attentive (I got the drinks I needed to get through the picture -- thank you, Jesus).  So, obviously I'm torn.  It is a retro experience for me having experienced my first dine-in theater at an Alamo. I would go back here again in a heartbeat.  But it is like getting in a classic car and then realizing you actually like modern bucket seats and power steering.  At the same time that classic car was less expensive and still brings a smile to your face.  I'm going to rank based on the model Alamo built and on fulfilling my memories of great service...and I'm looking forward to going back again! :)"

Secondly, they have the nicest staff, and their food is always delicious! If there's any issue, they handle it quickly and efficiently. They're also super clean, and have been really amazing with COVID protocols. I feel comfortable going back to the movies because of Alamo Drafthouse. Thanks for always going above and beyond!"

This is our second time for a family party and they rock! 45 minutes before the movie they have crafts for the kids (seems like usually 3-4 stations) and then they have an interactive dance or activity at the front of the theater immediately before the movie. It makes the movie an event for the kids.   Now if I could somehow watch a movie I want to see while the kids watched their cartoon!"

                "description": "My wife and I attended the Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring 3:00 p.m. showing at Lakeline Alamo on Saturday, March 27. It was our first public outing since last year before Covid-19 struck. We were excited and nervous to venture out, but trusted Alamo's protocols.  We walk into the theater and there is just one guy there, sitting a couple rows from the projector, American flag bandana for a mask sitting around his neck not covering his face, scrolling on his phone. He makes a couple calls and talks loudly, checking on his insurance apparently. He continues to do it halfway through the movie previews. My wife and I are already annoyed. Not a good start.  The movie begins and the guy behind us has been quiet for 10 minutes. Things seem to be turning for the better. That is, until a short while into the movie when he starts making comments aloud. \"No!\" to Gandalf leaving Frodo. \"Asshole!\" to Saruman betraying Gandalf. I grit my teeth and exchange glances with my wife as it continues, both of us hoping it subsides.  Nope. The loud asshole decides to keep making his commentary like it's his own personal screening. I finally have had enough of it about an hour into the film and place an order card that read \"Please tell the guy behind us to stop talking! He keeps doing it!\" The server comes five minutes later, takes it and nods. She does nothing.  Another 30 minutes goes by. This guy's behavior continues. He even plays a video on his phone for all to hear at one point. He's all I can focus on now, my enjoyment of the movie totally ruined. I storm out of the theater determined to get someone to kick him out.  I find a young guy with a pony tail who is clearly a server. I plea my case that this guy needs to go. He seems to take my request seriously and I return, hoping the Alamo's well-known policy of kicking out disruptors will finally be used on this guy ruining our movie.  Well, that wasn't the case. 10, then 20 minutes go by. I didn't see anyone come into the theater to handle it. The pest behind us makes comments aloud less frequently, probably because my wife yelled at him to shut up at one point. While I couldn't blame her for taking it into her own hands, I wanted the Alamo staff to do something about it like I know they should.  In retrospect, maybe it wasn't a bad idea because nothing was done to kick him out as I requested. The movie nears its end and the guy shouts again. Finally, we hear someone behind us address him, apparently letting him off with a warning. After all he had done throughout the course of the film to ruin the movie for us, it was far too little, far too late.  Amazingly, it actually worked that someone talked to him. He shut up for the 10 minutes left in the movie and didn't say anything during the cast reunion piece that followed the credits. So had the staff addressed this nuisance earlier like I wanted, perhaps this outing would have been salvagable. Mind you, I first brought it to the attention of the staff an hour into a THREE HOUR MOVIE. They finally say something to him with only 10-15 minutes left. Completely unacceptable, if you ask me.  Our server tells us shortly after one of her staff finally talked to the guy that she told a manager and that she was sorry the loud patron was like this. He seems \"a little 'special,' you know what I mean?\" is what she says. Whether that's true or not is frankly irrelevant. You have a policy in place that you remind patrons every single time they visit your theaters. No talking, no texting. Problem with a loud table? Raise an order card and a staff member will address it, eventually asking them to leave without a refund. Had this policy been followed as outlined, he should have been given a warning an hour into the movie and then instructed to leave without a refund 30 minutes later when I pleaded to the staff to take care of it. Case closed. The way it was handled in reality was an absolute joke and insult.  We were happy to attend this screening as our first outing. Now, after this incident, we will no longer give Alamo our business."

Even for a  vegetarian.  The best part of the experience for me is that people are told to turn off phones and be quiet. No one else is doing this and it is a thoughtful reminder.  Although some people don't quite get it and continue to talk, there was enough attention to keep the majority of chatter box's quite:-)"

Love to get there a half hour early and watch the pre-show entertainment. It's unique, nostalgic, and always funny. None of the advertisement bombardment you get at other theaters.   The food is always excellent   The 2x2 burger is my favorite and I've never been disappointed. It's a 5 star version of the Big Mac. The Colorado steak salad is also a regular favorite.   Drinks are always cold and the buttered popcorn with real butter is ridiculously delicious.   Awesome selection of adult beverages.   Love this place."

We were served pretty quickly. We loved the Pizza which was the Meat Pizza. It was hot and fresh. My wife was not a fan of the Chardonnay. My son thought his Pepperoni pizza was great and liked the Milkshake as well. We enjoyed the reserve seating. Just before the movie started we ordered some popcorn and a beer to split.   What cost them a star in my opinion was the Popcorn. It was really cold and without Salt or much Butter and taste like it was made at home. The main thing I like about the Movies is the Popcorn is always unbelievable. This was the opposite and was memorable for the worst reason. The other annoyance was the lack of under the table lighting when the bill arrived during the movie. I tried and quickly gave up so my wife finally figured out what we owed and paid in the dark. Not sure I have a fix just saying this is not good for older people with less then perfect night vision.  Definitely more to like than dislike here. We will be back."

She will ask you to show your order on the phone if match with the bag that you are grabbing but the way she did not so friendly.   Others staff is perfect, they're professional and friendly.   Food is good especially the fish dish. Fries as well. Love the new drinks that they are selling on the fridge. But if you use delivery service it won't taste the same.   3 stars because of that Asian waitress, otherwise 5. If manager or owner read this, please consider this waitress. She doesn't have a service mind!! She should find a new job that fit her style. I used to come here at least once every two weeks also order through DoorDash for pickup and sometime delivery, but I hate to see that waitress, so I might stop all."

We had to wait just a couple of minutes because they were getting a big influx of guest - seems like some sort of dance show had just let out. Gary was our server and even though my favorite pasta has been discontinued (RIP blackened chicken pasta) and they were out of my second choice item (turkey burger) Gary had a great attitude and solid recommendations and solutions to keep the night on track. I ended up getting the half rack rib special with a beer that he recommended to pair and of course everyone was more than happy to share my pizooki.

We've tried to eat here on three occasions in the past month, every time we walk in, maybe 1 in 4 tables is seated. Then they tell us it's going to be a 1-2 hour wait. I'm all about social distancing and being safe during these times but that's ridiculous. It's either bad management unable to staff the location or just an EXTREME overabundance of social distancing. We gave them two chances and the third time we're done. We'll just go ahead and drive to the next nearest one and get seated sooner. Every single couple/group that came in during the 5 minutes we spent there had the same appalled look on their face when they saw the place practically empty and an hour wait."

I got a call from the door dash driver a bit later and he said they had no record of my order.  I texted him a photo of my e-receipt and he showed the manager.  Apparently they didn't have the Shrimp Scampi -Tri-Tip Bundle I ordered at this particular restaurant so the order cancelled automatically and I got no notification from the restaurant.  The Door Dash driver had to cancel my order and he said someone from BJ's would be calling me.  They called and said they could have another bundle with a different item ready and cooked in about 15 minutes.  I said ok. that works.    30 minutes later I get a phone call asking when I was coming to pick up the order? I said I ordered delivery, not pick-up. He said, \"you have to order on our website to get delivery.\"  I told him I did the first time.  He just, \"Oh\".  So I said, \"So you are not going to deliver this?\" he said he couldn't.  So I just said refund my money and this is the last time I will be going to this store.    You would think that maybe a manager would have called back to apologize or something, but nothing.  I just hope I get my refund.    Good luck with this store!"

We arrived and then, found out that they had not taken that down reserve ahead of time option, so I reserved a seat for nothing, still waited about 40 minutes.  By the way, you have to be present to get on the waitlist like any other restaurant in town.  When it was time to be seated there probably 5 empty 2 top tables, and they were seating us next to a large party of 10!  Hello, can we move a few tables down?  So we picked another table and sat.  The host came and asked if we would like to move to a booth once it's cleaned as he pointed to the table, never were moved, and the original hostess that sat us brought our silverware and we assumed we were no longer moving.  Waited 15 minutes for our beer after waiting for our server.  Placed our order at 8:25 and got our food within 15-20 minutes, luckily!  By then, we were starving.  Be patient since all dining is lacking employees.  No pics to show since we woofed down our food!"

You may be thinking to yourself, \"tuesday?? are you serious?? what could be so great about tuesdays and what does that have to do with Bj's?\". Well tuesdays are the best day of the week because pizookies are only $3! The only thing that can make $3 pizookie tuesday better is our wonderful waitress Kyla! Kyla was kind, attentive, and accommodating. You can tell she is an extremely hard worker and earns every cent she makes. If you want to spice up your tuesdays, come to bjs and request kyla as your server."

We have eaten here many times, and although I didn't order it tonight, one of my favorites here is the Jambalaya. It is a little hot for my wimpy tastebuds, so I order it with light cayenne.

They brought out the alfredo sauce separately when I asked and it was awful, probably straight out of a jar. The croutons in the salad were all burned. Both of the steaks we got were very tough and chewy, although the flavor was not bad on this. The chicken Parmesan had no seasoning. I'm not even exaggerating, I don't think there was anything on it, same with the broccoli that came with it, but the white cheddar mashed potatoes were good. They also brought out another incorrect item, which I wouldn't normally mention because when I pointed it out they did correct it, but I mention it because it just shows more how much of a mess the kitchen is. My server was very friendly and attentive, did not have an issue with service, just quality of food. This meal cost $100 and I'm cringing over it. I wouldn't recommend going and I don't see myself coming back, personally. Which is a bummer because I liked this place! Definitely should have just gone to Longhorn!"

My boyfriend (who has a darker skin tone and has dreads as well might I add) and I go in and still, there's no wait time and it was not busy.  The woman at the front says we can sit anywhere near the bar and a server will be right with us. We sit anywhere as she said we could and about 3 servers walk pass by us and we make eye contact with all of them, multiple times, and they still don't serve us and I feel it had to do with our skin tone. Again, it was NOT busy and the servers were tending to all of the other tables but ours. We just got up and left after about 10 minutes of not being acknowledged. Writing this review to give others a heads up that if you have a different skin complexion you may not get served either :) There are much better businesses to support and this establishment is not recommended."

I walk in and there's a table with some merchandise on it and this little man, asked if we were there for the event? I said \"we didn't know there was an event\" and then he said it was $25 per person... well we didn't know, we just came for a drink and some parents night out. So I said sorry and we excused ourselves and then this same lady at the front was smoking outside so I said \"Sorry, we didn't know it was an event\" and she snarkily says \"Yeah! it's dwarf wrestling!\" Like I should be ashamed of not knowing this. I feel stupid, my bad.... But maybe next time have a sign on the door! We read the entire door and no sign about this, a cover of $10-15 we would pay but we didn't want to do $25 per person, since we had not  arrived for the event. I think if you have an event, try being a bit nicer. Some people are not regulars and just want to come over and you could sell it a bit, instead of making us feel bad for not know about your poorly advertised event.  I still like this bar and I like that people can smoke in doors (although I'm not a smoker) we have enough bars we can go too and this one is for smokers, so I don't have an issue and I know what I'll smell like when I leave."

If that's not a problem for you, then you're in for a good time.   We came in on a Tuesday night and easily found a pool table to ourselves. We opened a tab and had no trouble getting drinks without having to leave our games. The mixed drinks are nothing to write home about, but we had an excellent time drinking and playing pool. We also easily played some table shuffle board. They have computer slots/keno games to gamble with in a shady corner is that's something you're into.   The place was acceptably clean and the staff were all very friendly. Just make sure you have a VALID drivers license regardless of your age! This was place was a good time and I'll definitely be back again in the future."

Everybody knows secondhand cigarette smoke is really bad for you so open up a flipping window if you're gonna let people smoke. If you're too lazy to go outdoors to smoke then this place should be regulated by the health department better, this isn't your house, and no one saying you can't do something but it's just nasty and it's really bad for your health right now my throat is on fire because I've been breathing secondhand smoke I don't wanna sound like a whiner or entitled millennial but it secondhand smoke dude and it's nasty."

Staff has always been good to me over the years, and have been like family, met many current friends because of Shooters. Never a cover, and probably the best drink prices of any bar.  This place has great potential, but they need to make the best of some of its best assets, especially the use that beautiful patio more for events, music, etc. You should have a solo acoustic artist out there in spring/summer/fall and promote some games on the patio, it just seems as it's used as wasted space currently, and that's a shame."

Bartender was patient with us as we pondered our last cocktail of the day. Notice I said day not evening. We settled on shots (why not??!!). We all received generous pours at a reasonable price.   Shooters is a great sports bar with multiple TVS (they do have the NFL ticket). There are plenty of pool tables and games to keep you occupied. I would definitely come here to watch games but the cigarette smoke stench is too much for me, and I'm a cigar smoker. We visited for about 10 minutes and my clothes stunk of smoke. I wish they would go smokeless like their other venue on 620 or at least add some additional smoke eaters. If you are a smoker it is a 5 star joint... for others 3 makes it AOK and a fair rating."

The bar set up is great, but with rude staff like this why would I want to come back.  Bad service lost you 4 ladies who spend a good amount and tip well....and earned you a bad review.  If your staff is so miserable they cannot give good service, maybe it's time to clean house."

They offer a bar with ample seating, plenty of individual tables for seating, several pool tables, have a stage (that was empty when we visited), have an outdoor patio and an add collection of gambling machines in the back corner.  I am sure it is not real gambling, but the game players certainly looked like they were in Vegas.  Prices are reasonable.  Would not come out of my way to come here, but it is a decent dive bar."

                "description": "Let me just place some facts here as a ex customer!!   1. Chris is the rudest person there!! He treats everyone really bad and makes you feel like crap! So you go pay to get horrible service from him.   2. If you go gamble be prepared to share the machines with the workers as they are on their shift and serving you drinks as they have their machine on auto play and by that I've only seen one person dong this by the name of Desiree or Mrs Des for short.  Last time I saw her was a few weeks ago when I went after work to enjoy myself for a few drinks and even tho I go alone I do have friends there and she was so occupied playing and asking around if her machine was paying her a lady was complaining about how she hadn't give her her change back. It took her a long time to pay that lady back. It's not the first time I've seen her playing specially when it's slow but busy days won't stop her. Chris and her make a fabulous team as far as proving the worst service!!   3. Misty and the rest of the girls are the best workers there.   Too bad they lost me as a customer and will never spend one cent on that place ever again. Seeing employees playing as they work while others risk their hard worked money was the end of that. I already had enough with Chris being rude when you bother him because it seems that way. Good luck Shooters! This place has gone down hill since the past 6 months or so!!"

I know the current environment is a struggle and I'm pulling for small businesses and trying to support them in every way possible. That's why we came here.   After two hours at the establishment, a guy who identified himself as an employee who was there drinking  asked my friend to move from his chair to a bench because he was afraid the chair could break because, in his estimation, the $10 chair couldn't take his weight. After he'd been sitting there for two hours.   So. Completely.  Inappropriate.   I can't believe that this level of tone deaf insensitivity still exists today.   Needless to day I will never be"

I know my taste for beer and my expanded knowledge and things I have tried could never be the same without this place.  Great vibe, good pub grub, and an unbelievable and well priced beer selection are the highlights.  I still have my checklist from this place ten years later and miss it direly.  If you are anywhere nearby and you fancy yourself a beer connoisseur you owe it to yourself to stop in and try several beers you've never heard of.  Huge credit to staff for providing great recommendations when you aren't sure where to look or where to start."

                "description": "One of my favorite places in Austin. Their soups are great, pizza is the best, burgers are so good and if you can handle unorthodox nachos yummmm I love those too. Don't even get me started how awesome their breakfast is!!!! You get like 3 plates of food for maybe $8 and it's the best! I get their English scramble which is basically a scrambled omlet, patty sausage and biscuits with gravy, I've been eating this same breakfast for over 15 years and it's always just as good as the last.   So why 4 stars? The wait for the food. I worked here for 4 years a decade ago, back then it took 20-30 Min to get food but lately it's been taking closer to an hour.   Seems it's up for sale. I'm praying someone buys it and changes nothing but the kitchen equipment to speed up delivery. I'm just positive with a few changes in service this place will be back to packed. I worked Sundays back in the day, between 11-1 I had a steady stream of tables and would be running to get to everyone, these days we are one of only 3-5 tables. It breaks my heart as everything else beside the wait times here is truly THE BEST!!!!  Favorites: Gumbo, Chicken Chipotle Salad, Chicken Philly Cheesesteak, BBQ pizza, any personal pizza,  Broccoli Cheese Soup, veggie basket (fried veggies) and of course the breakfast!!"

This pub ticks off two of the must haves for a local bar:  Great beer selection and excellent, friendly people working there.  And it has great food on the menu to boot.  I stumbled on BB Rover's while waiting to meet someone for dinner.  I slipped in among what appeared to be regulars but didn't feel like and interloper at all.  Bartender who is attentive, unobtrusive and knows how to properly poor a Guinness?  Check.  Today's paper on the bar?  Check.  Sports on TV?  Spot on.  Oh, and they have Spaten Lager.  Ka.  Boom.    I saw a sign on the door the business is for sale.  Staff told me it is because the owners are ready to retire but they want the business to continue.  And the bartender says he would be willing to stay.  Keep the atmosphere, beer menu and your bartender, new owners, because it is a recipe for success."

However, if you are going to be stood up, then it might as well be at a place that has a decent reuben and stellar beer selection.  Quietly hidden on the backside of a plaze between the 183 N frontage road and Jollyville Rd, I would have never known this place existed. It very much has a that \"local dive bar\" feel, but the service was quick and courteous and though a bit on the greasy side (but not in an off-putting way) the food, especially for the price, was good. The reuben I got was tasty, the meat was not the best, but for $9 with a side of crispy fries, it was a steal.   The beer selection surprised me here. They have a huge bottle selection with a lot of the usual domestic and local suspects, but what impressed me was their draught offerings. Micro and craft brew offerings abounded and at very reasonable prices, even for the smaller pours.   All in all, glad I stopped in and discovered this place."

                "description": "This is a first rate neighborhood bar.  A long and fine selection of beers.  Good music. (They were playing old metal when I was there.)  A good kitchen. (More on food below).  A nice friendly family atmosphere.  A pool table if you want one ... the normal sports TV .. and there is live music on the right nights (or the wrong nights if you don't like that particular band).  I ordered a barbecue pizza - a local concoction with lots of kielbasa, bbq sauce and a bunch of other meats.  It took a while to come because it was being hand made - and it was not the normal time for pizza.  (The bartender - who was as nice as he could possibly be - suggested the daily special - which was already all made up and could have been in front of me in a nanosecond. The special probably would have been just fine.)  The pizza was an honest non-corporate pizza.   Very thick whole wheat crust with a lot of taste.  Tons and tons of meat.  I ordered the small and the thing was huge.  If you order the large, make sure that you have the Jolly Green Giant and King Kong with you to help you eat it.  The pizza was fine with beer ...  but the superthick honest crust had the side effect of drowning out a lot of the flavors of the toppings.  (there is a reason italians put super-seasoned ingredients like pepperoni, hot sausage and anchovies on pizza. they want the topping to win the battle with the crust.)  so if i ever went back and ordered pizza - i would probably order a model with stronger tasting ingredients.   but i left having drunk well,  having eaten a lot of real home-made food and was basically happy.  My normal preferred bar haunts are places with 48 esoteric rye whiskeys and places that make elaborate cocktails that were invented yesterday.  But for a neighborhood bar, I don't see how you are going to do better than B B Rovers.  So leave your hipster friends at some record launch east of Comal, get your high school friend who lives just west of Anderson Mill and take her to B B Rovers.   You will have a better time than you would have drinking lavender flavored tequila and listening to a rancid new EP."

If you still have room get real food.  Everything on the menu is amazing and worth the calories you'll have to work off the next week.  Pro tip - if getting wings, get them with sauce on the side so they stay crispy.  At least that's what we do!"

                "description": "So I walk into the location and it's freezing as i am informing them they seem not to care at all. I am 281lbs and i had to walk out from the bar area because it was way to cold. I walk out shivering! Not one person or staff member cared. They just stated you can just get on a waiting list. Which i did! But where is the common sense l? Its 80 outside and it feels like 67 inside???   Why is this the culture?  Customer: it's freezing in here Lakeline Pluckers: Well do you want to wait for 45mins to an hour?  How is this your business motto? No, ok paying patron we can take your concern seriously and see what can be done. It was so cold the servers glass started to fog up!! What type of weather manipulation is this?   Imagine a cold beer  and its under 66 degrees!! Un comfortable!   I swear if I stayed in that section long enough it would have start snowing. They dont even have to put ice in the drinks for crying out loud.   I also informed staff to address the situation or i will write a review in regards. Just acknowledge its over kill! They literally ignored me! So Pluckers you have two issues at this location the temperature and the fact your staff provides customer service but no customer concerns is a oxy moronic!   They way they duck my concerns rebranding should change name to Duckers!!  Any way wear a sweater, jacket and or bear skin if you going to the bar for wings. If you have any concerns they will kill you with kindness and ignore you with repetition as if you didnt hear them and also voice a concern. Based on my bites rating (check other post)   They get *2 bites and nibble!  Food Beetle"

Drinks, well I am pregnant so no drinks here for the time being but last time we ordered a michelada she was very confused and was trying to give us the drink with the chicken wing on top. so we had to describe it to her and show her a pic from previous orders in the past and explain multiple time we just wanted the plain michelada no need for the frills - IMO i think it is just the area we were in."

                "description": "Family has been coming to pluckers for a number of years now and we have never strayed from our order of spicy ranch wings- that's how much we love them. The spiciness of the wings vary a lot though, with sometimes being not spicy at all and others being a bit too spicy. But if you don't want to get too messy eating wings and want a good dry rub, then I highly recommend the spicy ranch. You can also never go wrong with their tater tots or Mac and cheese- tater tots are always fresh and crunchy and the Mac and cheese is nicely baked and cheesy.   Overall, service has always been pretty good and is a great place to come to if you're craving chicken wings and want to watch sports and drink at the same time!"

They advised me to cancel the order and replace it on the app. Unfortunately, I did not place the order via an app, and do not have an account, so I was unable to access the order after it was placed. When I called back to let them know was unable to cancel the order on my end, staff were still unable to help me modify my pickup time and said that since the order had not yet been received by their restaurant, the only thing she could do was wait until it came in and cancel the order at that time. She ended the conversation with: you'll get a notification in a few days on your account... (did not listen to the fact that I did not have an account!). Lo and behold, order was never cancelled and I am being charged nearly $50 for an order I never received. Its inexcusable. Staff need better customer service training. I am filing a dispute with my credit card."

                "description": "There's no doubt about it, Pluckers is my absolute favorite wing joint in the Austin area. Their wings are just the best and their different sauces always satisfy any craving I have - whether that be sweet, savory, spicy, or crying spicy (shout-out fire in the hole!) the wings are big and crunchy and they always have some good cold beer to pair them with! If you're a fan of Micheladas, you'll love them here too! Especially the pickled green beans they add!   Their rewards program is awesome if you're a frequent buyer. You pay $20 and earn 1 point per every $1 spent on food. Once you get to 100 points, you can redeem for $10 off your bill. They also have specials which you can get for free when buying two entrees so really, the membership pays for itself rather quickly!   There's room for improvement in the Service but other than that, I love some Pluckers!"

If you're cishet, this is the establishment for you. All others outside the norm avoid this location, it'll spare you a traumatic experience.

We waited for an entire hour before telling the waitress we were going to just leave, and of course, the food arrives at that exact moment. Fine we'll eat, even left a good tip. We box our leftovers and come home to weigh the thighs (we track calories and macros). Each thigh was between 3.5 and 4oz each, and we each received 4 thighs. That means we got 1lb each when we were charged for 2 each. I never received a refill on drinks, and it was all around a bad experience. I never leave reviews  but this was horrible. They also mess up curbside orders every single time I've ordered here."

Several months ago, just as COVID was starting to escalate, we sat in the bar area and I saw the waitress carry my glass by the top.  I complained.  Several times since, when we sat in the bar area the service was horrible. They took forever ttake and deliver our orders, messed up our orders etc...  We decided that the service in the bar area was so bad we didn't want to sit there again.   Tonight, I used the pluckers app to join the wait list. We waited for 10  or 12 minutes. Once we were there the text said we only had three minutes to checkin (way too short in my opinion).. You can wait longer than that in line.   When we got to the host stand they asked us if... we minded sitting in the bar!! ??  My wife, of course, said NO.   The hostess basically rolldd her eyes then told us that she could add us to the waitlist again... At the bottom! ... And it would be another 15 minutes!  We left.  We are now eating at Texas Roadhouse."

I have not been to Pluckers in a while and I guess they have changed a few things.  We didnt have a lot if time so we sat outside, it was covered. They had the plastic rolled down and heaters going so it wasn't bad. We were seated close to a heater then they asked us to move because we were too close to an exit? We didn't understand. Either way we were moved away from the heater and closer to other patrons.   We ordered wings, both grilled and fried.  The dry rubs aren't as good to me so I had grilled wings with the buffalo hot sauce.  The staff was just fine, did a good job of refilling drinks, checking in with us, etc.   What they brought out were chicken strips, not wings. I was a little disappointed in this, they were tough and stringy as well. Maybe it is due to Covid, I dont know but I had prepared for wings. Along with these being chicken strips and not wings there was a substandard amount of buffalo sauce on my order.  Overall it was ok, edible and met a basic human need of food but I will wait awhile before going back and check if they have wings or strips before I order."

Go into the bar area and get told we can't sit and have a beer on the table tops because those go through the host stand. Can't sit at the bar because we have a kid. Ask the manager if we can just sit and get a beer that we order from the bar while we wait for a table inside and get told no. I have never seen a place that doesn't let people sit at an empty table to order a drink while they wait in a half empty restaurant. We left...

Recent visit on 5/29 both adult \"10 wing combos\" came out with the wings over cooked   What this location consistently does is over fry the kids meal \"chicken bites\". They come out hard as a rock and you can't even cut them with a knife.   I really like pluckers but the lakeline location closest to my home has gotten to the point it's worth driving to another location or entirely different establishment.  On a trip to San Antonio recently, I stopped by the pluckers in selma the food was great and really highlighted how bad the lakeline location is in comparison. I guess they don't have to try anymore since there's typically a line out the door"

It's a complete mess. Stuff stacks up. Why or how Plucker's corporate hasn't fixed this location yet is mind boggling.   Total incompetence. Food is cold. Food takes forever. Servers ring up extra charges. They forget drinks and napkins, they sneakily upcharge you for 2 wing dipping sauces when 1 is not enough for 10 wings."

I've never purchased alcohol here before, but we were running critically low on supplies during the stay-at-home orders. A friend told me they had curbside at Total Wine and More. I called to confirm there was the ability to have contactless curbside pick up and the person I spoke with was very nice on the phone (even though I assume they are getting an annoying amount of calls during this time).   Placing my order online was extremely easy. The UI was intuitive and was not confusing at all. There were a few points where they reminded you not to pick up your order until you received an email (or text if you opt in) to pick up your order. I appreciated the multiple points of clarity.   Both times we have ordered (once on a Saturday and once on a Thursday), our order was ready within the hour!  Pick up was easy. All you have to do is pull up to the marked, designated spots and send a text to the number on the sign. You have to provide your spot number and name. Once they come out, just hold your ID up to the window. Then they will place your order in your trunk. Easy peasy!   Definitely give this place a try if you're looking for contactless curbside!"

I called the store and they said they would reattempt delivery that night with another driver. At 8pm I called again to reconfirm so I didn't have to come in -- and again, I'd get it if they had to cancel, but I just needed heads up.  Minutes before closing, I got an automated email that said it was canceled and there was no call or additional note. I'm very disappointed. I know that they use a delivery service like Uber so it's not all within their control, but what poor customer service to not explain the situation, or to personalize the situation in any particular way beyond a click/cancel. It's wine, so it's not the end of the world, but next time I'll just pop into an H-E-B."

                "description": "Great savings on alcohol. Probably the best I've seen. The staff were friendly and assisted me in getting the Hennessy from the the locked glass case. They even provided tasteful suggestions that proved their knowledge of the selection in store. And when I couldn't find the 90 minute IPA I was buying for a friend, they were there to guide me to it.  The check out was painless also as the cashier Susanna was very personable and talked to my wife and I the whole time. She even made me toddler smile and feel a part of the conversation. Great people in this location. Will be back when I'm in Austin."

Very friendly staff took me directly to the two areas I needed to visit to grab some of Mrs. Texas' favorites which will last her a year !!! It was funny as I was driving off, I told my son, I guess liquor stores are essential during this time of uncertainty."

                "description": "I was a huge Total Wine fan when I lived in NJ.  I drove an hour + to stock up.  When they opened the Austin store a day before my birthday I was thrilled.   Still the same HUGE selection.  Still Conte Priola Pinot Grigio.  Sadly no Kitchen Sink red blend, but HEB carries it here.  Still fun tastings on the weekends.    Annoying cashier girl who awkwardly scans bottles in my cart despite me wanting to put them on the checkout conveyor thingie.    Overall a 4-5 star experience every time.  But yesterday we had a 10 star experience.  OMGoodness, you just have to find Stephen in the wine area.  He'll ask a few questions and recommend wines based on your tastes.  You will love each of his suggestions.  You will love his stories.  This sparkling wine was named after the granddaughter of the vineyard owner....  yes please.    Best liquor store ever."

                "description": "I love Total Wine. When ever I go on a road trip, as was the case with this visit, I stop in and stock up! There was plenty of hand sanitizer available at the entrance. There was a tasting station near the entrance with a nice lady offering samples of Mezcal from behind a plexiglass. We were warmly greeted by every employee we passed and offered assistance. The employees are very knowledgeable about their wines, I just told them the taste I was looking for and they led me right over to the options that matched. There's also a large refrigerated beef room in the back. Checkout was a breeze and our associate was engaging and sweet."

                "description": "This store is always well stocked, clean and the staff is very helpful and courteous.  I was particularly impressed with the way they handled the  COVID mandates;  A sign was on the front door noting masks must be worn, ample hand sanitizers and wipes were readily at the entrance, and the carts are always clean.  From the very beginning of the pandemic, I was always comfortable shopping at Total Wine.  The store is arranged in such a way that although busy, there was plenty of room to social distance, including at check-out."

Tim had several wines and spirits prepped for us to try. He gave us great info on every drink we tried and helped us build a menu that meets our needs, personality, and budget! Tim and Total Wine exceeded our expectations for sure."

The samples are always plentiful and varied.  They have great deals and a huge wide varied selection as well as some high class expensive liquors for refined tastes. They also stock a ungodly amount of small sample, airplane sized bottles of liquor of famous and lesser known types.  They always have several check outside running and lots of neat extra items like gift sets, hangover cures, bottle openers, margarita machines and stuff to create your own bar.   For the holidays they have some unique items such as the moose cup from National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.  Check it out. I promise you will find new and known drinks and much more besides."

                "description": "We just purchased a Keurig Drinkworks Machine.  You put a pod filled with mixer and alcohol and you can have mixed drinks anytime you want.  The problem is living in Texas you cannot buy the pods online from Keurig.  The only stores that carry them in Texas are Total Wine in Houston and Specs in Houston.  I called Specs and the person I talked to was friendly, she knew what I was talking about and said she would look into the distributor and how they could get them in Austin.  I called Total Wine and had to talk to 4 different people, none of whom seemed interested in doing what Specs offered to do.  We place monthly orders with Total Wine for wine and spend a significant amount of money.  Guess we will move our wine purchasing to Specs :("

                "description": "A shout-out to my friends for inviting me to this. I think they were trying to prove me wrong. Here's what I mean: I'm a wine drinker - a dry, red wine drinker. On occasion, I'll sip an appletini or two. During game night, we were talking about one of our favorite subjects, liquor, and I mentioned not liking cognac. Well, my girl, Nickie, told me I've got it wrong and not to knock it until I've tried it again at this event- hence an invitation to a Hennessy tasting event at Total Wine. Talk about a lovely time! They served food (thank goodness), Hennessy (oh, yeah!), and even gave us recipe cards to try at home - oh, and did I mention the stainless steel martini-shaker? I learned a lot about the origins of this drink and how it's made. It was quite interesting. Everyone was having a good time, and the samples were very yummy. Real yummy! I'm a convert and hate to admit it. I hope my friends don't read this review!"

The employees act like they will run over you so you have to walk defensively. Seriously, it is like customers are invisible and they are running a warehouse because even when they cut you off, and they will, they don't say excuse me. If you are lucky enough to find what you are looking for you will get a great value but then you schlep to the checkout lane and that is hit or miss as well. Well, mostly miss in my experience. Good luck!"

She then called over a manager (called her Julie, but her name tag said Megan).  The manager said we had to mail in the coupon and absolutely refused to help us any further.  She even pointed to the address on the coupon and walked off like we were illiterate.  But the coupon states it's for the retailer, not the consumer.  If your employees can't even be bothered to care, then I'd rather support a local shop, like Twin Liquors."
