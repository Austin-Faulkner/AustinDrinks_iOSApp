The comedian they brought in tried to pass off self- loathing, sexually disgusting monolog as comedic humor. Someone please tell him he's not funny in the slightest. The staff are not at all personable. This place doesn't even rise to the dive bar level.  Pop a Natural Light at home and you'll have a better time."

My only issue is their recent partnership with Forrest Rogness to brew beer. Not only has he failed in the past, he is a disgusting human being.   Come for the spirits, cocktails, and atmosphere. Avoid the beer.   Love this place!!!!!"

                "description": "Wanted to try something new yesterday and decided to give this place a shot. We drove up to a small manufactured building and the end of a street  with some questionable establishments nearby.  Just inside of the building is a simple bar and small seating area. The employees are friendly and offer us tastings. We try each of their three offerings: silver rum, Pecan Street Rum, and their whiskey. I can't say I have discerning taste when it comes to rum or whiskey but I enjoyed them.  We ordered three cocktails from their menu (drinks are $6 each or 3 for $15) and took them to their back seating area. It was very no frills and reminiscent of a garage or basement man cave, with old leather sofas and a dart board. The drinks were all really tasty and could definitely be dangerous. We saw that they included generous pours for the liquor yet we could barely taste the alcohol.  We only remained at the distillery for about a half hour because there wasn't much else to do there. No food and no outdoor seating.  Not a bad place to go if you want to grab a couple of drinks and patronize a local distillery but if they'd like to keep customers there longer, the owners will have to invest in helping create more of an experience."

We got to sample a silver rum, pecan street rum and whisky: all were delicious.   Not much to say about this place as we were only a guest of theirs for 30 minutes, didn't feel like a place we could spend a afternoon.  Worth checking out if in the area but wouldn't drive an hour to get there.   5 stars on the quality of the drinks and friendly staff, loosing one star for the man cave feel. We would go back if in the area."

Michael was very helpful and informative on the phone, as well as at the distillery. Bought the Pecan Rum and Single Malt Whiskey. The rum was made into a American Dreamsicle, a recipe on the website with additional tips from Michael onsite. Excellent. Looking forward to enjoying the whiskey. Great service, great product"

                "description": "Spirit of Texas Distillery in Pflugerville, Tx My wife had a \"Bold Fashioned\" 2 star out of 5 It needs something creamy or sweet to bring it together. It completely burries the whiskey. However, the coffee flavor is out of nowhere and sticks out like a soar thumb.  I had the Spirit of Texas Pfluger Single Malt Whiskey  3 star out of 5 stars Had it neat, they don't serve it in a  Glencairn so if you're a noser, bring your own. It's a much better mixer whiskey than it is neat in my opinion. However, I did get about a 3oz pour so... Booya! (The picture is after I drank about 3/4's of it, lol)  Also tried their \"famous\" Pecan street rum, not a big fan of rum but this was actually decent. Given the choice I wouldn't buy it for myself but I would drink it if offered.  The distillery itself was tiny with not many places to sit. Even their tasting room was mostly a few couches with only a few tables. With that said, it was quite cute and had quazi sports bar vibe.   The staff was friendly and very happy to let us sample and make suggestions based on our tastes.   Overall, I'd come back."

                "description": "Honestly, I'm disappointed in this place. My hubs and I went for the first time here to see a comedy tour which the distillery hosted. The place itself is very small and decent enough- definitely no frills of any kind. They were hosting the comedy tour which was being held outside in their backyard space but they didn't have any of the tables and chairs set up for the patrons. Ppl were grabbing the picnic tables and moving them over to the stage...like shouldn't mngmt have done that ahead of time?? As far as their whiskey and rum, we did not care for it at all. After the reviews, I guess I just expected more. We kept trying it in different types of drinks and it just tasted like cheap stuff. Not to mention their prices! We had exactly 6 mixed drinks. Our tab was $70 before tip. That's $11.50 a drink! Y'all, this place is backwoods Pfluggerville not the dang Domain! I pay $11-$13 for my drinks at the Domain. So, $11.50 for this place was ridiculous. We will definitely not be back. And if you see an advertisement for the comedy tour- skip it. The first comedian was not very good (he had a whole table walk out and leave during his performance. Ouch.), the 2nd was decent but not in any way worth a $70 bar tab."

When we were walking up the steps we noticed that there was an open sign lite up and when we walked in the bar tender said they have to close for an hour because he is the only one there and needs to help the band setup..... sounds like poor planning on the managements side. He said someone keeps changing their hours on Yelp but not sure about that hmm. Anyways he invited us back to see the show at 7 as they open back up for that, but was looking to have a drink and not be drowned out by a loud band. Maybe we will try your place again some time ....."

My wife's uncle dropped a bottle of single-malt whiskey on my counter and I decided to pour a neat glass after I poured 3 others for my guests. I really let this whiskey sit on the back of my tongue and savored the flavor. This is hands down the best whiskey I have ever had. I am more of a blended whiskey guy but the sweetness of this whiskey is absolutely perfect. I have my mixing whiskey, but this is definitely my sipping whiskey. There is definitely a strong vanilla taste going on with chocolate, but finishes hard with a good wood. Since having it, I am trying to find a way to get in there and pay my respects, but his review will have to do for now."

Grab an inside picnic table and enjoy the fresh air coming in through the open garage-style door. There is a oversized Connect Four game and cornhole for the kids to play. Plenty of fans mean the inside stays cool.   We tried the watermelon cucumber vodka drink, which was tasty. We also tried a classic cheese pizza and a pesto-sausage-olive pizza. Both were good, but could have used a little kick of flavor -- spice? Seasoning? Next time I would love to try the deep dish. Leave 30-45 mins for bake time."

My favorite was the mambo Italiano pizza with garlic white sauce instead of pesto. Oh And if you squeeze some lime into the cherry daiquiris it tastes like a cherry limeade, I am hooked. So delicious!"

I had found them via some post on Instagram.  I am very happy we were able to spend time with them.  Anthony gave us the tour but Logan was there as well.  They give you a taste of both of their products while explaining their history and their process.  They have grand ideas on how to move forward as well.  Both men have full time day jobs.  They have done everything for this company.  Including building the building you are standing in.  Extremely interesting.  We have gone to a few distilleries and the tours can be a tad repetitive but this one was very enjoyable.  We are grateful they took the time to give us a tour.  Every minute they are with you they are not working on their business.  I wish them nothing but success. Worth your time if you are in the area and can get an appointment."

We were staying in the adorable town of Wimberley so I researched tours in the area.  Jodie's Taste of the Hills Tour got great reviews and went to wineries close to the Wimberley area. The day of the tour ended up being chilly and rainy. As soon as Jodie pulled up with her spectacular shuttle-like van she was out like a flash with pretty umbrellas for us! We went to 3 different wineries which we thoroughly enjoyed! After the first one, we returned to Jodie's vehicle and she had a gorgeous tray for us of cheese,  sausage,  crackers,  grapes,  olives, dips.....simply divine!!! The tour was also just the 2 of us and we loved that Jodie still did ALL of this for a tour that I believe takes up to 12 people! The next time we plan a trip to the Hill Country we are going to do one of Jodie's Beer tours!! We had such great conversations with Jodie too! Thank you sooooo much for the GREAT time! Sooooo much fun!"

Jodie made us all feel like we were old friends, even though we had never met anyone else on the bus.  She was very detailed with the stories of each winery, and explained all the different varietals, answering our every question along the way. The bus was very comfortable and clean, and she stored each bottle we purchased until the trip was over, but we could have had the bottles on the bus had we chosen to.  The wineries all seemed to know her, so they were expecting us and were incredibly friendly. We were not rushed anywhere, and still managed to make it back into town to enjoy shopping on the square.  My wife and I were pretty hungry by the time we had lunch, since we didn't have breakfast, but the tapas style lunch was perfect for the glass of wine we purchased to have with it. The lunch was delicious and filling.  Overall this was an amazing experience and I will be recommending this tour to everyone I know."

We were fortunate enough to have great people touring with us, and it made the tour all the more fun.  She prepared the best picnic lunch I've ever had.  Sugar Shack cake balls, meats, cheeses, crackers, hummus, a goat cheese something served on crackers (that I LOVED, and I hate goat cheese), spinach feta rolls, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something.  She was fully prepared for everything.  Boxes for the wine we bought, umbrellas in case in rained (it didn't), plenty of water...this wine tour couldn't have been more perfect if she tried.

It really was an amazing evening largely due to Jodie and the exceptional service she provides! If you are looking for a fantastic wine tour, get in touch with Jodie and she will ensure that happens."

                "description": "Ahhhh! So very relaxing! Jodie Meyer knew all the tourists' names and made sure we got to know each other. She provided an excellent variety of foods including a hot portion and gluten-free (just in time `cause I was lit after the 1st vineyard). The three vineyards for that day were selected based on the wine preferences of the tourists that day (A+ perk). We never felt pushed or obligated to buy wines, but we all did because they were very good (!), and Jodie kept our purchases organized and stored for us. She also gave a good background on each vineyard and on the Wimberley area in general. We learned a lot about Wimberley and wine and were able to get tipsy knowing Jodie was an excellent driver of her comfy bus. And have you been to Wimberley? That hilly countryside is beautiful!"

Our tour was originally scheduled for 10:30a, but got pushed back to 1:15p due to shuttle trouble (we had the option to receive our money back, but actually liked the later time).  We stopped at three wineries, including Driftwood Estate and Duchman Family Winery.  The views at all of the wineries varied, but each were unique to their locations.  Jodie provided an amazing picnic-style lunch, including a charcuterie (meat and cheese) board, chicken salad, nuts, walnut and feta salad, grapes, chocolate cake balls, bottled water, etc. At the second stop, Jodie was kind enough to call in people's orders to Salt Lick BBQ and had it all ready to take home by the third stop.  We can't wait to return again!"

She gave us a lot of background information on the wineries as well as the town of Wimberley. She had a delicious assortment of snacks for us to munch on while we rode to and from each winery. She helped package our wine purchases and brought us umbrellas as it started to rain. She even went the extra mile, literally, and drove us back to our hotel since it was raining as we had walked to our meeting spot earlier in the day. We had another couple on the tour with us which was really nice since we had people to mingle with. It was a very personal experience and I felt as though we were all just great friends spending an afternoon together. Who needs Napa, everything is better in Texas!!! We will definitely be repeat customers."

The stereo system was bumping, and Daniel, our amazing driver, had no issue with us turning it up to 11.  Our group was most guys in their 30's and Daniel gave us good recommendations on spots to check out that were age appropriate.  In between spots, Daniel drove me to a gas station to help me restock on beer. He even came in and helped me carry and load beers into the coolers.  Great communicate from Daniel from beginning to end, and he someone found the perfect spot to pick us up on busy Rainey St at the end of the night.   Great value and great experience.  Highly recommend."

He would check in on us during the winery to see if we needed anything or have any questions, and he would offer to help us take multiple pictures. He also got one of the wineries to allow us to explore their cellars!   On our last day in Austin, he drove by our airbnb to pick up someone else and honked at us as we waited for our uber.

                "description": "Y'all BOOK WITH THEM!!!!! I literally do not have one negative thing to say about this company. From the minute I called to book to the minute I said goodbye to our driver the day of the tour they were fantastic.   So when I called there actually weren't any times available. They worked with me to make sure they had a tour time and sprinter available for our group of 6. I had a million questions; they were patient and kind.   Our group was 6 but one of my friends asked if we could add an additional person. Reached out to TTT and they said sure no problem. Literally 3 HOURS LATER I got a call that another girl tested positive with covid and wouldn't be able to come with us obviously- they were so nice and made the switch back to 6. Very grateful for their exceptional customer service.   Day of our driver Bryant was early which was great! Got on the bus and let us have free range of the radio, answered any wine questions we had or any questions about Fredericksburg. He was a fantastic host. Always texted 15 minutes till our time at the winery was up and took as many pictures as we wanted. He was so sweet! He also made sure we were never thirsty or hungry. Which for a group of girls is very important- smart man! Haha   I've heard things about other companies having hidden fees and people getting charges after leaving Fredericksburg and we had none of that. Texas Tipsy Tours was very transparent with all of their pricing and they had no hidden fees.   Thank you TTT for making our trip perfect. You won't regret booking with them."

                "description": "My experience with Texas Tipsy tours was nothing short of perfect!!! From pickup to drop-off, Courtney (the owner) made our experience amazing! When I initially started inquiring about a tour a few months ago, many of the companies only offered private tours for a minimum of 4 people. However, Texas Tipsy Tours offers small group private tours (i.e. 2-3 people). This was perfect for me. She also made planning our trip so easy, and she promptly answered all of the questions I had.   On the day of the tour, she picked us up from our hotel in Austin in an Infiniti SUV (it was very clean too)! She even made a pit stop for me at a CVS on the way to our first winery. Throughout the 6 hour tour, she made sure we stayed on schedule. She even let us change a stop last minute because we wanted to check out a brewery!  One thing that was amazing was the comfort she provided! She allowed us to pick the music, provided phone chargers, and let us control the AC! She even opened our doors for us AND dropped us off/picked us up right in front of each place we went!  Overall, I highly recommend Texas Tipsy Tours, and I will definitely be back!"

We chose the half day option and were picked up right at our vacation rental (Farmhouse on Elder Hill) We wanted to just stay nearby so we visited Driftwood Estate Winery and Fall Creek.  We were planning to also see Vista Brewing (all in Driftwood), but we chatted and laughed so much that we ran out of time and Eric, driver/owner was flexible with our change of plans and let us just extend our time enjoying the fabulous view at Driftwood Estate.  The tour service was absolutely awesome and professional.  Everything done with excellence.  Thank you Courtney and Eric!"

I have taken quite a few van tours around the hill country and Texas Tipsy Tours sets themselves apart by not just being drivers but they truly host you the entire day. I will ALWAYS use this company going forward. We did a private charter from Driftwood to Austin, TX and back and Keaton our driver was a delight. He made sure we were picked up on time and each of our stops were easy and flexible. We did a mixed tour around Driftwood and Dripping springs the next day and our guide Eric executed the BEST DAY for us. He even picked up on what we were liking and recommended a change to our final stop to Vista Brewing and we were SO glad he did. At each stop he made sure we had plenty of water, snacks and chairs to enjoy the gorgeous venues. This is totally above and beyond what we would have expected from a driver. Courtney was so easy to work with and she helped make recommendations for our group ultimately making our weekend get away FLAWLESS. I promise if you don't use this company, you're wrong."

It was as easy as getting on the phone, explaining what I wanted, and Courtney took care of literally everything else. We picked the breweries we wanted and even included a food stop. She coordinated the bus pick up, drop offs, schedule, and even reserved tables for us at each stop. I love that we had our own bus (very nice one, by the way!), and had the flexibility to create our own tour based on beers and food my husband liked. It was the perfect Saturday in Austin! Payment was very easy as well - they sent me an invoice to my email and I was able to pay directly online for everything. Highly recommend, and thank you Texas Tipsy Tours!"

Courtney and Eric are just the sweetest people! Would highly recommend if you're looking for a relaxed tasting without the hubbub of big party buses, AND if you're looking for a more personalized experience with people who can really throw a party. Fredericksburg can be confusing because of the many, many options, so Courtney's expertise in the wineries proved incredibly helpful. Highly recommend!!"

What a surprise when he told us!  Didn't see that coming.  Three great tastings with good friends.  Discovered some very nice 2015 Texas wines.  The grapes have matured immensely since 2008 and glad to finally enjoy some good Texas wines.   Can't recommend this company any lower than *****!

I don't know if the business has just gotten bigger than the owners can handle but communication was subpar. It took several calls and emails to get answers sometimes.   At our first tour, Kathie took tons of photos and would pose us at the wineries. This tour, we had to prompt her. It was a cloudy day so not the best for outdoor pics but I was disappointed we took most of them ourselves or had to ask her to take the pictures.   Our tour was April 11, it is now almost 2 mths later I haven't received the few pictures we took. I emailed twice and have finally heard back that the SD is apparently not working. I'm not sure why I had to email to find this out, seems like this info should have been divulged as soon as the problem presented itself.   I hate to downgrade the star review but my second time with this company just wasn't as epic as the initial tour I took with them. The wineries all seem to love this company though."

DTWT was very accommodating, scheduled the wineries we wanted to see, ordered the lunches, and then confirmed our selections a couple of days prior to our tour. At the last minute after visiting with a couple in our third stop, we changed our fourth stop to a different winery. Jason (our driver) was happy to accomodate us. My only regret is that we didn't choose a few wineries a little further out of town, so we could spend more time in the limo listening to our Willie Nelson songs. Jason was awesome, and I highly recommend this tour."

                "description": "We started researching half-day wine tours for my BFF's bachelorette party several months in advance and chose this company because of its good reviews and cancellation policy (full refund up to 7 days in advance).   First, the bad news. The booking process is way more arduous than it should be. My initial discussion about the tour plans happened over the phone, so I asked for a written, e-mail confirmation of what we had discussed - specifically how the deposit and refund policies work. It took me more than three weeks to get that first e-mail confirmation of our booking and deposit payment. I then went back and forth, back and forth, back and forth with the company, hammering out the details, like setting a pickup location and our choices for the winery stops. Many times, three weeks would pass and I'd have to make multiple attempts before I would get a response to my e-mails. Sometimes, the responses would be incomplete and we'd repeat the process of trying to get information confirmed. Seriously a pain for an experience that costs $129 per person.   Now, the good news. The online payment portal for each attendee was a breeze to use and eliminated the need to handle money all through one person. As for the actual tour itself, we couldn't have asked for a better experience. Our driver, Bobby, was on time and wonderful on the day of the tour. He was funny and polite and had good knowledge of the area. Also, very importantly, he was a good and safe driver! The Mercedes bus we took was very clean and spacious, and they provided water, cups and napkins. They also allowed us to bring our own food onto the bus. The three wineries we visited, Driftwood Estate, Duchman and Fall Creek, were all accommodating and fun. The views were lovely and we never felt rushed and made it back on time. It was raining when we got back to our car, and Bobby was so nice and helped us get our stuff back into our car in the pouring rain.   All in all, despite a wonderful wine tour, I'm not sure I would recommend this company, only because I spent way too much time hounding them throughout the booking process. While the wine was excellent, I NEEDED to drink after dealing with their horrible communication. Discover Texas Wines should strongly consider re-evaluating their communication practices and hire more people to keep up with the demand for their service. It's the only way they will stay competitive in the long-run!"

I made the reservation back in January, gave my card for deposit and was told I'd be emailed a link for everyone to pay. Over the next two months I called and emailed asking about the link so my friends could pay their part and I was repeatedly told they were having issues. Okay fine, no big deal- I also emailed again saying we can just pay the day of if the link wasnt working and never received a response. The day before our tour, as I was driving from Dallas to Fredericksburg I get a call from Some guy at the company and he seemed very annoyed with me saying no one had paid yet. Um.. I'm sorry I didn't realize you finally sent it after months of my asking. (He had sent it the day before calling me to tell me no one had paid) The vehicle I requested was not the one that showed up. The driver Julia was late bc she did not write the address down correctly. We also had 3 girls cancel last minute, so we were down to 5 instead of 8. Considering there minimum is 5 I wasn't expecting that to be a problem but Julia felt the need to bring it up multiple Times as if it caused some inconvenience for her. Rude people, horrible communication."

Roy was a true gentleman and really took good care of our group all day long, making this a truly great experience. Noel was very helpful in booking us, even with a last minute addition to our party. I will be using these guys again in the future, and would recommend anyone who is looking for a first time trip to do the same."

                "description": "What a fantastic time! Organizing a full day wine tour for 50 people in the Texas Hill Country may not sound like an easy task, but Noel at Discover Texas Wine Tours made it smooth and most importantly, unforgettable. His main goal is to make sure everyone is comfortable and has a good time! Most companies were not able to host a group this size, but Noel made it happen. He made sure our bus was the best he could find, worked to have a lunch catered for us at one of the stops, set up private tastings with many of the wineries to accommodate a group our size, even stopped to let one of the guys who didn't drink wine buy some beer. I can't say enough good things about Noel and how hard he worked for our group. I highly recommend him and look forward to another tour with him soon!!"

Throwing a surprise weekend is stressful enough but Woody was SUPER accommodating especially for being so last minute.  There were many tours that I could've chosen to stick with but Woody was so authentic about his services and was a person of integrity when it came to what he offered.  He personally picked us up from our little hotel we were staying at and drove us to all three of our tours. His tour bus was super clean and we all had a blast! He even offered to pick up some cheese and snacks at the HEB close by to have on the bus if we wanted! I really appreciated Woody taking the time to answer my numerous phone calls with questions I had as this is my first Bachelorette party I threw.  I HIGHLY recommend using Woody if anyone wants to have a great time and looking for someone to trust. I will be booking with you again Woody, thank you so much for everything!"

If you come across Fredericksburg Uncorked Wine Tours, stop your search and make the booking.   Organizing a wine tour for 18 girls as part of a bachelorette party was a breeze with Woody, the owner/operator of Uncorked. He gave great advice, offered competitive pricing (especially for the expectant mothers/non-drinkers in our group), and was easy to communicate with. Woody was incredibly patient during the lead up to our tour, and then was a funny, gracious, and attentive guide during our wine tasting experience.   Our tour was fantastic from start to finish, and I can't recommend Woody and the rest of the Fredericksburg Uncorked team highly enough. All (18) of us had the greatest time!"

I honestly called three or 4 more tours throughout the week and left messages and he is the only one that called me back. Not only did woody come through, he came through at the last minute when I thought We weren't going to make a tour.  He was funny , knowledgeable and overall a great guide. He even recommended a few things that weren't apart of the tour (Alamo Springs Cafe) which we ended up going to and was delicious.  Lunch was not included but the place we went to was pretty great for a sandwich . I'd hang out and grab a beer with woody any night !  Thank you for making my boyfriends birthday a good one !!"

I was upset and apparently he was too so he threw customer service out the window. I never agreed to Woody keeping my credit card information on file after he charged the wine tour for 11 girls (almost $1,300).   The driver Tommy was nice but he did nothing special and didn't know the basics of Woody's business. Had he known even a little bit about Uncorked Tours, there wouldn't have been confusion about lunch.   As far as the wine tour: William Chris and Lost Draw were my favorite wineries. Hye Market pretended we weren't there half of the time. Pontotoc was greedy with their pours.   Woody was very unprofessional and difficult to work with at the end. I would not recommend him. Book early to get the highest rated wine tours (2-3 months prior)!"

Sam, the owner and driver, was unbelievable. Very accommodating, great driver, and super chill.   We planned to hit up the Salt Lick on the party bus and then venture around to some breweries afterwards. Sam made sure that the group got where we needed to be on time, had great suggestions for breweries, and made sure we were having as much fun as possible.  The bus is great. Fit everyone comfortably with enough room for a cooler in between all of us. Sam had her playlist turned up or she would hand over the AUX cord and we could play our tracks as loud as we wanted. The whole experience was incredibly laid back and worry free. I would absolutely recommend Cool bus ATX to anyone that wants to have a great time with a big group in Austin.   On a side note, if it is Sunday, make sure that you buy beer on Saturday because they don't sell it on Sunday before noon.   Thanks again, Sam!"

As a bachelorette \"day party,\" we gathered together and hopped in the super roomy and comfortable All About Central Texas SUV and headed out on our journey.   Kim is extremely knowledgeable about each winery; the history, the best wines to try, the \"wine club\" or other bonus things each winery has.   We stopped in on 3 different wineries and Kim had made superb choices in each spot; from the wines to the view to the suggestions on what to try and how to make the most of our samples so everyone could try as many as possible (thanks for that tip, Kim!).   Be it an afternoon with a group of friends, or a romantic day for two, All About Central Texas is an outstanding choice.  Thanks for everything, Kim!"

I did the Fredericksburg tour and based on my wine preferences she had some great suggestions on which ones to stop in, there are so many! I even joined a wine club, the tastings were informative and she is just a lot of fun and I didn't have to worry about driving or directions and could enjoy the pours and some snacks.  I highly recommend All abt Central Texas tours, they are personable, you can really get to meet the others in these small groups- Thanks so much!"

                "description": "I rented a party bus through this company a couple weeks ago. In the beginning, Robert was extremely accommodating and friendly. And our driver, Terrell, was great. We got dropped off at COTA for a show and had a great time!  But where it turned south was at the end of the night. I texted our driver 30 minutes before we needed to be picked up (like he requested) and he said no problem. Then we left the concert and were walking to the pickup spot where I gave him a call. He said he got in an accident but would only be 20 minutes and I said that's fine. 20 minutes roll by and I gave him a call again, no answer, but texted and said it would be another 20 minutes. We ended up waiting in the cold for almost an hour and well after most people had left COTA. Multiple people in our party ended up just taking ubers because they didn't want to wait. The whole point of a bus is so you don't have to wait.  The next day, I texted Robert saying we would like a refund for the extra hour we paid for waiting that we wouldn't have used if we had been picked up on time. He said he would call to discuss but never did. I've now sent him multiple emails - mind you, being incredibly nice about it. All I asked for was an hour refunded back - not the whole thing, not even half. But still no response.  The customer service level of this company is terrible should anything go wrong. So hire them at your own risk."

                "description": "Apologies for this review being so incredibly late but Austin Nites was the best! We had rented a party bus on pretty short notice to take a Bachelor Party to and from Lake Travis and Robert and team were amazing.   It was also Prom weekend so the schedule was packed for them but they still took care of us and worked with our schedule.   Our boat ended up staying out on the water longer than scheduled which through our plans all over the place and Robert was there waiting on time. Given his packed schedule, the driver did have to leave without us but Robert made sure to get me in contact with another service and they sent a bus over right away.   All in all, it was an incredible experience!"

Missing panels inside of bus missing or duct tape together.  Another party bus parked next to the one we had and it was so obvious how terrible looking our bus looked.   Can't believe owners would let this bus represent their company. Hope they use our $700 toward getting it fixed.   Driver was pleasant."

                "description": "I'm incredibly frustrated with this business.  We had spoken a couple times in the months before I decided to book and I initially felt great about potentially booking with these friendly people.  When it came time to book I called them and was told, once again, that our requested date was open and we talked out an agreement.  The owner tells me we're good to go, and that all he needed me to do now was to send him my information so that he could get a contract sent that same day.  I'd explained to him that I was booking this bus ride to and from a party boat, and that I would be booking with them that day as well.   SO, I get off the phone and send my info.  I call my party boat folks to let them know I've just confirmed my bus, and I'm ready for a boat.  I book with them based on my discussion with these guys and put down $400 to hold our reservation.  It's been two weeks since I last spoke with this company and they have ignored my calls, texts, voicemails trying to figure out why the contract hasn't come through.  Our event is next month, and at this point I've been researching new solutions, and unfortunately the new solution means I can't use the same boat company, and therefore I've lost my $400 deposit.  I did not have this money to lose, but after being ghosted by this company I guess I have to take the loss and move on.  They seem like nice people, and it takes A LOT to get on here and write a negative review, but this has caused me a lot of stress and I want to prevent this from happening to anyone else.  I hope at some point I find out a reasonable explanation and can revise this review, but not counting on it.  We'll see I guess."

But how is that supposed to work when you have a huge group? I called austin nites party rentals for a few reasons 1. I love puns and 2. I'm am austinite and 3. My group was over ten people and we wanted to go out and have nothing to worry about. Great party bus, great personable driver, great experience definitely reccomend these guys!! DONT DRINK AND DRIVE!! Call someone you can trust call Austin Nites!!"

                "description": "BOOK WITH THIS COMPANY!  Robert did a solid job taking me and a bunch of my friends to Lake Travis and back on July 4th. His price was WAY lower than other companies I called, being the ONLY one that actually sticked to his regular prices during this busy day. He arrived early and was 100% responsive to my emails and phone calls. He arrive early to pick us up and was extremely friendly and professional. He helped us carry our coolers and accommodate everything on the bus.  The bus itself is amazing. Seats are stacked in two rows facing each other, which is great for dancing and socializing, since you are actually facing half of the crowd. The sound system is also very good. I almost feel that the bus trip was even more fun that the boat.   In summary, Austin Nites Ent. is the best on price/quality, Robert and his wife are responsive, professional and friendly, and the whole experience I had with them is positive. Would highly recommend anyone to use it, and will definitely consider using them again if I ever need to.  Thank you guys!!!!!"

                "description": "We rented a party bus from Robert for my brother's 30th birthday. They were one of the only companies I found that didn't increase their rates because of prom season. I called about 10 other companies looking for fun and safe travels with almost all of them being ridiculously overpriced to take advantage of the prom goers. Robert was very accommodating, professional, and had awesome rates. He called two days before the scheduled time of arrival to check in and verify everything was still good to go. He asked if there were any changes in the amount of people and offered a bigger bus just in case. Our drivers, Patrick and Joe were awesome! Patrick called me early the day of to verify everything and let me know he'd be there at 8 and then called again when they were almost to our pickup location. They arrived right on time with an awesome bus just for us. He had coolers with ice, a flat screen tv, music system, AC and even a bathroom in the back. What more could you ask for? Part of the evening was spent at Graham's Central Station in Pville. We didn't realize prior that Graham's doesn't serve food anymore and had to order pizza to the bus. Patrick gladly retrieved our pizza and brought it to us when it arrived. We all had a blast, felt safe and were taken care of. Highly recommend Austin NItes and shout out to Patty PartyWagon, if you had a Yelp page, I'd write a review for you too."

We enjoyed his friendly banter, nice and clean van, and all of the places we went. Will definitely book with David again."

                "description": "Do NOT recommend! We booked a tour for 8 people and everything was a mess from the beginning. We were told we would be upgraded to a 15 passenger bus. A 15 passenger VAN showed up with a dent in the side and ripped seats. We were told we could bring coolers. We were only able to fit 8 adults in the van with our two coolers- no way we could've had another person in the van. None of the wineries had been scheduled yet and the ONE we had specifically requested was not available. We had to scramble ourselves to find wineries, in which we were promised everything would be done ahead of time. The meat and cheese tray that was promised was a small tray that was bought during the tour at a convenient store to feed 2 people. Our driver was great, however the owner did not deliver what was promised and we were highly disappointed. There are plenty of companies to choose from, and I would NOT recommend Open Range."

We've used him so much, that we will never use another company when we're in the region. You can't do any better than Open Range, trust me."

                "description": "\"Double Pimp D\" aka David was absolutely phenomenal.  We had a group of 13 in San Antonio go wine tasting in fberg for the day.  He picked us up from San Antonio, drove us up to Hill Country and around to 3 wineries.  As this was my first Texas wine tour, he did an AMAZING job of helping us select which wineries would be a good fit for the group.  As we had a decent amount of guys with us- he suggest Garrison Brother's Distillery which ended up being a HUGE hit!  He was extremely professional, courteous and just an absolute delight to spend the day with!  He also has a wicked funny sense of humor.  He was also very accommodating and ordered and picked up lunch for us so we could continue to enjoy beautiful Hill Country.  I would use him again in heartbeat and highly, highly recommend him to anyone wanting to enjoy Texas Hill Country!  Thanks David!"

D'Ann was extremely responsive and gave me several suggestions of where to go. Since I'm a wine club member at quite a few wineries in the Hill Country, I opted to do a custom tour and made my own reservations. Greg, the owner (and D'Ann's husband) arrived on time and drove us to 3 wineries where we were able to enjoy a nice, relaxing afternoon. Greg was so friendly, helpful and accommodating. I would highly recommend Open Range Tours...thanks, D'Ann and Greg!!!"

They know a lot about the wineries and have personal relationships with the owners/managers/tasting staff.

                "description": "We went to Fredericksburg for a girls trip and wanted to spend a day at the distilleries and breweries. David was fantastic to work with planning everything out. I wouldn't have changed any of that part. But, once the day rolled around we were met with a hiccup. The driver, not David like I was anticipating after multiple conversations, arrived in a mustang for 5 of us. Obviously that wasn't going to work so I was offered by the driver only to cancel or reschedule. Our trip was planned around spending our day out and about so cancelling wasn't an option for us. After a phone call to David, we were assured our day wasn't ruined just a bit delayed. The driver left and showed back up with an SUV and away we went. The driver wasn't interactive and she didn't seem to even be having a good day... It happens I get it but come on. Anyway, we made the best of our day and enjoyed ourselves. When we were dropped off, I tried to pay but she said to get with David. No problem but I did have a problem with her then saying that she'd go ahead and take the gratuity and that the standard is 20%. I didn't even know what our total cost was to figure 20% but asking for the gratuity before I even paid for the day was in poor taste. We did go ahead and tip, and well mind you, because that's the kind of people we are. I ended up calling David and finishing out the transaction and once again, he was a pleasure to deal with. Overall, we'll use them again because I appreciated David that much. But, I'll definitely make sure we don't have the same driver. 5 stars for David but 4 stars overall for the above mentioned."

It really does not look like much from the outside but my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try based on the reviews and we were not disappointed! We easily made a reservation on the website and came in at 2pm on a Saturday. They took out temperatures at the door and we were seated quickly.   We decided to go for the wine tasting first, 5 samples for $15 plus a stemless logo glass to take home! We really enjoyed trying the wines and enjoyed all of them. Our favorite was the Blanc du Bois because it was light and crisp but had a unique fragrant flavor from the floral notes and the apricot.   My only gripe was the reservation was only 45 minutes. I wish it could've been around an hour, we didn't get a chance to finish our wine or our charcuterie but it's not too big of a deal since we just took it back home. We also got another bottle of the Blanc du Bois to take home and they gave us a cute wine bag for the two bottles.   We will definitely be back again to try the rest of the wines!!"

                "description": "What a wonderful discovery on a lazy pre-Xmas Sat afternoon. Who would have thought you could find a boutique winery that rivals any that I've visited in Sonoma.   Do not despair as you pull into the generic industrial park hard off of Anderson Mill Road in the CP. Walk-in past the small lobby area and step into their beautifully decorated tasting room.  Since we were the only patrons we received VIP treatment from start to finish.   We opted for their premium tasting menu and selected all reds. I'm not a TX wine fan but Dylan, our sommelier, expertly guided us through our tasting and as we concluded our wonderful stay my mind was changed.   My favorite was the Alexandar Valley Cab will more than suffice if you enjoy a big traditional Cab with a strong finish.   Their Spanish Mourvedre version is deep and rich and has a surprisingly strong finish,   There are a number of \"light\" reds as well. We were not fans but appreciated the flavor and balance of these wines.   Bent Oak does offer cheese plates and other small plates to accompany your tasting. Check their social media as they have live music on certain days.   Wonderful wine, an intimate setting, and passionate knowledgeable folks equals a 5 star experience."

                "description": "This was a real treat.  We looked for winery that was open before 4pm. We were staying in San Antonio and wanted to visit Austin TX. We found this place by searching best wineries near Austin. When we 1st arrived, it looked like a little store front in a strip mall. When we entered it was a whole different story. We were greeted by Debbie and Bryan who both turned out to be extremely gracious hosts.  They have wines grown in TX and CA. The TX grapes are grown in the High Plaines near New Mexico where it is warm during the day and cooler at night. I decided to do a tasting with only the TX wines.   The TX wine menu had 5 wines for the tasting menu. Started with the Chenon Blanc (quite nice with a buttery smoothness), proceeded to the Blanc de Bois, then the Roussanne (my least favorite), then switching to the reds starting with the Sangiovese and finally to the tempranillo.  The Tempranillo was my absolute favorite.    What really made this experience so nice was the wine Ambassador Debbie. She is just the nicest person who took good care of us. She also has a very nice sense of humor. Bryan was also very nice. He helped me pick out a few stainless steel wine stoppers. Bryan gave us great restaurant suggestions for Austin and San Antonio.  Do not be fooled with the entrance on the outside. It is misleading in the size and the value you receive on the inside."

                "description": "My experience with this winery has been amazing to say the least! Took two of my really good friends here today both who require wheelchair accessibility and felt very comfortable in the atmosphere. The reservation made ahead time was set up easily and the communication was quick and efficient through email. They were able to recommend a table that was best suited for us all to feel comfortable. It is very rare to actually be able to talk to the owners/wine makers about their products but they were the ones serving us the tasting! It really was a special experience not only for me but for my friends that have not gone out socially since the pandemic. Thank y'all so much for the inclusive atmosphere and making it such a memorable experience, we had a blast!"

                "description": "What a hidden gem! We were sitting at home on a Friday night, trying to find something to do. After a quick yelp search, we saw there was a winery up the street and open late. We decided to take a trip and check it out.  Driving up, you start to question if you are going the right direction but just keep going.   You walk in to this office center and are welcomed to the most friendly staff and environment.  Rarely do you get to sit down at a winery and speak to the head wine maker.   What really makes this place different is the fact that they have California and Texas wines. I'm no expert, but I've been told Texas grapes just don't compare.    The prices are great, and the options are plenty.  This will definitely be the family visit spot in the future."

                "description": "Wine: Only tried one wine, the tempranillo. It was fine, not as bold as they usually are. I smelled some of the whites, and they smelled very sweet so I passed. Didn't even look at pricing because of what the snacks cost.  Snacks: wow, expensive. Tried a bunch of them with a group, overall not worth the price. Particularly the truffles. It was $27 for a teensy box of 9 pieces of terrible chocolate. Waxy texture, did not melt when you eat it, chalky, bad flavor. Dark chocolate is my fave, so that's not the issue. Who knew chocolate could actually be yucky? It came from next door, glad we didn't go there after.   Service: very good, sweet ladies.  Ambience: not good. Outside it just looks like a store front, inside is super dark, no windows, and looks like a Kirkland's from the 90s.... everything is red, has fringe, pretty cheesy. Not eclectic, just ugly and full of stuff."

                "description": "Living in Austin, this winery is located in our backyard. It's nice to be able to drive just 20 minutes and enjoy a good glass of wine, and meet the people who made it. I now have a place for out of town guests just spending the weekend to take a sip of Texas wine.  They focus on creating quality wines sourced from Texas and California grapes.  They do not blend grapes sourced from the two states together.  When you drink a bottle of Texas sourced wine, it is 100% Texas, and vice versa. Bent Oak has been around for about 3 1/2 years, and from what I have heard they are starting to find their stride.   When you enter the space, you will walk through the front gift shop to the back tasting room and production area.  They have gone to amazing strides to make a warehouse space homey. It feels like a Texas hill country family home.  We were warmly welcomed, and they even let us take our three well behaved dogs into the back area to sit and enjoy a tasting with us.  Everyone here was friendly and knowledgeable.    I was pleasantly surprised by the consistent quality of all their wines available to taste.  You can taste up to five wines from their menu.  The Blanc Du Bois was one of my stand out favorites.  There wasn't anything I didn't like on the menu.  I am not a fan of Chardonnay's but their California sourced Chardonnay was good.  Their reds were a bit young, but the Mourvedre from the Texas High plains was tasty and my favorite of the current options.  Medium bodied but with spicy fruity rich tones.  The Sangiovese was satiny smooth, but just needed some time.  I actually enjoyed their Texas wines more than the California options.    Clearly there is a reason why their wine club membership has a waitlist.  It's just a great group of people to hang out with.  It felt like being with family, and enjoying a great conversation over a nice glass of wine.  They are located next to Delysia chocolates towards the back of a warehouse area.  Wine and chocolate neighbors?  Yep, it's an amazing pairing."

We finally mustered the courage to go have a look inside this warehouse looking building.  What an incredible surprise!  We were warmly greeted and led into the tasting room where our eyes grew wide with wonder.  Themed tables, lounging areas, decor and a scuttle of people enjoying some of the most spectacular wine ever!    Everyone in there was so nice and the server we had was very knowledgeable.  My daughter promptly made sure everyone knew I was celebrating the 20th anniversary of my 30th birthday!  Our wine expert quickly informed the wine maker \"John\" and he came over to wish me a happy birthday and give me a taste of a special \"not on the menu\" wine.  All I can say is every single wine we sampled (8 in total) was superb!  I walked out after buying 4 bottles and was extremely happy!"

Tom provided a charming mixture of highbrow wine knowledge and light humor as he took us through our tasting journey of 5 red wines. The wife liked all of the wines, and I liked all but one (a tempranillo). Never fear! Tom is here! Tom saved the day (and the Tres Primos reputation) by pouring us an extra taste, but instructing us to first chew a chocolate-covered coffee bean before pouring the wine across that bean in our mouths. This somehow transformed the flavour into something amazingly pleasing for us both!  We also ordered chicken empanadas, which were surprisingly delicious! For some reason we did not expect such flavor and complexity from a wine bar's kitchen. The empanada crust was crispy and flaky, with a filling of chopped chicken, onions and seasonings that burst into the mouth with each bite. This was no Tex-Mex kitchen empanada. Hats off Barons! Hats off!"

You can do the wine tasting but have to be seated. I had a red blend and my husband had cranberry. They both were sweet and light, which is just what we were in the mood for. I didn't want to carry bottles around the square but next time I'll take a few home."

My friend and I were greeted promptly and given an overview of the wines for our flight-sampler. We scored a small table. This was a huge win as there are limited seats, I believe up to 25 seats. The staff checked in on us as we tasted our way thru the wines. When we finished tasting, we bought a glass of our fave wine and continued to walk through market days on the square.  Anywho, if your walking the Georgetown Square, stop in for a tasting and or a glass or 2. Cheers."

After a more upscale experience in a different tasting room on the square, it was pleasant to ease into this more relaxed space. We were promptly greeted by the hostess, who became our server, and perused the menu of wines. $10 each for a sampling of 4 wines. Nice price, and fitting to the setting which would have been appropriate for beer as well. Neither of us remembers which wines we ordered, except for my two port samplings, but neither of us was overly impressed either. My ports were good, if extremely sweet and fruity, and the wife liked 2 of hers. She was disappointed in her first choice, which was the most expensive wine on the menu as priced by the bottle.  We didn't buy a bottle, nor would we return if we ever visit Georgetown again, but the ambience and carefree environment did add to an overall relaxing day on the square."

This is a great spot for a date night, girls night, or just an afternoon with a small group of friends or family. The actual vineyard is located in Rockdale Texas- this is just a small tasting room right on the Georgetown Square.   For $10, you can taste 4 wines. My spouse also got 4 tasting, so in total- I got to sample 8 wines. My favorite was the Big Tex which is aged for 9 months in oak. A full bottle will set you back only $24. Create price for the quality.  I also love their Viognier, I love white wines- and this was so light. I would casually sip this on any warm summer day. One thing I didn't love their fruity wines. The Blueberry and Blackberry wines tasted like they used artificial flavoring. The couple next to use was absolutely loving the blackberry, so maybe it just wasn't for me. Totally fair.   They also have cheese and crackers available. I feel like any wine tasting isn't complete without a good cheese plate. Unfortunately, we had dinner plans right after, so I enjoyed my wine cheese-free.   I absolutely plan on coming back here soon for some wine + cheese."

My friends and I have only been members of this winery for about a year, but this is honestly one of our favorite locations to consistently come and visit when we're all together. They have sweeter drinks and wineritas for people who aren't fond of dry wines and their wine club memberships are literally built to be shared. There is table seating inside where you can sit for hours and catch up. Laurie and Heather in particular are so sweet with their service and their recommendations.

Any day of the week. And I know from experience.   I don't bother doing the tastings here - I know exactly what I like. Their unoaked chardonnay is butter and smooth. After that I move over to their pinot noir - which isn't too sweet but not so dry that I need to carry in my own water bottle. I do not drink fruit wines but my sweet lil granny does and she swears by the pomegranate and blueberry.   You can buy gifts and chochskies here. I always like to pick up a few bottles of wine before I had home to visit family. Their wine club is probably the best you can be apart of in terms of benefits.   I would really like if they would provide bread so that we can try the olive oils. Probably smart that they don't do that or else all of us winos would use that as food. :)"

Never knew anything about Georgetown except that it was an annoying mile marker on Interstate Hell-35 indicating after driving north for an hour you have gone nowhere.  Low and behold there is actually an ancient town square buried in there somewhere. So what else to do but gravitate like a bee to flower and find the alcohol. It's here and it's called wine.  The place is filled full on a steamy June Saturday afternoon. Saddle up to the bar and start in on the tasting. I was in a red mood and took 4 tastes.  The chambourcin was an interesting new grape for me and it was deeply dark in color yet light on the tannins. It was nice but I like tannin and the Tempranillo delivered on all counts.  It was a nice pit stop and I recommend it if you accidentally end up touring the square of Georgetown."

The GM proceeded to stay late with us and show us the absolute best of the best mead I have ever had. He was amazing the bartender was amazing and if I ever re-vist Austin this is a must have on the to do list. Do NOT miss out on this amazing experience. Do not go to Austin beer works this place is literally 10x better if not more."

Unfortunately, they do not allow dogs inside. As a dog owner who lives in the brewery district, this establishment is simply off my list anytime I go out with my little gal.   I do love this place but it's hard to give a perfect score to a place I can't frequent. Especially when they have ~10 competitors in a 5 minute radius and none of them share the same policy. As a result, I am updating my review from 5 to 4 stars."

There seems to be good social distancing. There's hand sanitizer on the counter. Growlers are a possibility as are CDB sodas. The people are friendly and seem to know about the beer. I only discovered this place after the pandemic it started so I've never really spent time inside. But I've been sitting on my own porch enjoying it quite a bit and when things get back to normal I hope to spend a few hours at Adelbert's."

The neat thing is that they have artwork that's for sale on the walls. The art adds character and is a large variety of different themes all from local artists.   No good is served inside the brewery but there is a really good food truck on the outside.   The beers are amazing and you can sample before you buy.  Liked this brewery and beers are very creative."

They have a food truck outside with I think chicken I usually just get the fresh popped popcorn it's delicious and great to snack on while drinking beer. They have a Nintendo Wii with Mario kart and two old-school arcade games they also have a Foos ball table and darts. There's also boardgames that you can check out with giving them your ID, an awesome place to hang out with friends, kids and dogs!"

They have an outdoors area that's shaded for those with doggos or who want to enjoy the heat and eat from their food truck. I had the Triple B, which was surprisingly crisp and floral for a belgian. They had a variety of beers which I wanted to taste, but we arrived late with one hour to spare before closing. That just means I need to pay another visit to truly enjoy the place.  They have a private parking area shared with neighboring businesses and strong wifi. The best part is the indoors games like 4-player Mario Kart (WHAT!), darts, and a bunch of board games. They also give free stickers, plus our lady taptender that day was so kind and welcoming."

However I checked out their site, saw they had some wine options and a food truck--so I happily tagged along. The bartender who greeted us gave us the rundown of everything. Served us with a smile and was very informative about the beers, of course. I had a great bottle of pinot grigio while my friends enjoyed the various beers available. I had a great time checking out the art that they have on the walls for sale. We also played a game of jumbo sized connect four and Mario Kart on the big screen. A large collection of board games are also available to borrow while hanging out enjoying your drink in the taproom. Very cool place, warm vibes. Great food truck on site as well.  Definitely will return soon and bring my beer drinking friends."

Get the wristband if you're a first timer- only $15 for six \"half pours\" which are definitely more like 3/4 pours haha  The mango wit, naked nun, and hibiscus saison are AMAZINGGG.   Cool art, live music, food truck (although they left early, which sucked).  The only real disappointment? The brewery closes at 10- we coulda stayed all night!"

They've got a bunch of cool artwork from local artists, giant Jenga, a foosball table, and live music to keep you entertained.  They also have great food truck options during Taproom hours.    $14 for 6 half pours and a free pint glass is a pretty amazing deal, especially due to the quality and content of the beer.  If you're into light, crisper beers, try the Naked Nun or the Philosophizer.  If you like the darker stuff, the Black Rhino is your friend.  They also have some great sours!"

                "description": "Three words: Belgium style brews! Oh my goodness, where have you been hiding from me Adelbert's?! This is by far one of my most favorite craft breweries in all of Austin, if not in the United States. For those of you that really know me, you know that I L.O.V.E. Belgian beers...so much so that, yes, I traveled to Belgium JUST for the beers (okay, I ate some mussels and saw some pretty cool stuff too, but...). For those of you not in the know (no insult meant for those who are), Belgian style beers are pretty high in ABV, so amateurs enter gently. Just looking out for my Yeeps! :D  Adelbert's doesn't look like much at all from the outside. Tucked away in a warehouse district, it can a tad difficult to find, particularly at night - just look for the little white lights and the picnic tables outside. Park, walk through the plastic flat \"doors\" and you will discover a beautiful huge space with stacks and stacks of barrels, merchandise for sale, lots of local art hanging on the walls to purchase adds to the ambiance; plus games to play such as giant Jenga, foosball, and darts and that's one fine outing.   But the beer! Oh my gosh - the beer. Handcrafted at its best. So amazingly fantastic and such a great deal. On your first visit be certain to buy the 6 half pour (really close to full pours - yay) tastings for $13. You get to keep the glass and get $2 off beers when you bring it back on your next visit. Regular prices range from $4-6 a glass, which is phenominal in the first place for such high quality ale.   ALL great, two personal standouts for me were: *Flyin' Monks Quadrupel: 10.9%ABV, aged in rum barrels with hints of spice, deep, dark, and lovely. *Philosophizer Saison: An easy choice. 7.8% ABV, very mild carbonation with a hint of pepper. Fantastic.     To add some icing to this already oh so sweet find, the founder and brewmaster Scott and staff cannot be any more friendly or knowledgeable about the beers and brewery.   Highly highly highly recommend. Simply doesn't get better than this IMHO. Cheers!  TIPS:  *The brewery has a license so you can take a large bottle home for a reasonable price of about $9 to $12, which is average. They also sell retail at area Austin locations (visit their website for exact locations).  *Tours are available (see website for details).   *They typically have a food truck on site on Saturdays.  *Fido friendly pergola area - not allowed inside."

                "description": "Ya'll are probably already aware of my latest and greatest obsession with collecting pint glasses from assorted breweries. For our first stop in Austin, we stopped by this unassuming warehouse. As we walked in, the live jazz band was jammin' and the beer taps were flowin'.   Michael and his bearded friend were fantastic bartenders. I really appreciated their hospitality. Michael instantly could tell I was new to this particular brewery and proceeded to explain the process to tasting their beer samples. He even noted that I had a minor with me and offered a brewed hibiscus tea for him. They really cater to all ages! We paid $13 for six half poured samples from a souvenir Belgian tasting glass. One yellow wristband later, my siblings and I were playing ping-pong and giant Jenga in the back of the warehouse.  The stringed lights on the ceiling made it feel welcome and homey. They had a wall of local art for sale ranging from $30-$300! I had my eye on a Sinatra painting, and as luck would have it, it was indeed the $300 piece lol. I stared at it longingly for most of the night, but couldn't bring myself to throw down on it. My favorite craft brews of the night were the Naked Nun and the Philosophizer. Brilliant names and great hoppy flavors.  Once it got too muggy in the taproom, we ventured out to get some grub. The food truck of the night was Emoji Grilled Cheese. (See their yelp site for my review) It was mouthwatering and delicious. We visited a couple other breweries throughout our trip, but Adelbert's was my all-time favorite.   Thanks for a great time!   -xoxoxo"

Also, what kind of brewery would this be if they did not have board games to play as you drink?  The Mango Wit is good and refreshing. Mango flavor is not as present as I like, but the hint of it is good enough."

You know Grape Creek's wine is good: they earned almost 2 dozen medals, including three Double Golds, this year at the prestigious San Francisco Wine Competition. And their wins encompass all styles, with Double Gold wins for red, white and Port. My Tasting Ambassador, Sandy, was exceptional! As we talked, she discerned my tastes and made a couple of recommendations that turned out to be spot on. She was knowledgeable and responsive, and a delight to talk with. Having been to many tasting rooms and wineries in the Texas Hill Country as well as from the California wine regions to the New York Finger Lakes, my experience at Grape Creek exceeded my expectations. Highly recommended!"

Since they made us split up our party of six we got two tables that were close together. Apparently management had a problem with my girlfriend and I orienting our chairs towards our friends table so we could all talk to each other and came and got in our faces to tell us we have to turn our chairs around and face forward. What is this kindergarten? The wine was alright, but definitely not good enough to justify the $40 per bottle price tag. I've found better bottles at HEB for under $20. Don't waste your time or money. There are plenty of other wineries in the area of the same quality that are more affordable and less rude"

                "description": "Grape Creek is my official go to for Georgetown vino. After signing up in Fredericksburg, I've quickly come to LOVE their red wines...particularly Bellisimo. It is absolutely delish and my go to red for my collection and for gifting to friends.   While the main building itself is somewhat small and doesnt offer the option to sit downstairs (GC....this is overdue), there is a members only room available upstaird with views of the Gtown Square.  The patio however is the reason people gravitate towards this winery. There is live music, nice fans to keep you cool in summer and heaters for the winter.  My only dislike is the changes hours...it closes at 6:30. Far too early and down the street are alternatives that stay open til 9 or later."

My friend is a wine club member and invited us to accompany her and her significant other to a tasting. We ended up enjoying a bottle! It was delicious. We sat in the reserved section on the second floor and finished the bottle and relaxed. Grape Creek has a nice selection of local wines to choose. Although the facility is small, the atmosphere is friendly and quaint."

Although... standing in line when you first walk-in did seem a bit off, it was merely just a way to help usher traffic through more efficiently. Luckily, the line went quickly or this would probably be a different type of review, as someone * wink wink* who doesn't do well with lines for absolutely anything, except that one Prince concert 30 years ago.   Needless to say, we came, we tasted, we joined the wine club and now we are big fans. Especially of their Rose of Malbec. That deliciously tasting watermelon jolly rancher (without the sugar) wine has changed wine drinking for me and completely justifies the $30 price tag."

She started jerking things away from the table while we were still sitting there. We had previously been sitting there calmly, not being loud or offensive in any way - it felt very abrupt and extremely rude. We realized after we were booted out that closing was at 5 and this intrusion happened at 5:10, it wasn't like they were waiting on us for an hour. Even though my friend is a member we won't be coming back."

I decided to join the wine club because of her level of service. However, it's hard to get a hold of someone on the phone. I have a simple question to ask but no one will ever pick up the phone. When select the button to speak to the tasting room, their automated service starts all over again. Yes, I can email, but for a simple question, picking up the phone should be an easy option as well.  Also, the times on yelp versus their times on the phone are inconsistent. That needs to be updated.  Bottomline, they lack communication.  It's really annoying and frustrating. I plan on canceling my wine club membership and going elsewhere due to the experience that I've had."

I really like this winery, with the exclusive access to seating upstairs. I love the live entertainment outside lounge area. I really like this winery! I also like how EVERY time you come to the winery, you get a complimentary glass of wine! Of course, you need a membership.  I don't live in the area so I have a trek to make to receive my complimentary glass of wine for me and a guest. However, when I am in the area you better believe I am here. I just started my membership last visit but failed to write a review after a couple of bottles. My apologies. I was informed that my three bottles qill be mailed to my residence in Harker Heights, Texas. I will be sure to post how that goes. You can cancel the membership at anytime. More to follow after I really get a chance to experience this establishment."

My sorority sisters came to Georgetown for Austin's ACL Fest and added on extra days to sightsee.   Grape Creek was a wonderful respite.  You stand in line, describe your likes to the salesperson, and taste. Then, you get wine by the glass (I think it was 10$/glass) to enjoy on their relaxing patio, and bottles to go.   My BF is a frequent member and has a card to get 2 free glasses of wine a month.   A very nice spot to relax and enjoy good wine and good conversation.   Thank you Grape Creek Vineyards!"

It's going to be a quarterly experience for my wife and I, which includes a 6-sample tasting or half glass each visit and access to the upstairs member only area. We went on a Saturday around 5:00 and it was busy! The wait for the tasting was only a few minutes since they fully staffed the counter. I think I saw them doing 5 couples or groups at a time.  She told us that we can order delivery from Gumbo's around the corner or bring in any food that we want! The offer live music on the weekends on the patio and dogs are welcome out there. The member only area was packed with people, so it was a bit hot, but had comfortable couches and chairs, many windows overlooking the courthouse and town square, and some salespeople offering tastes of the Owner's Club wines. I only took off a star because the member's area was hot and could use some more seating and a server would be great since it takes a while to get another glass or make a purchase by standing in line more than once.  The had quite a bit of wine related merchandise, cheese, olive oils and vinegars, and cookbooks downstairs."

It is a nice storefront on the square in Georgetown, which is a terribly cute area if you haven't been.  Got my free member glass and took it out on the back patio to enjoy.  Plenty of tables and shade there and some light classic rock, which made for a nice relaxing atmosphere.  Also I went upstairs to check out the members only lounge.  There was nothing free being handed out there food or sipping wise, but it was a comfortable place with lots of leather chairs, and if the winery was crowded, I could see escaping up here.  The wine itself is very good, something for every palate, even the dry red drinkers like myself.  If you are into wine at all, stop by and do a tasting, and I think you will be happy you did.  I plan to come back anytime I'm in the Georgetown area again."

People everywhere with no special lines for members Or any direction other than a sign that said everyone get in line.  Not sure the value of paying to be a member for this space.  Also a 21 and over rule in the tasting room. Most serious wine folks have kids.  Seriously reconsidering our membership and if it's with it. My suggestion would be to expand as quick as possible if you're that popular. Otherwise, do away with memberships benefits and just open to the public.  4 stars because the wine is amazing."

                "description": "My family rode the North Pole Flyer, not so much for the Santa stuff since we have no children under 10, it was more for family fun. And it was a fantastic experience. The train was actually pretty cool, I've never been in a proper train before, I mean, it was old fashioned but still just a really really cool experience. We paid for the private suite and it was worth it, we also walked throughout the train which was a bit old west feeling. My favorite part was walking between cars to see the view unencumbered by windows.   We walked through all the cars (like most people on the train did) to see what the other cars were like. The giftshop car was the nicestest with big windows and plenty of room to walk around while balancing yourself on a rocking and rolling moving train.   Some of the private rooms give you an idea of what is was really like to ride a train across country with a sleeper car, teeny tiny shower, and narrow hallways. It was such a great experience.   Not sure why people complain about the views because mine were fantastic! I mean, c'mon. We live in Texas not Denver. I know what the hill country looks like. There's no mountains but where the hills meet the sky is expansive. It was beautiful."

We loved all the fun facts the volunteers had to share about the train cars and lifestyles of some of the riders back 100+ years. The sunset was magical and the night portion of the ride was really neat, having the moonlight illuminate the tracks in front of us. One of the cars is a dedicated gift shop/concession stand with a variety of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages to choose from. Everyone we came in contact with was so kind and made the experience that much more memorable. Overall such a great time - we would definitely book this experience again!"

Note that you have about 45 mins moving time, then 40 mins stopped for the engine to be brought from the back to the front and then 45 mins back again. You don't really see much of the sunset, and you aren't moving for 2.5 hours. They also assign seats ahead of time, some of the cars were nicer and louder than others, so just depends what you're looking for. The association was responsive on social media when I had questions, staff and crew on board were all very friendly. They dont really follow any of their own posted rules about masks, no personal coolers, etc. so just something to be aware of- but I think this also varied by car. Overall we had a great time and would go again!"

Fortunately for me the plague was in top form. Was in the area looking for sustenance and 'Steam Train Association' showed on the map so I figured to pop in for a quick viddy before lunch. pulled up on a nearly empty lot, a shackled gate, and a locked door, the sign had the now common 'Closed for Plague' message which softened the blow of discovering \"...that the train and rail yard are not open for public tours or photography\" which meant the entirety of the museum was contained in the double-wide corner space in the strip. There's nothing inherently wrong with scenic train rides on vintage rolling stock, I've done it before and it's OK but that's just not my cup of meat. I was here for a bit of museuming but there was no museum to be had - nor postcarding nor touchable cars nor engines :-( sad face"

The Train itself is quite impressive and was my first time on a real train not subway. The First Class Coach option was really nice and the seats were spread out along with social distancing, we felt really comfortable. My only complaint was it was VERY cold outside and though they are climate controlled, it was really cold the first half of the ride - coming back was much more comfortable. I also wished the lay over time perhaps had been 3 hours to provide a little more browsing time in Burnet. It would be cute to do music in each train car from the era the train was made. Ours was built in the late 30's so it would be a nice little touch that's simple to do! They had complimentary snacks and drinks which was a plus. Can't wait to do it again in a private suite!"

                "description": "This was an excellent experience. We took the train from Bertram to Burnet for one of the special events (Wedding Oaks wine trip). The staff was friendly and seemed very knowledgeable about the history of each train car. If you have a chance to walk to the very last car and look out the back, I definitely recommend taking in that view. I would have loved to take a longer trip and will look for other chances to ride.  The website is a little hard to use. We would have really liked a private cabin for our trip but didn't see how to book that on the website.   I wish the volunteer in our car would have been a little less Chatty Cathy when we weren't talking about the ride. It was a bit of a distraction from our enjoyment of the ride. Also, riding during COVID was a bit out of our comfort zone already so we were sad to see at least two volunteers wearing their masks covering only their mouth, not their mouth and nose. The website goes into great detail about precautions and that is a basic one not being taken. (That being said, they did a great job with social distancing and I felt like the train was very clean.)"

                "description": "Enjoyed my first ASTA experience today.  Here's my recap:  - Purchased a First Class Lounge ticket so I had my own room in Rippling Stream  - Train left the station on time, arrived at Burnet on time, and left for Cedar Park on time.   We were only an hour late reaching Cedar Park because a car thought it could outrun the train, but it could not.  Once the accident reporting was complete the train resumed.   - Personal note:  I am a train nerd and love riding trains, so my threshold of being annoyed on a train is higher than most.  This will affect my review below.    THE GOOD:  - clean cars, fun to walk in between them, and if you're without children, the adults only first class cars are a must - Rippling Stream and Nambe.   Otherwise with kids, I would recommend the Maurice Beckham or Eagle Cliff.    - the trip itself is smooth and the volunteers are friendly and helpful.  You can tell they enjoy being there, informing and helping others.     - Burnet has an abundance of antique shops if that's you're thing.  Also the soups at the downtown coffee shop are wonderful.     - The shootout show in Burnet, while not having a worry about winning any acting awards, is fun for the kids and has a good ending.  They could trim some of the fat from it, and make it a more concise / engaging story - there were a few too many awkward pauses.  But I applaud the folks who are likely doing this for free.  And the kids loved it.     THE NOT SO GOOD  - The scenic ride - if you're from the area this should not come as a shocker - is not that scenic.  There's a great bridge over the San Gab river but otherwise it's unremarkable trees, backyards, roads, and strip malls.    But again, none of this bothers me that much because I'm on a train relaxing.    - Burnet:  This is a sleepy, very conservative town.  One sign to deter thieves in a store said, \"We got an alarm.  We got video.  We got guns.  DON'T BE DUMB.\"    While the downtown is a short walk from the train station, 2.5 hours here is way too much time unless you love antiques.   There isn't much else.   And as far as lunch goes, I highly recommend walking a bit farther past the first couple restaurants or else you'll have long wait times.   I went to a deli just a couple blocks away and it had no line.      - Announcements:  there are few.  Nothing along the way to alert you to landmarks or scenic opportunities (there is really just one, the bridge over the river).   But it would be nice to hear more than the pre recorded departure / arrival ones.    - The warm soft drinks:  no one wants green tea or apple juice at room temp.  There was literally an ice bucket next to these (but for scoping ice).  A second one to put these beverages on ice would go a long way.    - Lack of variety in snacks:  for a first class experience, at least more than the mini lemon cakes and mini cinnamon rolls would be nice.  Some savory, perhaps?   - chairs in the RS lounge car are what you'd find at your local dentist's waiting room.  I expected something that would at least remain comfy for 1.5 hours at a time.      OVERALL. - for the price I paid, it's 4/5 stars.  I knew the scenery wasn't going to awe, so most of my ranking is based on the train experience inside.  The quibbles above are all minor; chill the drinks, add some pretzels, get someone to donate an old leather chair or 2, and be a bit more chatty with us.    Those who really ranked their train ride low usually fall into the following categories, so please take them with a grain of salt:  - a/c sucked because it was Austin in the summer (hopefully fixable but not all that surprising) - solution is to go when it's not hot, the 60 days out of the year it's under 99 degrees.  I also think they have ironed out most of the a/c issues by now.    - Burnet was terrible, Burnet food was terrible, etc.  It's Burnet.  There's a reason it's not as well known as Fredericksburg.  You walk a bit father to get away from the crowds, you cross check their list of lunch spots they give you when you board  with a quick glance of Yelp reviews and you roll the dice.    - scenery sucked, super ghetto, etc.   Maybe because I grew up in St Louis, but using the word ghetto here is laughable at best.  It's junky, yes.  Unkempt, sure.   And truly, if you live in the region, you should know better than to expect breathtaking views.  You've driven on 183 east of 35?.  Same views.   If you're from out of town I could see valid point here since the website pushes it hard that it's scenic - but us locals know how much lipstick you can put on this pig.   So go check it out!  But go First Class if possible.  And be flexible about being home on time; like with any train, delays can happen."

                "description": "We rode the Hill Country Flyer which departs from the Cedar Park station and goes to Burnet, Texas,  where there is a two-hour layover so that passengers can disembark, do some shopping or grab some lunch or both.   Before leaving, the Burnet Gunfighters put on a show which is free to passengers, although they do accept donations.   The scenery leaves a lot to be desired, however that is not something that the Steam Train Foundation can control, they have a designated track and can not control who builds subdivisions or places gravel pits along the route.   If you are looking for a beautiful scenic ride, this probably isn't for you.  However, if you want to experience riding on a passenger train, and learning about the history of the railroads, it is a great experience.     They are very careful with social distancing and we felt completely safe riding the train.  I spoke with a couple of families that had young children and they loved it!   All in all, I would recommend it as a very enjoyable way to spend the day."

                "description": "I rode the Sunset Express on 5-29-21 with my family, while on a trip to visit Austin. I'm from Southern California (this is important later). The scenery was certainly nice in some spots, but not enough. The sunset was awesome, but the experience wasn't that great. We paid for first class and rode aboard Eagle Cliff. Some basic drinks and snacks were provided, but the train was understaffed. No attendant for our car. One very sweet elderly volunteer was doing her best to handle two cars at once. I decided to offer to help, which she was very appreciative of. She said it was great that I wanted to help and so I did. I helped stock drinks and snacks as well as stocked ice to keep the drinks cold. Later on, a female volunteer who looked to be in her 40s came up to the counter said \"Sir, you cannot be back there, what do you need?\" I explained the situation, and she kind of had an attitude. I was informed in a rude tone that I had to be a member to help, and was given no thank you. Being that I live in Southern California, there's no way I could really be a member. While all this was happening, the AC in the car was doing a very poor job at keeping the car cold. It was unbearably hot in there, and everyone in the car was complaining. The excuse given was that the car is vintage and has a lot of runtime. The car was very original, and you could tell. That roughly translates to \"we don't have the money or people to keep this car in tip top shape, and we don't have the money to upgrade it\".  Eventually, my family was re-seated to the Rippling Stream. That was much better, but it didn't change the overall experience. Cherry on top was we were over an hour late returning to the Cedar Park station.   Not worth the money."

                "description": "We also did the Xmas Polar Express train ride. Tickets were about $50 each. We also went with a friend and their kids too.   I'll give this train ride 4 stars. The kids were excited to see Santa and the ride was slow at times.   To start, one of the first things was a balloon guy. Ours was awesome. He was funny and overall entertaining. He had me laughing my @ss off.   Next came hot chocolate... it's hot chocolate.   After that was, singing Christmas Carols. They had 2 girls from McNeil high school. I felt sorry for them. They were nice, but they couldn't just get our car interested in singing.  A few of us sang, but overall it was a failure. I'm sure adult beverages if allowed/served would help the spirit. Great job to them but our car was mostly interested. It probably didn't help that they gave us a cookie just before they arrived so everyone was stuffing their face.   After that was story time, the lady reading the Story was animated and funny. Kudos to her.   She visited just before Santa.   Then Santa came. We were in one of the last cars so his visit was a bit rushed. He was nice and gave everyone a wooden train whistle.   ***********The entire operation is run by volunteers. So I'd like to thank all of them for their time!*******  This was he first time my son was not afraid of Santa:-)"

Super We stayed in the Turquoise Room, which consisted of 2 tables, 8 chairs and two smaller windows. Staff was super friendly and knowledgeable...Once the train started the conductor came in to room to announce that there we several open seats in the main car...everyone got up and left leaving the wife and I in peace...Not that we are anti social, but it was peaceful to say the least...Good to catch up with each other, as we both work different hours...Truly not much to see on the way up...but it was a great ride....AC did work, not great but tolerable...I see in other reviews there were issues...You have freedom to roam Car to Car once the train gets rolling...and the train does turn around in Burnet...hard to explain, but it does...and we were able to see the other side of the tracks on the way home...Plenty to see and eat in Burnet...Our Car/cabin also came with free snacks and drinks...which is a great perk..as the snacks in the concession stand were quit expensive...The trip was worth it for us and will do it again next year with the granddaughter.."

                "description": "This review is based on my customer service experience with Zena, not the train ride itself (although I may come back and give an update!)  Zena is a lifesaver. Not literally, but she has made my train experience 2x as good. I bought a Groupon because I didn't even realize there was a train experience in Austin. After the headache of scheduling, our trip got canceled. Zena came in to save the day. She mailed me another gift certificate that expired in a year (vs the next week per my Groupon) AND she gifted us a little extra!  Sounds great, right? Unfortunately, the GC could not be redeemed online. After multiple tries of calling in (and getting a forever ring - no pick up), I was getting irritated.   I emailed Zena back asking for her advice. She wrote back in 24 hours and apologized for their phone service. She even offered to reserve me herself. After a few back-and-forth emails, she answered all my questions and got us all squared away.  Our train ride happens this weekend and I can only hope that the experience is similar to Zena's customer service."

                "description": "It's such an adorable idea - volunteers running a historic train line on weekends to give people an authentic experience. But the train is slow - really really slow. The view is simple and unmemorable. The FandB in the first class is simply a cinnamon roll and lemon cake with tea. They do have apples and oranges as well. The trip back was painful - we stood in the concession cart the entire time because the A/Cs didn't work and it was triple-digit hot on a September Saturday. Even my 5-year-old nephew, who is obsessed with trains and knows all there is to know about them, wasn't engaged in this ride much. Thankfully, we had carried board games and our own food so the ride to Burnet was okay but the ride back was really terrible."

                "description": "The most horrible rip off of an experience I have ever had. I bought 4 tickets for the VIP lounge which included treats and drinks and a nicer car, it was none of those things. The food offered were store bought generic cookies and the drinks were either warm apple juice or water. The car lost the A.C. capacity on the return from the small town with nothing to offer and did not even have the gun fight reenactment due to the extreme heat, now imagine that extreme heat inside a metal sardine box. I invited my 72 year old father and I was genuinely worried we would have to rush him to the emergency room upon arrival. I chewed the place out for their false advertisement and putting the elderly and children at risk in the extreme heat without AC.   In summation, do not buy tickets to any of the events this was a horrible experience. I got my money almost a month later, and I will never return and I will warn anyone thinking about ever going to one of these fiascos."

We booked tickets on the Sunset Express trip. The Staff was all very friendly and knowledgeable.   You are able to bring your own drinks (non alcoholic) and snacks which is a plus. They do have a concessions car which is nice.   To us the trip was not as much about the scenery as it was the experience of a mode of travel long since gone."

Just jump off the train, and there you are.  Each train car has it's own characteristics, but take my word, spend the extra money for the air conditioned cars.  We had a chance to walk through the other cars, and even on a beautiful spring day, you can tell a big difference walking into the cars without A/C.  We rode on the City of Chicago, in a table for two, which had great views.  There was complimentary water, tea and snacks on our car.  The volunteer, Barbara, was informative about the train, wildflowers, and announced points of interest on the route."

                "description": "My family and I took a ride on the Hill Country Flyer and this a brief overview of our experience and I recommend you heed this review well.  ----------------------------  I visited and rode the September 7th 10:00 am to 5:00 pm ride to Burnett going out of Cedar Park Wirth the Austin Steam Train Association and I'd like to share my experience that day.   To begin the train left 20 minutes late from the terminal when it was communicated the train would be leaving promptly and on time consistently. Which is fine although it did negatively impact the quality of time spent in Burnett and exploring the town which was a key experience in the advertised outing. Another large disappointment was the lack of the advertised western gun fight. We saw no mention of it, nor display of it. Apparently that was another misrepresentation of the trip. It was advertised we would have two hours to explore downtown Burnett and have lunch. This was barely enough time to visit a local restaurant flooding with business from both local lunchtime and other passengers. With barely an hour in Burnett without enough time to eat we actually had to leave the restaurant we were at in a manic frenzy without eating, apologize to the staff at the restaurant for our rush due to this,and return to the train. Then upon returning at the specified time we still not even begin the process of departing until nearly 30 minutes past the time we were told to return! The. On the return trip we didn't even get above 10 mph on the speed making for a grueling and arduous journey back creating an atmosphere on complete misery on the entire train. On top of all of that the trains expected time to return was 5:00 we did not return until after 5:30! This is insane it officially help derail our entire vacation plan and helped out more of a strain on our time off. Meaning we had to rush and adjust our original plans.   Another issue with the experience was there little to no a/c in rear car named Rippling Stream on a day with temperatures rising above 95 degrees! Although the next car over had perfect a/c with a lower priced ticket. Paying for six tickets @55 dollars to sit in the heat in pool of our own sweat was not the idea of a luxury car provided by marketing materials. We actually had to use the pamphlets provided to make fans in order to be comfortable during the ride and continuously go into the other cars for refuge from the sweltering heat. Upon informing staff of the issue we were told once the train is moving we can go to other cars and stand in the cool air to gain some reprise from the heat.This is insane as we bought out the entire private room to have a bonding family experience we certainly were unable to enjoy. Also this car represented itself as a purchase of an adults only car ticket and children were running through the car. We wanted an experience that would supply with a relaxing adult atmosphere that was negatively impacted by this not being enforced.   Another major concern of mine is lack of communication from staff with the private areas of the train. Announcements regarding safety, departure time, arrival, landmarks etc were unheard in the private room and no effort was made by train personnel to inform us of anything. We were left alone with no information about anything given without having to seek out an attendant regularly. To mention with sound there was also an almost constant excessively loud screeching noise as we moved along at a slugs pace that I feel each passenger will hear in their nightmares of this ride for years to come.   This experience wound up being more stressful due to the previously mentioned circumstances causing our trip to be unenjoyable. Due to the dishonest representation of a truly climate controlled car, and times for departure misrepresented. Unfortunately this is not an outing that we would attended again or recommend to others visiting the Austin/Hill Country area. This is not something we would recommend for anyone trying to relax or enjoy a vacation."

We were sad when the Round Rock location closed down, but found this place to be a million times better. The decor is cute and thematic, with tons of inviting spots for seating, whether you're looking for a romantic spot for two, or some couches for a larger gathering. The best part is the staff - super friendly and helpful while we try to make the tough decision of what to drink or take home. The free samples help too!   Making our own batch of wine is a yearly tradition for us. We get together with friends to start the wine (which of course involves a good time trying the different wines first), design our own labels (or get help from W2W), throw a gathering to bottle the wine, then have bottles to hand out as wedding favors, Christmas gifts, or generic gifts.   We are club members, so we stop by at least monthly for a couple glasses of wine and to pick up our bottles to enjoy at home. Whether you're joining wine club, making a batch, or just stopping in for a glass or two, Water 2 Wine is a fantastic neighborhood gem. I only wish they were in my neighborhood!"

                "description": "Came here with friends who decided they wanted a wine baby and we tagged along to help them taste wines. It is a very laid-back tasting room. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Prices are reasonable and tasting is free. You can even make your own wine, which is exactly what we tagged along to do and that gets you 28-30 bottles. Highly recommend this place - Cheri and Jenny are so knowledgeable and make the whole process so easy and fun!  Only downside, no Texas wines... but this isn't necessarily a con -  all their wines are made on-site with grapes from various vineyards."

They make excellent suggestions whether you know what you're looking for or not. They can get you going in the right direction.  Sulfite free wine? Is my understanding. I don't know a lot about wine, but know that's a good thing to be free of. I can say the ports and fruity wines are a good dessert. My family and friends love the other wines."

                "description": "If you are a young couple, or an old couple, or an odd couple, and you decide you want a wine baby, you may be a bit worried about where, when and how to do that.  It's a big step and you should have nothing but the best for your Vino Bambino, so please look no further than Water 2 Wine, and Jenny in particular.  She is the BEST midwife for your wine labor.    We just had the best experience making, bottling and labeling our wine baby.  It was smoooooth sailing and immediately made me want another :)  When you decide to make your own wine, first, you'll get to sample the wines, ALL of them if you so wish.  I spent two afternoons sampling bunches of them and all the staff were generous and enthusiastic in helping me find which wine I wanted.  Then, you make an appt for conception.  It's fairly simple  and pleasurable.  Again, you can grab a glass of wine as you work, mixing the juice and water and yeast in a giant white bucket (Carboy), churning away for about 10 minutes and then your part is done for about 6 weeks!  The rest of the staff will ensure that your baby gestates comfortably and appropriately, testing its ph and sugars until its ready to be born.  Then the magic happens.  As the parent, you'll have full creativity in naming your baby.  In which case, you can pick any 3 images you like, decide the wording and color scheme and font of the label, email all that to Jenny and she'll print out the most perfect labels.  You can then invite a bunch of friends to witness and help in the birthing.  You can bring in all kinds of snack ems and the fine ladies at Water 2 Wine will immediately ply your guests with tastings of their wine and you can buy bottles (and bottles) to facilitate in the birthing process.  Everyone in your party can try their hand at filling bottles, corking bottles, melting the lid foils, and sticking on labels.  In the end, you'll have about 30 bottles of fantastic wine ( I recommend the Gruner!) to share and take home.    They make for fantastic house warming, business, wedding, new baby, Christmas, Hanukkah, etc gifts.  In fact, if you decide last minute you'd like to adopt a wine baby for Christmas, they keep a bunch already made and ready to label for your Christmas party or gifts.    Best thing was, our friends had so much fun and it was such a new experience for all of us that we WIN again as the hostess with the mostest.  And, even though I had grand plans of using this wine at our housewarming party, I doubt it'll last another 8-10 months so we may indeed make another baby next year.    Jenny and the rest of the staff really made this so much fun and interesting with all their cool contraptions and accomodated me with the music I wanted (got to have appropriate Edith Piaf wine birthing music!) and never left a wine glass dry in my group.    So grab your partner, in life, in business, in crime, and get to makin that baby! They're the best kind of babies, they don't puke or shit or cry and instead of causing you stress, they relieve it.  And in the end you'll have the coolest collectible bottles."

                "description": "Water 2 Wine has taken your normal wine drinking experience and given it a unique spin by providing you the keys to the winery and letting you become the vintner. You make your own batch of wine, create custom labels, bottle it, and best of all, taste the fruits of your labor. By having you do this work on site they are able circumvent certain regulations resulting in less sulfites and other chemicals than store bought wines.  I have been visiting Water 2 Wine for about five years and actually created a batch with my wife and we gave the custom bottles of wine away as gifts at our wedding. The gifts were a hit.   Water 2 Wine imports their grapes and juices from other vineyards. This is not uncommon for vineyards in Texas as most don't grow enough grapes, if any, to meet their own demand. When you decide to make a batch this is where you will start. You will mix the juice, and depending on the type of wine you are making will add flavors like oak.  After you make the wine it will go in the back room for fermentation where the staff will guide the wine along over the next six to eight weeks changing containers around six times.  About two months later you will come back and bottle your wine. You add your label, fill the bottle, cork it and shrink wrap foil around the top. Like a good chef test tasting food a lot of quality assurance goes on during this process. This is a perfect event to bring along a group of friends. Hopefully you end up bottling more wine than you drink.   You don't have to make wine. Water 2 Wine is also a spacious wine bar, with a large selection of wine, where you can stop in just to drink some wine. All of the wine is made on site by the employees. They don't sell food but you are welcome to bring in food to eat with your wine. There are plenty of tasting options or you can buy by the glass or bottle. The staff is very friendly and have been one of my favorite aspects of every visit."

Whether it's a glass of vino after work, a place to gather on weekends with friends or a fun place to work remote during the week W2W has it all.   I always thought you could only make wine here and was surprised to learn it's also a wine bar and retail destination.   Stop by and challenge the team to find you the perfect glass- they won't disappoint."

It was a last-minute decision to book a bus so we ended up having two drivers, because they had to scheduled something at the last minute, and both were entirely friendly, professional and helpful. We wanted to find a bar with a mechanical bull and they helped us track one down. There communication was perfect, it was always easy to reach them and they were super flexible at the end of the night, allowing us to extend our trip for as many hours as we wanted for an hourly rate. In the end we only stayed out another hour, and they gave us the extra hour for free. Also, because it was a late booking, they offered us their 25 person bus for the 20 person bus rate.  The sound system was enough to give everyone permanent hearing loss and the dancing pole and hand holds proved to be incredibly robust and secure!  These guys are AWESOME, and I would DEFINITELY book from them again in a heartbeat."

The bus itself was roomy and nice. They also provided ice, cups and water for the bus ride. Overall - everyone in my party was extremely pleased with our trip and experience with Austin Party Bus. We will definitely be using this company again next time we are in Austin! Thanks for making our Labor Day weekend an unforgettable one!"

                "description": "I called this business to inquire about a party bus rental. When I started to ask general questions, the man on the phone (unfortunately I did not get his name), kept telling me to refer to the website. When i asked him if he could please tell me his thoughts on how long the bus was needed for, etc over the phone because it was easier for me to do as I could not look at my phone at the time, he very rudely said \"I just don't understand why you can't just look this up on our website.\"   I do not think it is too much to ask to provide basic information over the phone, and the snarky, rude comment was completely uncalled for and one of the more unprofessional customer service experiences I have had. Needless to say, I will not be using Austin Party Bus for my transportation."

                "description": "Booked a limo bus to take 23 people to float the Guadalupe River in New Braunfels, six hours round trip.    Bus: The rate was so much better than every other place I found that I worried the bus would be shabby.  Not so.  Bench-style limo seating, hardwood floors, good sound system, and a pole for dancing.  My birthday guests were all impressed.   Service: Our driver Mike quickly answered every question I had in the weeks leading up to the event (and I had a lot).  He gave us an excellent rate, arrived on time, and was very polite and accommodating.  We were a loud, rowdy birthday crew, but he never seemed to mind.  The first toob place we visited was sold out, so he called another and even got us a group rate!    Overall: Very happy, no complaints.  I plan a few different party buses every year, and I will be using Sixth Street Rides from now on."

                "description": "We purchased a MooLaLa deal for a 5hr wine tour from Sixth Street Rides for up to 15 people.  The deal was supposed to end before we were able to get the group together but Sixth Street Rides was very accommodating on extending our deal to March (2 months after the deal was supposed to expire).  Mike handled our requests including moving the date and giving us suggestions on where to go with complete respect and professionalism.  I received a confirmation the day before as well as our driver, Chris,  called us 20 mins before our pick up time.  We had a couple hiccups (including running late - as 15 girls tend to do - as well as running late at our last winery stop) but Chris handled it with the utmost patience and ease.    Honestly I couldn't have asked for a better company to use for our wine tour.  I highly recommend Chris and Matt over at Sixth Street Rides."

                "description": "\"I had such an amazing 21st birthday party with Austin Party Bus. It's almost a year later and my friends still talk about how much fun they had. They all want party busses for their birthdays/graduation parties. My only complaint was the A/C did not work from the get go of the ride, my birthday was in May so it was pretty hot on that 22 person bus, but no one had a stroke so it was still a good time. Just make sure you get a bus with an A/C. Other than that, no complaints about this company. Driver was on time (11:00), and took us wherever we wanted to go. We had the bus for 4 hours which was more than enough time. Spent an hour or so on the bus, got dropped off down town for 2 hours, then rode it for the last hour and dropped people off back in west campus. It was perfect!\""

                "description": "So many good things to say. I first and foremost am not a cider guy. Came in here on a referral from a friend and was surprisingly impressed with the operation. The cider was good they had some crisp ciders that came off more like a beer if that's what you need. My favorite was the blood orange or the pear. Still a toss up between the two. Also this place has some crazy good wines. They are cheap for a much better quality compared to the ones you get in most stores. They had football running great AC for that Texas heat. Best of all they allow dogs! When I came in my novice skills when drinking wine and ciders were put aside by the owner who gave me a great understanding and tour of his selections. The staff are all super friendly too!  There are no downsides to this place. Except for the hangovers. (Mostly self inflicted) I recommend Sundays. For your visit. There is a cool little coffee shop inside too. Nervous Charlie's was serving up brunch. Soo many good combinations outside of your regular mimosa routine. Do yourself a favor. You are not too cool to break away from your traditions to try this place.  In regards to the cider snobs leaving bad reviews. They obviously didn't come here for something new. Why would you want to go somewhere that copied someone else? Boring.... wish they could get more stars."

It's very laid back, intimate, and relaxing with its clean aesthetic. Down in South Atx, we have Texas Keeper (awesome cidery, very different fireflies-on-the-porch and farmside vibes), so it was nice to see a completely different cidery with literally garage-space, elevated, and hipster vibes.   We both got cider flights, and loved the diversity of selections. Their ciders are all hilariously named (Fuccboisen is my favorite...I should've ordered that). I enjoyed their Smell the Van and EZ Tea (it truly tastes like tea!). The EZ tea was so delicious. Quenches thirst, subtle, and very honey-like. Their ciders aren't sickeningly sweet, and the flights give you a great little taste of all of the ciders that you're curious about but are unsure about getting a whole pint of. Their inventory has a clean design too. Their tees are super adorable, as well as their BEVERAGES sweaters. Tempting.  Service was wonderful. Our cider taptender was a wonderful man who was very sweet, knowledgeable and welcoming. The space is small, so it's not recommended you come here with a huge group (unless you plan on taking up the entire space. They have strong wifi, serve-yourself water, and different styles of seating from regular tables to taller barstools. They have little succulents on the table along with a well-designed menu for their \"specials\" deals. I would usually go to 4th Tap next door, but why not do both and hit up Fairweather too?"

If you're here at 11am, which would you pick? Why not both? Good vibes, good music, and a great atmosphere.  Bartenders are super friendly. I like it here! Check out 4th Tap and the pizza truck outside as well!"

But, after some friends who are also beerdrinkers suggested this place and that it wasn't your typically overly-sweet cider (which is what I have the aversion to) suggested this place, I decided \"why not?\".  The vibe here is super chill and the cider-barista was super nice and everyone there chimed in when I asked about the diff ciders they were offering.   So I will say, while I am still not on the cider bandwagon (I mean beer will always be my first love), the ciders here were actually drinkable! I enjoyed that they were on the drier side so your mouth isn't annihilated by chocolate and you can actually appreciate the different flavor components of each one! I will also give them kudos for actually packing a little bit of a punch w/the abv, which you don't usually see with ciders either!  Definitely enjoyed the vibe and the concept here!"

It all started with a long wait for barbecue and a guy wearing a cidery shirt/hat. A quick google search later I dragged my family to this tap room so I could get a cider fix (having spent five years in the PNW it is a tough itch to scratch here in TX). The bartender/coowner was extremely friendly and ready to answer all questions. He was adorable and alone was reason enough for a follow up visit.  My sister and I had a flight of their four ciders on tap. Currently:  Common: base for all other cider, ACTUALLY DRY. In lurv Tejano dreams: green chile cider, bomb af. Strong pepper aroma and beautiful subtle Chile flavor. Nelson sauvin (I think).... very strong hop flavor forward with sweet cider finish. A good balance for people seeking hop flavor while trying to expand to cider. huell melon: hop flavor is SO subtle that it almost tastes like sour fruit flavor. I LOVED this cider. I can't wait to try it again.  Opens only Fri-Sun this is definitely a stop to add to your weekend plans. There are big things coming for this cidery. I can't wait to watch them grow.  I loved this cidery and cider and definitely recommend to anyone in the area."

                "description": "I really love Fairweather's concept and having a new addition to Metric Row that isn't another brewery! (Love to y'all breweries, though.)  I came here the day after opening day with a few friends who love cider (I'm indifferent) to try out their brews. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised!  We each ordered a flight of their four ciders on tap. One was the Common, which is the base for all their ciders. Another was one of my favorites even though it involved a little heat from some peppers! The last two were hopped ciders, and the bartender/co-owner told us if we tried them first in different orders, we may like one over the other. He was right, both both were delightful.  I want to give a five-star review to support a new business, but my only tiny complaint would be the fruit flies. Some kept buzzing about here and there, but you can only imagine they want to get a taste of this dry cider sweetness!  If you're a beer person like me, you may have found a new hangout for your friends who don't love beer as much as you. But you'll still enjoy what Fairweather has to offer -- so much so, I ordered a 12-oz pour of my favorite hopped cider after my flight!  Good luck, guys, and congrats on your opening!"

                "description": "Fairweather was a surprise find for me thanks to the wise owner of Sunrise Mini Mart.  That guy knows SO much about all different types of distilled liquids, I wish I had a brain that could store that much knowledge.   I digress, this review is about the awesome family who started Fairweather (super friendly and knowledgeable).  I bought their cans of Common and was blown away.  Cideries claim to have dry cider all the time, but it's not TRULY dry.  Common though was legit.  These guys are making a truly BONE DRY English style cider from apples sourced from the PNW.   It's not perfect yet, but you can taste the potential. It reminds me of Shacksbury.  The fun artwork on the can intrigued me to go check out this spot that was just a few minutes drive away.  The tasting room is TINY! Start small and dream big! Kuddos to them for turning a cold warehouse space into a fun modern hipster community watering hole.  On a Friday night, get here early to even find a spot to sit!  I arrived around 5:30pm and sat at a high table outside and had no line.  By 7pm, people were crowded elbow to elbow, with a long line.  There also is very limited parking.  Be prepared to take time to find a spot and walk.  When they state they are pet friendly they mean it. Not only was my furry friend chilling with others, we were soon joined by a parrot!  I had a great time. I had come by myself, but ended up having several great conversations with people I had never met before.  Truly this place is only months old, and has quickly become a new neighborhood hang out.  The ciders are all 6.5%.  You can enjoy a flight of 4x4OZ for $10, enjoy a glass, or enjoy a guest cider or something from Austin Winery. I love the local support for other local liquid makers. There is a wide range of ciders to choose from.  They have some fun experimental ciders that were not like anything I have tried before.  It's hard to choose just four for a flight.  They have their staples- Common, EZ TEA, and Tejano Dreams, but also some Dry Hopped Ciders, and fruit ciders. My favorites were Tejano Dreams (nice kick), Gin Bot, and Dr. Rudi."

Their cider is so amazing with fusions with sweet tea, gin, wine and different fruits, it'll definitely give you a pleasant experience you may not have been expecting. They also have so many more flavor options than what they offer in the store so id go to the cider for more options. You can also take pictures in front of the interesting wall art with the unicorn things going on."

You can get a flight or by the glass. If you are usually a beer drinker or new to ciders, they will definitely let you try a few so you can find your favorite.   If you are hungry, there are usually food trucks at 4th tap and they let you bring food in. It is not officially dog friendly but sometimes they have a table outside when the garage is open."

It's quite small, but there was ample seating when I was there. Their cider is different from most of the dry ones I've had before - my favorite was the common with citrus-y flavors. The Apple flavor wasn't as strong as I was expecting (or used to with other ciders), and maybe that's just the case with a \"true\" dry cider. It tasted almost like a wine, which is great if you're a wine lover, I suppose!"

He then refused to take us home from the second winery which was an hour and a half away from where we live?? He said we were drunk even though 1. We hadn't even had 2 regular sized glasses of wine total and 2. Isn't that why you hire a driver?? So you don't drink and drive? He put his finger in my mom's face so close it was basically touching her nose. When my brother tried to calmly speak to him, the driver dramatically told him to back up because he was \"dangerous\" and started filming. The video he took will clearly show that no one was threatening him. The other people at the winery came up to us after and could not believe how he acted and that he just left us in the middle of no where. He also called the cops on us and then drove away laughing. What if one of us had a medical condition and needed to get home to take medicine? We had to call all of our friends to see if one of our friends could pick us up since there were no ubers / Lyfts.

The driver was dismissive of us from the start, we needed help setting up the Bluetooth speakers but he was clearly trying to rush us from the moment we got in the bus. At what was supposed to be the halfway point of our trip, the driver came into the winery and told the owner we were 'running late' and they needed to rush us out. This company had over booked themselves and instead of calmly talking to us to resolve the situation, they decided that abandoning a group of people - an hour and a half away from our destination - was the best course of action. The driver had also called the police after escalating the situation himself which was both unprofessional and a waste of the officers time. To add insult to injury, the driver was laughing while he drove away without us. We were lucky enough to have friends drive out and get us, but it was a terrible end to what was supposed to a fun experience. I would not recommend this company if you expect transport to be completed both to and from your destination."

                "description": "Two years in a row now, me and my peeps have used this company to chauffeur us around the hill country wineries.  Beautiful idea, that.  Depending on how many people you have and what kinda of car you want, they will tote you around in a shuttle bus, a limo, or even a stretch hummer.    What is sooo cool about this company, is that they are so laid back about every event you schedule with them.  They will let you bring ungodly amounts of food and booze on the bus or limo and you can get as loud and unruly as you want, as long as you don't puke in the vehicle.  Last year  got a little rowdy and alll the girls ended up pole dancing in the shuttle bus!    We always bring party trays of sammiches, cheese n crackers, and lots of easy to drink beverages, like box wine or premade mixed drinks. We have them pick us up at my house at 10 am and they bring us back at 6.  And in that time we are usually able to visit 5 wineries.  When you call to set this up, talk to Bob.  He will visit with you on the phone for a long time, finding out where you want to go and making recommendations on new places.  He is a real sweetheart.  The drivers have always been very helpful also in recommending places and in general by putting up with our drunken behavior i.e. pulling the limo into a convenience store to pee several times in route......  One more kindness they extended to me this year.  We had reserved the airport shuttle style bus again as we had 10 people on our tour and low and behold pulling up in front of my house was the stretch hummer.  I was a little nervous about a mixup but they said not to worry, the bus had a flat that morning so we just got upgraded....now that thing was pimped out!  Blue running lights inside, nice stereo system (I bring my own cd's), and glasses and cups lining the backs of the seats.  Only problem with the hummer is it is kinda difficult to get in and out of for older people or anyone with a gimpy leg.  Only 2 back doors and a steep step down.  Gotta crab walk if you are sitting near the front.  Small regrets compared to a great day of hangin with my peeps, sampling wine and enjoying our hill country."

Will was polite and professional and helped us pick out wineries to go to.  We went to five wineries and my girlfriend and I were a little drunk by the end.  We had booked five hours (12pm-5pm) but knew we had gone over that by 30 minutes and were fine with that.  When the driver wanted us to pay for the extra time he said \"Well, you went an hour and half over but I'll put it down as an hour and fifteen\".  I called him on it and said it was only thirty minutes.  He showed me his watch and for some unknown reason his watch showed 6:30pm.  My girlfriend and I both got out our cell phones and showed him that it was in fact 5:30pm.  He then backed down and charged us for thirty minutes.  At the time, I let it pass and even tipped him quite well cause his service had been good.  Later, when I was more sober, I realized that it was extremely peculiar for his watch to be an hour *ahead*.  I am pretty certain he was actively trying to scam us for an extra hour and don't appreciate someone trying to take advantage of me when I've had some to drink."

                "description": "Found this company on Yelp. Last Sunday, I booked their party shuttle to take 9 women on wine tours for my sister's birthday. Their pricing is dramatically better than all the other companies I researched.  When they showed up, they arrived with the stretch hummer limo - free upgrade due to an issue with the shuttle radio from the party the day before.  Drive showed up almost right on time. Our driver was nice, knowledgeable and all the part-goers were very pleased.    I highly recommend you visit the wineries n a Sunday instead of a Saturday. We visited 6 wineries and had the place to ourselves at most wineries. In contrast, when I've gone on a Saturday, the wineries were overwhelmed, which meant you received no personal service and had to wait in lines - and thus you visit less wineries. Sundays and Bluebonnet Wine Tours are the way to go."

I reserved a party bus for last Saturday to take some girlfriends on a wine tour to celebrate my 25th birthday.  Everything was fantastic from beginning to end!  They were at least a hundred dollars cheaper than any other place I called, and I feel like we could not have gotten better service.    When I made the reservation, I estimated that we would have around 15 girls and Bob reserved the 16 passenger bus for us.  However, a few days before the event I realized that we actually had 17 people.  I called Bob (slightly panicking that he wouldn't have a solution) and was pleasantly surprised that he offered to upgrade us to a larger bus for no additional charge!  Happy birthday to me!  Our driver (Justin or Jason... I think his name was Jason) arrived 15 minutes early and was extremely patient with us the entire time.  I mean, what other guy could put up with that many screaming, dancing, drunk 20-somethings on a long car ride??  Jason was very professional but also very personable.  He even suggested a winery (Woodrose) that was not on our original tour - and I'm so glad he did!  Woodrose was very low-key and had some great live music (it was perfect for our first stop).    We ended up only going to three wineries on our tour (we were slated to go to four) but that was completely our fault - we just spent wayyyy too much time at each stop.  All in all, this was the perfect way to celebrate my birthday!"

The picnic tables outside are plentiful but were all full when we arrived. Luckily two guys let us join them. I had the Raspberry Berliner Weisse and it quickly became my new favorite. It is sweet and crisp without being overly sweet. Our friends both got the Cream Ale and loved it. We all walked out with growlers. Everyone there is super friendly and very welcoming. We had the baby with us which was fine (there were a few kids there)...but every time a car was exiting we would have to wrangle him down (minor downfall of basically sitting alongside the parking lot). We are looking forward to visiting again."

                "description": "Bluebonnet Beer Company is simply amazing. They are a little difficult to find, look for the side street behind the post office and you should notice it on the right.  Their beers are super delicious, I had the wit, pecan brown ale , cream ale and hef. Out of all of them, the cream ale and wit come highly recommended. They are so smooth and drinkable.  There is a schnitzel food trailer that serves some pretty decent food. The place is small but all of the employees I encountered were nice and friendly. For seating, there is only plastic benches avaliable located in the front of the brewery. Not really any kind  of shade or landacaping but this is expected since it is such a small brewery.  It may not have all of the amenities and backyard space that other larger breweries in Austin have. But if you love beer and want to interact with some awesome, friendly people then Bluebonnet Beer Company is the way to go. Everything is tasty and pints are currently at $5 each, you can't beat that price."

We go when it's raining and all tables are outside for the exception of the owners table that was inside.

                "description": "Great little brewery in my hometown of Round Rock!  My family and I came here on a Friday around 6:30 to grab a few beers and relax. If it's cold outside, I highly recommend bringing a layer or two as there is only a bit of seating inside but about four picnic tables outside. Also, wait to grab dinner at the brewery as they have rotating food trucks Thursday-Saturdays. When we went, they had a lobster roll truck that served amazing rolls.   I started out with their Oktoberfest beer, which was very good! My mom, who is not a big beer drinker, got their shandy and thought it would be great for a hot day. The beers are $5 a pint, and I thought it was really cool they have a series related to the Immortal 10.   Parking is not a hassle, the beer is very good, the people are friendly, and your hardest job will be finding a seat. Enjoy!"

Beer is tasteful and I don't always love IPA. Their indoor seating is limited by this isn't normally a problem in Texas. They have plenty of tables outside and also have tents in the summer. No food but there is always a food truck - if you follow them on Facebook you can see what it is ahead of time.   Staff is always friendly and accommodating. Plenty of space for puppies here too.   They are only open Friday evenings and Saturday! I wish they had some openings on Sunday."

Their Cream Ale was a new beer idea to me...tried that and WOW, creamy and light...Very Good.  What a Great Place and Team!!!  Thank You soo Much!!!

We know that they are popular and were even excited to try Jimmy Vega's Smokehouse but when we arrived half of the available tables were set as reserved. There was literally no where to sit. Every table was packed. We had our 3 yr old son with us, so standing wasn't an option, especially since we wanted to eat too. We asked anyway if any of the tables were available and was told no, they are all reserved for 5pm, but you could squeeze in anywhere else. In the end, we left irritated and disappointed, while I understand reserving tables, but when you only have 10 tables and you reserve 5 of them, that doesn't leave much room for anyone else."

They have a solid line up across a wide style of beers. The summer wit is a favorite along with the Kolsch styles they release during the fall. I would love to see them expand to a new location  with a climate controlled tasting room which I think would bring in a lot more clientele."

We noticed that staff attention to customers had been a little lacking and very slow. I think this has more to do with our crappy country and COVID. But who am I to judge?

I don't think I've ever been in a bar with such nice and professional staff. They have an epic beer selection. Though beer isn't my thing, the selection still impressed me! They helped me select a beer, as I said, beer isn't my thing. They were patient and actually found me an option to \"get me through the night\". I did move on to margaritas though, and were these delicious! So why the 4 starts, well, they kept running out of things. For instance, my margarita went skinny when they ran out of the regular mix they use. Then, they ran out of limes! The margaritas, even the skinny ones, were fantastic! They use A LOT of ice, but still tasted delicious. Decor was wonderful for Christmas. It was just a warm and inviting space. We will definitely go back if we are ever back in that area! Parking was sufficient, as it was a weeknight. I'm sure that helped for it not to be too crowded. Everything was very clean also. Just a great place to go and meet with friends over drinks. If you're expecting tapas, call ahead to see when the kitchen closes. The kitchen had closed shortly after we got there, which was a bummer. Regardless, check this place out if you're in the area!"

The back courtyard has giant Jenga and other games and there are plenty of seating options both indoors and outdoors. Just recently tried their food and the loaded fries were pretty good!

Service is outstanding, they always have A great selection of beer on tap and if you are confused or just can't decide, ask, staff is great and matching your preferences to their current selections. Over the last couple weeks my friends and I have enjoyed flatbreads and sandwiches - Tasty and fresh. The options these days in this area, post Covid, are rather slim - But it is definitely worth you stopping in and staying for a while... They have a nice sitting area out back when it's not too warm outside."

                "description": "I was looking forward to returning to the Brass Tap because I have had a good experience on a prior visit. There were a couple of mistakes by our server at first, but I chalked it up to him possibly being new or simply having an off night. Unfortunately, the service progressively got worse throughout the dinner. From spilling a drink on the table, to telling us he wasn't focused, to the bartender remaking the drink and under pouring it, and it taking almost 20 minutes to receive our check after we asked three times for it, you can't blame it on anything but a lack of effort. Continuous poor service can truly ruin an evening if you let it."

                "description": "My Fiancee' and two friends of ours visiting from Dallas area decided to check this place out on Friday night.  I read the reviews on Yelp (as I always do before going), and suggested this place to them.  I am sorry for doing so. We got there, in what seems to be happening area of downtown Round Rock, which I did not know existed.  There are several bars in this same stretch of road.  Parking was easy on the street.  Once we got in, it has the bar and lot of the front area filled (no social distancing here).  Sign at the front read, \"Seat yourself, and we will find ya\".  We sat at a table/booth section across from the bar near the back.  Our waiter, seems like he did not know much.  We asked him questions, and he was not sure.  We found out though, if you don't want beer, they are limited on other alcohol.  I wanted a Grey Goose and tonic.  They did not have Grey Goose.  I asked for Ketel One.  They did not have.  They said they only have local vodkas, \"Dripping Springs\" and \"Titos\".  I went with \"Titos\" and waiter asked three times, what I wanted with the vodka.  My friend got a \"Apple-tini\".  It came in a very small v-shapped glass, that looked like not much more then a shot...and it had ice chips floating in her drink.  She used to be a bartender, and knew that is not what you are supposed to have there.  Also, her boyfriend had a Long Island Ice tea.  He sipped it, and it was not tasting right.  So, she walked up to the bar to get it fixed.  They told her to go back and get her mask and come back (*mind you, no patrons at bar were wearing a mask).  She did so, and ask if they could remake it.  They did so, and brought to our table by different waitress person, and he tasted it, and still not right.  So, my friend asked the waitress if they knew what they put in it.  They went thru all the ingredients and found out they use \"lemonade\" instead of  \"sweet and sour\" , which made it taste really sweet.  The food was just ok.  My friend got a salad, and looked like left over pieces of lettuce they had lying around. The nachos were just ok, and the reuben and cuban were ok.  It took us about 15 min or more just to get our waiter to come back to get bill.  They pay attention to bar area, but not much in area around it.  Sorry, won't be back."

                "description": "After enjoying delicious food and well poured drinks from my favorite bartender Tanya, I was blindsided for having a political opinion. I was shushed and shunned by the staff for having any kind of point of view. I decided to move to the main bar to be by myself and was then questioned by the staff, who blew the whole thing out of proportion. I was told that I needed to leave the premises by some screening bartender because I was \"disturbing other people\"; all while never raising my voice. If the staff had not perpetuated drama, it would have been dropped. I would not suggest this bar unless you're absolutely certain that you're going to be quiet and pay for over price drinks for underwhelming service from the newer waitstaff. Weak management."

When you walk in they have mostly a collection of not your average beer. For those looking for bud, coors etc time to expand your horizons lol. Every month they switch up which brewery they get select draft beers from, notably good draft  breweries!  This month they were featuring Clown Shoes, a brand that  has some really great  IPAs and high % which is nice. Tried a 12.5% stout while here and it was amazing. For sure a beer lovers bar!"

We had an excellent server and really liked the \"Snug\" we sat in.  The seating options are pretty and a unique feature actually.   Seating: Large tables, small tables, \"Snugs\"(private little cubby with plenty of room), bar seating, outdoor tables and cozy seating around a fireplace outside.   The food: Pretzel w/ dipping trio. Yes! These are excellent w/ an awesome sourdough flavor.  The fish and chips was pretty good. Great batter with a ton of flavor in it. The pizza (ordered without the pepperoni). The dough was under proved and under cooked. Ok at best.  The irish stew was pretty to look at but had none of the heart or depth of flavor that you'd expect from a stew. My soul was craving a hot heart stew, no luck. Disappointing.   Drinks: No wells here!! Just a quality selection of excellent wines and spirits.   We'll definitely be back and try a new selection of foods! If you're looking for a place to visit/meet up, this is a great venue. Plentyyyyyy of room!!"

I want to start off by saying I hadn't eaten breakfast, lunch, or dinner prior to arriving there which you could only imagine I was hangry(hungry + angry)    So I park my car and Soon as I step on the curb to make my way towards the door the hostess had already opened the door and was greeting my wife and I with a warm and friendly greeting.   As a manager myself, I always preached that our customers should never have to touch the door and I was so glad to see this establishment have the same values about it as I do.   We sat down and in no time our waiter Homer was at our table greeting us. I must say he was very personable. He truly grasp the concept of building rapport with his customers.   The food came out pretty quick which was a huge plus because a I stayed before I was \"Hangry\"  My fries were cold, but then again they're fries so I just asked for some fresh ones that had some heat to it lol.  My wife order the 8HR Braised Short Rib and she stated it was just ok.  I asked for lemon pepper wings, My receipt shows that's what I got, but I can tell you that want what came in my plate. Was I made about it NO, why you ask? Because whatever the heck it was taste pretty darn good. I should have asked what was I given because I wouldn't mind ordering it again.  My fish and chips was freaking AMAZING and whatever little SAUCE they give you to dip you food into.... AMAZING!!! make sure you ask for extra so you get enough to dip your fries in it to lol. My wife tried my fish and chips and said she couldn't wait to come back to get that next time.   On our way out the door the host struck again with grabbing the door for us and she did it with a smile. As I was walking my way to the car another employee told me how much they appreciated our business and I'm thinking to myself write your done working your on your way to your own car to head home and you still take the time out to make is feel special. I feel that the friendly service has us excited to come back and eat here again and we are looking forward to it."

They also control the mosquitoes which could ruin any patio dining experience for me. It's a win all around!  I can't wait to come back to this piece of Ireland in Round Rock, the managers told us that a lot of their restaurant decor are from Ireland shipped here. That's pretty personal and lovely in my book."

Staff is friendly, never have I ran into any issues with reservation or walk ins. If you want to sit outside I would recommend just calling in and making a reservation.   PET FRIENDLY! Same goes with my recommendation with a reservation, if you're bringing your pet just make one so they know where to seat you outdoors. Call before :)  The menu is great! I've tried a lot of different vegetarian/pescatarian options on the menu and haven't been disappointed. You have to try the pizza!   I don't drink alcohol so I can't review on that but from what I see and have heard it's really tasty.   I love going to lunch and dinner here, so much fun.   The patio has one of the chillest vibes in the area.  Go eat and chill! :)"

                "description": "First of all, the place is beautiful inside and out. That's the main sell 100%. The food is good and so are the drinks but a little overpriced for their outdoor menu. A guiness draught at any type of irish pub shouldn't go for $9 nor any bar for that matter in my opinion. All food and drink prices could be $1-2 less, especially if it's a limited outdoor menu. If we were dining in (and it's beautiful inside + full menu offered), I could see those prices being fair. If the drinks were to be $1-2 less in the future, we could see ourselves being regulars, but definitely not until then.  Two of our friends ordered the wagyu burger, when asked on how it compares to a non-wagyu burger, they said they wouldn't have noticed anything especially different to a regular burger in comparison if they had not read the menu.  Nonetheless, they seemed to enjoy it.   I would order the reuben sandwich again with the kimchi slaw. I thought the kimchi slaw was very creative and it added nice flavor contrast to the otherwise classical meaty cheesy aspects of the reuben. The kimchi by itself was good, they use older more fermented kimchi, which gave the sandwich a bit of sourness to it.   My wife ordered the fish n' chips, one of her favorite barfoods. The fish itself was very moist and tender and it appears much larger in portion size than what we were expecting when looking at other user's yelp photos. The chile-lime tartar sauce wasn't very 'chile-limey' at all, it tasted just like regular tartar sauce, don't get me wrong - we LOVE any tartar sauce, but they could dial up the chile and lime all the way to the moon if that's what they're advertising.   Lastly, the staff was nice, although our waitress basically dissappeared for the second half of our stay and kept forgetting/taking an unquestionably and questionably long time to get our drinks and takeout box. Service was just OK, there is always next time.   Bonus points for the restrooms, very neat, clean and well decorated."

The Fish and Chips  and Reuben Sandwich are delicious and portions generous. The craft beer is also the best (Huckleberry wheat).  Plus the place is filled with great atmosphere, and plenty of history. Our server (Jewels) pointed out the wall plaques located all along the restaurant filled with tidbits of information. This contributes to the experience. The music is great and staff friendly. A very happy place! We drove from South Austin to visit, definitely retuning soon!"

                "description": "This brand new brewery is the spot to be lately and I can understand why : great outdoor space and patio,the ambiance is both appropriate for a romantic date or a friends outing.  I had the charred vegetables which were delicious although the portion was quite small. The pepperoni pizza is cooked in a wood fire oven and was delicious. Overall, it was a good experience, my cons would be the service (organization still balbutiating and we waited 30 min for our drinks) and it's pricey for the size of the portions. $14 a cocktail is overpriced, but their craft beers were good."

The drinks were \"okay\". Not great, but not bad. The food was what was disappointing. I ordered the flaming bacon burger. The waitstaff that brought it over, said \"wait I have to light it on fire\", and she took off quickly without another word and before I could ask how long I was supposed to leave it lit- We had said we hadn't been there before, so it was all new.  So my entrée tasted like 151. It was gross. The fries were pretty generic, so they didn't make up for the burger debacle. Likely to return? Nah."

                "description": "5 stars for the atmosphere/design. 4 stars for the manager that tried to help correct some mistakes. 3 stars for our server that seemed to have pushed beyond her limit. 2 stars for a good looking menu that was greatly under-delivered. 1 star for the overall management and organization of the restaurant.   We had a group of 6 that was sat outside on patio. We ordered charcuterie, pretzels, wedge salad, hot wings and lemon pepper wings, a beer flight, the Carrie Bradshaw, the smoked margarita and a few standard mixed drinks.  After placing our order, we were brought 5 place settings for the 6 of us. We asked several times for the 6th set which was eventually delivered after all the food was gone. The servers keep saying that they didn't have any silverware or plates left!  ‍  Our drink orders rolled out so slow that we had to go to the bartender ourselves to make sure the order was ever placed. The manager came over to apologized which was very nice and professional.  The charcuterie was delivered without any explanation  of what everything was. It was a very odd mix of flavors from sweet to acidic that did not pair well.  The pretzels were by far everyone's favorite. But it was also served with no description of the 3 sauces. The thick white cream was actually an amazing garlic butter that we all devoured once we finally figure it out.  The wedge salad looked beautiful and was enough for all 6 of us to have some. I only thought it was weird that they covered it in ranch inside of blue cheese   Both flavors of hot wings were so salty that it ruined the rest of the flavors. The sizes were good though.  All of their beers except the ipa fell flat and not good. The mixed drinks were super yummy and I really enjoyed my Carrie Bradshaw.   The 6 of us were all in agreement that this place was such a sad waste. It looks so cool and could be really something great if they execute their food on a higher level and manage their staff/facility better.  We won't be back unless they can turn it around"

The outdoor games will be perfect for friends, parties and the kids. I know my toddler will love running around and playing and checking out the turtles in the creek down below.   The food was okay.

I started with a glass of caymus since it's $2 off for Happy Hour and although it's yummy as usual the tiny pour made me a little sad but I have to remember some people measure wine to the T. We also had the drink with Tito's and watermelon and the one with empress gin and rosemary, both were tasty and again $2 off for happy hour. For an appetizer we had the pretzels and the short ribs and both were prepared well. Finally our meal, I had the Cuban sandwich and my friend had the roasted vegetables, no complaints about either and I'd absolutely order the Cuban again. I'll definitely be back but may steer clear of wine due to tiny pours unless I get a bottle."

All of us commented how the atmosphere is lively and how we like the decor and that service is good.  But the consensus this time, as at our other visits is that the menu is somewhat disappointing.  The food is a cross between general bar food and a smattering of Irish pub dishes.  What we had was fine but a variety of true entrees is what's lacking.  Maybe more Irish fare would be good like shepherd's pie, corned beef and cabbage, smoked salmon, etc.?  The burgers and sandwiches are okay but just a few more options would be great."

The beer and cocktail selection is fantastic, too. I will have to update my review after we have the opportunity to eat indoors. After two visits, the outdoor menu (while great), was getting a bit redundant. Chicken wings, salads and pretzels all very good.   I believe they have more offerings inside, so again -- we'll try that as soon as possible.  Also: don't miss the restrooms! They are super cool. The women's room was inspired by the luxury restrooms on the Titanic, I believe!"

The seating area was comfortable and well shaded. The on-site food truck served up an amazing chipotle steak quesadilla; it had the right blend of savory and spice. Together, the beverages at BA and the lineup at the food truck were a great pairing! We are on vacation here in Texas and we're hoping to return to the Barking Armadillo before we head home!"

Husband had the Witbier (one of his go to styles) and I had the Hefe and (limited) strawberry farmadillo.  We ordered chips and queso and tacos from the taco truck onsite. We enjoyed those as well. Very solid meat in those tacos and very filling!  We will return, but try to come earlier so we can sit on the patio instead of inside. Some of the guests inside were not vigilant about masking when leaving their table. I would suggest some signage on the interior tables (at least) reminding them of this request.  There are dogs allowed inside which did not bother us at all (we have 2 at home). But, some people are not as comfortable with dogs inside so I feel it needs to be mentioned.  Looking forward to trying more beers in the future!"

There is nice shaded outdoor seating. Inside has a few video games and pinball. There is plenty of seating insight with high tops and tables. There is a nice couch and a couple of comfy chairs.   The bartenders are great. The beer selection changes with a handful or regular lagers and IPAs. The stout is coffee based. The Belgian heavy is fantastic, better than Devil's Backbone. Prices are fair. People might argue about the single kind of glassware, but I'm unbothered.  Would be good to have a few more interesting board games their for more of a social atmosphere, but hard to argue with success."

Food is always hot and fresh, ready when I am and made to order. Wish they would include more beer cheese, but that's just cause I like it so much! Would love to come in for a pint and check out more of the menu and plan to do that soon. Staff are friendly and helpful. Overall a place I will frequent as much as possible when I'm in the mood for a good burger."

                "description": "Was there about 9 pm last night. My companion wanted a really good burger and Yelp gave us this place.   We were the only patrons eating at tables. There were a few guys at the bar. Since I wasn't really hungry, we decided to order their signature burger which is made with ground brisket and ground meat from short ribs. I asked for it to not be overcooked. We talked about the cooking temperature with the waitress and she assured us it would be cooked medium. When it came out it was more like well-done. Pretty dry meat and not all that tasty. The bun seemed like it was homemade and was good, as were all the veggies they put on it. Fries were nothing special.   We will be back and I will try their fish and chips.   Service was good and the prices for what we had were consistent with 2021 inflation prices. I am sure this would be the place to be when a soccer game was on.   Music playing on their sound system was very good too."

This definitely brought me back to my Navy days of Portsmouth and London Pub style fish and chips! Perfectly battered and fried with that nice light crunch when you bite into it. The buffalo cauliflower bites was a first time try for me also. All vegetables need too be made this way. Not too spicy but just right.  This was a takeout order and everything was still hot and crispy when I got home. Perfect spot for any occasion."

I came across the Fort Kenney Pub in Yelp and knew that the following Saturday would start with a fry up!  When we walked in, the staff were all super friendly and welcoming. It wasn't busy as it was still early but there was plenty of seating and the football could be seen from most of them.  The food was great and everything I had hoped for! I subbed black pudding for an extra sausage which our server was more than happy to do. The sausages were really delicious!  Really enjoyed spending my Saturday morning here eating a yummy breakfast. I would love to come back to try some of the other meals on the menu!"

I feel like they could have done better to give it a pub feel. It feels nothing like a pub which was disappointing.  I'm docking one star for the Pimm's Cup. It's made with that awful soda machine Minute Laud Lemonade. It was horrendous! That was all I could taste. Simple syrup and Minute Made Lemonade.  I also docked a star for the music. It was SO LOUD. My husband and I couldn't talk. Literally. Couldn't hear each other. We were starting to question whether we're hitting an age where we say things like \"the music is too loud\", but no. No no no. This was freaking ridiculous! They had a lady there playing it for an hour before she started what I think was a quiz or game. Music should add ambiance. This felt like we were sitting front row at a concert. It was insanity. To the point I'm totally okay removing a star because of it.  We'll probably go back for the food, but if we're in the mood for a cocktail, or conversation, it won't be high on our list."

                "description": "We've ordered from here a few times and quality of food and service is usually good. Today we got the burger, side salad, and chicken tika. Burger didn't come on pretzel bun like usual and meat was basically raw. Side salad was a generous portion but the cucumbers were moldy. Chicken Tika was awful. Looked like freezer bag pre cooked and seasoned chicken, dry and tasteless without the sauce. Rice was soggy mushy, clearly too much water in rice cooker when it was made. Bread that came with the tika had a yellow gel slime. Going to get people sick or worse serving up food like that.. When I called to let them know about the bad produce two different people took attitude with me about it, poor customer service. As someone that works in the food service industry I'm disappointed. Will not return or recommend to anyone."

                "description": "Today, on this lazy, rainy, gloomy, post-#AustinBlizzard2021 Sunday, Hubs and I were on the hunt for some true comfort food! Thus, we knew that crossing the proverbial pond was a must! This is how we found ourselves at Kenney Fort Pub. Can I just say, y'all, that what we had here was just what we needed? This is true English pub food, and it warmed the very cockles of our very recently frigid hearts!   Hubby went with the English Breakfast! As he was wolfing it down, he looked up at me with an actual sparkle in his eyes, and he said, \"Do you know what this reminds me of most recently, honey?\", and I said, \"Yep!\"! I knew right away that he was referring to that Irish Breakfast that he got at the military part of the airport in Shannon, Ireland, on the way to his too long deployment in Afghanistan in 2018! The picture that he sent me on WhatsApp of that breakfast in that airport is burned in my memory forever!   I went with the Sunday Roast, and it was bloody fantastic, as well! The picture tells the whole story! So good! Chris ate 3/4ths of it, which is our usual division of restaurant food, but I just loved everything about it! The horseradish sauce was MAGIC! I could bathe in it!   We ended with the Sticky Toffee Pudding, and damn, y'all! Just damn!  Bottom line: if you've never tasted either of these traditional plates across the pond, but you're the sort that likes little tastes of many things, both of these dishes will be RIGHT up your alley!   And, even if you're not down for little tastes of many things, you'll absolutely wax poetic about that pudding!   What a fantastic find!   p.s. Our server was Noah, and he was a gem!"

Everything was well seasoned. The kids fish and chips was great and my 5 year old ate it up.   I did not like the tikka masala. It was not creamy and felt heavy on the cumin. It was a smaller portion and not very much sauce. This was the only dish I didn't care for.     Also, when you pack up a to go order, please package the naan separate from thee sauce. It was packed together and the naan was all covered in the sauce that I didn't like so I didn't eat that either.    They need clearer instructions on what their pickup curbside process is. It was a little confusing but we just called and the man who answered brought our food out.  Maybe we were supposed to go get it inside?  I don't know.    I'm glad Kenney Fort Pub is in our neighborhood. I am sure  that we will be ordering curbside from them frequently."

I feel they either put an Texas flare or their own take on what British food taste like.    The burger was good, you  can't really mess up a burger.. well, maybe. The banger and mash, yall.... no. It tasted like a warmed up Slim Jim, the mashed potatoes had an odd flavor that none of could place. Maybe the mustard?

                "description": "Can't believe I haven't written a review here yet.  I went out of my way to get here. Was so looking forward to eating real British food.   I was going to be out this way during my first vaccine shot at Dell Diamond.  It was around lunch that I arrived here.  Waited a short time until they opened. Yes, I was the first one there.  First stop was to the loo.  Yes, it was labeled Loo. Started off with an order of iced tea.  Sorry, Brits no hot tea on a hot day. I asked the server if I could possible try the Black pudding they serve with breakfast. Turns out the server was one of the owner. So I got a slice. Ordered up a Scottish Egg and a plate of Bangers and mash.  I have had Scottish eggs before. These were a bit different because they used British sausage.   British sausage is very much leaner than US sausage.  The sausage meat surrounding the soft boiled egg was denser.  And it was served with picalilli (British salsa).  Loved these starters. Next up the bangers and mash and a slice of black pudding. Had to try the black pudding first.  Trust me it is not a pudding but a blood, oatmeal, pork fat, spices sausage. Before you turn your nose up, try it. A little nibble and interesting flavor. Bigger bite and it was good, before I knew it I finished it off and wish I had more. The banger was a Cumberland made sausage.  Lean pork shoulder meat makes it different than US sausages. Once you get over the difference, It is really good. But the mash potatoes, oh wow. They add mustard and cheddar cheese to theirs. Next batch of mash, I plan on adding mustard to mine. Now if that isn't enough, Red Onion gravy.  Take a slice of sausage, dip into the mash and make sure you have the gravy on it.... Prefect bite. I keep thinking the next time I go, I will get the fish and chips. But as I am writing this, all I can think about is the Bangers and Mash."

They also have different visiting food trucks which makes it fun and interesting. We went for Oktoberfest and really enjoyed the German food truck and had BBQ another day. Rentsch has plenty of outdoor, shaded seating and the beer selection is impressive with lots of interesting seasonal offerings - I really enjoyed the apple streusel seasonal beer. We'll absolutely be back."

They have a good variety of beer on the menu and have a really nice, relaxing outdoor space. the service is fast and friendly. They rotate food trucks so there is always something available to munch on.  We had such a good experience that we decided to join the 2021 mug club. Ask about it!"

We always bring games to play or invite friends to spend a few hours with. They have great seating inside and outside, with covered areas and fans. A beautiful garden with trees and a nice country view surrounding the brewery. Husband and I even had a small, intimate wedding here last fall! The staff are also very kind and always put a smile on our faces. 10/10 recommend if you're just visiting or a local looking for a new spot."

The blonde was really good also and my husband had the one up from the Hefeweizen, \"hef's  big brother\", and it was also tasty but too heavy for me. I'm more of a wine drinker but if you like beer you'd love it. We took our two kids and they had fun being outdoors with us. We ate at the food truck and had a family Sunday funday. Highly recommend!"

                "description": "I will preface this review with three biases.  1. I love beer 2. I love outdoor setups in Texas rural areas 3. I am a Red Raider  This is was our first trip out and loved it!  The beers were delicious.  I had the IPA, the double IPA, and the Amber.  Wife had the blonde and the Hefe.    My favorite was the IPA then the Hefe and then the Double.  Can't wait to go back and try more.  I missed the details on the mug club,  but like the concept and will have to check it out.  A little far from my house so not sure if the bang is worth the buck based on my frequency.  The atmosphere was fantastic.  Great patio and open space areas.  There was a Youngman playing cover music but there was enough space to where he didn't seem loud.  There was plenty of games and we brought some toys and our kid and others had a blast running around.  It was beautiful and spacious, yet plenty of space inside for when it it gets to crazy Texas temps in the summer.  Only bummer was the food truck was broke down so we just ordered Dominos instead! How easy is that?!  Looking forward to the next visit and recommend you check it out too"

                "description": "Cool little brewpub in Georgetown. They have two IPAs that caught my attention. Their Rentsch IPA is quite malty east coast style. Plus one had her usual lite Blonde ale and she was OK with it. She was not thrilled with the crisp finish but she did empty her pint. There is a cozy bar area with TVs and with the Temps reaching 100 degrees we chilled out there. There is also a nice beer garden with fans on the deck but even with the abundance of shade trees, it was too darn hot to be outside.  Lastly, the bartenders are pleasant and knowledgeable and will provide excellent guidance if you are a newbie. They do have some interesting specialty/seasonal beers that I must go back and try. Solid 4 stars!"

Had a great time, mother's day specials. Tried the Poppy Fest Red Ale. Right down my alley. Great place, great beer. I was a little disappointed w Pat's BBQ. Seemed to be over cooked. It was later in day and they were running out. I would give them another go. Can't  bash Rentsch for food truck."

Especially since I'm not the biggest \"craft-beer drinker\" he suggested the blonde which was just what I was looking for.  My friends had the doublerumtoberfest and rate it 10/10!!  I love the open concept that makes the space seem larger than it is. We came at 1pm on A Saturday, not too many people just A few family's enjoying their day. Their patio area looks super cozy but it's too cold today so I'll be back!"

                "description": "I was recently in Georgetown for the 20th Anniversary Annual Meeting of the Texas Master Naturalists. I stayed in my camper at Cedar Breaks and commuted daily to the conference at the Sheraton. I was at the Sheraton from dark to dark attending classes every day but the last. The conference ended at noon, and I headed straight to Rentsch.  I got a flight of beers and went outside to drink them. I was the only one there for the first twenty minutes or so. That gave me the freedom to move around from place to place. The outside area is really nice. I tried full sun areas and shaded areas. There were several bees in the area that pestered me, adding to my moves. The wind chimes were also a nice touch.  I liked all of the beers I tried. But two of them were amazing. They were the Bourbon Barrel Double Oktoberfest (2017) and the Double Rumtoberfest. Believe me, if I weren't alone and responsible for my own transportation back to camp, I would have stayed and had a few more Rumtoberfests. It was everything I like in a craft beer.  Georgetown was such a great to visit. I know I will be back to camp at Cedar Breaks. That obviously means that I will be back to the brewery. I only hope they have another beer as awesome as the Oktoberfest and Rumtoberfest. I am sure they are seasonal, and probably won't be on tap next time."

                "description": "I feel conflicted giving a fairly low rating given I consistently think of ABW as one of the top handful of breweries in Austin, but I'm giving this as a rating of the taproom experience moreso than a rating of their beers. I've also only gone during Covid, so I'm looking forward to giving them a try in the future when I can comfortably get the full experience.   Compared to other patios in the area I find theirs to be pretty lacking. There were no fans in the summer and no heat lamps in the winter. Their space isn't particularly large so there are fewer tables than other locations. This leads it to be uncomfortably packed on weekends, both in terms of how close tables are and the lack of distancing enforced in lines.   One weird thing working against them is just how available their beer is around town. Every HEB and bar will have at least a couple of ABW's beers available, so they lose out on the necessity of going to the taproom to try their beers. Even their seasonals get around town pretty well both in stores and on tap elsewhere.   On that note, and to not make this review totally negative, their beer is absolutely phenomenal. All their flagships are good to great examples of the style, my personal favorites are the Sun Shovel (think blue moon but with some hop prescence) and Fire Eagle (leans more towards West Coast IPA, but has enough juiciness to be really refreshing in the summer time).   Their seasonals also absolutely knock it out of the park. Sputnik (Coffee Oatmeal Stout) is an absolute must if you're in Austin in December and is probably the best beer I've had since moving here. The Heisenberg (a combination of a Pilsner and Hef) and Black Thunder (Black Lager) are two other stand outs to me.  The food truck is good enough that if you need something to snack on while you're there you won't be totally dissatisfied, but I've usually felt compelled to go elsewhere for food.  Overall, can't recommend their beer enough, but you don't need to visit the taproom to get the full experience."

                "description": "After three months of sheltering at home, Austin Beer Works was a first outing.  They did an excellent job with social distancing, wiping down each table after guests left, and mask enforcement (when not seated at table) in a firm but polite way.    No inside seating right now and the outdoor tables are shaded and a good distance apart. It is reservations only. depending on the time you make the reservation for, you will either get an hour to enjoy your table or two hours.  They go over all the rules with you when you arrive.  They have some great beers, both on tap and in cans. You can purchase some to take home with you as well!  I ordered a sour raspberry-lemon Einhorn.  So summery and refreshing!  I ended up drinking two.  My husband had an Essential IPA and the Small Spoon session IPA.   We didn't care for the Heisenberg Heff-lager (a bit too banana-ish).  The only thing that would have made the difference from 4 stars to 5 would have been some kind of food! Even a bag of chips or pretzels to go with the beer would have been awesome! We saw a food truck parked there but unfortunately it was not open."

The staff is incredibly helpful and knowledgable, but I think the best part of the experience (other than the drinks) is the atmosphere. The interior is very spacious which makes it a perfect space for a casual happy hour with coworkers while the exterior has an abundance of seating. I'll definitely be returning if I am ever up that direction!"

They do have a larger beer selection for local breweries, parking is hit and miss, outdoor seating is mostly shaded. Inside is picnic seating. There's a food truck here if you get hungry.

We waited in line with a mask on and ordered. The man was helpful and recommend the cherry sour to me since they don't have ciders. My boyfriend got two different lagers, one was dark and one was light(I think it was called like the best ever or the most awesome) he liked both a lot but preferred the lighter one, and I really liked my cherry sour. It would be nice to see breweries trying to use class beer cups instead of plastic but with covid most places are doing single use plastic sadly. We took our dog and everyone was friendly. They even give you chips and salsa with your drinks. The ambiance was great, there was a food truck, and a cool courtyard with tables and a kids area. All around a cool place!"

Walk in and turn left to place your order at the counter.  If you want to drink .. walk in and go straight to the bar.  They have salads, apps and several speciality pizzas ... sized from individual to family. You get soda from the fountain (cherry, cream, cola, etc) or beer from the tap (too many to cover here).   There are a few booths and tables but mainly it is community seating at 20' long tables. Kind of cool I think.  TVs everywhere ... watched baseball and ESPN. I bet this place is lit on Sat and Sun for football.  So the food? I really liked the beer mates .. garlic cheese bread. Good size and flavor for just $5. I had the pear honey pizza .. add blue cheese, basil and pancetta. I really liked the way the flavors all stuck out .. sweet, herby, salty ... love it!!"

You order the food and beer separately, food from a walkup counter and beer from the bar in the middle of the restaurant. You get a buzzer puck when you order food so the servers can locate you and bring it to your table. We ordered the Beer Mates and Pizza Roll appetizers to start and two pizzas, the Oo La La and the Shroomin' Goat. Food timing was staggered and the only real hiccup was that the Beer Mates appetizer order seemed to have gotten lost because we had to ask for it after all the rest of our order had trickled out, and it then took about 15min more for it to finally arrive. But, when it did, it was piping hot and fresh, so that's good. Food quality was very good and we enjoyed everything we ordered."

It's a sad little thing that deserves a happy home. Not in my belly though...I could've gotten something better and cheaper from the frozen section of H-E-B.  Would've been one star but I know they don't cater to vegans. Still, I'm not sure you can call yourself vegan-friendly if your vegan pizza looks like a Lunchables.  At least their beer is good!"

It supposed to be brisket, chopped jalapeños, pickled onions, and a chipotle sauce. Honestly, it was like pizza dough with pickled onions. I had trouble finding and tasting the brisket as it was non existent. The chopped jalapeños were hard to find and taste as well. There were plenty of pickled onions. To sum it up, this pizza sucked !!! I should've stuck to my favorite the Banh Mi with extra sausage and extra jalapeños. Lesson learned and money lost, such is life."

                "description": "Haven't been back to Pinthouse since Covid and since we loved the food we wanted to go back.  Glad they were busy but I have to say, while the pizzas and salads are absolutely great, the service seemed off. I know this is mostly a serve yourself model but it felt awkward standing with my family trying to see if anyone would help us find a seat. We stood there quite a while and once in a while a server would walk past us, look at us and keep walking. It would have been nice for one of them to smile and say 'sit anywhere' or something helpful. I knew I'd have to stand in line to order, then go back for refills, and finally to close out my tab. I guess the two things that chapped me most after  the seating thing was first, when we asked the server who brought our pizza for 1 more plate and fork and she said 'sure,' then never came back and second, I was presented the option to pay a tip from 15-25% when I closed out my tab. Now I almost always over tip because I'm in hospitality and try to support exceptional service. I did tip but felt it wasn't really deserved, sadly.  Outside the service issues, we will likely try it again as I know finding enough good employees is very tough now and we LOVE any restaurant that is part of the Jack Allen family because the food is SOOOOO good.  I hope owners will work on the service and keep the high quality of the food and beer.  Cheers"

I believe that the round rock location is definitely the best of the Pinthouses. Their beer selection is quite diverse, the food is just hands down amazing and there are also options such as cider, wine, hard kombucha (thanks hipsters) for non beer drinkers.   I'm struggling to think of one bad thing to say and just to say  something- it's the crowds on Friday and Saturday evenings.   I'm chuffed that this branch has gone from strength to strength; and I hope it continues to do so. As long as they're open, my Family and I shall keep visiting !!"

                "description": "Pinthouse Pizza was recommended by a bartender at another local brewery when we asked for suggestions for other places to visit while vacationing in the area. We stopped in at the Round Rock location and figured out the ordering process - order at the counter or at the bar, get a beeper, and your food is delivered to your table. If you have questions about the beer, I suggest you order at the bar. We ordered our food at the counter, but when I asked a beer question, I was referred to the bar. The bartender was very helpful. I ordered a flight and she offered some feedback on one of my choices. There was a combination of booth, bar, and common tables. We chose the common table to have the best view of the Red Sox/Yankees playoff game. Go Sox! The queso and salad came out first. The queso was good; the Italian salad was amazing. The individual salad was enough to share. The Shroomin' Pizza was very good too; I thought the crust was phenomenal and enjoyed dipping the end pieces in leftover salad dressing. The last thing I'd like to mention is how environmentally friendly this place is; paper products are compostable, pizza plates and utensils are metal. There's very little waste here! I would definitely recommend Pinthouse Pizza!"

Only reason for the 4 starts is today we came for what had to be the 6th or 7th  time and got kicked to the outside patio for having a dog. This is ALWAYS the brewery I go to when it's hot because they allowed dogs inside. I've had every other bartender let my dog in, love on him and have had zero problem sitting inside with him. Even their Facebook has a picture of a dog inside. Today we were told that was never allowed and should have been told to go outside. We have also seen many other dogs inside during past visits. I hate inconsistent rules. Also, super sad that we'll have to find a new brewery this summer. It's too hot to be outside and my dogs nickname is the the brewery dog.  I'll still support them during cooler months-- but dog owners should know the rules have changed. Very sad. Wish they would have posted something about this change."

We got a selection of beers, I personally really enjoyed the Mango Crazy wheat beer and the Keyboard Gansta IPA. The service was also very friendly and they offered some samples if you are in between choices.   The taco truck outside was also very good! I highly recommend one of their loaded fries. The fries were perfectly crispy and tender in the middle, and super flavorful toppings. The tacos were also yummy and I'm a huge corn lover so the elote bowl was perfect.   I will definitely be back to try more of their seasonal beers!"

                "description": "It's been a hot minute since I visited Whitestone- I think the last time I was here was in 2016, when it was quieter and a lot more laid back.  Fast forward to 2021 - the city of cedar park and Leander are booming.  There is a huge influx of population. The tables at Whitestone are full, there is a food truck (which is awesome) as a permanent fixture BUT the overall customer experience has left me disappointed.  Maybe because it's a Sunday with lovely weather, the guy behind the bar is done with people, or, he isn't a people person , or, he just didn't like the way I looked? But man was it hard to get him to give me an effing beer without getting hateful glances. Yeesh. Im kinda scared of coming back here now!  That aside, im not really a fan of their beer selection either - the kolsch is OK but I've had better. I guess the biggest advantage is the proximity to both CP and Leander and for the people who live around here.  So, this isn't much of a review rather than a semi rant ?   Also guys- kids have a tendency to move around from one side of the table to the other. They're not capable of sitting still and neither are you. If you'd rather than families stay away, just tell us to our faces."

                "description": "Austin is rich with craft breweries and 4th Tap is an excellent addition to the mix. I went there recently with my son and DIL to enjoy their beer and treat ourselves to some outstanding Laotian street for from the SXSE food truck. My favorite was the coffee stout but the amber ale was worthy of another taste.   Located in the obligatory warehouse area the facilities encourage family and pet attendance. Inside seating has a wide variety of games for those at  a loss for words. Outside seating is ample with umbrellaed picnic tables.   Also, it's within walking distance of Q2 Stadium.   Will I be back?  Youbetcha."

                "description": "First, I must profess.  As much as I love my hometown of San Antonio, Austin really has it going on regarding the microbrewery/brewpub scene.   There are so many options in the ATX and 4th Tap Brewing should NOT be overlooked. From their awesome craft beers, to their homemade pizzas, this place has it going on!  Beer - they have precanned beers, crowlers and growlers to go, as well as a handful of fresh beer on tap if you want to hang out in this cool joint/  On my visit, they had nine beers on tap, and I settled on the \"Can You Dig It\" amber ale.  It was definitely good, and I would get it again the next time I visit, but it was pretty similar to an amber ale you can find anywhere else. A little sweet, a little caramel taste to it, and just the right amount of hops - but not too much!  I didn't sample them, but they also have a could of IPAs, a sour, and a couple of different stout types.  Now, let's talk about the food! The pizza is SUPERB! They have several pizzas geared toward carnivores and herbivores alike.  If you don't see a prebuilt pizza that appeals to you, you can always build your own custom pizza.  They also have a handful of salads.  My friends from the ATX shared the 12\" \"Backdraft\" pizza for $12.99 with me.  It was LOADED with huge slices of pepperoni, jalapenos, and house made spicy Italian style sausage. The crust was thin and crispy.  Even if you don't like beer, I recommend stopping by here for a pizza - it.was.that.good!"

We booked a table a couple hours before we were planning to meet up.  Staff was super friendly. Beer was great...loved the Running Man, didn't really care for the gingerbread. Outdoor space was nice and spacious. Definitely felt safe during covid times. Food from the truck was delicious. Props to SXSE because their food is absolutely delicious. I had the beef skewers and upgraded to crispy rice. It was so flavorful and delicious.  Thanks 4th tap for the ease of booking a table, keeping things safe during covid, serving delicious beer and having such a great food truck."

                "description": "Here's why I luv 4th Tap  1.) Great drinkable, delicious beer!  My current favs are: ALL OF THEM!  haha I'm kidding.  Try Stay Gold and Kung Fu Robot.  They're so good you will want more.    2.) Great staff.  Really nice, accommodating, and they keep everyone's safety in mind by wearing masks and sanitizing ALL THE TIME!  So no CardiB, I won't get Corona virus here!   3.) Great vibe.  As a woman, I often think of, \"is it safe for me to drink here alone?\"  when out at bars.  I've never had this concern at 4th Tap.  4th Tap is open and bright and has lots of space to be alone or hang with guests.   As I mentioned the staff are great and wear masks and they look out for their guests in other ways, too.    4.) Great bar seats. Great bar seats are an unrated variable and let me tell y'all, I don't slide off these seats!  They're comfy and allow me to drink more beer.  Cause it's all about the beer!"

Offering eight taps to choose from at any given time, including their four core beers and four orbitals. Can order by pint, half pint, and/or flight. Very reasonably priced... and several little options for self entertainment including board games, a TV, and a piano. A must stop if visiting the now named \"Austin Craft Beer Corridor\" (i.e., there are several breweries in the adjacent area). Support local! Cheers to the shared love of good beers!"

You can also sit in the production area as long as you follow the rules such as \"1. Be Cool\" and of course, others like don't touch the equipment. The parking area is very limited but the location can be accessed by public transportation. Outside they also had a pizza food truck.    Fun place to hang out!"

                "description": "Solid brewery, but I wish there was more varieties of beer offered.  I opted for the flight, which is 5 for $12, but you have to go for the 3 core and can only choose 2 orbitals. It's a shame because I didn't care for 1 of the core items, a really fruity gluten-free beer. (I had a sample and didn't really like it).  Fortunately, I asked really nicely if I could swap it out for an orbital, and the employee said she could. But when my cousin tried the same, she was denied.  +2 Vitality (Core): Spring Ale-and their lightest beer they offer. Smooth and good flavor. Perfect for if you're looking for a light beer.  Zephyr (Core): American Pale Ale-A little more hop to it, but still a smooth and light option.   Long Walk-Grapefruit IPA-Light notes of citrus, hoppy, and refreshing. But in an increasingly crowded market of grapefruit beers, this one gets lost.  Mega-Citrus One-Double IPA-Basically a stronger version of Long Walk. To me, it tasted almost identical, which makes me wonder with such a limited menu, this one is offered. (But then again, why did I choose to sample it? Not too sure myself.)  Brick Top-Robust Porter. I'm not a porter drinker. At all. But once I started sipping, I really enjoyed it. This is a popular and enjoyable one.  Sample cup pours are generous and the prices are really good for the amount you get. (I couldn't finish my entire sample flight!). There indoor seating as well as seating 'outside' in the brewery area. There is a ping-pong table, plenty of board games, and apparently, rambunctious wrestling matches that happening quarterly that brings the whole neighborhood out.  I didn't get to see any wrestling happen this time around, so all in all 4th Tap offers good beer at good prices, but I'm looking for something more to wow."

The space is nice and the AC was turned up, so it was a great respite from the heat. Got a flight of their beers and not a bad one in the bunch! The bartenders were very friendly and knowledgeable and were able to make some solid and informed beer recs for my date who had no idea what beer he wanted.   There is even a piano randomly sitting amongst the tables and a random patron got up from his table, chugged the rest of his pint, waltzed over the piano, took a seat and then started playing and belting out Billy's Joel's \"Pianoman\". A pint w/free entertainment is always a plus!   Can see myself coming back in periodically to check out the new stuff on the rotation"

I wish I had gotten the names of the bartenders because they were so sweet to my mother, who is a lightweight and does not drink alcohol, but was feeling adventurous :) They even went out of their way to grab a beer they were out of on tap, but had a can of it in the back for her to try. She loved it, so she got it on the house. Incredible customer service.   There are plenty of large picnic tables in the taproom, and a whole shelf of board games to keep you and guests entertained. There is a grand piano off to the side of the room, so you know fun times are had here.   In the brew house, there is more seating, a wrestling ring (not sure I get it?), and a ping pong table! Game on.   I really enjoyed the grapefruit hints of the Longwalk as well as the tamarind acidity of the Renewal. Tasting is highly encouraged here as well. My family and I enjoyed ourselves immensely. At the end of the night, I paid a $12 tab! Great drinkin' to do on a budget!  Thanks for taking care of us and for being awesome at life!   -xoxo"

Not your traditional pupusa or cortido, but I still enjoyed it. The flour tortillas were really good. Cubano is the perfect beer food though.

Plenty of tables and areas to social distance, while supporting a local business!   While we only visited during the soft opening, we know that Willards will be a fantastic addition to the Pflugerville area!   Willards Brewery features the Mojo Austin Food Truck!! (Separate IG accounts by the way) The Cubano Quesadilla, Braised Beef Taco, and Beef and Cheese Pupusa are allllll a must have!!  I recommend the green salsa since it's nice and hot, as well!"

Lots of little games and lighting. I love a place that offers 4oz pours so you can buy ole your own flights. The food was good and fast. Will be back!"

                "description": "Willards is my new favorite neighborhood brewery. Their beers are all solid and the taproom is a great place to get out of the house safely during covid. I really appreciate that they have a menu that caters to everyone, not just beer drinkers. I love their hard seltzer cocktails and they also have mead and a few guest taps from other breweries. The Mojo food truck is amazing - their pork tacos are to die for!  As far as the physical space goes, the patio is gorgeous and they have campfires going at night to keep you cozy. Everything is very well spaced out, too."

                "description": "Willard's is right around the corner from our home, but we tried it for the first time last night (it won't be the last). The first thing you notice as you walk into the beer garden is the nice outdoor space with a pleasant ambiance. They have picnic style tables in and outside, they keep the indoor space very open (making us feel safer during COVID era). The lights outside provide a nice touch, as well as the music- played at a low enough volume that we don't have to raise our voices to hear one another.   Now as for the drinks: their stout is amazing and smooth and very chocolatey. Their seltzers all have such unique taste combinations and are NOT overly sweet, like some of the big name brands. The strawberry tangerine reminded me of a Haribo gummy bear! The coconut papaya was delicious and I went back and forth between tasting the coconut and the papaya most. They even have cocktail like drinks that are good for those who don't enjoy beer or seltzer. My partner ordered the Hazy IPA and liked it enough to buy a six-pack to take home. George was our bartender. He has such a calm and respectful demeanor. He was really great and made the experience of tasting some of the drinks for the first time so pleasant.   The food truck is so reasonable in price and was delicious! It was so nice to have something other than typical bar food. Austin (chef) brings out the orders so quickly and is super kind! Their guacamole is really interesting and we all devoured it, their salsas are spicy and fresh, and they even have a mushroom taco with a black bean puree for those of us who don't eat meat. Everyone at our table enjoyed the food (other items ordered were pork nachos, Cuban quesadilla, and the pupusa).   Overall we loved our experience, and will definitely be back to visit this hidden treasure."

Tried the place on a Sunday afternoon and expected more patrons there were only 3 other tables. Great service from the employees offering tasting of different beers and seltzer's and you've got to try the Mojo Cuban food truck - can recommend the quesadilla for sure. Look for us on a Sunday with our Am Staf puppy named Daisy."

I love coming here when it's not busy, which I'm finding is becoming more and more difficult as time passes. The place has built up a solid base of loyal customers that seem to return week after week and I can't blame them. There is consistency at work here, the staff is always excellent - they make great recommendations to the ever-changing list of beers on tap, the selection of beers is constantly rotating, and best of all - the food is delicious. We often consider ordering take-out for only the pizza/pizza rolls here.   This place has adapted to changing times, they have more outdoor seating so we're able to socially distance ourselves most of the time and feel safe during our visit. I'm happy to see this place thrive."

I hope the high rating is for the beer, because the pizza and service was far below any one else...."

There's also plenty of tables outside with umbrellas for those with dogs or don't mind the scorching Texas heat.  The pizza is delicious. I can't remember the name of it but it had Canadian bacon, bacon and a sriracha bbq drizzle on it. Crust was delicious, the bottom wasn't soggy near the center.  Also tried the pretzels with beer cheese. Mmmmmm.   A really big beer selection available as well.   Service was great. You order at the bar, get a number and they bring to your table.   Def worth a visit if you're nearby."

                "description": "In my previous review, I neglected to mention something important. This is one of those businesses which require you to pay first and they hit you with the gratuity percentage upfront before you receive your food and service.  The gratuity should come at the end of the meal and service, not at the beginning and I have found this practice puts more money in the business' pocket at your expense.  Now with that said, their pizza, wings and pizza rolls are quite exceptional. they have an extensive beer selection which is always changing around to keep up with the seasons. So if paying upfront along with the gratuity doesn't bother you then we do recommend the fare, however I find it a turn off. Especially since they forgot half of our order and didn't get it to us until we were ready to leave. So basically, one star for the payment practice, but four stars for the food and beer."

Their beer cheese looks like gravy.. it doesn't taste like gravy though- highly suggest! We will definitely be back next time he visits. Nice large patio and clean bathrooms as well."

                "description": "Decent selection of craft beers, but one thing unique about this bar is that they do not allow customers to sample any beers, unlike most of their competitors.  I undetstand the policy to a certain extent, especially if you had very knowledgeable bartenders, but that is not the case here.  During my most recent visit, one person I was with asked for an IPA that was very hoppy, But instead got something but was very sour and totally did not like the taste of the beer. She was stuck with paying for the pint, despite the bartender's error.  The pizza (bbq chicken) was decent, but pretty bready - took away from the tasty toppings - left me feeling like we were served a glorified frozen pizza - we were hungry so we devoured the pizza, but we were disappointed and will thing twice before  ordering it again.  They had some live music, a young man with the guitar singing cover songs, did a very decent job. It helped make the dying experience enjoyable.  It was a great night to sit on the patio, with a nice breeze, some decent music being played, and the company of good friends.  Perhaps they could think about modifying their policy so that you're entitled to one beer sample, as long as you order a full beer.  The bartender stated the reason for the no sample policy was because of Covid... I just do not buy it, given the fact that None of the bars/restaurants that I have gone to the last couple of months have this type of policy."

Unfortunately I didn't get a pic of the wall of beers since I ate outside to enjoy the cool Texas breeze. The pretzel sticks were hot from the oven. The carnivore pizza had enough meat for four pizzas so come ready to eat. I must say the Hefeweizen was very good and close enough to remind you of Germany if you've been. They have have local bands playing nightly so there's also entertainment. The locals know and if you ever take a trip to the area now you do too."

First time coming here - you order at the bar, they give you a number, and then you take it to whatever table is available and that you choose. Look at the food menu before you come because the food menu is only visible at the counter/bar that you order from. The only bummer to the whole experience was that the number they gave us was not the number they gave the kitchen so the food got lost for a little bit because they were looking for a different number.

They split the calzone so it was two separate smaller calzones instead which was awesome. The only thing we recommend is the calzone and pizza rolls might have been slightly over cooked as the top of the crusts were very dark and tough. Probably because they cooked it in the same oven and temperature as the pizzas which makes sense. But this wasn't an issue and the food was still great. Loved our experience"

Their servers are so friendly and all throughout the COVID restrictions, they followed the protocols and managed to still make it a fun place to go to.

We tried them a couple of times but the thick, rubbery fat and lack of crispiness were big turnoffs - seemed like they weren't fried but maybe baked? In any case not good. We've got plenty of other deliciousness there, though, so we just order everything else!"

This last time, the beertender sat taking our order (yes, he was sitting behind the bar) and had no suggestions or enthusiasm.  There is no way to order without going inside the bar. During covid, there should be options for this!  The pizza is okay. If you are looking for pepperoni rolls, Pinthouse are much better in my opinion.  We may return for specific beers, but it won't be on our regular rotation with other options in the area."

Walking in gave me comforting coffeeshop vibes, with mostly tables of small parties 2-3 drinking beer and socializing.  Having no idea what to order, staff made some recommendations for a flight that were all fantastic. My favorites were the Cuerno Rojo (lightly carbonated and very smooth) and the Continental Breakfast (heavier stout but tastes just like French Toast and Maple syrup). I had to do a double take that I wasn't just drinking syrup but the flavors were spot on!  I'll be back again with friends/family and hopefully get to enjoy the great coffee I was smelling as well!"

The interior ambiance was dark, cozy, and perfect for an intimate convo, remote work, or even games with friends. I have two small children so helped myself to the outdoor covered and heated patio. The kids enjoyed the chips and salsa while we sipped our stellar brews. Excited to try the Leander location that is actually closer to us. 10/10 plan to come back, especially to try the coffee."

                "description": "Just wanted to update this one. Red Horn just gets better and better with age and has really turned into a community institution - especially during the pandemic when they switched to \"to go\" beers that we could all take out to the parking lot and drink while socially distanced. Fortunately those days are past us but I think I will always have a soft spot in my heart for this place that was a little bit of sanity amidst all the insanity.   As for the fare itself? The beers rotate and you can't  go wrong because they will always let you sample (I'm a strawberry pop-tart ravioli fan - and yes that's a beer). Pair that beer (or wine) with a meat and cheese tray or maybe a panini and you have absolutely nothing to complain about. They even have food trucks on most days...  Thanks for being here Red Horn."

I got the Gordon Ramsey coffee and it was obviously made by someone who knows how to craft a latte. I do wish the flavor complimented the espresso more or punched above the espresso. It was too balanced, if that's even a thing. I will definitely return next time i'm in town to see what pieces of coffee art they come up with next!"

Red Horn was very highly rated and the photos looked like they offered genuine espresso beverages. Red Horn offered a number of non-dairy options so I would not destroy my stomach on my pending road trip. We ordered Americans with a half inch of steamed oat milk. The coffee was very smooth. The espresso taste was still solid enough that I knew I was drinking espresso. I.e. Not watered down at all. All-in-all a great cup of coffee that hit the spot."

It's hard to find decaf that isn't boring and the decaf here is strong and full of flavor! I even purchased a pound of decaf beans to take home.   I pulled up and my first thought was that the vibe was more brewery than coffee shop and I was right, but I was wrong that the coffee would just be an afterthought. When I went on a Saturday early afternoon, there was a taco truck and people hanging out in the beer garden. Lots of bicyclists and not sure if it's a popular rest stop or because there's a bike shop in the same parking lot or both or something else. Once you step inside there is a giant section of beer taps and beer menu, and a small coffee and pastry menu. They also sell ice cream here which was tempting but I stuck to my americano and later a vanilla latte.   The inside has plenty of socially distanced seating as does the outside and I lucked out with a parking spot right out front. There's a large lot of shared parking for the businesses.   I want to come back to check out their beers!!"

You can get coffee, lattes, and cappuccino served anytime or also buy their beans to go.   They usually have 30+ taps of delicious craft beer which 10-15 being their beers with other guest beers also. They normally have cans to go and they will do growler fills as well. Its unusual to find a place that has both really good beer and great coffee but Red Horn is just that. There are a few slightly more secluded tables where I'll see people working remotely quite often. Most weekends you can find a local artist performing live music too."

He was very abrasive embarrassing and in my face. I personally think if you don't allow dogs at all then take the service sign dog off the window.

Prices can be a little steep but hella worth it."

                "description": "Great place to try out a new beer then buy a six-pack or two. We had a couple beers each (they sell singles if you are hanging out) and then bought some to take home. Taco Truck pilsner was great, Mama Pisner, and there was a pickle beer that was probably a tad too pickley for me (go figure).  Great/fun selection, good prices, knowledgeable staff, and lots of picnic tables out to keep you spread out and safe. You can get snacks too, or play Starship Troopers pinball (Do You Want To Know More?!?). We had  a good time just chilling there on a Sunday afternoon.  Oh, and they recycle those plastic can holders that craft breweries use. Bring yours back to help out the brewers in town!"

Anytime you stop by, you'll meet either the owner or his wife and they are both nice and very helpful. You can pretty much buy anything they have in singles and they always have their inventory listed online along with the untapped rating for each beer, which I find very useful. They have a solid selection of local stuff and occasionally some more rare stuff as well. If you're immunocompromised, you can call your order in and they'll bring it to your car; they also have a very sanitary setup inside and require masks (of course) and make everyone use the hand sanitizer when you come in. We've been there about 5 times mixing that in with buying direct from breweries but I really love the diversity you can get while supporting local at the Brewtique"

If you're more beer curious, head over and chat with these friendly folks. They know their stuff and helped me to pick out some new beers.  There's a good range of price points here too so you could find a good gift here.   Website is also really useful and lists out everything they have if you like to head in with some ideas of what to grab.   Good atmosphere in there too if you're drinking in.

We all met at another place for happy hour when bud 1 recommend this place for some take home treats. I mean,come on, we know a beer-n-burger nut like me can't say no.  This place is totally chill with a few picnic tables to relax and converse with friends. There is also a couple of other chairs if that's your thing. Sampling on sight is totally cool too.  On to the selection of beers. All I can say is,if you can't find something here that you would like, go home,empty handed and admit you have no taste. That's right, I threw the blame squarely on you! Why? Because they must have better than 300-400 different beers to choose from!  Now go, prove me wrong and try that chocolate oatmeal stout or triple ipa !!"

They also do some really cool charity events on behalf of some great organizations. There's almost always something going on in the evenings -- live music, comedy shows, football games, game night, beer tastings.

Owner(s?) seem to care a bunch, and have been available to point out new releases/limited beers, make recommendations, and take pics of my dog.   Prices slightly higher than other big retailers, but selection is much better (tip: check their Instagram for limited beers and new stock). Also, a good selection of CBD products for those interested. I have never hung around to drink there, but you can for a small per-beer charge if you want.   Hope this place keeps getting tasty limited beverages and doesn't turn into a vape emporium like the last one!"

Super friendly staff, fresh ingredients, and all public areas are spotlessly clean! This visit The Mr. ordered a small house side salad, which was was a very generous size. He ordered Build Your Own Pizza: pepperoni, salami, mushrooms, and red onions. I ordered the meat lasagna...large enough portion to feed two people. Love the marinara used in the lasagna. It was very light, fresh, and not sweet. (Some places add a lot of sugar to their pasta sauce not Tony C's). Not ordered this visit, but make sure you get the mozzarella sticks, made fresh in house, not Sysco Foods frozen. Photos of those beauties are in my previous review."

Why they have four stars...I hate on the app if you want ranch instead of red sauce it doesn't allow you to adjust and if I'm ordering a family size pepperoni roll dish (which is over 12 rolls) I get two or three small ranches, and any additional I have to pay for (.50 a piece). I wish they would fix the issue or relax on the ranch."

Friendly, fun atmosphere with 50's and 69's music playing often. Pizza is even good for takeout, which is quite popular, as well! They also offer salads and LASAGNA! (Marinara or Alfredo sauces) - see my photo of the menu for details!  TONS of seating - long tables for large groups. Nearby, newly-opened LaQuinta Hotel's guests , including sports teams, families, conference attendees, and other large parties, will love coming here, not just for the seating and atmosphere, BUT FOR THE PIZZA!!!

We ordered the chicken Parmesan pizza as recommended by our cashier and an order of garlic knots. It was a great recommendation.   The garlic knots came out first. They were so warm, soft and garlic buttery! They came with their house made marinara, which was sooo good! Those poor garlic knots were gone just as quick as they arrived.  When the pizza came out, it looked amazing but I was a little concerned the chicken Parmesan might be a bit dry because it kind of looked that way. Let me tell you, the pizza was spot on! The chicken was well seasoned and cooked, definitely not dry. The crust on the pizza was amazing!!! I'm craving it again as I write this review!  The atmosphere was also laid back. They had beautiful wood bench seating, which could accommodate a large party/gathering if the place is not to busy. Service was also excellent.  Honestly, the best pizza I've had in a while! I highly recommend this place if you're in the mood for delicious pizza!"

Ordering online and pick up is easy! I scheduled my pick up order in advance so I wouldn't forget.  Food was delicious. No complaints. Really enjoyed the sauce that came with the garlic knots and calamari. Gelato was satisfying. Looking forward to trying another pizza soon!"

                "description": "My husband is a pizza snob. Seriously. The staff here recognizes us now. I would say that's a pretty good sign that we go here often.  Here's what I don't like about this place: cheap, thin napkins and stingy thin plates. Also, If you have unwrapped straws, please buy a dispenser for it. It's really not sanitary in the first place, but with COVID, can you purchase wrapped straws please? I do appreciate the conscious effort to recycle. Please ditch the cheap paper goods and maybe use reusable metal pizza pans for plates or something. Also, I don't think I ever see lids for the cups. Again, perhaps consider plastic reusable cups.  What we do like: mozzarella sticks, pizza rolls, THE PIZZA, did I mention the mozzarella sticks ;) I don't like them trying to upsell ranch, but I get it. Also like the availability of pizza boxes for leftover pizza and lids for sauces.  We'll be back. Don't worry about my 4 star rating and comments about the paper goods. If we lived closer, I wouldn't insist on dining in."

Pepperoni is my fav but I had to get the motz, basil and tomato on the margarita pizza.

We shared the largest size pizza, split a fried ravioli app, and gelato. We also enjoyed a few drinks on HH.  We usually go to slapbox for local pizza, but dare I say it, this place has better pizza in my opinion! Not as greasy and it's closer to us. Their HH runs from 5-7. My boyfriend got 2 October fest beers and I had a glass of PG, a frozen bellini and a sangria, which were all $2-3 off depending on the drink. The frozen bellini was very good and I don't normally drink frozen drinks. I did not care for the sangria at all, though.   Everyone was very friendly. In regards to COVID, everything was very clean from what I saw.   Shoutout to the manager, Catalina! She was very genuine in her table checks and we both believe she's a great asset to their team in QC."

We also orders the garlic knots which were also fantastic but look more like cinnamon rolls than garlic knots. Then, we tried the vanilla, chocolate and strawberry gelato. The vanilla is more of a rich vanilla bean flavor so it's an acquired taste (my husband loved it, I didn't care for it)  my daughter loved the chocolate (said it was better than Baskin-Robbins) and I had the strawberry. The strawberry was so delicious. Sweet, soft and airy with the perfect amount of tart to it. The restaurant was industrial looking, open concept and very clean. All the staff were friendly and attentive. Wish we had one of these where we live!"

Service was great, place was clean, and they seem to be taking COVID restrictions seriously.   The pizza was pretty good. Not as good as Slapbox/600 Degrees but just a notch below (on par with Pinthouse). Came out quick and was hot. Beer selection was pretty good - had a local brewery Oktoberfest.   All in all, worth returning and will try to nudge my kids into agreeing to go here instead of Hat Creek next door."

Food: we tried the toasted ravioli, garlic knots, Italian chopped salad and pizza. The food came out quickly and was very tasty. While the prices were not cheap, I do think you get a good value for what you pay for.   The only improvement we'd suggest is letting customers open a tab and be able to order both food and drinks on it. We were told they're already working on this though!"

I ordered the 12\" carnivore pizza and it definitely satisfied my cravings. The carnivore has salami, pepperoni, sausage, meatballs, pizza sauce, mozzarella, and calabrian peppers. There were a lot of spices, which made it quite flavorful. If you like meat on meat on meat...this pizza is for you!   Service was great! I went inside, instead of using the curbside option, to pickup the pizza from their takeout counter. They greeted me right away and had my pizza ready on time. I appreciated their organization. The inside of the restaurant looks really cute with long family style tables, TVs, and a warm atmosphere. I look forward to dining in the restaurant next time."

Everyone got pitchers of mimosas but I'm pregnant so not drinking. They all enjoyed them!   All the food that came out looked amazing. I wasn't really feeling anything crazy but the items i got were delicious! The biscuit was fluffy and flakey and everything i wanted.   The sausages were actually huge and so filling. There was a nice flakey crunch to the outside of them which i wasn't expecting but enjoyed. The service was great and so were the portion to cost ratios! Well worth it!"

They were not outright rude, but not very hospitable. Nobody smiled throughout the evening. Definetly did not feel welcome.   I ordered the burger and fries.  It was probably one of the worst burgers I've had.   There needs to be a balance between meat, bread, and veggies.  The burger was under cooked and  too big for the bun.  The veggies were minimal and soaked in blood from the burger.    My wife had the hot chicken sandwich.  That was better, but a mess to eat.    My son had the Mac n cheese with fruit.  The Mac was a thick gooey mess with large elbow pasta. Very hard to spoon out.  Not easy for a 3 year old to eat.  Also, quite salty.   We don't plan on returning."

The brunch food was just average, I think this might be a better spot for dinner. I had a Bloody Mary and it tasted like watery tomato juice with no spice or horseradish. My boyfriend had the shrimp and grits - he really liked the shrimp on it but the grits didn't have much flavor. The best item that we had was the appetizer of chips and queso but we subbed fries instead of chips - SO yummy. The queso was spicy and the fries were so crispy.   We would probably go back for dinner and drinks to see if it's better!"

I ordered Shrimp and Grits and she ordered the Full Monty (American sampler)  Our food was all cold nothing hot or remotely warm. They didn't seem too busy so maybe they are working out some expediting issues. My grits were mediocre at best maybe if they were warm that would be different and the shrimp was fishy and rubbery. I've never had grits that were like a smear on the bottom of the bowl/plate but that's exactly what this was.  My daughter said her eggs tasted off and her fruit was clearly on the brink of, if not already spoiled. The best thing on the plate was the potatoes  I'd give them another shot just maybe not for brunch this time."

The good: We were seated quickly and there were quite a few staff in the restaurant to help so we didn't have to really wait that long for anything. In fact, once's we're done my wife said, \"we should start looking for the bill\" and here comes the waitress with the bill. This is really surprising in light of the challenges that other restaurants are having with staffing.   I like that this place is in downtown round rock and I like the overall aesthetic with wood beams on the ceilings and the house converted to restaurant feel.   I got a special off of their hatch chili menu and it was very tasty and a pretty decent sized piece of fish.   The not so good: While the food was tasty, I was missing some of the expected hatch chili flavor that I would expect to find when ordering something off a hatch chili menu  My wife's fish was a little tough, but again the flavor was good  If you get cold easily, make sure to bring a sweater. The temperature was pretty frigid and because of the small floor for the restaurant there wasn't really a way to find a spot where the you don't get blown on by the AC.   Wrap-up: All in all the food and service were good. A few tweaks and I think this could be a 5-star review."

Staff were friendly but noticeably uninterested as some were preoccupied scrolling on their phones and others even hanging out at the bar. Our waitress was at least attentive.   For food I ordered the salmon frittata, and the hubs got the pork belly hash and a $5 orange juice that was clearly brand made and from a bottle that probably cost just as much as the charge of the 8oz we were served. Flavor wise, my food was delicious tho slightly salty. However upon arriving to the table, the pork belly hash looked smaller than my entree. For $16 you'd expect strips of pork belly on top of the sweet potato hash - what you really get is 10% protein, 20% dry biscuit, 30% hash, and 40% arugula garnish. Redeeming quality was the perfectly poached egg.   Definitely a happy hour/small bites spot but wouldn't recommend for brunch or a full meal. For $50, much left to be desired"

What a let down. It was like one thin deli sliced ham on and English muffin with an underdone poached egg and barely any hollandaise. It was more like eating eggs on toast. Now the potatoes; they could've been great. They were fine. But the peppers with the potatoes were not cooked and more thrown in just because. Not only that the music outside was too loud to have a conversation. I wish my experience was better, but mayyyybe I'll try it again with something else on the menu? I don't know."

                "description": "My fiancé, baby and I came here for a nice Friday night on the town. We had heard how great it was and was anxious to check it out for ourselves. Upon checking in we were told there was a 45 minute wait...fair enough. We walked to Finley's to grab a quick drink. We were both surprised when we got a text only within 20 mins! When we came back we were greeted by the hostess who was an absolute doll and showed to our table up front. Let me just say - customer service was top notch. Exactly was we hoped for. Our waiter Chandler was amazing! For an appetizer we ordered the bacon wrapped quail. It was superb. We both enjoyed it very much. For our entrees I had a side Caesar salad and the Dry Aged Ribeye (with asparagus and a cheddar potato cake), my fiancé had the Pecan Smoked Pork Chop (with asparagus and a cheddar potato cake) and for our 2 year old we ordered a kids meal with Mac and Cheese and Fries.  Let's start with the Pecan Smoked Pork Chop. While it was the tastiest of our entrees it was just a bit slightly overcooked...but delicious despite that. Okay on to the ribeye. I get this is not a steakhouse so I probably shouldn't have ordered it, but I had a craving. For the $45 price tag we were very disappointed. The thin cut steak very under-seasoned. The \"cheddar potato cake\" was just okay...its basically a mound of mashed potatoes with a cheddar crisp on top. The asparagus was okay but I like the small asparagus better and these were ginormous.  I noticed the baby wasn't eating his mac and cheese and wondered why. It looked like it came from a generic box and once I tasted it I learned why. Oddly enough the dish tasted like it had vinegar in it!! My fiancé tasted it and said the same thing. We even let Chandler know when we were leaving."

Reservations for 10 were easy as we called first thing today. They save a great table for us. Very nice touch.   We started with a few apps that was great. The chips and dip was perfect. Everyone loved the main courses and the plates were cleared.   We ate inside but went outside after to listen to the singer for a few songs. We love live music and it is so great to have it back.   Great night with family."

                "description": "First time visiting Urban but decided to check it out on a whim because I was nearby. When I arrived it was happy hour so ordered a cocktail. Called the Passion Project which was delightfully delicious! A bit on the sweet side but yummy nonetheless. It was a cold day so decided on a cup of tortilla soup... unfortunately I was accidentally bought the tomato soup which is pictured as well... I didn't taste it but it smelled delicious. The waitress was kind when I let her know the incorrect soup was brought and quickly brought out the tortilla soup. The soup seasoned well and perfectly warmed however tasted liked chicken soup with tortilla strips. I also ordered the Urban chopped salad with salmon... it was huge! Lol! The salmon was a bit dry and not really flavorful but once chopped over the salad all of the the flavors blended well together. All in all I enjoyed  my time at Urban... the service was fast, staff was friendly, and the overall ambiance was nice! I'd definitely visit again."

                "description": "My daughter and I enjoyed a Saturday brunch at Urban to celebrate her Halloween birthday. We arrived a few minutes ahead of our noon reservation but were seated promptly outdoors and were told our server would be there soon. Then we waited...and waited.    Once our server arrived with waters in hand, things ran more smoothly. My daughter had a full Monte and I had shrimp and grits. The food was attractively plated and tasted great. My shrimp was spicy, and there was plenty of bacon in the dish. The only thing that seemed out of place was the redeye gravy around the edge of the cheesy grits. It really added nothing.   There are plenty of menu choices, including vegetarian and gluten free items. Prices are a bit on the high side for some things and reasonable on others. But the food was good for us so I'd definitely return. This would have been a 5 star review had we not waited so long before a waitperson visited."

Happy hour has $8 bar bites and drink specials. Would visit again! We got the chicken fried steak, pork chop and fried chicken hot sandwich. The hot honey sauce was AMAZING - spice only hits you at the end, and the dishes had the right level of crisp."

                "description": "My wife and along with some friends went to Urban Eats for the first time in a couple years and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. This s not a fancy place but very welcoming and casual. We decided to try the covered outside area and even though it was pretty hot, the fans and breeze made it very comfortable.  We discovered they have a happy hour Tuesday-Saturday which is pretty unusual in my experience. The menu is creative and utilizes locally sourced suppliers and though it is not a huge selection, it is varied, offering some seafood, steak, pork chop, salads, soups and starters. We had  grilled shrimp, quinoa salad, tortilla soup and side salads. Service was very attentive without making us feel rushed. Live music started at 7 which was another pleasant surprise.  We were amazed how much this part of downtown Round Rock has really developed. Parking was easy, the area is very walkable and Main Street entertainment district nearby.  Urban Eats is definitely a repeater for us! Give it a try and support a great local business."

                "description": "This is such a cool place! I planned an outing in Cedar Park with a group of my girlfriends. After our outing at the Ecuadorian chocolate factory, we needed a place that could accommodate a fairly large group of friends during lunch time on a Friday (a task that seemed.... yikes). I am very thankful I stumbled across The Good Lot on Yelp! I reached out to make sure The Good Lot could accommodate us, and they said \"Of Course\" and let me know that all of the trucks would be out on Friday.    When we arrived, we were pleasantly surprised to find several open food trucks and a large building (see, beer bar). People had their dogs outside and everyone seemed to be having a good time.   Between all of us, we tried every food truck. I personally got Four Brothers Venezuelan Kitchen. I am a sucker for good Venezuelan food. I got a Pulled pork Bowl with extra garlic sauce, black beans, avocado, sweet plantains, and all the fixings. I would definitely eat here again. I tried a few samples from other food trucks as well.   Everyone left super happy. This is a great place to go if you have a casual group looking for a quick bite and place to hang out.    The next day (Saturday), I swung by the dog park across the street and stopped by again for lunch on my way home. They have trivia nights, live music over the weekends, and happy hour all day on Monday. Please build another location close to Fort Hood. A copy and paste of exactly what you already created would be great. ;). I promise to stop by weekly."

                "description": "I made the drive up to Cedar Park and my friend was excited to take me here as it had just opened up and seemed to add a streak of cool to my friend's new neighborhood. So, it was midweek around 8pm and while the patio had plenty of folks and there was music going the food trucks were done and they weren't too courteous about letting it be known they were closed or out of food or closing up.   So, the taps were open which allowed me to try out a beer. The staff pouring were definitely friendly, letting me know some of their personal favorites on tap as well as letting me try some out. I did also appreciate that they had some NA options as well and I liked the kombucha they had on tap so much I had two more of those instead of the more adult beverage options they had.  If there was a way to have some of the bar staff cross train with the food truck staff it would make a huge improvement."

                "description": "The Good Lot is a wonderful addition to the CP area. Bring your kiddos and your hounds sit outside under the shade or on their covered patio.    Cocktails anyone? I was surprised at their expansive craft beer options. Check out their rotating taps at: https://thegoodlotcp.com/beergarden/drinks/  There are wine, seltzer, and non-acholohol options as well.  When we visited there were 3 food truck options; Yard Bird, Oink, and our favorite The Rice is Right.    Be aware on weekends and when there is live music parking will be a challenge. This has been a point of contention with the neighbors and according to the Good Lot, they are looking to expand the parking area.    Pro tip: Don't park in the adjoining neighborhood park 5 minutes away at the Veterans Memorial Park. Stretch your legs on the way there and work off that beer on the way back."

                "description": "As far as I can tell, The Good Lot only has 5 star reviews and for good reason.  It is a great beer garden with plenty of non-beer options as well.  I have always passed by the place and noticed how busy it is most weeknights and especially weekends, but I am certainly pleased with what it brings to the community.  Generally it gets pretty busy after 6PM until close, and parking can be difficult to find.  Carpooling or taking a rideshare would be the best way to do it in my opinion as I would hate to park in front of someone else's house in the nice neighborhoods nearby.  Certainly a parking lot expansion is something the owners are considering as that is my only issue with the place especially when it gets busy.  That being said, it is always a great atmosphere with a variety of food and drink options.  There are also always lots of dogs in the grassy area by the patio and it is nice to see how family-friendly the place is.  I will certainly be back and bring some friends in the future!"

                "description": "My daughter and I visited The Good Lot yesterday (8/8/21).  It's the new and hot food truck and bar spot in Cedar Park TX (2500 W New Hope). The Good Lot has a main building with a large dining area enclosed by glass garage doors that open and a bar that has numerous beers, ales, ciders, and craft sodas.  It's nestled among the oak trees. There is a nice amount of paved parking and gravel lot parking.   The Good Lot also has dining areas under the oaks along with a game area (corn hole) and a playground for the kids with a large wooden teepee for climbing.  They are dog friendly.   The Good Lot had 4 food trucks.  We chose The Rice Is Right that serves Korean inspired rice boxes and other items.  We ordered the crispy chicken box and the cauliflower box.  Both items were perfectly fried and coated in a sweet and spicy Korean sauce.  Flavor was amazing.  The boxes came with steamed white rice and a purple cabbage slaw.  The portions were large and more than enough food for us. There were other food trucks that served Mediterranean, Pork, and Chicken.  The menus look good and I will explore those in the future.  The Good Lot and The Rice Is Right are on 'My Keepers List'."

What a wonderful experience. There was a variety of beers on tap and nice small selection of wine by the glass. The food was outstanding. Most importantly the environment and the friendliness of the staff was exceptional.   During our visit we met the owners and their family and it was truly an enjoyable experience. Playing corn hole and chatting with the family was outstanding. Neil and his wife are fantastic.  Do yourself a favor and enjoy and afternoon or evening there. I think you will enjoy it."

Food trailers here, beer on tap, covered patio, great outdoor seats and space, place for kids and pets. It has only been open for 3 weeks and the word is getting out.

Head over to The Good Lot and get some food from The Rice is Right and Oink Mobile."

The beer selection was great, lots of locals including Whitestone, Hedgehog, Red Horn, Family Brewing and (of course) some lovely PHP Jellyfish on tap.  We decided to tried Yaadbird, since we hadn't had any fried chicken in a while. The lemon pepper chicken was on point, crispy, juicy, peppery, a 'lil salty, and everything you need in your fried chicken!  The property is beautiful and well landscaped. The lawn was amazing! It was so fluffy! When we first arrived we just admired the live oak trees and the quality of the grass.. Lawn lovers, you will understand...  The bartenders were very nice and very excited to introduce so many new people to the Good Lot. The owner was all over the bar, pouring drinks, helping staff, and checking with guests, seeming to have time for everyone.  We are looking forward to coming back here and trying the 3 other food trucks, along with the rotating beer menu. Hope they are planning to host more events, as we would love to do an anniversary party here at some point!"

                "description": "Finally, a really great beer garden in Cedar Park. I came on their first \"soft public open\" day and I'm so glad I did. I've been to about 20 pubs and bars in CP and this one stands head and shoulders above the rest. It's an open air (no AC but there is heat in the winter) with big garage doors that were open and a huge ceiling fan so it was comfortable. There were about 20 taps and 3 of them were not filled yet. I chatted with the owner and she said she was looking for ideas so my friend Greg gave her some. :)  There is plenty of indoor seating. Plus, there is a huge grassy area with picnic tables and even a fire pit. It's family-friendly so no smoking.  There is a playground for the kids and spots for four food trucks although only two were filled.   Beer was about $6 on average so not cheap but not expensive either. $1 off all day on Mondays.   It was an enjoyable experience and a really great ambience. I'll definitely be back!"

This place is non-smoking, dog-friendly (leashed) and kid-friendly, with a unique play area, six sets of cornhole, and plenty of shaded grassy area to run around in. Tables are wide and comfortable, and the entire patio was open-air, so social distancing is a breeze. We ate at the Oinkmobile truck (delicious) and grabbed local beers and ciders at the patio desk. We walked the fifteen minutes from our house, but it looks like they have a decent-sized parking lot and are working on creating more space. The only downside is that there's no ramp down to the grass/play area, but hopefully they'll make it more accessible in the future. Staff was super friendly, and I can't wait to come back for open mic night. Because yes, we'll be back!!"

Huge outdoor space with picnic tables plastic chairs or plenty of room to bring your own (even saw someone bring their own folding table). Live music was at just the right volume playing just the right kind of classic rock that doesn't offend and always pleases. Beer selection was generous and reasonably priced (not to mention $5 glasses of wine). Had a 50/50 burger at Oink and was BLOWN away. It's half bacon and half beef and all good. Loved it. The bacon Mac and cheese was also delicious but the portion was a little small for $9 (my only complaint of the night). Do yourself a favor and if you're up in the 613 check this place out!!!"

Once we got a drink, we were lucky enough to snag a table under the fans and the breeze was so nice. They had live music while we were there, which I believe will continue on weekends so that's fun. The lawn looked so nice, chairs to sit in, trees for shade, lawn games for entertainment! There were 4 or 5 food truck options while we were there and while we didn't get any food, all the food we saw coming out looked so good! Definitely recommend stopping by and checking it out!"

For the owners- they may have different names other places- it's a ziploc bag with water and you put coins in and hang them. If you Google penny bag it will tell you they avoid them because it's bright (thanks Matt for googling!) but I like to think it looks like a spider web to fly eyeballs so they are trying to stay away from a web. Flies probably aren't that smart.. it's probably the light part."

(sorry guys, we were the last ones to leave)  Parking is nuts so plan ahead and maybe carpool... We drive a jeep so we had no issues ... live music and plenty of smiling faces.. service was great, bathrooms were clean... dogs welcome! Plenty of good beers, wines and ciders... gals were so nice behind the bar.. offered samples and were super sweet... good folks, good music and good grub.... my son joined us and grabbed some food from the food trucks... cauliflower wings, shrimp fried rice and macaroni and cheese... so so good.... bring your chairs/ blanket to sit on because tables and chairs are hard to snag... the lines are long for drinks but they go fast.... We will be back for sure! We feel right at home here. If you like fresh air and freedom... come here.. if you are afraid of fresh air and human contact, probably should go to Austin and be amongst others who feel that way... Merica!"

I enjoyed the openness of this place -- there was a lot of seating that was not in the immediate proximity of others which was great. My only issue is the pricing -- I cannot pay over $5 for a Kung Fu Robot IPA when I can get it for $3 near my apartment. $8.25 for an Electric Jellyfish? I can't but I understand."

                "description": "This restaurant is a 5 out of 5 for me. I absolutely enjoy eating here. The raw oysters are always my favorite to snack on (tip: on Mondays, their gulf oysters are only $1). I've also tried their chowda fries which are delicious. It's everything you would expect with chowder but better because you also get fries (this dish itself can be heavy and filling). Definitely one to try if you're looking for something to warm your soul. Their lobster roll is good too. I love the lobster meat but I wish they served it as a warm, hot sandwich rather than the chilled one. Nonetheless, still delicious!   Now don't get me started on their dessert which is also worth noting here. All their desserts are made in-house but there is one that really hits the spot. This dessert has a warm chocolate brownie topped with a scoop of Vanilla ice cream and drizzled with caramel. If heaven was a dish, that would be it because it just transports you into another world. Worth saving some room in your stomach for!"

I mean throw 1-2 nice options on there... it's oysters after all.   Oysters were fresh but not great. The sushi rice was made out of a home rice cooker... come on y'all... gotta step up your game there. Food is a bit salty but overall decent. Worth a try if you live in Round Rock otherwise probably not worth stopping by for."

                "description": "I mean the food was OK but was a) very very rich, and b) everything was very salty.  I had a half-dozen gulf oysters which were very small, and also had the shrimp and grits which was just over complicated. The shrimp was overcooked as you would expect someplace hundreds of miles from the coast where no one knows anything about seafood, and the dish was overall just rich and higher-flown than necessary.  D had something else for a main dish that neither of us even remembers, and she also had the mac and cheese which was tasty but also a little over-produced.  Neither of us would consider returning. Third star is because the service was good - Kevin was our server - otherwise, and this this is just OUR opinion as lifetime gulf coast residents, maybe two stars."

                "description": "We found ourselves in Round Rock, TX on a recent Saturday, early evening, so we decided to stop by Salt Traders Costal Cooking on IH 35.  We found a couple of open seats at the bar.  Our first orders were a couple of craft cocktails, the Gin and Housemaid Tonic and The Rum Around.  Both were good, but upon reflection, for the price, regular cocktails would have sufficed.    We kind of went crazy on appetizers, having Gulf oysters, grilled oysters, crab fingers, and the crudo plate, which was yellowfin.  All of those dishes were \"off the chart\" crazy good, with the exception of the crudo ... the white sauce used was way too sweet for the awesome fish.    When we finally ended up at the main section of the menu, we ordered the fried oyster lettuce wraps and the simply grilled fish of the day, which was redfish.  The tartar sauce served with the lettuce wraps was delicious, but a bit too much was slathered on the wraps.  IMHO put a dash on the lettuce leaves and let the patron add as desired from the small cup of tartar sauce that comes with the dish.  The redfish was terrific, but no one knew why the place would have farm-raised redfish from the Indian Ocean when we have fresh redfish 200 miles away in the Gulf of Mexico?    Keeping it local, we ordered the Becker Vineyard Reserve Viognier, and it was delicious.  In closing, a special shout out to our waiter Nathan behind the bar, service was attentive but not intrusive, so nice to have a great waiter with a great attitude!"

We've never had a less than wonderful experience there with the diverse menu and bold bright flavors and textures of amazingly prepared seafood and American cuisine and wonderful drinks.  The newly transformed Flat Top Fish Tacos are unbelievably good as the two hearty tacos are prepared Birria style with caramelized cheese crust on the flour tortilla and with substantial amount of grilled black drum with a street corn filling along with the cup of aromatic tomato-shrimp soppin broth and tomatillo-lime rice with pickled chilis.   Other favorites include Grilled Oysters and Fried Oyster Lettuce Wraps for Starters and the  Fish Enchiladas and of course fresh Oysters and Daily Specials and Seasonal Deserts.  FLAT TOP FISH TACOS 17 crispy cheese flour tortilla, street corn,  tomatillo lime rice, pickled chilis,  charred tomato-shrimp soppin' broth"

                "description": "Salt Traders might be my favorite upscale casual restaurant in Round Rock. The vibe here is similar to Jack Allen's, but with a nautical twist. 100% the kind of place where you'll find at least one dude rocking salmon colored shorts and boat shoes. No shade, just facts.  I particularly love their happy hour. All the appetizers are hits (especially the chowder fries), and that $4 discount on apps is really nice. I may be wrong, but I think on either Monday or Tuesday, happy hour is basically all day. If you've never been and want to sample a bunch of things, definitely take advantage of this.  My favorite entree by far is the shrimp and grits. It comes with a savory sauce on top that really sets it apart from other places. The bowl is also huge, and so the price is more than justified. I'm particularly fond of the Bonnabel -- one of my favorite whiskey cocktails ever. Just sweet enough for a guy like me who can't drive a manual, but just whiskey forward enough that it doesn't look like I own a Fiat.   The place gets super busy at the usual dinner times and all times during the weekend. Be a pro and hit them up during slow hours for the best experience!"

North Round Rock really isn't the place you'd think of for high quality seafood and a great classy bar scene, but that's exactly what this place had.  My wife had the scallops and they were seared perfectly and tender in the middle. Couldn't ask for better.  I had a fish sandwich, but I'm picky so I did it without the slaw, which was a mistake because it needed the crunch and the sauce. I'm sure it would be a 10/10 with that.  Definitely go to this place. We were treated like gold and the food was excellent!"

I then had the New Orleans Shrimp. Very nice. You can tell the shrimp are fresh. I then proceeded on to the Shrimp and Lobster roll. The roll was fantastic! Warm, fresh, toast yet pillowy on the inside. The Shrimp and Lobster salad was nice and cold. The shrimp burst with flavor and freshness.  My server, (Scott) was elusive to say the least. The other waiters attended to me a lot more than he did. I probably waited 8-10 minutes before he took my order. The restaraunt was probably at 30% capacity at most. I had multiple managers see me looking for my waiter and just walked on by.   Overall, the food is good and they can definitely improve on service. I understand being shorthanded, but some things are inexcusable."

My husband and I arrived in the early side, during happy hour (3:30-6:30 on a Thursday), so we could enjoy a leisurely meal. We started with drinks. I had the frozen grapefruit margarita, which tasted like a regular margarita. I loved that the salt on the glass also had citrus peel.  Our appetizer ($5 off during happy hour) was pot stickers. They were excellent, and the portion size (6) just right for sharing. The sauce was wonderful.   I ordered one of the day's specials for dinner, seared monkfish. It was served over fingerling potatoes and topped with a great salsa. The monkfish was tasty  but a bit on the chewy side... and the potatoes were barely undercooked. My husband had fish and chips, always a good choice at Salt Traders.  Dessert was vanilla creme brulee topped with peach sorbet. Excellent!   Service was excellent. We enjoyed Patrick's sense of humor and the stories he told.   We will be back again, without a doubt!"

Given that it's by the people behind Jack Allen's, Salt Trader typically gives you a small portion of their Salmon dip to welcome you.   This place is always packed, especially on Mondays when it's all day HH. If you plan on coming on Monday, definitely get a reservation or you might be waiting ~1 hour.   I've had a number of their appetizers and they're all super tasty. My favorite is definitely the fish collar. Nicely seasoned with Cajun spice and the perfect amount of crisp. You can't really go wrong with any of their entree either.   All in all, solid restaurant that I would go to again and again."

We enjoyed a variety of fresh oysters as an appetizer and then ordered a second round! Super selection so we had to try most all of them  Entrees included the fabulous monkfish special and my absolute favorite, the ciopino! I thought about the monkfish but just had to stay with my favorite, which was soooo yummy as always.  I have to give a shout out to our server, 'Hanna from Louisiana.' She was SUPER! Kept us entertained and was a great representative of the Jack Allen family-knowledgeable, super friendly and totally dedicated to delivering an exceptional guest experience. She is 5 stars for sure.  In summary, we just love love love Salt Traders!!"

We made our reservation a couple of days in advance and the only available time slots left were 4:30 and 8:30pm. We decided to do an early dinner and IT. WAS. SO. GOOD.   We got the 2 dozen chargrilled oysters, 2 dozen seasonal oysters, chowder fries. Presentation, portion, and service was great! Our waitress Hannah was attentive and very sweet! I'm not a huge oyster fan, but these were phenomenal! Between the four of us, we cleaned house and walked out with our appetites satisfied. Afterwards, we walked off our fully bellies at the outlet mall!"

                "description": "Perhaps one of the best local pizza places in Round Rock.  Their menu is definitely creative, they have a lot of amazing pizza combinations or you can always create your own.  You can also order a whole pizza or order by the slice which my wife loved since she usually doesn't eat too much.   We ordered the Orig Mama Gallo and it came with sliced meatballs and pepperoni. The combination of meats were great. The crust and dough were amazing and so soft. Their beer selection is quite extensive, I found a local beer from a small brewery I had never heard of before. I loved it so much that I ended up visiting the local brewery in Pflugerville.  Definitely give it a shot if you are a pizza lover like I am."

                "description": "Bought some wings this weekend.  Tried out the:  Kentucky Bourbon - Amazing! Right level of heat, smoke, and sweetness  Teriyaki- Sweet and tasted exactly how teriyaki sauce should taste. Deep notes of ginger which was amazing  Lemon pepper- could have been a lot better. It was almost as if they just sprinkled a little bit of essence of the seasoning.  Honestly couldn't tell the difference between the lemon pepper and the following wings.  Taco- I could see the seasoning but they were basically naked wings. The only flavor I could sort of taste was cumin, which was kinda blah. I wouldn't call these Taco Flavor. A good idea to market these as taco flavor would be to market the as \"carnita wings\" fry them up until they are super crunchy like chicharrón crunchy then serve them with side of salsa. If you use this please credit me! Lol free wings with a year would be nice too lol ;)"

                "description": "I honestly do not know where to begin with this review......I get it, possibly short staffed, since I did see a sign out front, but management should adjust how many patrons are seated if that's the case. 1. We signed up for space available seating for six people, mind you, two were planning to order single slices. We get to the restaurant and the first thing that strikes four of us as odd is the fact that the \"greeter\" had the emotions of Wednesday Addams...zero expressions nor cordiality. Did not see a smile one from this person. She should reconsider her position, but I'd suggest she work BOH the way she appeared.  2. Our waiter/order taker person, whatever the pronoun is today was flat out.....Terrible! His name was AJ, AJ was not attentive, didn't write ANYTHING down, did not take our drink orders(he was reminded by the bar staff). After he \"mental\" took our order down l noticed the \"I got you look\", AJ did not have us. Nope, ordered sweet tea, got unsweetened, came back with an excuse, we brushed it off. Ten minutes later, came back and asked my wife and I what pizza we ordered(again, he wrote it down mentally), I asked him to guess...when I told him a number 12 he replied, \"I knew it, was just checking.\" I honestly could keep going on number two, as the service was just that....shit.  3. Nothing, I mean nothing arrived on time. My Brother received his pizza before ANY of the the reheat and serve slices came out. My wife and I got ours after he'd finished half of the pizza. After the complete shit show for service, as soon as our pizza came out we got a to-go box. I could expound on every one of these points, but I won't.   All in all the bill was $145, only one beer was ordered. I was \"fine\" with leaving a $20 tip for the service we received, but was talked into being generous. My old self would not have been so nice. Maybe folks are used to this service at this establishment, but for the money we paid I would have been happier with a PJ pizza and some good garlic butter sauce! Oh, I attached a pic of my pizza from last night...."

One time we ordered it for delivery and were charged mega bucks by the delivery service, so we'll never do that again.  Another time I placed an order over the phone to go and had to wait outside for about 15-20 minutes past the pickup time because there were so many people in line."

                "description": "Slap Box is an interesting name for a Pizzaria with an included drafthouse. I stumbled upon this spot after Google searching \"pizza near me\". I was sawyer by the 4 star Yelp reviews, I had detour from my original plan to visit Pinthouse Pizza.   There's plenty of parking in fact there's an indoor covered parking lot on the same block around the corner. Upon entry the ambiance is well wonderful. There's enough tables and an ample amount of TV's to watch any of your heart's desire for sports.  I proceeded directly to the bar to order my pizza and beer to go.  When I sat down at the bar I ordered a pepperoni pizza and some water. After the pizza arrived after about 15 minutes or so I decided to sample a couple of ciders. I tried the Meridian Hive Cherry and the Meridian Hive Rhapsody. I ended up buying the Meridian Hive Cherry. It was on the sweeter side think like a wine.  When I finally tried the pizza it was pretty good. It was above average and I would try it again. The wings were really good. The sauce was flavorful and robust. The chicken was very good too. I definitely recommend Slap Box!"

During CoVid times, we ordered to-go and ate in the plaza next door since it was a lovely afternoon.   Be forewarned, if you get a slice... it is a BIG slice!  See the La Jolla slice picture. It's huge!  The kids loved their pizza. Not a surprise there since it was your typical pepperoni.   I had a GF, vegan pizza for the first time and it was pretty good. I'm so glad they had this option on the menu so I didn't have to order a salad.   They had lots of beer options on tap but we didn't partake this time. Next time, we will. Give them a try!"

                "description": "1. Let me just start off by saying, I grew up in a small town in Chicago Illinois so you could say pizza is my thing, and quite frankly slapbox pizzacheria or whatever the pronoun for this place is today has just that(pizza) 2. My experience at the slap was quite literally the reason I am willing to go back. Although it is clear to me that they are fairly understaffed the staff that work there currently are quite a joy. When you walk in you are greeted by a very interesting fellow that has the likes of Wednesday Adams from the Adams family, aswell as the door swinging wide open. Luckily for me I really enjoyed Wednesday Adams in the movie as she was my favorite character. Also I think people should be less hard on her at the slap because she seems to be doing good at her job as a greeter. 3. Our order taker person or whatever was also a very pleasant person. When we were seated by the greeter our order taker person named I believe adam was extremely nice and energetic,it was a damn shame my friends and I did not grab his number because he was looking extra fine the day we came in. Other than that he was still very nice and made sure our food was out on time. 4. To wrap up my essay on the slap I think it would be nice for me to talk about our experience with the food. Putting my Chicago ego aside my friends and I decided to order pizza here. I ordered the El Camino and let me tell you it might have been a fan favorite of mine, heck I could go for a slice right now while writing this review. 5. In conclusion I think slapbox pizzacheria is a great place to hangout and eat some pizza with friends and family. I also think that other reviewers shouldn't set a 4 star restaurant at such a high standard the place is ran aswell as it can be with the amount of staff they are given. My friends and I will most definitely be coming back to the slap as we enjoyed our stay"

HUGE slices! Lots of variety and interesting toppings. AND this is a pizza restaurant but do not overlook the wings. They are sooo good. I love the dry rub ranch and recently tried the bourbon glaze which was super tasty. They have a great variety of beers on tap and attentive service. Also, a great place for take away.

Good pizza and a great selection of draft beer is why we stop. But tonight, Sunday evening, January 2, was a disappointment. We agreed to the 30 minute wait that we were told it would take for our group of five to be seated. What we were not told after we were seated was that we would have to wait more than an hour to receive our two-pizza order. An hour and twenty minutes to be exact. It seemed a great number of take-out orders were being filled that night and after an hour our waiter assured us our order had not been lost but there was a long line ahead of us. The staff knew of the pending delay when we were seated and we should have been informed so we could decide if we wanted to invent that amount of time. The bill was $88 and some change. I left a $5 tip and a note expressing my disappointment. I signed my name and left my phone number on the ticket should the owners like a more detailed explanation of our experience. We will go back to 600 Degrees but we know now to ask what the wait time will be after we are seated."

                "description": "It wasn't pizza.  It was something very surprising and I had to share.  I don't know what happened.  I went downtown to pay my tax bill.  I thought about a nearby place that has a great beer selection and pizza.  So, I went there.  But I went in a different direction. Hot wings.  I asked about them.  The servers were attentive and described everything.  Even the bartender came over to check and make sure I was OK after I ordered and suggested beers and said it will be worth the wait.    Then the wings came to my table. They glistened in sauce and fat and were luscious.  Even the shiny foil underneath made them look like a gift   And then I ate.    Tender, juicy, the perfect spice.  The heat and meat!  Sooo good!!  The perfect chili/orange/Buffalo sauce color was gorgeous but tasted even better.  My palate was singing! My hands were messy. But, I ignored napkins, my friends!  I licked my fingers instead.  I don't regret it!   I thought at first the size of the wings order would be too much. It. Was. Not.   The server asked if I wanted a pizza. But, no, I ordered another beer and wings.  I don't want the pizza. I want the wings!!!!"

                "description": "This place was recommended by a family member. The interior was small And packed so we sat outside on a brisk night. They should have some outdoor heaters and covering from the on/off drizzle.  We ordered a pizza and wings. The pizza names were curious as I'm from the area these towns are located in. I ordered my birthplace pizza (San Jose). The Lemmon pepper wings came out about 20 minutes before the pizza. The wings were PERFECT! I mean damn they were good! The pizza came out and it's a spicy one. The pizza was bigger than I expected and is made for at least two people. Flavor was good but it had a bit too much of some sort of creamy white sauce on top. The beers were on point as I tried out several local ones.  I will definitely come back and try more of their delicious menu!"

I always get a slice of the basil pesto and it is absolutely delicious. And very filling. My husband and daughter like the pepperoni, and we usually get a side salad that's good too."

                "description": "That's not a slice..This is a slice! References aside if you want giant slices of pizza this is the place. Think as large a slice that you have to fold like a sandwich to eat. Perfect for any pizza or cheese cravings.   Atmosphere: Had the chance to dine outside of here. Given the location within Georgetown, you get the feeling of a family pizzeria. A place one would bring their friends for a casual dine out. Complete with patio.  Food: As mentioned above, big big slices. Perfect for any pizza lover of all sorts. I ended up going with the Pirate which is one of their speciality slices that comes as pictured below with a pickle too. The only complaint I'd have is that since the pizza's come out so fresh they also come out very hot. I unashamedly had to eat the pizza with a knife and fork as I just couldn't wait for such a prize to just sit there.   Service: Friendly service, given the significant amount of speciality slices I had a few questions and the server was happily able to answer any I had. Especially if you are unsure of what pizza slice you may want.  Overall: Now that I've tasted whenever I have pizza cravings I just want to return here to try all their other speciality slices. Give this place a try, and have a slice day!"

                "description": "Eating my way through Austin and the suburbs.  Pizza I love it.  My go to.    Interesting spot!   You can do pizza by the slice and customize it with your own toppings much like a whole pizza except it's a slice, a slice that is the size of a small pizza or Texas? Go figure.   Everything is bigger.   Just cheese pizza would be rather bland here add your toppings and go with it.  Everyone gets what they want and it's fast.   Good stuff.  The garlic knots need some more garlic too them that's just me.   Definite unique spot to get that pizza fix."

                "description": "Drove up to Georgetown with my girlfriend to take some pictures with the Christmas lights and explore the square. We popped in to 600 degrees after talking about needing to try it for months and it did NOT disappoint.  We were going to try a traditional pie, but ended up branching out to try the Royale with Cheese and we are so glad we did! The pizza was incredible, we split it and still had a few slices left over. We did it with the additional mustard and pickles, which is an absolute must.  The crust was to die for, and I say this as a person who normally throws crust away. It was so fluffy and soft, truly a 10/10 dough experience.  They had Maine Root soda on the fountain and a ton of beers on tap that they are more than willing to let you sample.   It isn't a big place and it can get pretty packed. There was a 25 minute wait when we arrived, but we ended up just sitting at the bar.  The service was great, the food was phenomenal, and the atmosphere was fun and friendly."

                "description": "Tried out for a later lunch/early dinner so got here about 330.  (Passing through to San Antonio but was starving)   It's in downtown/on the square so has the old build vibe. The side we sat on was little and faced the bar.   Definitely has the college town feel.   ***Didn't see any actual menus so be prepared to use your camera on your phone to look at the menu.   Service: Food was slow to come out. I didn't time it but we were there about an hour.  Our waitress was nice and did come by and check on us a couple times.   Food: Ordered the Caesar salad to start and it was tasty. The size for the salad was big enough you could share if you are looking for a smaller side salad.   I will say if the time it took to get our slices it was worth no sharing.  We ordered #6 pirate and #23 number 23 as slices and shared them.  Oh my!! They were both delicious and honestly for us worth the wait.   Even with the little bit of the wait I think still worth the 5 stars.   ** please forgive my pictures, I got so excited about them I ate the point of the slices. And we sliced them in half after we got them so they would be entire piece if when you get them.    ENJOY"

The slices are very big and one was plenty, hand in pic for reference of size. We didn't try any of the craft beers but their selection is quite large if that's your thing. Easy to find parking and a nice chill vibe."

                "description": "I have always loved coming here. Service is hit or miss but such is life. I've told so many people about this place because they have a decent beer selection and decent pizza.   I'm a simple girl. I love a hoppy beer and a slice of cheese pizza, so that's generally what I come here for.  I'm always respectful, nice, I tip well and have a cheerful disposition. That's just my vibe. I've also been a server for many many years so I'm generally pretty patient with bad/moody service or off experiences.  I loved this place so much that I used to always go to the one in N. Austin slash Cedar park for lunch because it was close to my work and I'm a loyal customer. At that location, I always order a slice of cheese pizza. One time I asked for a bit of seasoning, chef's choice, and it was so damn good I never ordered regular cheese pizza again. It's a beautiful thing and I was so thankful.  I can drink a beer and make something tasty at home; all day every day, but tonight I decided to come to 600 degrees because I love supporting local businesses and servers in general.   I order my go to; the hoppiest beer and a slice of cheese pizza with any seasoning.   She said \"we only offer cheese pizza or pepperoni\"  I was like, \"cool, I just want a slice of cheese pizza but with a touch of seasoning, any seasoning really, chef's choice.\"  She appears to be really put out, not the least bit subtle and perhaps internalizing this because she's outwardly angry. \"I can give you Parmesan or red peppers as seasoning.\" She picks up both and throws them like I've hit a nerve.   Sips beer. Ok, fine, whatever. ‍   It's a slow Sunday night, there's 3 other people at the bar. It's approx 8:30pm and apparently seasoning is a touchy subject around here so I let it go for now, but the fear of my slice lacking flavor was making me rethink my dinner choices. I hadn't had a proper meal all day, just scraps of snacky stuff. I was really hungry, but not so hungry I would eat something just shy of delicious.   I take a few sips of my beer and the bad vibes are so thick I could cut right through them.  Being steps away from the BOH, I ask, \"hey can I get a little bit of seasoning on my slice of cheese pizza?\"  To which he responds; \"you have to ask your server. Its up to them, if they order it I'll make it. I can't make it if they don't order it\". The loyalty coupled with toxicity was blowing my mind.   Apparently it's a whole thing, because the staff starts gathering to watch the showdown. Girl who wants a slice of seasoned cheese pizza against the world. It's riveting.   OMG you guys, this woman wants seasoning!!! Can you believe it!!!?   It's to a point that it's kinda hilarious and I'm just like, these people have big feelings about seasoning.   She steps in, heroically in her eyes I'm sure and says \"I'll do it for you but just this one time.\" I mean, total saint right?   Oh my! I'm touched. Thank you! My cup runneth over!   I go back to my seat and watch the drama unfold over a bit of seasoning on a slice of cheese pizza. It's something to behold folks.   At this point I don't like my tasty beer so much that I'm willing to subject myself to this level of toxicity so I left because I prefer my pizza sans the needless drama and hostility.   I kinda think this has nothing to do with seasoning."

I upped the rating to 5 star from 3 star because takeout pizza is all about timing. 600 has taken steps to separate the \"I just want a beer\" line from the \"hey, I'm here to pick up an order\" line. Getting home with a hot pizza = a great pizza. Getting stuck in a long checkout line and ending up with a cold pizza = a horrible pizza.   Great job 600 on stepping up and making the takeout experience better for all."

We walked around the quaint shops of the square while we waited. When it was our turn, we were really hungry! Our friendly  server was Michael and he was really friendly. He brought us a few samples of local beer and my husband and I were happy to get to choose our favorites. I can't remember what we got but it was good. We ordered garlic knots but they were out. We choose cheesy bread for our 2nd choice appetizer. We ordered one city pie, one margarita pizza, and one cheese pizza. Michael recommended the gluten free, which made our portions a little smaller and also less of that bloated feeling. The hubby and I are trying to eat healthier so I said yes to gluten free. We ate almost all of our pizzas, while sitting on the patio enjoying our beer.  This restaurant is just one more reason that I'm falling in love with Georgetown. We will be back."

Since its located downtown Georgetown there is a bunch of street parking and a few lots located a block or two away so not too terrible of a walk.  After reading a few reviews I was sold on the pizza by the slice especially if you are able to customize it however you want or from their list at dinner (5PM) it is only cheese or pepperoni. To start we had the sweet chili wings and they were delicious, had a nice crisp/crunch! Pizza was amazing and worth the wait, I had the pirate and the garlic on top just made the pizza even more amazing.  Service lacked a bit, but I can understand everyone has their off days and with the pandemic contact should be at a minimum. All in all, I will be back especially during lunch hours for more pizza by the slice."

You can make up your own mind based on the trolling I've received from their clientele from my previous review, and the continued crowding on their sidewalk outside with unmasked folks not socially distanced."

They usually have sports on their TVs. Whether you're shopping during the day or stopping in for a drink in the evening. The crowd range is vast. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and the taps are rotating. They even have water bowls outside for your dog. They serve beer, wine, and select seltzer's in cans. It's a great place to kill a few hours in the heart of downtown Georgetown."

                "description": "This place is always SUPER packed on weekends, it can be near impossible to find a seat. Luckily there are a few outdoor tables and chairs for overflow but even the sidewalks get crowded with people just standing around drinking. One evening we managed to make it in and see what all the excitement was about and it's a cute little beer and wine bar/outdoors gear store. Cute merchandise but pretty pricey. The bartender told us occasionally a food truck will park behind their store so you can enjoy yummy eats with your drinks, otherwise no food menu. I liked the atmosphere of this place... cute little date night drink spot on the square. But I am a little confused by why it's so crowded all the time. The beer and wine list is good, but not anything spectacular. I don't get it. I'm sure we'll be back at some point if we can find a place to sit."

They have a good selection of draft beer that changes from time to time. Mostly local. I went back the very next day for the Dallas Cowboys game. Very friendly staff. The next day I sat in a comfortable leather chair. They also have a lot of nice clothing for men. A little too pricey for me, but I understand they have some deals from time to time. I will definitely be going there every time I'm in downtown Georgetown."

I didn't try the beer, so I can't comment on that, but the clothing selection was good. They carry Howler Brothers apparel, which is a company out of Austin that my fisherman husband likes, and Texas Standard clothing, which is a TX-based brand with cool (not kitschy) Texas-themed clothing that gives back to Texas non-profs. They also carry another local brand - Kermode Outdoors - which is new to me, but evidently founded by Georgetown residents. The store has a great vibe and the bar is a place I could see spending a few hours on a Saturday afternoon. Stores like this are what I look for whenever I shop local - a place that sells unique, cool stuff that someone has spent time thinking about.   4 not 5 stars because I didn't try the beer. Next time...."

She had been, but it was my first time - although I'd been eyeing Hopsquad as it was building up and it had been on my list to visit. The parking is limited, so plan ahead. The space is bigger than it looks from the outside - as it has an indoor bar as well as an outdoor picnic table area. I tried two beers (can't remember which ones) and they were both very good. The menu had good variety, so I feel like it's a good spot to bring a group that could have diverse beer tastes. The staff was friendly and seemed to be happy working there. I would definitely visit again!"

I usually love the sweet, malty taste of a brown ale, but the IBU rating on this one was a little high for my tastes.  Not terrible, mind you, and I would consider it again. Just a little hoppy for my tastes.    It's in an industrial park, like many breweries are, but it was a nice, spacious, and clean set up. Service was quick too - so was parking.  On my last visit, they even had a local band playing from within one of the loading dock doors.   Bottom line, great tastes, services, parking easy, and some good live tunes.  Check them out!"

                "description": "Design aesthetic on fleek. Open ro ALL customers--dog and kid-friendly! Strong wifi and food truck supported, Hopsquad is going places.  We walked in excited to try their beers. We heard about this spot and it was so easy to find off the main road. It's connected to Circle Brewing and separated by an easily-crossed chain fence. UGH! How convenient. Beer nerds unite! The mural art is very instagrammable and the interior is even more of a design paradise. The chairs, tables, succulents, artwork and all-around ambiance is so calming, zen and open. It's the perfect place to get work done or enjoy a sunny day with your furry friends. We were a group of four, and all of us loved the space. They also have strong wifi, so y'all know this girl would rather get studying/work done with a beer over cafe drinks any day.  The restrooms are also very clean and GET THIS...they have tampons, pads and AVEENO LOTION IN THE WOMENS' RESTROOM. Yee-haw! They have flights of four for the typical Austin price of $10. Everything is wonderful about this place. They also have a little strip of grass for dogs to do their business--and they have a poop bag station too. The food truck looks like omakase (I'm not entirely sure), but they have so many outdoor games/picnic tables as well as indoor activities like fooseball and dog treats.  The aspects that could be improved are parking. Yes, they have additional parking that's a few lots away...but immediate parking is a drag. We got lucky and squeezed in on the side by the large trash receptacles. The beers also weren't everybody's favorites. They did have a selection, but they only have a few beers on tap. However, Hopsquad is so very green still...that variety will take time. GREAT new brewery providing a hip space for all folks!"

                "description": "We chanced upon Hopsquad recently, and I don't think I've ever been more comfortable at any other brewery in Austin. I do agree that their beer is still probably finding its footing (Austin does have a competitive craft beer scene, after all), but I don't think other places can hold a candle to Hopsquad's absolutely chilled out homey vibes.   I'll do a pros and cons list.   Pros:  - I can bring my human +canine children and seat them indoors.  - the staff actually don't mind human children.  -cider and wine available for non-beer drinkers   -the staff like my canine child (and there are plenty of other dog parents who visit which means you can play \"I pet that dog!\")  - board games  - foosball table  - plenty of space   Cons  - I truly believe there are better beers out there.  - cider portions are small - from a can and a little steep , price wise  So when you weigh the two, the pros beat the cons by a mile. As for the beer- give them time. I mean, no one really cared about a few other noted breweries 5 years ago but look how popular they've become now ! Here's to Hopsquad becoming Austin's next too brewery.   - food truck outside  - plenty of parking"

As the name suggests they are very much hops forward. I am not. I came in and asked the woman about non-hop forward beers. She suggested one and I tried it. It was very hop forward. The bar, if you call it that, is very pretentious. Would not come here again if traveling through Austin."

They're welcome!  We enjoyed the ambiance, hubs enjoyed the beer (I'm doing dry January) and they've got an amazing Japanese food truck out front (Tsuken Hoten) and their shiitake and avocado bowl was fantastic! They'll be serving a limited seating omakase very soon and it'll be reasonably priced!   We've got tons of greta breweries in austin but I think this one is in my top 5 for ambiance, dog-friendly, great grub, plenty of power outlets if you want to work, and friendly staff! I'll be sure to taste their beers myself and update this review accordingly.  Plenty of parking, and you can park in the lot by Circle if you can't find one in their lot. Head on over ASAP (Wed-Sun) only for now."

                "description": "I stopped in this past Friday for some crowlers to-go. As this was my first visit, I tried three different offerings. First off, their online ordering is slick and seamless. Secondly, they seem to have adapted well to the pandemic with adequate spacing between their outdoor tables. I would definitely feel comfortable having some pints in their beer-garden. If you are as excited about Austin FC (soon-to-be season ticket holder) these guys are within easy walking distance to the gorgeous new stadium. I can see myself having pre-match beers here before taking the short walk to the stadium.  Now on to the important stuff: the beer!  I opted for their Kate la Quimica SMaSH IPA, Professor Pleasant pale ale, and my personal favorite style Sir Winsor ESB. I found the SMaSH to be my favorite, it was a fantastic representation of the style, 9/10. My second favorite was the ESB, major kudos for carrying this style that is far too rare state-side. It was delicious and my second favorite of that style in town 8/10 (bonus point for a well-done obscure style). I thought the pale ale was fair, I found it to be a bit one-note. Though pleasant on the nose, it lacked a similar nuance on the palate 6/10. All said, I will definitely be back to try their extensive and varied roster of brews. As a bonus, the staff I spoke with were extremely friendly and happy to talk about both their brews and Austin FC. Keep up the great work!"

                "description": "From the second we walked in I liked the vibes of this place. It is very open and clean, but still warm and cozy. There is a decent amount of space both indoors and out, but I could still see how this place could get packed.   We went around 5 on a Friday and it wasn't empty but also wasn't too crowded. It was nice out so we sat outside. I got a flight which was only $10 for 4 smaller beers and I could pick any of the options on tap.   I'm not a big beer drinker so I don't know that it's fair for me to detailed review each beer, but from the variety I'm sure any one that likes beer could find something they enjoy.   Great place to bring a group! They also have a little food truck/ restaurant out back that looked really good but I haven't tried yet."

                "description": "A decent brewery very similar to all the others in the area. The problem is that it takes longer to get a beer here on Austin FC game days than any of the other places. I know there's a big crowd on game day, but how dumb not to anticipate that and bring in more staff. A brewery exists to sell beer. And you'll wait 45 minutes in line to get one here. Hopsquad just hasn't figured out how to serve beer at a reasonable speed so they are selling half as many as they could while inconveniencing everyone."

                "description": "We came during peak time on a Saturday evening. This means we are seeing them at their most challenged time. And I was a little \"hangey\" having to wait a half hour to be seated. But it was worth it. The waiter checked back with us every few minutes (mandatory for a good restaurant). And our order was delivered hot and fresh in a reasonable amount of time (a little slow because they were very busy - but in a reasonable amount of time).  We had chips and queso as an appetizer. The chips were the thick, homemade type. And the queso was their own recipe with ancho cili drizzle, crema, some sort of pico de gallo, etc. Really good - exceptional.  I had a chicken sandwich. It had a lot going on (in a good way). It was not just a run of the mill chicken sandwich. And the sidewinder fries are fresh and homemade.   My wife had the watermelon, which she also said was really good.  Overall, some creative foods that were well executed, and on point service  Definitely give this place a try."

                "description": "I didn't love this place. I totally understand that with COVID, many restaurants have had to cut back their menus.   With that being said, it seemed like breakfast-y food definitely prevailed during our Sunday afternoon visit. Seeing that they do a Sunday brunch, I get it, but always pictured that included a few other options not focused around eggs or waffles.   My husband ended up ordering their burger (which isn't even obviously advertised as a burger), and said it wasn't anything to write home about. My mother-in-law had their chicken sandwich and seemed to be okay with it. Not much fanfare from my husband's stepfather or his girls.  I ended up ordering the chili and didn't have any major complaints. I would've loved to see more in the \"siesta\" part of the menu that wasn't a salad.   My other complaint was the noise. The music was so loud that we could barely hear each other across the table, which pretty much awkwardly split our party in half. At first, we tried to get past it by borderline yelling, but that got old.   In between waiting for condiments, I asked our waitress if there was any way to knock the volume down by a click or two. She mentioned that she would see what she could do, but that it wasn't guaranteed since \"people pay for it\". My brother in law ended up seeing the jukebox in the corner, and while that's fantastic, I don't think it's too much to ask to keep music at a reasonable level in a place where you'd expect your guests to socialize at their table."

We chose to sit outside but soon discovered the flies were way too many to be able to eat in peace. We couldn't stop waving our hands or the flies would land on the food. I'll go back, but sit inside next time."

Out of some Cabernets. They were out of everything we went to order. The server could not have been more kind and sweet. She said it was because they run out of a lot of things on Saturday nights so Sundays they're just out. Well, I did a quick review of the comments on this restaurant and this is apparently a running theme. 1. Shame on me for not checking the comments before we came, 2. Shame on them for not resolving this clearly on-going issue. I know times are tough, but just close on Sunday nights if you cannot have more product delivered. We finished our drinks and left without ordering dinner at all."

                "description": "Sorry this is a little late but I wanted to give a review. I stopped by here a couple weeks ago for dinner. The place was full, but they squeezed me in at the bar. I asked for a menu and a beer. The bar tender let me sample one of the beers on tap. I liked it so I ordered one to drink. I also ordered a patty melt with tater tots. The burger was think and made to order. I had to cut the burger because I did not want a big mess from trying to get a bite into my mouth. The burger was juicy since I ordered it medium and very tasty. I can say it filled me up. The beer was cold, nothing better than a cold beer, well almost nothing.  The atmosphere was as most sports bars are, a little noisy but people seems to know each other and they were friendly. The bartenders were busy but kept getting those drinks. The servers were also busy taking food and refilling cups of the patrons. There is outdoor seating but it was one of those HOT Days so I was glad I was inside. The parking is decent but they share with several other businesses. It was not too far away from the entrance so no need to wear the sneakers unless you want to.  Thank you Republic Kitchen + Bar for being a good neighbor and giving us another option to dine in Leander, Texas."

The only complaint I have about it is that they put the bread on the grill to get grill marks, but all I tasted was burnt toast. They do the top if the burger bun the same but it's not as grill marked. So next time I will ask for them not to do that, I hate black charred burnt toast. My husbands burger was good as well and both the tots and fries were tasty and perfect portion. They have a big bar with a good variety. I had a Hell or High Water to drink, and will definitely order that again. Delish! And last but def not least the service was great! Our server Kelsey was attentive and very sweet. Definitely looking forward to the next visit...word is they have a good weekend brunch, so we'll be checking that out."

But the mash and veggies had great flavor and tasted good!  Texas Smash is good if you like a honey whiskey, I don't.  But the old fashion was just how I like it!  Overall good place to try, the service was good. They have tvs on but I'd recommend that they put subtitles on all of them so since we can't hear them we can at least read and know what is going on."

                "description": "This was one of the worst experiences we've had in a restaurant in a long time.  The server was rude, the manager condescending (strangely, I don't remember him being so rude at Texican) and the place was dirty.  The table was sticky, and they knew it, even said there was nothing they could do about it because it was \"resin\"...it wasn't.  We ordered four entrees, and they came out in stages. The first ones to hit the table were cold.  The third followed five minutes later, and mine didn't show up for another five minutes, at which time I told them to just keep it.  The \"hash\" was runny and not at all hash, the scrambled eggs cold, bacon underdone, and no condiments available; when we asked for them, they acted like it was an imposition.    $92 worth of bad food and crap service.  Very disappointing considering the executive chef was wearing a Fox Hole chef's coat, and Fox Hole is one of my favorite places in this area; I assumed from the get it would be extraordinary after seeing that...I guess not.  Oh, and word of caution, when the server handed my fiancé the mobile payment device, she selected the 20% tip option.  Make sure you watch out for that...there is no signage indicating there is an automatic gratuity so the servers have NO business choosing their own tip amount.  Update: while we were out of town, we discovered my fiancé's debit card had been hacked.  Oddly, the odd charges started AFTER using the mobile payment device, which was WiFi powered.  I cannot stress this enough...BEWARE!"

This was the perfect place to sit back, chill and enjoy great food and company. I really like the ambience of this restaurant. It boasts a laid back feel with the dim lighting, yet has an open atmosphere. I ordered the Grilled Atlantic Salmon and everything was cooked to perfection. The salmon was cooked on the medium side to my liking and request to the server. We also ordered the James Bowie Nachos. Keep in mind these are not the typical Tex-Mex nachos, but they were still delicious and flavorful with a hint of robust BBQ flavor. There is an option to add chicken or steak and we opted for the chicken...great choice! If you love spicy (I sure do), they have a kick to them, as they are topped with freshly sliced jalapenos. Our server was excellent! She was so friendly, accommodating and checked on us frequently. She alone deserves a 5-star recognition! Try this place that offers locally-sourced, high quality food with its own, unique flavor."

I guess that means I'll have to make up for lost time. We got the Brussel Sprouts as an appetizer. There was a sweetness to it with the apples and honey and candied pecans. So good! For dinner, I got the Pan-Seared Chicken and had to say yes to that when I saw that the chicken was on top of risotto, my favorite. The chicken was a small piece but very flavorful. I got the tots and also some chili which was spicy! Thanks The Republic, great place. I gotta get one of your large cocktails next time too."

They were out of fried salmon (odd bc they had the other way?) or I would have gotten that since you can basically get a shrimp taco anywhere. I'll definitely be back for taco Tuesday again. It was a little cold, I like my food room temperature so it was perfect for me, but I could see someone being disappointed in the temperature of the food. But I'm not knocking off any stars for that since that's how I like my food."

                "description": "Came here for dinner on Tuesday night 6/15/21 with some family. I ordered the El Cesar Chavez salad with salmon and when they food came out the first bite I took I was fishing a bone out of my mouth from the salmon. So I started to inspect the rest of the fish and found 3 more bones. I informed our waitress and she kindly had it re made but when the second salmon came out I once again found 2 more fish bones inside.   At this point I did not receive an apology nor did a manager come by to check in to if everything was okay so I asked to speak to one and inform him. The gentlemen came over and apologized but really did not seem genuine about it after I explained how dangerous it was that I found a total of 6 fish bones that I could have choked on. He also attempted to blame the chef for not cleaning it right and saying \"I always tell him to make sure all the bones are out.\"   Coming from the restaurant business myself and having my husband be on the corporate side of a big restaurant chain - I was very disappointed in how this place dealt with the issue.   Please check your seafood at this place - they clearly are not ordering boneless seafood or properly cleaning they're fish."

Family friendly spot (a kids play area with kitchen and all!!),good music playlist and eventually some live music. They just have snacks right now but eventually said they'll have a menu. Oh yah and coffee too. We got to meet Derek and his wife, the owners. This is such a great spot to go and work or to relax at after work! Will definitely be back and can't wait to watch this business grow.  We were having so much fun I forgot to take pictures! I'll update with pictures next time I go."

My favorites were the Twisted Rita and Sweet Sow. The Shrooms to the Moon had some good umami to it -- it's the most flavorful, but a bit heavier than the first two. Also -- if you like pizza rolls, then I would definitely try the Rollin' Ronies.  I will definitely be ordering these again in the near future.  Note about ordering: I ordered online and picked up the food. I will say, however, that the order was not ready by the estimated time. Instead, you can wait for a text notification to pick up the order. I didn't know that, but now I do!"

Regardless, while the food tasted great, the portions (pizza and pizza rolls) were pricey for what we got. Paid over $50 for dinner (one salad, one small pizza, 3 very small pizza rolls and one dessert.)"

They are the perfect accompaniment to a pint of draft beer from whichever brewery is housing them at the moment. But if you're looking to just bring their pizza home, you can also order online ahead of time to skip that 20 min wait on site."

There is conflicting info on Yelp and their website. I called ahead because going to the wrong pickup spot would turn me into a hangry rage. They did not answer the phone but the host breweries did. CONFIRMED: They are currently located at Celis brewery.   We ordered 2 pizzas for pickup on Grubhub on a Friday night. BackDraft and pepperoni. They were ready in about 30 minutes. CONFIRMED: The pizzas were AMAZING. Like... hands down some of the best pizza I've ever had. Their homemade sausage and humongous thin pepperoni slices were phenomenal.  I can't speak for anyone else's experiences recently. It sounds like delivery may be questionable? But as of April 2021, if you can drive to pick up a pie, this is the place you need to go."

It's topped with House Made Spicy Sausage, Pepperoni, Fresh Jalapeños, but we also added mushrooms on ours.  It's a thin crust style pizza that is PACKED with flavor.  Our buddy ordered the Kale Yeah Caesar salad which he was very pleased with.  The guys that run this truck are really cool and definitely dedicated to their craft.  Backdraft Pizzeria is definitely up there on the short list of Austin's best pizza.  I'd be surprised if they didn't branch out and open up another location in the near future, especially in the downtown Austin area.  I would highly recommend giving them a visit and try their food.  How can you say no to a fantastic pizza and a frothy craft beer to go with it?"

                "description": "TLDR: BackDraft is back, and they're better than ev-VAH!  I'm a longtime fan of BackDraft, even once calling it 'the best pizza you can get off a truck'.  That's damning with faint praise, as this is some of the best pizza in all of Austin.    Back when I first tried them, the food truck was parked down on 360 near Bee Cave.  But now that both I and they have moved to the north quadrant of Austin, and they're attached to an excellent brewery to boot!  By far, my favorite is a slightly altered 'Shrooms to the Moon', which is a triple-whammy combo of homemade spicy sausage, mushrooms, and carmelized onion. If you look at the picture, you'll see that the crust has the  right amount of 'char' or 'leoparding' as some call it.   Whoever's doing the pizza-slinging at BackDraft knows their stuff. Get down here when they're open, grab a brewski, and you're in for one of the best lunch combos that Austin can serve up!  Some Tips:  1) I said 'best lunch', but be sure to check their hours before you come. I'm pretty sure they just do lunch Friday and Saturday.  Otherwise, they follow brewery peak hours and just do evenings.  2) Try the Shrooms to the Moon but ask them to hold the caramelized onions.  Without the onions, you get a spicier, hotter pizza which goes perfectly with a pale ale beer to wash it down.  You'll end up with a pizza-nirvana feeling of a warm glow in your tummy.  This place scores a 5 out of 5 on the 'CTJ Scale', as noted below.  5 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Jesus good. Would be OK passing away after finishing a plate here. 4 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Mary good. Would be OK being seen eating here by Mother Mary. 3 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Joseph good. Would be OK having a beer here with Jesus' Dad. 2 out of 5 stars: Come-to-the-Apostles good. Meh. Wouldn't have my last supper here. 1 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Nobody good. I wouldn't have my penultimate supper here, either."

But this pie from BackDraft pizza ARRIVED cold.  The fact that it was skimpy for the cost pretty much assured that there weren't going to be any leftovers. From one perspective; that could be a blessing. Because while it wasn't the worst pie I've eaten; it would easily place among the bottom three. Two stars is more generous than this deserves."

                "description": "Oz. Taphouse (pronounced Ounce) is my most favorite neighborhood place to go for a quick bite, a variety of drinks, a place for my kids to play, and the most friendly service. They have a shuffleboard and foosball table inside, a playground and outdoor games like corn hole and hook and ring toss outside, AND live music on Wednesday nights.  We have a big family, a complicated order and the people at Oz. TH make us feel like family. The food is excellent (burgers, tacos, salads, fish and chips, and more). We never have to wait too long. If there is ever an issue they are always quick to make it right.  The adult beverages are on a self-serve system and you pay by the ounce. You can get a flight of beer or wine, but I prefer the Fuzzy Navel Hard Seltzer. Yum! We have loved their commitment to the community and love supporting a local business we believe in. Thank you Oz. Taphouse for being a great place to take my family!!!"

                "description": "My husband and I were in town for the weekend and found this place a short walk from our hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The Bourbon Berry Cocktail was my favorite! We also enjoyed sampling many different beers and wines on tap. Their crispy chicken sandwich was delicious! Very crispy on the outside and moist on in the inside.   They have crowlers and growlers for 25% off everyday. I really wish they had a smaller to go container as I would've loved to have taken some of the Berry cocktail home - I can't justify the cost of it to take home a crowler or growler. We would definitely go back if we were in the area again."

                "description": "We really enjoyed this place which was an accidental find on our way back from one of our activities in Austin. It is a self-serve concept, so basically you are given a card to scan anytime you want to order a wine, beer, or a cocktail from one of their many taps. You also place your food order at the counter and they bring it out to you.   The fried avocado tacos were amazing and my significant other really enjoyed whatever tacos he had, which I believe were the Carnitas. Why four stars then? Two reasons. One is I was really confused on how much I should tip. I usually don't struggle with this being a bartender, but since we had to pour our own drinks and order food at the counter , I wasn't comfortable leaving a full 20%. Second, when you are pouring your beer, the price adds up very quick. There was one point my boyfriend poured a pint glass and the beer ended up being $22. That was a bit of a letdown. Otherwise the staff is VERY friendly and welcoming -they run a very tight ship. The bathrooms were exceptionally clean and the layout with a big outdoor patio is a bonus. Highly recommend, just watch the higher ABV beers because they add up fast!"

                "description": "Stopped by Oz. Tap House for the first time after a Vandegrift H.S. football game, recommended to us by a family member.  \"Go to Oz (pronounced Oz, like wizard of Oz) Tap House, is great.  First things first, we realized later it's not Oz it's Oz.  Notice the period after the z.  Oz. = ounce!  Makes perfect sense when you see the concept.  Dozens of self-serve taps, pouring cocktails, beer, wine, etc.  Way cool!  We couldn't tell how much vodka was actually in the Cosmos we had, but they were tasty!  The Community brand ice tea off the charts too.  Any place serving Community products knows their stuff ... oh yeah, the food.  Definitely \"gotta go back for more\" fare.  Fried cauliflower and jalapeños, nice ranch sauce.  Our server, unprompted, brought some buffalo wing sauce, \"dip a little in here, then the ranch.\"  Awesomeness!  House tacos and cod tacos were delicious, depths of sublime flavors layered into top shelf flour tortillas.  Our only observation was using the house taco slaw on the cod tacos may be a better pairing than the sautéed cabbage... at any rate, the tacos were outstanding.  We'll definitely be back, lots more on the menu to explore.  And a special shout out to James working the register.  Explained the concept, led us through the process, and answered quite a few \"newbie\" questions.  He was great, no need to hire more employees, clone James!"

                "description": "The uniqueness of this place really sets it apart. You are given a card to pour any of the beers on top yourself, which I had seen before and always love. What I hadn't seen was also you can pour wine or cocktails! This experience is perfect for all of those people crawling out of quarantine and not knowing what to do when they cant pour their own drinks. But now you can! And despite the setup involving many hands, Oz. keeps the place sparkling clean.  I can't speak much to the food menu. It's mostly a meat-forward fare. They have a vegan burger patty, but I was told neither of the buns are vegan. Since the patty was really soft, I am not sure it would work as a lettuce wrap. It seems weird to have a vegan patty when you can't have a full vegan burger, but at least there is a vegetarian option.  My mom liked her fish and chips.   I am really just here for the taps though!"

                "description": "How lucky are we to arrive in Texas and meet this amazing place! It was like stepping in paradise. Delicious food and a whole variety of beers.   We tried a few of the beers and had some Tex-Mex.   I tried the sangria beer. I believe it was number 32 on the panel. If you like sangria and bubbles go for it, It's like sangria with bubbles (GF)  Husband had a few other kinds of beers which I tried and oh Man, It was very good! Nothing like I ever had before.   I also had the house tacos (3) with chicken, steak and fried avocado. The fried avocado was definitely a hit for me. It was full of flavor, creamy and crunchy at the same time.   If you are visiting Austin like us and want to drive away from the city you won't regret going to Oz Tap House.   Also, one of the owners is supper friendly we had the pleasure to speak with Sean briefly. Staff is also very nice, patiently explained to us how tap works.   Thanks Oz Tap House for such a memorable welcome!   I recommend this place to everyone!!"

                "description": "I just ordered lunch from Oz tap house. We got fish and chips, fried pickles,  a baked pretzel, a Caesar salad and a cheesesteak.   The pro's: The ranch dressing that came with the fried pickles was pretty good, As was the coleslaw.   The cons:  The fish and chips portion was small and soggy. It was two pieces of greasy fish, that iterally had no flavor. Fish and Chips is one of my favorite foods and I've had it all over the world. Never had I gotten it without flavor. How do you make something taste like nothing? Granted. I asked that the fish and chips have no hot pepper on it. Unfortunately, Hot pepper is the only spice Oz uses.  The fries were cold inside - clearly not hand-cut. The Caesar salad, was spicy in a weird way. It was not good.  The Philly Cheesesteak was very very spicy and greasy.  The Baked Pretzel - Auntie Ann's does a better job, this was a VERY basic, previously frozen pretzel. Nothing special and not worth the price.  The fried pickles - under seasoned and instead of crisp, they were chewy. Again not good.    Everything was extremely spicy, from the fish and chips to the Caesar salad. Food items that traditionally aren't spicy, were all grossly over spiced with hot peppers. Oz Tap House needs to learn how to use spices without making things spicy. Go back to cooking school - Spiced and Spicy! There is a difference! One more thing,  Read dietary notes. There's a reason why people write them."

We were greeted when we walked in,had the process explained etc.  Beers, a couple of ciders,and wines on tap. Pretty cool. I did semi accidentally pour myself 9 oz of wine, so it was a $12 glass, not what I'd typically spend on a glass of wine, but I also typically wouldn't be served 9 oz.  Our food came out quickly and it was really good!  I don't know much it was (folks mentioned auomatic gratuity) bc my husband paid, but it was great and we will definitely come back. They had a playground in the back that we saw,which would be great to come to with our lil people."

Overall everything is a little over priced. Food was sub par. Even happy hour there was only 5 cents off the beer. Expect around $8-9 for a 14 oz beer, and $15+ for mediocre food. And when I went to go tip, they looked at me confused as to why I didn't give them a big tip. Well the answer is simple. I did everything myself while all the workers sat on their phone talking in a booth."

                "description": "One of the closest breweries, in North Austin, to the Austin FC Q Stadium Oskar Blues Brewery is the best spots to stop and have some pre-game beers all in the air conditioning!  Plenty of space to come in with a large group of peeps and even catch some live music on a fantastic and great sounding stage!   My best friend and I came in on a busy Saturday afternoon on a game day so there were plenty of people enjoying beer by the pints and all dressed up in their verde gear. We ended up finding a cool spot near the stage to partake in the flight of beers we ordered.  I couldn't decide on what to get so we opted for the flights to get us started.    Beers - boy oh boy I have never had a smoothie hard seltzer beer ever and Oskar Blues knocked my socks off when I tried their L.A.B. Juice which was super refreshing and looked like a smoothie I make at home. Unsure what was in it but I bet strawberries, banana, and maybe some seltzer apple juice? Either way do not sleep on any of the beers they have on tap that are special to Austin as I am finding out that the beers on tap here differ from their other taprooms in Colorado!  What a special thing for Austin!  One of the biggest perks of Oskar Blues is the space, the live music, and the air conditioning! Texas has at least 9 months out of the year where it is consistently over 89 degrees even in the Fall. Oskar Blues has the air pumping on hot days like when we visited and had plenty of games and shade outside for us to hang under.   We will definitely be back especially to see some live music again. The stage is super professional, large, and the sound man was doing an excellent job for the acoustic performer we saw play that day. I am sure they have epic great shows here."

First thing that stood out to me was how quiet everything was. it was early afternoon, and the place was relatively empty. it does have an extremely large open room, which lends itself to this. if you are looking for a more laid back experience, this place is probably a good bet. the beer itself was good. there wasn't anything that really stood out as fantastic, but nothing that really stood out as bad either. Overall, 3/5."

                "description": "Oskar Blues is a great brewery in North Austin. Located close to the Domain, they offer a wide variety of beers. As a first timer, the bar tender gave me several samples to try. I went with the Dallas Blonde Ale and was not disappointed... it was actually very good.   There were plenty of hightops indoors for seating and the place was packed on a Thursday afternoon (5pm happy hour). I chose to sit on the patio outside where there were more picnic tables, tents, and even cornhole!   Fair warning, the parking lot is a bunch of rocks and dirt, so expect your car to be dirty when you leave. It also looks like a giant warehouse from the outside, but the entrance is along the far right side.  Definitely try Oskar Blues if you're in the area. One of my favorite breweries so far!"

                "description": "This regional brewery has a spacious indoor area with a formidable stage space for local talent to perform on and a projector screen for game nights. They have an outdoor space as well with minimal shade. They are pet friendly outdoors. Friendly staff and average Untapped rated brews. I enjoyed my flight here, everything was OK. With all the other spots in town, this is not top of my list, but wouldn't refuse to go here either. If they opened up the fences between properties they could build a direct walking path to the stadium."

                "description": "Compared to other breweries in the area I feel like Oskar Blues doesn't get a ton of love but I've really enjoyed my experiences when coming here! They do a great job of utilizing their massive space, they're one of the few breweries with tvs (when indoor dining/drinking is available) and they have a massive stage for live music (again when indoor is a viable option).   I recommend trying more of their seasonal or offshoot beers if you visit than their staples. For one, their flagship beers are available nationwide and I haven't found any of them to be particularly noteworthy.   The seasonal beers cast a really wide net and have had more hits than misses in my experience. Their Death by Coconut Porter and Slow Chill Dunkel were both fantastic and they do a pretty good job with their various juicy IPAs.   The food truck has some really tasty tacos and I like that they've partnered with the brewery to give 4$ off a food order for every full pour of beer you order. This does come with the caveat that the prices are kind of outrageous if you don't utilize this option, but it becomes a pretty good deal with it. The tacos are more traditional street taco style, so if that's not your thing they do have some more typical bar fare like burgers, fries, and nachos.   Overall, I think it's a great hang out spot. They are reliably not super packed, they have a wide variety of mostly good beers, and have a food truck that will keep you satisfied while you hang out. I don't think any of the other breweries in this part of Austin can boast all three of those, so I highly recommend!"

There are plenty of tables and even a few very comfy high-backed vinyl booths.   Also, the typical beer garden area outside with strung lights, roomy tables and corn hole games.   The bands that play are varied with an emphasis to blues and rock. We have discovered a few local bands we like just from going for a beer on a Friday evening.  For certain bands, they will clear a small area in front of the stage for dancing.  The beers they offer are good, but its a smaller selection than some breweries. They stick to a few classics like several IPAs, a couple stouts, a pilsner. Have yet to seen any kind of sours offered. Would love to see a specialty sour.  There is a Wunderpig barbecue truck on site with very tasty sandwiches. Be sure and grab napkins!  Large clean bathrooms, friendly bartenders, and plenty of parking too. Can't go wrong here."

They have free, live music very frequently with a great stage and sound set up.   The staff is awesome and to say that they are friendly would be an understatement. A couple of occasions I've been here with my boyfriend's band and they treated the members and their guests with top notch service.   Last but not least, their beer is awesome! My go-to is always the Rose for Dayz just because I'm a fruity/citrusy kind of girl haha.   This has definitely turned into a regular hangout place."

                "description": "Looking for a local brewery to grab a drink and have good barbecue, I picked this place because it was close to the office and hotel and it had a decent ranking on everyone's favorite food app, \"Yelp\".  Arriving to the site, I was a little concerned that I may have read the Yelp review wrong. The opening is a driveway to a parking lot behind an industrial warehouse. So you might find it a little disconcerting as you drive over 100 feet of driveway and then cross into a chain-link surrounded dirt parking lot.   What hit me in the face was the taproom essence, which smelled of old beer and sanitizer fluid. Not a big fan of the smell. Then the décor of the taproom reminded me of a mix of a 1970's New Year's party and a crushed velvet weekend band cave. (Lol, I don't know how good the bands are that play there but they had it set up like it.) What I thought was strange was the noise level which was almost whisper-like and the lack of any music playing over the speakers. I may have gone at an off time but still, there should have been some music playing in the background.  The beer was tasty. I had the Can-O-Bliss Citra and the G-Knight. The bouquet off the Can-O-Bliss was amazing but lamentably, the flavor wasn't there to back it up. I preferred the G-Knight much more. It was good go-to IPA.   Sitting there I was hungry and asked to see the menu. They handed me a short menu and told me that I had to order outside at a food truck that was parked in the parking lot. It was raining and I wasn't too keen on ordering outside but I was hungry so I sucked it up and did it. You can see my review at Wunder Pig Barbecue - Yelp. But the long and short of it is the food was a big disappointment. And there was no bar food available. No finger foods! Bummer.   I realize you aren't a restaurant but please kick that food truck off the parking lot and get one that serves bar/finger food and better barbecue."

He was the very one that introduced us to this place. I love craft beer and I must say I love Oskar Blue's beers!!! What I enjoy the most about this place is that they offer beer-flights! My top favs has got to be Mamas Little Yella Pils and Can-O-Bliss IPA!  I love that they also have live music here. I believe when a band is performing, that's the only time they won't be able to sell you a beer flight.. Music could get super loud so luckily they have outside seating as well. It's crazy how busy they could get! Lol. All the tables inside fill up super quickly because of the live music.  Overall experience: fantastic. I love the atmosphere, also this brewery is clean and spacious. The workers are very friendly and I always have a good time conversing with them. Great music and even better beers! Until next time"

                "description": "Out of the handful of breweries I've visited in the ATX, this one is hands down my favorite!  It's VERY spacious, and has plenty of room to sit at the large bar, or one of the many tables in the venue.    They have a decent size stage for live music, but I was there on an early evening, so nothing was going on at that time.  There was a decent sized crowd in the place, but it wasn't too loud and it didn't make you feel cramped.  I mentioned the spacious seating area - they have quite a few long tables that are great for group get togethers.   Nice apparel shop with brewery t-shirts, hats, koozies, stickers, and more.  They have 16 beers on tap.  You can get a sampler flight of four beers for eight bucks - you just can't beat that with a stick!  They have six choices of non alcoholic soda and a sparkling water option.  Nice sized patio with a covered tarp to keep the sun off of you and keep you out of the rain.  Giant Jenga and other games to play out on the patio - it's really a fun place to hang out.''  There's usually a food truck parked outside - I was told it's a permanent fixture and their \"home base\", so check them out.  It's called  \"Cluck n Burger\" and it was awesome.  Look for my review for that one coming soon.  The beers I had inside were Mama's Little Yella Pils (I've had it before and it's OK).  But the one that blew my socks off was the the Old Chub Scotch Ale.  This really surprised me, because I'm not usually into the heavier flavored beers.  But this one was just so divine and delectable.  I'm gonna have to begin a search for this one in my local beer joints in SA.  They're open from noon to 8pm Sunday and Monday and from noon to 10pm every other day of the week.  Wi-Fi password is Oskarblues"

Driving there at night, you might think you are driving into a forbidden, industrial area but turning on the street where the brewery is, you will see the lights.  I happened to come on a night where there was live music. The stage is in a great location and there are table and chairs for people to sit and enjoy the show. The decor is very unique and you can tell you are in a brewery.   The staff was very nice and I truly enjoyed talking to the friendly bartenders. The outside area has long picnic type tables were a large party or group of friends can come and hang.  I went alone, but a cute programmer by the name of Daniel came and chat to keep me company!  I will definitely visit this location again for a beer!"

                "description": "The first time I tried Oskar Blues beer was the Can-O-Bliss hazy IPA from HEB. It was pretty good, so I knew one day I would make the trip up north. And it was definitely worthwhile.  The beautiful thing about Oskar Blues is the accessibility. Everybody knows about Dale's Pale Ale Walk into any bar, dive or elevated, and you'll probably see DPA on their draft pours selection. Also, the Austin Costco sells the variety pack of canned beers, which is how I also got to know their \"Canarchy Collective\"--is what they call it. In the taproom, both of us had their taster flight, which was four beers for $8. It's pretty standard flight pricing in Austin. I had a hard time choosing what to taste because everything looked so good. However, I chose the Guayabera PA, Jai Alai IPA, Rose for Daze and their Can-O-Bliss (because why not choose something you already love?). I enjoyed all of them pretty much, and I love that their flight rack isn't one of those \"drag and hold\" types. THANK YOU. We all know the drag-type rack causes spillage. Which means less. beer. Boom.  We sat inside because...Austin summer heat. There were annoying slow phat flies that kept on bothering us, which was a bummer. However, everything else was great. Our taptender was very chill as there were basically only a few other people in the taproom that afternoon with us. They also have phone chargers WITH the cables just in case your phone is dying! Amazing. Plus their wifi is strong and restrooms clean. They have plenty of outdoor and indoor seating (think college mess hall size), and a merch corner if you are in the mood to get some of their swag. I also enjoyed how their brewing room is open for onlookers to peer through. There is tons of space and even a stage for live music, it seems. Google maps didn't take us to the front parking area, however there are signs amongst the industrial businesses there (the best microbrews are always hidden in the industrial businesses!) for \"back parking.\""

I opted for the seared salmon Caesar which was recommended by our server. The salmon was fresh, they have seafood shipped in fresh never frozen, but was a little bland.

                "description": "This is one of the newer Georgetown spots and we finally made it out for a late lunch. I've been craving fish and chips - which I've heard is one of their specialties.    We started with the Calamari Diablo - it wasn't as spicy as I expected, but it was delish! The calamari pieces were sliced thinner and crispy.  Peppered thru the dish were fried pickles and shaved Parmesan that complemented the appetizer nicely!  The dip was \"marinara-ish\" with sliced onions - Yummy!   The menu had plenty of great options but we both got fish and chips.  The plate was loaded with 3 large battered/fried cod pieces.   The crunch to fish ratio was on point!  The dish came with a unique slaw made from cabbage, apple slices and apple cider Vinegar- I couldn't place my finger on the spices but it was very tasty!  The thin sliced apples popped in the slaw.   The waffle fries were crunchy (I normally don't like waffle fries but these were thinner and possibly light battered/double fried with perfect seasoning.   We will definitely return ~ looking forward to trying more options from the menu and bringing friends with us next time."

                "description": "Never been to this location before but let me just say it is worth a visit.  I enjoy fish and chips and found that they do it just right here!  In my opinion the only thing I did not like was the waffle fries were crunchy, mainly because there's some weird additives they added to them, looks like some kind of sesame seeds or something.  Waffle fries are just fine by themselves with great seasoning no need to add weird crunchy stuff, I literally thought I was going to check my teeth only reason why I didn't go five stars here.  My wife got the blackened salmon Caesar salad which I must say was above and beyond with a ton of flavor! I will probably get this next time.  On another note their coleslaw is unlike anything I've had before some kind of a cilantro vinaigrette highbred but I must say I do anything to learn this recipe!  Decent draft beer selection and a handful of wines this place is worth a visit especially if it's game day and you're looking for a good game there's TVs in every direction you look pretty good sports bar especially at an upscale level I would recommend it definitely give this place a shot!"

The waiter was outstanding and made us feel like we got special service.  We will go there again soon."

I would HIGHLY recommend to management to change your classification to include restaurant as well because when searching for that this place won't pop up. BUT the fish and chips is killer, very crispy and great flavor. The slaw on the side is some of the best slaw I've had. Also love all the sauces it comes with. Will def be back."

                "description": "This is a true hidden gem in Georgetown and I'm so glad we found it! We came here for a late lunch today. I got the Joey's el Classico margarita and my fiancé got the roadrunner. Unfortunately my margarita was way too sour for me and I hate to be this person, but I asked if I could trade it out. Our waitress said yes and I got the jalapeño martini which was way more enjoyable. For an appetizer we got the Cuban nachos, which was basically the fillings of a Cuban sandwich served over a bed of homemade chips with a swiss queso. I'm salivating just writing this because it was so good we cleaned the plate!  For my meal I ordered the chicken fried steak that came with mashed potatoes, bacon green beans and Texas toast. Y'all....as a southern girl I consider myself a chicken fried steak aficionado, and they know what they're doing. The serving was huge, the breading  flavorful and crispy, and the gravy was so good I wanted to dip everything in it. You can also really tell that their sides are not an afterthought because the green beans were so good I couldn't stop eating them even well after I was full. My fiancé got the fish and chips and while I didn't personally try it he said it was delicious, and again, the portions were huge! You definitely get your money's worth here. Along with the great food we also had great service so next time we're in Georgetown we will definitely be back!"

                "description": "Wow! What an amazing meal. I stumbled upon this hidden gem while in the area grabbing thing at a near by Home Depot. I was hungry and had already tried some near by restaurants. This place was not busy and the ambiance seemed nice.  My friends and I were a starving and boy did we come to the right place. We started with cooked oysters that were absolutely mouth watering. One of my friends had never had oysters so I was excited that he enjoyed them. We also got the pork belly queso, it was a bit thick but full of flavor. The chips were crispy and seasoned which helped with the thick cheese. One friend got the Buffalo chicken sandwich, the biggest juiciest chicken breast I'd ever seen. He left nothing on his plate! My other friend go the fish and chips, he does not like coleslaw but this was no ordinary slaw. The head chef explained they don't use vinegar and they do add celery seed. I was the big girl and ordered the pork chop, large portion but I ate it down to the bone. I wish I had another option besides mashed potatoes but overall it was awesome. We did order cocktails, peach martini and margaritas. Our server was knowledgeable and very pleasant. We were immediately greeted and seated. Our food was fresh and hot and the wait wasn't long at all. I can't wait to go back and try desserts."

Two weeks later, I'm two days short of the half off apps. Ok cool. I wanted the shrimp and lobster roll. No longer on the not updated menu. Ok cool. I got the tiny flavorless not seasoned at all salmon and salad, grilled oysters which were excellent( they didn't last) and side stale waffle fries....... I get more fries for cheaper at McDonald. That are fresh. I pay $14/ 3-4 pieces of fresh salmon at heb. Sooooo this salmon has got to be bomb to justify this size for $18 w salad.

I had the chicken and the brisket and both were really good , seasoned well and very moist - cooked to perfection. I couldn't finish my salad and took maybe half of it home. So, portion wise, this is also a win. My daughter had the 1/2 ribs and we were all taken by surprise on the flavor. Seriously, TRY their RIBS!!!  They have a selection of different sauces, including a strawberry one that came with the ribs. I was very skeptical at first, but it worked pretty well. However, their mustard based one is my favorite.  We can't wait to be back!"

It's not your \"traditional\" BBQ stop - the menu is really fun and there are some pretty creative treats to try, from Texas-sized sandwiches to habanero strawberry glazed ribs. The meats were tender as could be, the flavor was incredible, and the sauces were amazing. Will definitely be visiting again!   Service: 5/5 Food: 5/5  Individual food ratings: - Habanero Strawberry Glazed ribs (5/5): sweet and spicy (but more sweet), these ribs were perfectly tender and had really great flavor! You can get them without the glaze, or get the glaze on the side. - Smoked Gouda Mac'n'cheese (4/5): pretty tasty mac, very cheesy and creamy, would be great with hot sauce or meat. - BBQ nachos w/brisket (5/5): super loaded, huge shareable portion, and great flavors! Add extra sauces on top to get saucy. - El Jefe sammie (5/5): brisket, onions, peppers, and Fritos for some crunch, this was a great sandwich and super filling! - Twice baked potato casserole (3/5): needed a kick or maybe some more salt/pepper, but was good overall with the dank white sauce on top."

The have 4 types of sauces, I sampled them all and my fav has to be the backyard red sauce. We ordered the Texas OG on a tortilla and the Tony Montana. The brisket was meaty and fatty. The Tony Montana could have had more queso on it for sure. We also tried the gouda Mac and cheese amd twice baked potato and it was creamy and pretty good. The potato was just ok according to my boyfriend. They are located in a strip mall with lots of parking."

Our party of three started with the double meat bbq brisket nachos, then we shared 1/2 # of ribs, a Texas Tornado wrap with double brisket (absolutely LOVE their brisket) then added an extra large order of the smoked Gouda Mac and cheese, green bean casserole and finished up with a banana pudding .  Gotta say I haven't eaten such great bbq for years AND took home enough for another meal.  This is my new go-to for Austin BBQ! They have a nice selection of regular and craft beers as well.

The sliders, brisket nachos and chicken sandwich were all delicious. The max n cheese was good, it had a smoky flavor, like it was cooked on the grill. The potato salad didn't have any flavor but we just know not to order it, it was a side and not the star of the show like the meats. The music was great!

The line was long, but luckily I was able to head to the to-go desk and place my order fairly quickly...Brisket Nachos packaged with all the ingredients separated so as not to get soggy. They easily survived the drive home to Cedar Park and were super delicious and unique! Like a chopped brisket sandwich on tortilla chips with queso. Um, yes, please.  This barbecue place has a vibe like no other. The walls and music combine hip hop with classic Texas in a way I would not have dreamed possible, but it works. Pretty trendy spot. I really appreciated the clear partitions separating tables as a covid precaution."

The St. Louis ribs are some of the most tender I've had.  I wasn't a huge fan of the bbq sauce that came with the ribs but it's on the side and they have other sauces available as well- the one it came with was a little sweet for me. Planning on bringing my small rib aficionado this weekend after the pumpkin patch.  One complaint... the kids meal ribs says it comes with two.. TWO. Mine will be asking where the rest are if I ordered him a kids meal  they do have a great amount of meat on them but I have a 3 year old that eats like a teenager when he has ribs in front of him so these kids meals won't work for us  we will be getting a whole rack and I'll be lucky if *I* get to have two."

Their chicken is good, the brisket is great, but BOY them ribs! Whew! They've got great sandwiches too if that's more your thing. I really like their green bean casserole as well. If you haven't gone yet, GO!"

Right when you walk in, the smell hits you, and you know you've picked the right place.  Not only do they have great food, they have a bar with beer, several flat screen TVs and a nice-sized patio area. I had the BBQ nachos with extra queso and rib meat; it had jalapeños, diced onions and pickles and one of their signature bbq sauces drizzled on top. My meal was so amazing, and the portion size was enough to get full and still have half of the plate to take home(which is equally amazing after reheating in the oven)."

                "description": "We found Slab via an Eater list and Yelp reviews and it was pretty good! We knocked off a star bc some of the meat was dry, the smoked mac was very runny and the coleslaw wasn't too good but overall enjoyed our meal. We allotted more time here for lunch bc we assumed there'd be a lunch rush and orders would be slower if meats were being smoked throughout the day but our meal came out almost instantly so stuff was ready to go / could have contributed to some of the meat being dry....  * Slab slider trio - sliders of Notorious PIG, Texas OG and Chicken WA. Notorious was very good flavor and pulled pork was still nicely moist. The Texas OG was kind of a let down bc the brisket was dry and there wasn't a lot of sauce on the sandwich to keep it moist and flavorful. The chicken WA was actually pretty good and the chicken surprisingly stayed moist * El Jefe - hubby got this was and liked it.. the brisket wasn't as dried as it was on my Texas OG * Smoke gouda mac - I love macs and this was way too runny, wish the sauce was more creamy * Cole slaw - my hubby is a cole slaw snob and he thought this didn't really have enough flavor  They had outdoor seating so we got to people watch but it is in a strip mall, so not too much to see.  Woman at the counter was very nice and gave recos for us while we were ordering."

Then, finished off with a drizzle of BBQ sauce and cheese. For me, the pickles were a great touch. if I had one criticism it would be that I had a lot of empty chips at the bottom. They may want to consider doing two layers of toppings. A little bit on the bottom and then a little bit more on the top, just to get a little bit more coverage of some of the chips at the bottom."

                "description": "Okay this is my favorite coffee shop in the Austin area period.  I love how big and spacious this new location is, but the coffee is WHERE IT'S AT.  Definitely come here if you're looking for the perfect date spot, study/get work done, or just to enjoy a nice morning coffee and breakfast.  We ordered a hand pour over, a Chemex, and a double espresso.  The double espresso came out first and this one definitely packed a punch - don't let the espresso size cup fool you.  If I was just here for the caffeine content, this one definitely would've done the job alone.   The hand pour over came out next and the presentation was super impressive!  They bring you the entire carafe with the dripper on top, so it's definitely a lot.  Considering this is only $4, you definitely get your money's worth!  This one was so flavorful and the fruity notes definitely stood out while drinking it.  Now the Chemex...just wow.  For $5, they bring the entire Chemex setup to your table and you pour our of it as you drink.  The fact that they trust their patrons with the Chemex really speaks volumes about how much they care about the presentation piece!  Looks aside, this coffee (I believe we got Ethiopian) tasted amazing and on-par with the pour over.  Don't let me forget the breakfast tacos.  This was such a treat.  I got the Migas breakfast taco and this one was stuffed FULL with eggs, tortilla strips, and pico.  It was delicious and filling and for $3, this one definitely hit the spot alongside the coffee.  I also bought one of their coffee beer stouts to take home...I believe it was the House United coffee milk stout.  If taking home, you either order beer in a Crowler (two pint cans) or a Growler (64 oz).  I can't wait to try their coffee IN THEIR BEER.  But most of all, can't wait to come back here every time I'm in the area!"

It was a little chilly so we sat inside. Felt like we were outside with high ceilings and good air flow. Excellent acoustics so we could hear the conversation at the table. Staff was friendly and helpful."

                "description": "Came in this past weekend to celebrate the weekend with my friend at Circle Brewing.  I love their beers and have had them at bars and restaurants around town but had never been to the brewery until this past weekend.   Circle Brewing had easy parking as soon as we pulled up even on an Austin FC Saturday game day. It was pleasant to not have to figure out where to park when they have their own parking lot with plenty of space.   Easy ordering but hard decisions to make on what pitcher of beer we were wanting to try. We noticed they have Austin FC game specials that includes their Austin Anthem draft for $18 a pitcher which is a great deal! I also saw signage on the tables that indicated 1/2 pints during the Austin FC games. Double check that is right because it almost sounds too good to be true, right? I even saw a green cup special going on - ask the bartender what they have on special just to be sure.  They have a lovely and large screen set up right in the middle of their taproom to watch any games including those Austin FC games. They have a couple of tv's as well located above the bar to keep your gaze on during any game not just Austin FC.    If you are coming in the summer especially day time be sure to wear loose clothing and/or be ready to sweat. Even at the bar top with the fans going we came out of here sweaty which is typical anywhere you are during Texas summers. Just want to give you a heads up!  Huckleberry is the food truck that slings all sorts of seafood and burgers (surf and turf!) with some easy ordering from inside the brewery.  We didn't get a chance to try out their food as we ended up brewery hopping around right after we had our pitcher of Blur (hefe) at Circle.  This may be the closest brewery to the stadium (?) but if not it sure looks like it as you can see the Austin FC stadium right from their parking lot.  Excited to come back when I am headed to a game and/or in the area as Circle Brewing beers are divine!"

                "description": "This brewery had a nice indoor-outdoor atmosphere. We were a bit divided on how we felt about the beers themselves. Some in our group loved certain beers, including some of the lighter bodied and hoppier beers. Others in our group liked the beers but didn't find any favorites from among the fight. Overall it was a nice experience - perhaps not our favorite stop on the brewery tour- but one worth going to again."

                "description": "I've been here for a Sunday funday and more recently did the 2021 Cookies and Craft Brews at-home virtual tasting with Circle Brewing Beers and Girl Scout Cookies. The vibe at the tasting room is casual and approachable - the staff is friendly and unpretentious. For the virtual tasting I did, they had the packages ready for pickup and hosted the tasting on Zoom. It was fun even if I was tasting solo from home as there were others on the Zoom and the two who guided the tasting were informative and engaging. Here were some notes I took during the tasting:  Alibi Blonde and Shortbread - a nice blend of the maltiness and breadiness of the cookie. The beer is a blending of German Maibock style with American Blonde Ale, resulting in a rich, malty flavor with a clean, crisp finish.  Blue Texas Hefe and Caramel deLits and Peanut Butter Sandwich - this is their best-selling beer (about 2x any other) and is a traditional German Wheat beer with a touch of caramel malt and an emphasis on citrus notes. It's refreshing and definitely a Texas twist on one of my favorite types of beers.  Envy Amber and Toast-yay! - this is a new cookie this year and they paired it with the first beer they ever brewed, although it's not the first beer they released. The cinnamon toast crunch flavor of the cookie worked well with the robustness of the amber. It's an English style amber with an emphasis on dried fruit notes - they use two types of British caramel malts to contribute to the well-rounded flavor of the beer.  Ladybird American IPA and Lemonades - this was one of the pairing favorites of the crowd and I definitely liked it a lot too. It's a West Coast style IPA that is very hoppy, but not overly bitter. Solid pairing and solid beer.  Tuxedo Shirt Black IPA and Thin Mints - the hops in this beer are changed annually, so it never really has the same flavor profile year to year. I was not familiar with roasted IPA malts, but it's basically an IPA with black malt. It has a bold, roasty flavor, with a solid body. It was a smooth pairing with the Thin Mints.  Nightlight Dry Irish Stout and S'mores and Peanut Butter Patties - this beer is the CO2 version of Guinness. There is a slight bitterness to this, but it has a rich flavor with a very light body.   A few other bonus takeaways shared in the tasting conversation: * Epic Playlist is a beer that they created to interact with their fans in the market. It has a QR code on it that connects the drinker to the Circle Brewing Spotify playlist. * Devil's XX is a barrel-aged version of the beer (XX) and is sold in bottles. * They are keeping this tasting room, but also expanding and moving to a location in Elgin where they can grow their own ingredients to put in their beer on the 23-acre property."

                "description": "I've come by a few times and always found it to be a good experience. The staff is friendly, the beer is consistently good and they go for styles that are much less popular from Austin breweries. They also participate in some fun events throughout the year, in particular I really enjoyed the beer/girl scout cookie pairing event and the red line brewery tour.  Highly recommend trying the Blur, its a Hefeweizen and their staple beer. I would put it up there with Live Oak's Hef as a common point of comparison. If you're around in the winter time their Doppel Blur is probably the best Hef I've ever had; Imagine if your alcoholic grandmother made banana bread in liquid form. If you're looking for something darker the Tuxedo T-shirt is a black IPA, I really liked the combination of roastiness and hoppiness. It sounds like it would clash but I found the hop flavor subtle enough to work really well.    The one negative I would have is that the interior really makes it feel like they're trying to get you to sit outside, which given the vast amount of space available in the parking lot makes sense. However I don't feel like they do a great job of utilizing it, there aren't nearly as many tables as you would think and the ones they do have aren't particularly well spaced out.  The food truck situation seems to rotate pretty frequently, I've found most of them to be misses but it's a roll of the dice depending on the day. There's also plenty of good food options in close proximity that it doesn't feel like a major negative.  Overall I think Circle makes for a good hang out spot and a change of pace from the typical Austin brewery experience."

They're known for the Circle Blur, a hazy hefeweizen, but all of their beers are good. The Austin Anthem golden ale is refreshing and \"crushable\" and the kolsch and IPAs are good too. They have both indoor and outdoor seating and host free pre-events for Austin FC games next door."

                "description": "Beer is good, staff always friendly... but damn does it get hot as the third ring of hell during the summer in there. Maybe \"stuffy\" or \"swampass humid\" is more accurate, but it's uncomfy when busy. I'm from southern Texas, so I'm used to it.. but it's even hot for me. Need some big ass fans or something. But.. the cold beer does help! And the food truck outside always looks good, but I've never partook in the tasty treats.   Gonna be a go to for many (including myself) pre-FC games, just hope they're OK with me only wearing my FC boxers once I've been there for 20 and sweat through my less-than-fancy Target shorts I got for $20, so I'd have more $$ to spend on their tasty beer."

It just so happened it was a special beer release event and charity donation (for Pink Boots Society and Pink Velvet Collaboration IPA), so it was crowded.  We lucked into a table inside and tried a sampling of beers while we played a game and listened to a few interesting sounding bands that played (standing on the loading platform).  Because it was so crowded, it took a while to get served and the line for the single person bathroom was very long.  The beers we tried were good, and we would definitely stop back by on a day that wasn't quite so crowded."

Big variety of beers - and probably the best English pub ale in Texas that isn't a big brand beer. I personally think they would gain to have a tv or two once the MLS stadium opens.

                "description": "I was so pumped to check our Circle during a brew-crawl, but the ambiance left me feeling unimpressed.  I had my first sips of Circle after being introduced by every Texan's good friend HEB. I believe it was the hefe that reeled me in, so I was excited to go to Circle during the Red Line Brew tour (check it out online if you've never done it). I was so excited to try a few beers, but knew I could only focus my tastes on one since we were on a crawl. I went with their Cereal Keller kellerbier which I've never tried before. It was described as \"unhinged\" probably because this stuff is unfiltered and not clarified! I was psyched to try a grittier version of the lager. It wasn't as funky as I thought it would be, but instead felt light, simple and slightly malty/sweet. I enjoyed it. I was pretty curious about all their others like their IPA's and the Doppel Blur, but that's for next time.  The space itself is definitely reminiscent of your small-production and grassroots taproom. They had two porta-potties outside (along with a food truck), but only one restroom inside. It got pretty crazy with our crawl of beer lovers. I can't imagine the staff members sharing one restroom, especially when the brewers are in there doing their thang. Someone's bench with weights and press station was still out, and there wasn't that much open space indoors for the lot of us to all be in there, so outdoors it was! They allow dogs which is awesome and they also have wifi. Parking seemed a-plenty, but we took public transport so that's that. Their gigantic chalkboard menu is beautiful and fully rounds out their super relaxed and earthy vibes. The people here are friendly, chill and the brewery gives off a neighborly essence. It's not an instagram-hotspot like their new next door neighbor Hopsquad. And that's the beauty of it!"

                "description": "Perfect day to celebrate Circle's 6th anniversary. With the Temps hovering around 90 degrees what better way to while away a Sat afternoon than having a few scrumptious craft beers, street tacos and listening to some great music.  My companions opted for their Alibi Blonde it is a German-inspired beer but it drinks pretty light but with a hint of flowery hops that gives it a good aftertaste. I opted for their Ladybird IPA that also drank surprisingly light for an IPA and was perfect for a hot early spring day. I did see a lot of folks drinking their black IPA but it was too warm a day for that, next time.  The event was top notch 15 bucks, American, got you a cool pilsner type anniversary glass and 3 beer tokens. We gave 3 tokens away at the end as we were getting full and we !had! to attend a friends crawfish party later that afternoon. Got to leave room for dem bugs and more brews!   The first band was a Go Gos inspired female band that rocked and the second band played some great 70s, 80, and 90s cover songs. Since I was wearing a Boston Sports shirt I got to meet some other Massholes which only added to the fun.   Good times, great beer, and a wonderful event!"

Not only are there tons of events that are always happening there, just for fun or to support local organizations, all the employees there are so kind and really attentive. They also change/add different beer options often which is great if you're looking to maybe get your favorites and try something new. I'd highly recommend the doppel blur and although it isn't on tap, you can still get a can in a glass of you want. If you're really wanting something on tap then I'd go with the blur! I'd definitely recommend going and bringing your pup because they are very pup friendly everywhere !"

Not only is the beer great, but the location and setting speak to the nostalgic part of me that's seen a few little start up breweries begin to flourish out of industrial parks, and often with their taprooms in the brewery space itself. That's what this space is--Utilitarian is too strong a word, but it's comfortable, practical, and cozy. We've enjoyed days playing games out on the picnic tables, and others indoors on the barrel tables. The staff is friendly, and there's always parking available, or you can take the light rail or easily bike from this brewery to others nearby!"

I also learned two things I've been missing in pizza, too.  I've passed this place dozens of times.  It sits on the fringe of a west Austin neighborhood and several apartments/condos between them and 183.  I believe it is affiliated with a restaurant that has a place in Fort Worth, too, but I might be wrong.  What I'm sure of my first visit there was killer!  I'm planning on going back when I can eat and drink a whole day away!  They have a great outdoor area with plenty of umbrellas and we chose a table.  The server acknowledged us right away.  We QR'd the menu and by the time we'd made a choice of food our beers were on the table and cold (good pour on the Guinness, btw).    We ordered a pizza of our own:  Sausage, mushroom, green peppers and spicy marinara sauce.  Okay, first... You know how some chain pizzas you have the ingredients all coming off together leaving you with less than even a cheese pizza?  Not here.  Every thing is chopped into small pieces and spread evenly over the entire pizza.  Every bite comes with a mouthful of exactly what you ordered.  Second, put some of that marinara on a piece of canvas and I'd eat it.  The spices brought everything together.  We got wings too.  Golden Buffalo.  Perfect heat! Crispy.  Meaty. Those wings were gone so fast I was looking at other tables to see if someone had snatch a couple off our plate LOL  We were licking the hot sauce off the plate.  I'M DOUBLING THE ORDER NEXT TIME!  Great service, cool vibe, good food!  Did I get lucky or find bar food Nirvana?  I dunno.  I'm going to rock a five star and adjust as I need to, but I'm not going to deprive myself of another visit here for sure!!"

                "description": "Fun Neighborhood joint.  This feels like a place where you'd walk in and they'd say, \"Norm!\"...if that were your name and you were on an episode of Cheers.  The beer was deliciously cold served in a thick glass to keep it that way. The pizza was generously embellished with toppings, and the crust was above average. The service was timely and courteous. I really liked the outdoor patio. Part of it is covered with fans, and part was uncovered with tables with umbrellas. The only drawback is there's a lot of road noise. We sat at a table as far away from the road as possible, and it was acceptable noise-wise. When our world health situation is better, I hope to see all the tables filled with large groups of friends enjoying pints and pizzas. For now, come check it out with your close friends and/or significant other."

It was way more laid back then I expected (place is always popping outside!!) which was great, I'm not for the \"pay twice what it's worth because we are fancy pants\".  Everything was very reasonably priced, and freaking delicious! We tried a few of the drinks (I tried a few of the beers) and it's safe to say I left tipsy and happy!

                "description": "My friends like this place, but I don't see the draw. The pizza is mediocre. Fortunately tonight I discovered their sandwiches are good. I got the Pourboy, with Fries. Everyone else in our group who wanted food ended up being in a sandwich mood, so the Chicken Parm sandwich got good reviews from two of the guys. The fries were well-seasoned and looked promising, but were a little cold and soft. Other times I liked the Fried Pickle Chips, but could only eat a few pieces before they got overpowering. It's not like we'd eat that many pickles out of the jar in one sitting! I think the server mixed up my friend's beer order. The final blow to this spot is that their outdoor chairs are wildly uncomfortable. I even brought my own seat cushion the last few times I came! This time it saved my butt, but my back still hurts. I'd give Pour House a 3.5 but I'm in a generous mood so I'm rounding up."

This isn't even the first time this has happened. On another occasion, I saw a rat running out from the KITCHEN and into the parking lot. It was disgusting. The owners of this business need to have pest control come in so that their patrons can eat without worrying about rats, and so their kitchen staff doesn't have to cook with pests. I've worked in the service industry and know this is no ones fault but the owners. Do better by your employees and your customers and get rid of the rats."

                "description": "At first glance, the interior of Pour House looked a little un-maintained. But, then of course, Austin. Where everything is underground. I was excited about the local beer list, though the stout selection was a bit thin. I went with Redhorn, a coffee stout that was a little short on stoutness for me. But, the flavor was good.  We ordered three 8\" pizzas to share: El Supremo, Hawaiian, and a Veggie pizza, providing plenty for two adults and two children. The pizza was quite good, as in Austin-good. I couldn't put my finger on it, but there was something unique about the flavor.    Our server was very good, personable and informative. We ate a late lunch, during which a growing number of what appeared to be regulars gathered mostly around the bar. The location is a bit secluded from the rest of Austin. But, it's near the technology district, where I was working for the day.  Parking was a little confusing because we approached the building from a side where the entrance wasn't visible. It's a private parking lot with plenty of space. Outdoor seating is available. Highly recommended!"

The environment was chill and not too busy during lunch time so that was a plus for us because we needed to be back for training within the hour.  Three of us ordered the Cubano and it was so tasty! I definitely enjoyed the pickles and pork amongst other fine ingredients they packed on that pizza! One of guys ordered the regular pepperoni pizza and he said he liked it a lot. The crust and dough of the pizza was cooked perfectly thoroughly.  There salads were delicious and portioned perfectly. When you arrive the parking is all in the back area pretty much, and you enter through the patio area. They have signs for you and that guide you to entrance."

Unfortunately, Jollyville is busy so you have to speak loudly to each other but there's not a lot Pour House can do about that.  At first, our waiter seemed like he was going to be a lot of fun but we quickly realized he was all show and no action. He forgot to bring one of our drinks the first time around and then we very rarely saw him after that until he was ready for us to pay the bill. We had to find a different waiter to order a second round of margaritas.  The margaritas themselves we're nothing to get excited about and seemed like they had very little alcohol. We ordered two orders of the fried pickles, though, because those were great! (And even here we had to flag down our waiter to place a second order and get extra ranch dip).  We will go back because of the convenient location and nice patio but we will have our expectations set appropriately."

The Canadian bacon, all so good. Also got a pita bread house made bruschetta. Wow, is that good. Diced tomatoes, with small cubes of mozzarella, and fresh basil. Deliciand shareable. Again I had the cherry limeade drink. It's perfect. The whole meal was fantastic. The waiter we had was super nice. This place is packed. So get there early. It's loud inside, but they have a large patio, but tonight it was chilly. No heat lamps. Parking lot is tight too. Been here twice and I think I took the last parking spot both time UPDATE: I've never been here for brunch, so today is the day! Chicken and waffles it is! I find chicken and waffles such a Southern thing, and I can't get enough of it. If it's on the menu, I'm ordering it. Their waffles are amazing. It's two small waffles with pockets of like brown sugar maybe? They have some kind of crunch to it. I didn't even use syrup because they just had a great flavor already. Chicken is tender and juicy. And it's a big piece of chicken breast. Bartenders are so Southern with their \"yes ma'am\" and hospitality. I always had a drink in front of me and I was checked in to make sure everything was to my liking. Pour House on Jollyville Road is such a great place to go alone or with a group. Their patio is outstanding, service is Southern as Southern can get. Always had a great meal, an even better cocktail, and the service is hands down Southern and hospitable. You have a great team here, this is my go to place"

Picked up 2 pizzas for myself and office manager. Her first response was that it seemed to be frozen pizza. I agreed. Pepperroni was sliced so thin it was almost tranparent transparent. Sauce and crust definitely seemed directly from the frozen section. My large greek salad was equally disappointing - very much so.  Counter staff was very friendly and courteous though."

We came at lunch and though I was initially hesitant to bring in kids, there ended up being plenty off other families in there. The menu was upscale American. Given it was lunch time, we went with hamburgers and sandwiches. The main dishes were all really good and a decent portion (not too big, not too small). The sides we got were a bit under seasoned though. Lastly, there should really be a hamburger on the kids menu.   Overall, really enjoyed this place. Will come back for dinner to try more of the menu."

Despite both being relatively small, there's plenty of seating.  Choose from high-tops to semi-circular booths to high-back swivel bar stools.  And they have an outdoor patio as well, but not much of a view.   The League is a great place to meet a friend for drinks, a casual date, weekend brunch, watch Sunday football, or to just to ride the bar solo.    Excellent food with new, weekly specials, including a burger-of-the-week. On Mondays they have 2-for-1 burgers for dine in - can't beat that!  They also have cocktail specials to go along with their food specials (in addition to their menu and drink standards).  I wish they had a bigger beer wall, but the selection is serviceable.   The League is one on my regular spots and I've yet to be disappointed with their food, drinks, or service."

                "description": "We have been going to The League for a couple of years now. I get my hair done around the corner so it's convenient for my husband to hang at the bar. Sometimes we eat here and sometimes not.   Upside; Bartenders are always friendly and welcoming, they have great happy hour prices on drinks and apps. Also weekly food specials.   Food can be hit or miss. Between the two of us we've had everything on the menu. Club sandwich is always as hit and so is the spinach artichoke dip. Burgers sometimes a bit dry. The salmon is usually perfectly cooked. Fish and chips over battered and greasy. Prime rib sandwich is hit or miss.  Burger of the week this visit was Frito Pie Burger. I had the garlic butter grouper, which was a huge portion, but lacked seasoning on both the fish and couscous. Garlic butter was on the side, but was just melted butter with a chopped garlic at the bottom. No other seasonings.   We will continue to come hang at the bar and eat here occasionally."

Arron the bartender jumps in to help out in the dining area. Great guy !! Food : Pot pie (basically a biscuit with gravy with a fried egg on top - WOW filling and Delicious!! Wife had the steak salad - steak cooked exactly as she ordered it.  Mother in Law had a breakfast anytime.  All of our food was delicious!!  All and All we had a GREAT experience!! Definitely will come again.  A quality restaurant ! Absolutely nothing negative to report.  As a treat on your 1st visit - we'll show up and ask about it.  Prices were VERY REASONABLE!!"

                "description": "5 stars for service and 2.75 stars for food. My 4 stars are on the generous side.  We dined here this afternoon. The server was very nice and took care of us. I'd give her service 5 stars.   For our food we ordered the chicken fried pork chop, the full rack of ribs, the southern burger, and the kids Mac and cheese.   Our little guy loved the Mac snd cheese. It was decent and definitely not out of a box. It didn't come with anything else but was only $5.   Hubby had the Southern burger with truffle fries ($2 up charge). The burger was solid. It could have been a slight bit juicer but it was a good burger. The \"truffle\" fries were not. The fries were limp and soggy and sprinkled with Parmesan but had no truffle flavor at all. Actually when you picked up a fry the cheese all fell off too. Pretty bad fries to be honest.   Older son ordered the baby back ribs and enjoyed them. They were your standard fair. Similar to what you'd find at Chili's but they cost $30 and come with a side of mashed potatoes.  I had the  chicken fried pork chop. It was very over cooked and dry and was topped with jalapeño gravy but there was no heat or jalapeño flavor at all. The gravy made the pork chop less dry though. I subbed Brussels sprouts instead of mashed potatoes ($2). They lacked seasoning or flavor. I like the taste of Brussels sprouts so I ate them but they had no other seasoning that I could detect.   The food was all fine. Not bad but at their prices I would definitely not run back."

I will say I was underwhelmed with the salmon deviled eggs... it just tasted like eating cold eggs with no signature flavor."

We usually pop in for a late lunch early HH and sit at the bar. Check out their small bites menu the meatloaf is pretty darn good. Fish n chips are AOK there are better fish n chips in the area but you can easily split this bountiful dish.   The League pours a good cocktail and their bloodies, according to Plus 1, are right up there with the best. There are rotating taps for you beer snobs (like me).  There is a patio off to the side and a good-sized dining room. It does get crowded hence our late lunch HH visits.  Pro tip during football season Friday nights are packed pre-game."

The server was very rude when we asked to have the burgers redone and later literally threw a to go  box at me !

Service was good and the place was small but cozy and clean.   We ordered the fish n chips and a burger with onion rings. The burger was fine, very average and a little bland. The fries that came with the fish were also ok but a little cold. The onion rings and the fish is the part I wanted to love but didn't. Taste wise they were good. However, they had so much batter on them it made me feel sick after just a few bites. I know these were heavy items to order for lunch, but the ratio of batter was just too much."

Poppers weren't really cooked, maybe they were just uber cold because they sat out, see below.  Order was to be ready at 6:58 and brought to my truck. I though ok they are behind...at 7:10 I went in and saw it just sitting on a table next to the door.  No clue how long it was there. They said I could just grab it and go.  Disappointing Brussels spouts we're amazing, the only reason they get two stars.   The last visit they brought it to my truck but the food was mehhh."

They have reposted my pictures on social media and allowed a close friend to film a short film there for free. The beers are unique and delicious, with lots of options on tap! They have nightly specials and events, all of which are fun! For example trivia on mondays and Thursday, and they have little long horn saloon come do chicken shit bingo once a month there as well. At one point I was going every week for the Tuesday 99c east coast oysters. Among many other specials. There has been some miscommunication in the past with showing games but the manager working at the time is always very quick to help out. For example none of the TVs had sound on when they advertised they all did, there was confusion inside but the manager was outside and apologized and immediately turned on the sound inside and changed to social media to reflect inside. I also noticed that someone had paid to play the juke box and he paused their songs and gave them a free beer for rhe inconvenience. The dog park is also very nice and spacious and the new beer patio is very well put together! I am looking forward to live music!   Unrelated to Celis itself, but Black draft pizza truck is good there but overpriced. I am excited to try the new con todo truck!"

This place should be pretty chill - there's nine people here either chatting (or trying to) or working as I type - but they're blasting the music as always. It's kind of bizarre, doesn't fit the vibe, but they always do it. Thus I knocked off a star.  Look for oyster nights, a real highlight here."

They were blaring music so loud - outside - that we couldn't have a conversation across the table. Every customer looked like they were only there for Instagram pictures and the perfume was so thick you could see it hanging in the air. The waitress inside is ummm... dressed to get big tips. Ahem. Then you go back to the outdoor concert area, and it's a lot of families with kids and regular people. Weird. Beer was okay, but after the cloud of perfume I was honestly too sick to drink. Maybe someday I'll come back and avoid the front entirely. Then I went to cash out and the walking cloud of perfume was in front of me in line."

The brewery is easy to get to, has plenty of parking, and tucked away in a low key part of north Austin. Perfect place to stop by after work on a weekday. The oysters were outstanding, the price is awesome for east coast oysters. We also tried some of their beer, the Raspberry flavored beer is a must, absolutely loved it."

My boyfriend and I aren't even beer drinkers but we enjoyed the drinks! I tried the strawberry lemonade seltzer and was hooked. He tried the raspberry beer and grand cru, definitely great choices. We also grabbed some pizza and that was delicious as well! We'll be back!"

Celis, as y'all know, is an Austin institution- steeped in history, the first craft brewer to bring Belgian beer to the craft world in ATX (I think), so y'all can rest knowing that their wheat beers are AWESOME.  The tap room is large, airy, albeit a little dimly lit. There's patio seating outside and get this- DOGS ALLOWED INSIDE AND OUT!   They also welcome kids! Actually I think everyone is welcome here. It's one of the friendlier breweries in ATX IMHO.  We've visited almost every Sunday during covid and I can say that they're taking every precaution. There's live music on the weekends from 6-9pm.  Beer wise - I like the options. If you're a sour beer connoisseur, you'll enjoy the raspberry sour. Light beer? Lo Lo Lager. Safe, easy drinking? Celis White.  I know this place has had its ups and down but as Austinites, we need to show support to our local businesses and just be cool with each other."

                "description": "Drove by here today and thought I would check it out and I liked it! I ordered a Peacemaker Beer, an ale that tasted good. The next time I want to try the Blackberry beer. The name itself is appealing. Since it was close to dinner I figured I should order food instead of going home and cooking. I got the fish and chips. You can order the 2 piece or 4. I got the 2 piece with cut fries. It was cooked good. The fish was flaky and not oily. The pubs tarter sauce was good.. the fries were very good too..   The service was very good. There was a sign to sit yourself which I did and within 1 or 2 minutes my server stopped by to get me started. She showed me the ropes and got my beer and food quickly. I was really surprised at how fast my food came out. I can say it was just under 10 minutes but I was still surprised at the promptness. There was quite a few customers but the servers were on top of it. They talked to the customers as if they were family.   The place was clean and there was good parking. The beer menu had several types of craft and IPA beers. I'm  pretty sure I will return when I have time. My total cost including the food and beer was only $14, amazing! Thank you Dig Pub for being in Cedar Park and giving up another place to get a beer and some grub in a friendly way!"

                "description": "Evening in the suburbs and the dining options were dwindling. I was getting hungry and being out with my buddy meant that I'd have at least one more beer. My friend went through his mental list of places and came up with The Dig.   We arrived there and fortunately got there in time, it was a slow night and the kitchen was about to close so we quickly made our choices. I saw that they had Scotch Eggs and I'm a sucker for Scotch eggs, but unless you're a vegetarian/vegan what's not to like about an egg wrapped in sausage that's then deep fried?  I also ended up getting their Buffalo Chicken Sandwich because...actually why do you need a reason?  The egg was good, a little thin on the sausage side but the mustard dip added a little more savory. The sandwich had a good amount of spice but the sauce was pretty runny so it was messy but otherwise good.  They do have a lot of taps and I appreciate that they try to have a little bit of everything and focus on locals. I get that they have to strike a balance between locals who want a beer that's cold, yellow, fizzy and domestic and crazy whale chasing beer nerds that are into barrel aged, wild/lacto, hopheads but for my visit it was a little more on the tame side. I had a sour from Prairie and a local mead which was great and at the time, that was about it."

We stayed long enough to finish our beers and while we were drinking, staff propped the booth bench back together. I disassembled it twice but they kept putting it back.

Lots of good seating both inside and out for  those who want a more open environment. Their pub grub is excellent, Scotch eggs to die for and some really tasty cheese offerings as well as some standard fare. The whole staff is friendly, honestly, never had a grumpy server and I really like sitting on a couch...one of the seating options depending on where in the pub you are. Check this place out, you might find that you....DIG it too."

                "description": "This place is interesting. The right side of the restaurant looks pretty nice and lively and the left side of the restaurant looks like they gave up or ran out of money on decorating and just put a few tables out. They also have an outdoor area but no shade so I didn't want to sit out there unprotected, otherwise, it would have been nice because I had my dog. It was a bit busy so unfortunately had to sit on the left side (maybe everyone else there agrees the right side is better and that's why they all preferred to sit there). It didn't look or feel particularly clean and I'm a clean freak so I didn't particularly enjoy sitting there.   The service was fine; the waitress was nice. The food was pretty decent, but nothing outstanding or memorable where I feel I have to come back again. It was fresh though and I appreciate that for comfort food, it wasn't soaked in oil. I think the ambiance had already turned me off so I didn't enjoy my food as much as I would have it was clean.   They are known for their beer but I don't drink beer so take my review with a grain of salt. Clearly I'm not a dive bar kind of girl (unless it's out for drinks and bar hopping) but plenty of people are fine/really like those types of places so if you do, you'll enjoy this place. I'm not knocking this place and I would come back if friends wanted to go but I like more of an ambiance when I go out to eat."

Sandwiches were straightforward and tasty and the fries were thick but crispy outside and soft inside.   Scotch eggs were better than Renaissance festival... but could have more sausage.

                "description": "Been checking this place out online for months now and finally got an opportunity to go in person today. Wow. What a superior waste of time! It makes sense now why it was so empty when we went in.  You would think that as we're just coming out of a pandemic, pub and bar owners would be over the top happy to have people show up to eat and drink their food.  Well, not this owner! I'm still in shock how rude he was to me and in so little time of me being there! His bar waitress was super sweet and answering questions as it was our first time there. The plan was to order some grub, and craft beer and go sit outside on the picnic tables on this beautiful Sunday.  I was into my second question about one of the brunch items, when he rudely interjected himself into our conversation by trying to answer my question for the waitress where he clearly had not actually heard my question at all. I then corrected him by repeating what I actually asked. He then tried to defend his ignorance by stating something else about the food they serve that was a complete contradiction to half of the menu items. You should of heard the way this guy talked to me, there was absolutely no reason for it, completely unwarranted.  Plus he made himself look like a total idiot in front of everyone and it was so obvious. The more obvious thing was that he didn't want our business. When I say our, it was my husband, 2 yr. old and me. Maybe he felt threatened by our kid? He wasn't misbehaving or doing anything crazy. The nice waitress was chatting with him and everything was totally fine. And then out of no where the owner was just a total dick to me!! So of course we left, I mean who would stay!? But that's exactly what he wanted, for us to leave. With pleasure, Asshole!  I felt bad for the nice waitress, she seemed to be in shock also. Sure hope she finds somewhere else to work since I can bet she gets treated like garbage.  Funny thing is that I can't even comment on the food or beer which is all I was yes to try. This guy should do the world a favor, sell the place to someone who actually wants business and go take a class in The Important of People skills in the food and bev business. Mean people suck and they need to learn how to be nice or just grow the F up."

                "description": "First of all, not family friendly. Took my daughter here for a dinner with our dog ... sat outside, and ordered a couple of burgers, and after a long day I wanted a couple of cold, craft beers. Perhaps I shouldn't have expected a family friendly atmosphere, but I honestly didn't think I had to think it through too much. So, a group of men in their 30s-40s began arguing about a patron sneezing , dropping \"f bombs\". The patron went in to get the owner. I thought \"ok cool, the owner will take care of this.\" Instead, of calming the situation, he comes out dropping \"f bombs\" of his own, bragging about how he's going to kick all their asses, and how big of a Texan he is. I asked if he could watch his language in front of my family, he ignored me. So, I took it as a way to teach my daughter that this is the definition of a bunch of men that are nothing but losers. I told her, this is not the way men that have any class should act in public. There were also plenty of other women around that didn't need to hear all of this male drama while they are trying to have an enjoyable evening with their families. The guy that actually started the whole thing apologized. Owner, Eric, you should be ashamed of yourself. Dude, have some awareness ... no one cares about how cool and tough you think you are while they are trying to have dinner and spend some time with their friends and family. The people next to me just got up and left, too. You were so caught up in your own ego, you didn't even notice. I spent $42 and still left your staff a 20% tip, mostly cuz I felt sorry they have to work for such a loser. Not sure what Texas you claim to have grown up in, but not the one my family has lived in for 6+ generations. We all make mistakes .. and I rarely leave reviews or waste any of my precious time on this kinda thing .. but this needed to be said."

I do prefer more sauce but, still good.   The pepperoni had the crunchy edges I like   Took home a piece of red velvet and Italian cream for my last    We both loved it all   Only one register so slow going but I recommend you try this out if the was gas station pub.   Serve alcohol on site and sell NUMEROUS types of beers microbrew stuff-more than I've seen most places."

When I got there, I waited an extra 15 minutes for the pizza. So 45 minutes after I ordered.  Normally that's not that bad but there was literally 5 people in the whole restaurant. 2 of them were working. That's pretty slow.    Brought it home and honestly I've had better frozen pizza.  It was real doughy and lacked a lot of flavor. Minimal sausage and the mushrooms. I bit off a piece and the cheese completely came off the pizza and there was barely any sauce holding the cheese on.  It was heavy on the dough and nothing else.   Unless they change the recipes and use more fresh ingredients, I won't be back."

Brought in a group of four, and bar tender insulted me and my beer choice after I sampled a hazy ale, asked if he had a pale ale, and settled on a Yuengling.   He then ignored my wife when she tried to place order. The place was dead slow on a Monday night. I used to come more often, probably won't be back. There are plenty of places to grab a beer."

                "description": "Wow pleasantly surprised by this recommendation and now I tell everyone who lives nearby about this.   High Country is a gas station..... with a bar in it, food, oh and casually 100s of different kinds of craft beer. Need I say more?   We stopped in on a Sunday to check out the selection and ended up staying for a beer and a burger.   The food: amazing and fresh. We did the $5 Sunday burger special, and might I mention the KETCHUP. I believe it's truffle ketchup, has me drooling about when I get to try it again.   The bar: great selection of beers on tap, they also have a whole selection of wine. In addition to the tap they have a variety of bottles in the fridge you can also pick from. They do Monday ALL DAY pint happy hour for $3.50, which is as cheap as they come by and local brewery tap takeovers on Thursday. Speaking my language.   The beer Togo: gosh almighty this is the place to get craft beer, but careful they aren't all cheap! They also have Pacifico in a can and a fabulous selection of commercial and domestic beer. They have fridges full of cans from breweries EVERYWHERE, not just Texas beer. They then have a whole large bottle section and more. If you like to try new brews - get here now!   If this didn't sell you ^ the people were also tremendously helpful and personable. Stop in if you are nearby and be ready to turn from skeptical to a regular. Shout out to the owners of Southern Heights (my fave brewery if you read that review) for introducing us to this place."

Our go-to pizzas are the pepperoni and the Hawaiian with pineapple and ham. We always ask for extra crispy crust and it never disappoints.  This time I got a great local craft growler that we enjoyed when we got home with the pizza.  Really hate to see our local neighborhood places struggling to stay afloat with just take out. Glad the stay at home orders are easing up.  I still ask fellow Yelpers to tip extra these days.  We'll continue to be regulars here.  Cheers!"

Yelp says it closes at 10pm and the actual website seems to be hacked or given up on.   I showed up at 7:30pm they says kitchens closed, as the guy just finished putting down food in front of another customer.  I've worked food service back end. I didn't in any way want them to cook for me after closing the kitchen. It's not the cooks fault, but the front end had no explanation other than tough luck.

They constantly roll in and out different beers on tap and have a large cooler filled with other interesting types too... just can't go wrong!  Their wine selection is something to be cherished too... seriously... you have got to try this place!  Since the last time I was here it does seem to have slipped a bit in maintenance... light in hall way not working, icee machines down... cooler for sodas really low... and the extra TVs in eating area are off... I think we need to rally for this establishment!  For a gas station restaurant it is really so very very cool! You can't beat the selection! I don't want to see this place fold up... it truly is a coo cool coo place!"

My Son came and asked me what else I wanted since they didn't have either so I walked up and asked what they had.  The guy brings a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon and said I have this. I laughed and said ok let me get a glass please. So if you specialize in wine, why not educate your bartenders on wine. There seemed to be only 3 bottles out of wine they were pouring.  Pizza was good. It was a busy Friday and everyone just seemed too busy and not customer friendly at all. I guess you have to be a regular and sit at the bar to get smiles."

The outside patio \"pre-COVID\" had lots of games for guest to play. There's enough TV's to watch sports from anywhere you're sitting. I recommend ordering the fried chicken and homemade mash potatoes. I think it's their most popular dish. The dish is fried to the perfect level of crisp, and it's very juicy!  I also like their salmon!  As far as the drinks, if I'm not ordering my usual Austin Eastcider, I'm getting their jalapeño margarita! One of the best in town!   The vibes are always good here."

They have indoor seating and half outdoor seating (it's \"outside\" of the restaurant but still covered on all sides - great for when it's cold out!   It's a cool bar with live music and games but my favorite part is the food!   We got the cheese fondue that came with a bowl of pretzels and it was nothing I expected at all - pretzels are okay at best usually and most places has cheese that taste gross but this was the best pretzel/cheese combo I've ever had!! The pretzel balls were pretty big in size from what I was expecting, they were warm and perfectly seasoned and delicious! And then the cheese - wow I could literally drink a jar of it if I wasn't my age and getting heartburn everyday as is. I haven't stopped thinking about the pretzels and cheese since my first bite! I definitely want to go back to Austin just for this dish.   And then for entree my boyfriend and I split the butternut lasagna and they were so nice enough to split the dish for us without us having to ask.   Oh yeah and for drinks (I forgot to take a pic) but we got the Smashed Irishman and it was so good we ordered 5 through out dinner.   The staff was really nice and the place was super busy so some things took a little longer to come out and we were forewarned before ordering anyway."

Place was very busy on a Saturday night - multiple parties out on the porch.   I still dream about their chopped chicken salad! - so good!    They have a big drink menu with cute cocktails. Staff was so nice and my dog loved all the loving he got from everyone there.   It's definitely a casual/loud/fun ambiance!"

I was happy to see CD had an Austin location!  We came on a week night and it was still pretty crowded. Wait time was about 30 minutes, so that gave us some time to walk around and do some window shopping at the Domain. Once we were seated, we put it our order right away.  Pretzels and Fondue: The softest pretzels!!! Perfect for dipping in the provolone cheese sauce. We actually got 2 rounds of these as they were that good.  El Matador: tequila, elderflower, ginger agave, and orange bitters. This is my favorite drink here. Has enough of a fruit taste without being overly sweet. And the bartender made it with a lot of love. Lol. Only 2 drinks and I was finished for the night.  Our server was really great and kept checking on us throughout the night. Fun crowd. Fun music. And a really fun time."

I love Brussels so I had to try their Brussels sprouts. They are delicious and super spicy. Next we ordered some pork belly nachos which were so tasty. However it was too much food for the both of us. You definitely need a large group for them to be worth it. Overall would go back to this place."

I've been here for brunch and got the breakfast burrito. It is huge and it's pretty good! I'd have to say my favorite menu item so far is the fried chicken! The breading is crispy and the meat juicy. The portion is pretty large so you get to take some home! Overall this place is a good go-to spot!"

                "description": "Originally was going to stop for a quick lunch but got ahead of ourselves when looking at the menu.   Brussel Sprouts (3/5): not crispy like I expected it to be but the flavor was solid and unique.  Salad (4/5): they made kale taste good. that's impressive!   36-hour Pork Ribs (3/5): very sauce-y and therefore, very messy. At least the flavor was decent. The ribs itself were are not very tender.   Steak Frites (3.5/5): not bad but also not great. The salad on the side was great tho.   Korean BBQ Skirt Steak (4/5): lots of flavorrrr. Better than the Steak Frites. The meats on these two dishes actually tasted the same but this one had sauce. I actually liked this main the most out of the ones that we tried!   Overall, chill spot for a nice dinner with friends. I would rate this place a 3/5 for the food but probably bump it up because of the ambiance. There's lots of space and a few games to play so the vibes probably make up for the food."

We tried the burgers, the pork nachos, the salmon, and the kale salad. The Kale salad was incredible. I would have given a higher rating accept that it seemed our waiter forgot about us and we waited over 45 minutes for our food and appetizer. Otherwise, I think it is worth a try and the whole area of downtown Austin is great for kids."

                "description": "10-25-21  Quality/Quantity - Gochujang Brussels Sprout - I would have preferred the brussel sprouts to have been a little more crispy. Could not really taste the gochujang flavor, not spicy at all. Kurobuta Pork Ribs - My favorite, good flavor. Would have preferred more fries though. Spicy Vegan Curry - My daughter's choice, I guess it was good, but not something I would have ordered. Had a hint of lemon grass after taste, which is a little different from Indian or Thai Curry. Separated rice versus rice combined in the sauce is also preferred, so we can control the flavor.  Atmosphere - This is a very good spot. I like both the indoor and outdoor space. There were a few activities (cornhole, etc) for the guests. I like the choices of seating - regular tables, high top tables, bar seating, couches, etc. Additionally, your huge wrap around bar was nice. Lastly, I am always a fan of an open kitchen concept.  Service - Julia did a good job; she came back and refilled our water often. It was really busy and the entire team seemed to be working hard. I also noticed 2 employees picking up garbage as they walked back and forth serving customers, this is always a positive plus.  Price - $49.80 + tip  Owner Suggestion - Seems like you are very successful, owning quite a few restaurants. Congrats on all your success, and wish you many more. I look forward to trying your other restaurants in the future."

Here's what I tried: - Evil Jungle Princess ($13): This fruity rum drink was good! - Soft Pretzels and Provolone Fondue ($13.25): The pretzel bread was good. The cheese was good. $13.25 is a lot for what it is though. - Gojuchang Brussels Sprouts ($6): It maybe came with 5-6 total brussels sprouts. It tasted good, but super not worth it. - The M.A.C. Burger ($14.50): Their take on a McDonald's Big Mac. It was good!  Fun vibes. Convenient if you're staying in the Domain."

                "description": "Our experience eating at Culinary Dropout was nothing short of perfection. We went on a Monday night with all three of our very young kids. It was busy but there wasn't a wait if we wanted to sit outside. I was concerned because of how cold it was outside, but they assured us that the heating lamps outside kept it pretty comfortable so we could check and feel it out if we wanted. They were correct; between the heat lamps and the heated seating (amazing!), we faired well.   Our server was very helpful and knowledgeable of the menu. He recommended his favorites to us and we took him up on them. I ordered the Spicy Korean Skirt Steak and my husband ordered the Prime Rib sandwich. They were both absolutely delicious. Like finger-licking good. I seriously can't wait to go back. I also love that they have a kids menu and are more than willing to bring the kids food out first if you ask! We will be returning to try the ribs soon!"

Friendly staff. The food was so good. My husband and I are some carnivores but today we both ordered vegetarian options  Don't let that fool you. Both dishes were packed with flavor. My favorite was the vegetarian spicy curry. Holy cow was it good. So good. Would definitely visit again!!"

The restaurant is large and has plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. I arrived at around 5:45 on a weekday and did not have to wait to be seated.   I ordered the Fried Chicken and Between You and Me to drink. Both were delicious and definitely recommended. The portion sizes are large enough that I had leftovers.

I recently went for brunch and we had cheeses, meat, and Brussels sprouts on ours. The Gochujang sauce on the Brussels is amazing. It's sweet and a little spicy. I could have eaten a whole order to myself, they were that good. I also loved the Wellness Retreat cocktail. It has a slight spice and it's a change up from just getting a mimosa."

                "description": "We had been trying to get here for a while and we're excited to finally make it in. Unfortunately, we probably won't be returning.   Food: We ordered the pretzel fondue, the breakfast sandwich, the breakfast burrito, and the hash.   The pretzel fondue was 'meh' at best. The bread that came with it didn't really have that pretzel texture and very little salt. Provolone cheese is a pretty light tasty cheese so it didn't taste great as a fondue.   The other food items were great but all came out lukewarm or cold. Which, relates to the...  Service: It took a long time for the food to come out and my guess is that's why it was cold. Because it has taken so long to get there, we were too hungry to send it back.   The server was forgetful and/ or missed the details. For example, we had to ask three times for a bowl for the dog. Many servers just bring one out automatically when they see a doggo but, even if they don't, it doesn't take three reminders.   Overall, service was slow and not, well, service-oriented. For example, my friend and I both had coffee and my friend asked for a refill. The waitress stepped away and I assumed she was getting the pot for a refill. Nope. She came back with a new cup for my friend and took off. So, I'm sitting there looking at my bear empty cup. As someone who was a server for many years, it seems so obvious to me that you should ask the other person if they'd like coffee as well especially when it's near empty. That's just one example of the just miss when it comes to great service.   Other details: - The ambiance and big open patio was great which *may* pull me back for a drink or something. Then again, you can get the same at other places in the domain.  - They didn't offer corn tortillas which I feel is really strange. My friend has celiac's and can't do gluten but corn tortillas are fine. Since they didn't have corn tortillas (or a gluten free bread option) it limited her options significantly. Granted, they said they could do lettuce wraps but let's not pretend like that's the same.   I don't think I'll be returning to Culinary Dropout."

They had one vegan option - the spicy vegan curry which tasted like Thai curry. It was pretty yummy but the portion was not super filling for the price in my opinion, so my only wish is that there was more! Overall solid place for vegans and non vegans to enjoy a meal in the domain!"

I have not had time to contact or go up to the establishment in regards to this matter but WTF... Y'all are aware that it's a pork burger right?? Make it a point to ask people how we like our burgers because I don't like this... I couldn't even eat the burger.. Just looking at this makes me sick.... I'm so pissed I don't think Ima ever go back to that yard house again."

                "description": "Been here a few times. I must say that the waiters and waitresses here are phenomenal. During my most recent experience our waitress was Karisha.  Late 30s early 40s generation like me will LOVE the music selection here - I felt like they were playing my old playlists from high school or something!   (And they actually have a barcode to listen to their playlist on Spotify which I thought was cool)  I ordered the 20 oz ribeye. (I had a very paltry breakfast and had recently worked out so my body was lusting for some bovine carnage)  My better half ordered truffle fries and the Gardein Buffalo chicken - which she absolutely loved - and trust me that's a rare sight - so Thank You Yard House!  Meanwhile, this steak had everything I hoped for - it was bone-in, juicy and cooked to perfection. The server even asked me to cut into it to ensure it was to my liking - I had to ask her to repeat herself because I've never had someone ask me before.. how thoughtful! And cut into it I did, again and again until all that was left was the bone.   The Parmesan mashed potatoes were also scrumptious! Just the right texture and not too cheesy at all, the right touch of Parmesan.   Oh and there was also the healthy baby broccoli. The heads were very good, the stem was a little tough for me to chew but that's probably because they are grilled (as opposed to steamed) but that's fine because I usually only eat the heads anyways.   I don't usually drink but they are supposed to have a large selection on tap as well as bottled beers. I had the Heineken 0 (0% alcohol) and for those who used to drink Heineken I recommend it because it tastes exactly like the real thing! I was amazed they had it, so I guess there's something for everyone here.  I think this place is a keeper and I will return to see what other delicious adventures are lurking inside that menu. I've had the steak bowl before and it always hits the spot! The burgers are also delicious - though sadly I'm watching my carb intake recently.   In the end, you can't go wrong with this place! It can get pretty busy but all you have to do is give your name and number and they text you when your table is ready! Just go walk to Restoration Hardware and look at extremely expensive furniture you'll never buy in the meantime or stroll on over to Amazon books and play with their toys :) the possibilities are endless"

                "description": "We've come here almost every week, sometimes multiple times a week since we moved to Austin 3 months ago. The hours are great and the food has always been good, you get a full menu and happy hour specials. I'm not sure if we've been here any other Sunday but this past Sunday the food was absolutely awful. I'm not sure if the head chef, kitchen manager, etc. is off or what but both our meals and appetizer tasted like they were microwaved leftovers.   We got the ahi tuna and it was very strange this time, so strange I didn't want to really eat it but the portion was so small this time we just ate it. I guess that kind of shows we're really not picky so when I say something was terrible it's really-really bad. I know anyone reading this will say that's your fault for getting ahi tuna from a sports bar but we've got it dozens of times and it was always surprisingly good. The tuna sandwich and poke nachos are great as well, but we didn't get them this time. We did get the fish and chips and the hot chicken sandwich. The fish was 100% microwaved, it was rubbery and had no crisp to the breading so they're dead giveaways. Also, the coleslaw was brown so that was nice. The chicken sandwich tasted nothing like the chicken sandwiches we've had from there before, and the taste of this one was not pleasant. We still ate most of our food so I wasn't going to complain that it was terrible unless our waitress asked and to my surprise she never did. lol. I think she knew so she avoided that question.   The cocktails and beer selection is great from here and they make great drinks for a sports bar. During happy hour they have small discounts on drinks and larger discounts on food. I don't remember what they all are but I know the cocktails are 2 dollars off, nothing crazy but hey I'll take it. I ordered my first cocktail during happy hour and about 30-40 minutes later another. The waitress took my order for the drink and came back later maybe 10-15 minutes and asked if I still want the drink I ordered. I was confused and said yeah so another 10 minutes or so I got my drink. My girlfriend was on her phone and noticed she came back to ask right after 11 PM when happy hour is done. So I was charged 2 dollars extra for one drink, I could care less. But it was really weird for her to do that.   I don't think we'll stop coming here because of our bad experience. I figured I would take my time to at least let the establishment know of our experience. So they can improve - if they want to. I know a lot of restaurants have staffing issues and there is a massive amount of competition in Austin. A bad meal isn't the end of the world by any means."

                "description": "A Must Go!!!... Every time we come visit close to the Domain , we have to come to YARD HOUSE! THE ATMOSPHERE is nice.  Very spacious.  The staff is Amazing and professional but not so much where they're snobby.  Just a kick back place.  While my husband and I sat down at the bar there was a guy watching a game..GO DODGERS!! To our left.. a couple to our right and a blind date across the way. I feeds everyone's needs.   Our bartender KEITH was fantastic...  if your ever so luck for him to make you a drink... you'll be in mixer heaven. He recommended a beer to my hubby some kind of blonde.  Jez I wish I can remember the name... any who, he's gave himself a sample and that was the end of that.  Also, we ordered shots and I ordered a dirty martini.  EVERY.  SINGLE.  DRINK.  Was delicious haha. But also, he was  good company and made sure we're taken care of.   Pros: EVERYTHING!!!! FOOD IS ON ANOTHER LEVEL.  CHEERS TO THE KITCHEN  Cons: nothing. And I always find something that can be"

Finally, last night I had dinner at the Yard, and was so pleased.  First, Miguel, our  young wonderful Server who was just the BESTEST-helpful, kind and patient.  You couldn't ask for more.  Second, the food, the appetizers, buffalo wings and Sushi Nachos were so impressive, fresh and tasty.  The bacon cheese burger were amazing.  Good beef, and delicious fries.  Of course the Beer was good too, and cold.  All in all I am already planning my return until I sampled everything on the menu that appeals to me."

                "description": "Yard House in my opinion, is a chain that is highly underrated especially when it comes to their happy hour. In case you didn't know, during happy hour all their apps are half off.! Unfortunately I only took pictures of the calamari and nachos, however some of my appetizer favorites are the ahi sashimi, poke nachos, fried calamari, and the chicken lettuce wraps. I also like the chicken nachos, classic sliders, and have heard great things about the cheese curds. Often times, I come here for the happy hour and don't even end up ordering an entre just get a few half priced apps!"

I got the KBBQ Cheesesteak sandwich, which had decent flavors and nice presentation. I would personally have preferred a stronger tasting gochujang sauce, but it was still tasty as is. My friend got the whiskey salmon, which had great sauce! The sweetness and whisky flavors mixed very well. I had a pretty good experience overall and was really happy with the atmosphere and waiters! Tim and Noah, you guys were cool!  I also had Yard House in the past once at maybe 1am and ordered their pepperoni mushroom pizza and Margherita pizza, both which tasted great! Definitely a great meal after being out with friends. Would recommend as a fun, laidback place to eat and drink!"

The waitress that assisted me was attentive, knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. My order came out in a timely manner. I ordered blackened shrimp tacos that came with rice and beans. The sauce that is on the tacos is spicy. For my drink I ordered a Sangria. The food and drink were great!   I sat outside on the patio because it was a nice day outside. The patio is a nice size that has a lot of tables. The restrooms were clean and they are unisex. It's a parking garage across from Yard House which is convenient."

Great spots for drinks after work, happy hour, dinner etc   Eats- we started with the spicy tuna roll but was told it was not sushi! Glad they said something! Was very tasty and without the guilt of the rice!   I got the Baja fish tacos (white fish) it was lightly fried with a nice sauce and slaw on it. I wrapped it in lettuce to lighten it up a bit. However it was delicious! Would 100% recommend this! I also ordered brussel sprouts instead of the rice and beans and they were deliciously fried !   My husband got the Nashville hot chicken sandwich with fries! This was delicious and not super spicy, filled with flavor! Fries were good too! Would recommend this as well.   Worth- the whole check was about $100 after tip. We did get a few drinks as well so that added up. However the portions were large and we felt that it was worth the amount of food and quality of food as well.   Drinks- i got a couple vodka sodas and my husband got the half yard of the left hand milk stout. He loved it !   Services - our waiter was very nice. He checked on us multiple times and refilled waters promptly, he also guided us through the extensive menu and helped us narrow down our choices. Loved that!   Would def come here again! I might bring the pups next time and sit on the patio(when it's warmer)!"

We ordered waters and beers, which they were out of all the beers we wanted to try. Our waitress didn't bring us water for 25 minutes! We had our appetizers basically finished by the time we even had a drink. The poke nachos and cheese curds were awesome and really large. The waitress barely checked on us, and when she did the one time we asked her for sauce and she just never returned for over 15 min. We paid and left without ever getting our sauce. Food and atmosphere were amazing but our waitress truly ruined the experience for us."

                "description": "We absolutely love yard houses HH! We have tried bunch of there appetizers and they are all pretty good, and most of there appetizers are 50% off and pizzas too. But if it's outside the HH time, I this it's bit pricey.  Chicken nachos: skimpy on the chicken and too much of sour cream.  Korean chicken wings: it was pretty good, it had a nice hint with a hint of sweetness and our kiddo loved it.  Onion rings: I mostly don't like onion rings because it's greasy and feels heavy, but at the YH, it's light, crispy and non greasy.  Chicken strips: chicken strips comes with the small basket of fries, chicken stripes itself doesn't have much flavors or seasoning, but it's good if you dip it in some sauce.  They don't have online reservations, so that sucks. Ordering and paying is with the tablet they have on the table and that's not convenient either, we had to try atleast 4-5 times for payment to go through and it's so confusing, otherwise everything else is good."

The hh burger was good for $7 in my opinion.  Good atmosphere, in and out.  Friendly service.  Live music.  Wide menu.  Kid-friendly until 9. Close parking.  Good place to stay for hours and hours.  Generous cheap side salads.  Pretzel appetizer.   Cookie skillet with ice cream.   The bad: Poisoned my friend by serving her a known allergen.  Forgetful service.  Mushy fries. Did they boil them?! Bland house-made tater tots. Frozen tots would have been better.  Ruined my salad by drenching it with dressing.  Other friends didn't like the burger.  Added things to the wrong tab."

                "description": "My fiancé and I were looking to have lunch at the Domain and happened to see this place close to where we parked. The main reason he wanted to try it was to watch hockey.  We were immediately greeted and told to take a seat anywhere we wanted, a precursor to the excellent service that we received the entire time we were there.  The place is very spacious with a bunch of tables and bar seating, as well as plenty of outdoor seating, and a bunch of TVs. There is also what appears to be a stage space, most likely for their events like trivia and bingo. We sat at the bar and ordered drinks. It was a Sunday early afternoon so it was pretty quiet. We ordered a side of Buffalo roasted cauliflower per recommendation. My fiancé got the impossible burger with a side Caesar salad and I got the smoked pork quesadilla also with a side Caesar salad.  All the food came out relatively quickly and pretty much all at once. I obviously was too excited for the food because I forgot to take pictures of them! The portions were the perfect size and the side salads were not sad like some other watery small portions that you might get elsewhere. My fiancé enjoyed his burger and my quesadilla had a great texture and came with pickled onions, sour cream, jalapeño slices, and shredded lettuce.  Shout out to the service for being extremely friendly and fast, constantly checking in on us. We definitely want to come back to this place!"

I'm at a loss for words in regard to the preparation of this. Check the oil pools in the pictures. I wouldn't recommend this appetizer at all.   - PRETZELS - $10 Fresh baked pieces with white queso and spicy brown mustard (680 CAL.) -   Sooo..... Baked and then dipped in Oil? Also, avoid that queso. As far as ambiance... It was noticeably hard to ignore a certain mildew type odor while sitting. Sit outside if you must! But, plenty of other places you can go instead in that area."

The chips were warm and the queso was fine but not the start we expected. Disappointing.  We were hoping to try several of their beers but since the appetizer was less than average, we had a beer each. The Lagunitas Sumpin Sumpin was nice and the 512 IPA was wonderful.   One of the best IPAs hands down.   We each had a beverage, ate our chips and moved on."

Come during happy hour where flights are $7. You really can't beat that since they're heavy pours. I'd highly recommend the Texas flight.  The atmosphere and vibe was dope. They had live music and she sang EVERYTHING under the sun.. from 70s to Michael Jackson to The Weeknd. Definitely made the place awesome.   Our server was great too! Highly recommend to stop by and grab a beer."

                "description": "My girlfriend and I stopped by the Brass Tap on a Wednesday night after getting our nails done across the street. Cool vibe, big tables, seat yourself social distancing, and quite a few TVs. Servers kind of rotate between tables to make sure everyone is taken care of so they're super attentive. We had one main server though and she was sweet and personable. They had three different menus, which was kind of confusing, but we realized one was their main menu, the second was someone they partnered with, and the third was for their Smokehouse BBQ only served on Wednesday nights.   Go for the bbq! I was pleasantly surprised how delicious the bbq was. I got the two meat plate that came with two sides. The sweet potato fries and brussel sprouts were both delicious. My friend got the loaded sweet potatoes and really enjoyed it. Overall, we had a good time with some good eats! Would definitely go back again!"

                "description": "This is a difficult review of the Brass Tap Beer and Food restaurant at the Domain. Why you say?  I am getting out more and the Domain is one of my favorite places to shop(carefully), eat and people watch! Sunday I met my two adult grandchildren at the awesome Domain Shopping Center. After completing our initial agenda of a haircut and some shopping we were starving. When the three of us get together and we're going to eat 99% of the time we choose a place we haven't tried before.  There sat the Brass Tap Tavern.  As always, I took a look at yelp for reviews and the majority were very positive-always a good sign! We've gone to a small handful of restaurants that are available at the Domain but in the spirit of adventure we decided to try The Brass Tap.  It was a Sunday afternoon around 430 ... so absolutely not what I would consider prime time for eating. The Decor was beautiful. The interior huge, lots of brass which is beautiful, and a very smart, but earthy feel. A large screen TV on the wall which is standard these days but often takes away from the beauty of an establishment. They also have a decent size patio available and since the tavern is on a corner it wraps around it. At that time of the day on a Sunday there was one table inside that was occupied, and probably about eight tables occupied outside where we sat down. It took us a bit to see our waiter approaching with a huge front and back beer menu, along with a very cool looking food menu. It was obvious that he was feeling rushed however he did take the time to answer a couple of questions we had about the beer menu and he took our order. I let him know we would be eating also as he was already rushing off and said he would be right back to take it. 20+ minutes later he stopped back after delivering beer to at least two tables on that trip. We decided to order an appetizer to share. Due to our elevated hunger level everything sounded delicious so we opted to get the combo platter. It consisted of Boom Boom Shrimp, House-Made Tots with beer cheese or jalapeño beer cheese and Chicken Tenders with BBQ sauce on a bed of House-Made Angry Onion Straws - $15 this was an average size appetizer. I personally ate a couple tater tot's and some onion strings. There were also three different dipping sauces, one a barbecue sauce, one a queso cheese sauce and one that was kind of tangy with a little bit of heat. My grands polished off everything else that was on the platter. Our main dishes arrived shortly after we had gotten our appetizer. My grandson ordered a half pound Angus burger called The Pub it was  Jalapeño cream cheese, smoked Gouda, Applewood bacon, lettuce, tomato, cowboy sauce on a butter brioche bun - 11\rit came with french fries. The fries looked great as was the construction of the burger and toppings. Sadly the burger was requested medium rare and arrived medium to well done. After waiting on our food over 1/2 hr. the grandson decided not to request it be redone. My granddaughter ordered the PERI PERI GRILLED CHICKEN PANINI with Goat cheese, hummus on grilled Ciabatta bread - 10. It also came with fries. It looked good and my granddaughter really enjoyed it. When I asked her what \"Peri Peri sauce was She couldn't explain. Since I didn't want something that heavy(The Panini) but I wanted to know what that sauce was I ordered  the 3 BEER BATTERED COD  Tacos. They were dressed with lettuce , cheddar jack and pepper jack cheeses, Peppadew peppers and drizzled with Peri Peri aioli - 8.5 ,my tacos were served with some chips and tiny salsa on the side. I was glad the Peri Peri was only drizzled over my fish tacos as I didn't care for it. To each his own! So our tab for our appetizer,meal, one nonalcoholic bottled beer one draft beer and one beer described as more like wine was $61.86. For us the food rang out at about a 3.9 (out of 5.0), the beverages, we really didn't think my granddaughter would like the nonalcoholic beer but she tried it and as it turns out she doesn't like it. I ordered what was described to me as NOT tasting like a beer at all but like a sweet wine (I guess I must've missed the wine list because the website says they offer it)-after two sips that was enough of that. This is definitely not the Brass Taps fault as I am not a beer drinker but since I said that out loud before ordering off a two sided menu that looks like all beer I would've wished our waiter would have advised me that they did serve wine. All  of us rated the service a 1.5 out of 5.0.    I am not mentioning the name of the server purposefully. Although he could have told me they had wine that really is all I can say related to him.  The major faux pas for us was how long it took to get anything to eat or drink."

                "description": "We chose to celebrate our New Year's Eve at the Brass Tap after snagging a few tickets for the 'Silent Rave' being hosted there that night. Since it was our first time attending such an event, going into it we thought things were going to be awkward, when in fact it was the complete opposite. Everyone had their headphones on, singing and dancing to one of three DJ's that were playing simultaneously on different radio channels. Even on this special night, the drinks were priced normally so kudos to that. This event turned out to be a very social affair.   If you're planning on going to an event like this, especially at the Brass Tap (Domain), I would recommend coming earlier than most to 1) grab a table to have a place to set drinks, otherwise how are you going to dance the way you want to dance? and 2) the line to get event headphones gets decently long and checking out the devices isn't a quick process.   5/5 for a fun organized event, clean venue, friendly bartenders, and a great night out."

                "description": "I stopped in while shopping and waiting for folks.  I live in Round Rock so been to that (older) location many times.  The atmosphere is quite different in each location with the RR one being more cozy and pub like.  This is more open and like a sports bar.   Now, on to the pricing.  This location seems more expensive than the RR one.  Other than Happy Hour and Friday fun day when beers and some cocktails are cheaper, the prices were high.  A well bourbon (Evan Williams) and diet was $7.50.  A draft beer was $7.50.  A Bulliet old fashioned was $16.50 (charged as a double). RIDICULOUS for a mid level sports bar (no NFL ticket)!!  So be prepared to help pay their rent at the Domain (which I understand is high).  Overall I like it as I like the one in RR. Different vibe but great selection of beer and cocktails. Great old school video games to play (Galaga, ms pacman, Dig Dug, etc).   The environment is nice and I think they have a DJ on certain nights.  Food seems like high end bar food which is as it should be.  I will definitely come back but it will be for happy hour or some other special.  #discountdave"

The happy hour started at 4pm and provides lots of tasty options.   We've been into wine lately, so we got the house red and sangria. They offered $4 shots and $7 drink of the day. The food options are priced at $5,6,7 and $8. We ended up getting the 3 Korean BBQ Pork Sliders with fries and 2 chicken tacos with chips and salsa. We were both dumbfounded by how much food you get with the happy hour specials.   Despite the lacking service at this location, we still had a okay time. Go in expecting lackluster and you won't get disappointed. ‍ They have a wonderful selection of beers as well, and a full menu. I provided the happy hour selections in my photos!"

Anyway, cannot comment too much on food as we only had an appetizer and it was alright.   Beer and wine are served in a plastic now which is less than desirable. Not sure how it was pre-Covid.   Staff was fast and efficient but I don't think I could describe them as warm or friendly.  They weren't rude either.   Decent amount of variety. It's charm is that is local and has the hole in the wall personality.   We plan on returning."

                "description": "My review is mostly based on service.  I came here with the husband on a Monday night because I wanted a post-dinner beer. I marked this place in my bookmarks as a place I wanted to try based off the reviews. I generally try to be open-minded about my experiences at new places, but honestly I was just rubbed the wrong way here. We walked inside around 7 pm and I only noticed the list of cocktails on the wall behind the bar. I looked at the tap handles to see if I could tell what they had and the bartender finally came over. I figured I'd ask for something easy and see if they had Dos Equis on draft and was told they didn't with a snarky attitude that I guess he thought was witty or funny. I asked where the list of beers was and he stared at me and just pointed up...ok where am I supposed to be looking? OH. Apparently I'm supposed to know there are individual beer names hanging not only above the bar seats, but also sticking out slightly over the seating where you have to get up to see them. I tell him I haven't been there before and wouldn't know those were there. I order the beer he suggested (Alstadt Kölsch) based off of me asking for Dos Equis. He asks if I want to open a tab and I say no. His response: \"Only one beer?\" with what may as well have been an eye roll. You would think with me telling someone that I'm a new patron the attitude would be better. He probably doesn't care since A) it probably isn't his business, B) I'm sure they have regulars and C) he was probably in a hurry to come outside to vape with his friends on the patio that says \"No Smoking\".  Side note: if you want to sit outside be prepared to listen to cornhole games underneath the same covering as the seating which causes it to echo so loud you can't hear your own conversation."

                "description": "On this past Saturday, we made the adult decision to venture out as LB was open. We decided to visit as they were not busy and were following the separation guidelines. The service is always friendly and it was even better on this visit. Our guest puppy was treated to snacks and fresh water. We sat on the covered patio and watched rerun sporting events and just enjoyed being outside.   I've been an LB patron since day 1 and I remember when it was difficult to find a local venue that offered a large variety of craft beer options.  LB has changed a lot of the years as they now serve cocktails and their patio has been expanded. Venues come and go (see Sheas and AJs across the street) but LB has a loyal following and has remained our go-to venue to have a brew or two and some pub grub.   It's a misnomer to call their food pub grub as you can order a pretty darn good pizza, meatball casserole, fried calamari, artichoke dip, or our favorite their homemade fried pickles. Yes, they pickle on site!   Nice folks, great beer, good cocktails (check out their specials), and food."

The hurricane that I order that was off of there board on drinks that they made was not a good drink.   The garlic bread we ordered was overdone and almost fully burnt on the bottom.   We ordered pizza also. One side was barely done while the other side was burnt. They put a lot of Italian season on top the pizza after it was cooked. Some times you just get a bite full of seasoning, not good.  First bits we thought the pizza had a good flavor but the more you ate the pizza the less tasty it was."

A solid 4 stars   If they realigned their pool table and got some better sticks it wouldn't hurt."

                "description": "Seek and ye shall find. This tiny hidden spot in old Leander checks off lots of my boxes - but doesn't impress. First off. This is a nice place dont get me wrong. I have been 3 times now just to see maybe it was an OFF day. Good menu , sports , decent tunes. So - those are pretty solid. Let me start with the menu. Pub grub for the most part with $10 pizzas unlimited toppings. So- naturally this is what i ordered each time. Each time it comes out it looks amazing and I'm excited. Like a Pointer Sister ( I 'm so excited ) . But the pizza never tastes cooked. The dough is mushy. Not a big deal. NExt time around I tell them to leave it in a bit longer for me. Comes out -- same. Not a deal breaker. Just need to change what I am eating. My belly prob says same thing. Next lets move onto the staff. For the most part the lady running the joint is on point. Friendly- helpful and witty. The remainder of the staff is quite the opposite. I have noticed this during a lunch visit with us being one of 2 people in the place, and in the evenings like during the sports games and crowds. Just abrasive . Again- I'm not there to make friends. I'm there to have a cold beer ( maybe 3) watch baseball or the slew of people who still have to think if they need to be wearing a mask when they enter an establishment( smh). So - The beer. They have a pretty typical tap list with 1-2 silver and gold medal choices. I saw Aldelberts there last night.. sweet!. But behind the bar is a ghostbuster lunchbox treasure chest of cans and bottles. WARNING! don't try to figure out what's in there. Hard to see them all... and after learning  how friendly the bar staff(see above ) is - I gave up asking and went with an IPA. The crowds are not bad and for the most part follow distancing rules.. but - nothing enforced. This scares me. While I know its MY choice to patron , I would still like to see ppl adhere to the 6ft. Outside- good seating - tv;s good parking and over all fantastic. I will prob go back, just not order the pizza and maybe try and get a spy camera behind the bar to see the other options as -- that's what life is all about. Options. Thanks for eating with me today, and I'll see you next time.  -M"

Sat down at the bar and asked to move because a regular sits there. Ok fine. Told the game was on a certain TV. Once people started arriving the manager said she didn't have enough boxes to play the game I wanted all of a sudden. We had ubered to the bar and now are forced to leave. I guess there is a hierarchy in customers and you have to be important to be treated well. I'm baffled."

Something changed at the spot and for me no longer has that comfortable feel. Seems has if over serving is not monitored as you will have several loud and obnoxious folks who aren't being controlled.   This was the second night in a row that I was ignored while sitting at the bar and watching the bar tender hang at the end of the bar with is buddies.   What was once a nice calm place to eat and enjoy some craft beers is now a place for the high volume drinking and the vocally high volume people.  Bring back Luigi's for the food and leave everything else."

They have rotating specials, soups and flatbreads. The servers and staff are all very friendly and hard workers. I also bring friends here and they have all loved it as well! They have great deals on their happy hour and a good variety of beers and wine that are not crazy overpriced. I have loved everything I have ordered and they have great portion sizes! We usually come for lunch or dinner, but we recently had brunch which was also fabulous. I had the chilaquiles and they were amazing! The portions are also super generous so I've left with leftovers multiple times. If you're a sports person, they have a ton of really nice TVs and always have games on. I am honestly so happy this place is close by and will continue giving them my business! I would also like to add that like many places these days, they have also experienced shortages with staff and when that happens, we have seen the managers out on the floor helping out and also working their butte off! This restaurant has amazing food, service and is such a great place to have a nice dinner, go hang with friends or just pop by for a drink! Thanks for rocking it Cover 2! Oh and the Round Rock location is also awesome as I went their with a group of work friends once they also had excellent service and the food was equally as delicious!!!"

I like this place. The food is good the beer selection is passable and I can watch any sporting event live or read a book or both. But these two are killing the place for me. Ordered a beer and sat for 20 minutes with no one asking me if I might like to order food. Had to literally flag someone down to order a meal. That is not how this business works.   Wearing a mask under your chin until you walk up to a customer is not how this works either. And the tall one did that all night long. Now looking for a different place to spend an evening eating a meal and enjoying a beer."

Person who had seated me brought me a drink then nothing. Though a minimum of 5 different servers were standing right next to my booth.  I understand a restaurant may be short staffed but limit your seating if you cannot handle it.  I've had the similar experience here multiple times.  Last time I patron any of the restaurants in this local chain.  And \"the remedy\" after speaking to a manager when I asked for the check for my half drank coke...oh no need to pay for the coke.

The supposed waiter for our area literally helped everyone around us and kept skipping us. Idk if it was because we didn't have UT gear on or I was basically the only black person there at the time but ppl that just walked in the door got greeted before we did.   We just got up and left. There's no way the dude in the area didn't know we had not been helped as he purposely kept ignoring the table and was serving EVERYONE around us.   Terrible service."

We fancied burgers and thought that a sports bar would serve delicious burgers! What a mistaken idea!! We started with a cup of onion soup: it was edible, not delicious, a little strong on the acid side, but ok. Then came the burgers: a 3mm leather sole burnt to death!! Awful! Horrible!! My husband had to leave the restaurant and was sick in the car park!! The fries were smothered in fat... yak! The waiter on the other hand was a sweetheart!! VERY professional! When I mentioned it wasn't good, he immediately offered to comp them, which he did! I am tempted to say that he had been through a similar situation before, maybe several times!!! He didn't hesitate and didn't offer an alternative: he KNEW the food was bad! Shame on management to allow this to happen! It's a Burger after all, and we are in Texas!! Land of Beef!! Cover 2, I'm afraid you will not see us again!!"

(Previously came here and was seated but waitress seemed like she was just so busy she couldnt get to us and the vibe was just off? so we walked out) but let me tell you I sure am glad we gave it a second shot because the food was absolutely amazing and service was even better! Can't remember our waiters name but he was above and beyond. Everything came out quickly and tasted perfect... the environment was a plus! We willl back yall :)"

                "description": "Cover 2 off research always hits the spot it's got the best shoe string fries I can't seem to find anywhere else in Austin . Even though they may just be French fries and not a main course there is something so satisfying about them . My favorite dish is the buffalo chicken sliders , I personally get the blue cheese on the side with ranch to dip . These are amazing and have the perfect thin not to thick cut of chicken that's battered nice and crispy but stays juicy tossed in tangy but not spicy buffalo sauce. The bread doesn't take over the sandwich so that's not all you get full on and is super soft . They also have a buffalo chicken salad that has a good amount of chicken if your not wanting a sandwich but need to cure that buffalo craving . I've only had the burgers other than that and they are equally delicious again especially with those shoe string fries that are always crispy .  This place is relaxed and a good place to have a beer while you cool off after a long day or just dining with the family.  The staff is pleasant and the deserts are huge . Well at least the brownie is . If you like bars and burgers are in the area and don't know what to eat stop in and try the buffalo sandwich it's my go to and recommendation for cover 2 . If not that than at least grab a beer and some shoe string fries and relax a minute ."

Today I stopped in for lunch and ordered the flat top cheeseburger that comes with Parmesan fries. Should have been a safe bet, right? It came out DRIPPING in grease that tasted truly awful. Even the fries, which are always good, no matter the location, were inedible, as they tasted like they were fried in oil that should have changed long ago. It pains me to leave food that I paid good money for, but that's just what I did after trying to force down a couple more bites I shouldn't have taken. I left 2/3 of the burger and most of the fries on the table. Considered complaining, and might have if the server had even asked how the food was, but she didn't ask, and she had to have noticed how little I had eaten. She just left the check by the barely eaten food.  I rarely send food back to the kitchen, and since this wasn't exactly fine dining, I let it go today. But tonight I'm regretting eating those two or three additional bites I shouldn't have taken. It truly wasn't fit for consumption."

Heading back, I swung into Cover2. I'm glad I did.  The greeting, Silvana as server, and the whole support staff weekend terrific.  I started with a cup of French onion soup. It was just a tad too sweet for my taste. I'm also a purist in looking for a single crouton under the  hood (of cheese).   The fries and prime rib sandwich were a pleasant surprise. I will typically keg wrestle you to keep the horseradish sauce off the plate. The sauce here actually was mellowed very nicely and didn't fight the meat. The fries were great! Nothing more need be said.   This was a terrific first meal in a new town. This might become my extended kitchen it was that solid of aa performance!"

I try to give servers the benefit of the doubt cause maybe they're short staffed but after multiple issues with the same server and seeing tables sat after us putting their orders in and getting their food, I'm getting disappointed with the downhill service at Cover 2.

                "description": "I stopped by after reading a few Yelp reviews and what a great choice that was. I had the good fortune to sit at the bar and have Miranda take care of me. If I started a bar or a restaurant she would be my first hire (better give her a raise, Doug)!  She's friendly, professional and makes a great martini. The hospitality industry needs more Miranda's!    Now to the place itself. Cover 2 has a nice, open concept with the ubiquitous flat screens located around the bar and restaurant - it is a sports bar, after all.  The people working there are friendly and attentive while the noise level is energetic but not overly loud.    The food.  The Reuben was honestly just okay. The corned beef to Swiss cheese to kraut ratio is off (not enough kraut) and the bread was cooked to the point where it was as stiff as a board.  It tastes okay but the potential for a better sandwich is definitely there.  Ask for fries - they don't automatically come with it.   The fries were good and - just to see for myself - I ate half the Reuben and then ordered the wings.  The buffalo wings are tasty - not the best I've ever had but certainly worth sampling. Pair it with the 512 IPA and you have a winning combination.  Overall I would give Cover 2 a solid 8 on a 1-10 scale. The kitchen gets a 7, the bar an 8 and Miranda a 1o I think my math is right). If you're looking for a good sports bar that's not too sporty this is a solid choice."

But they used to advertise it as wing Wednesday, and they were cheaper that day. And it was fun.

                "description": "I finally got a chance to checkout Cat's infamous hideout, and it did not disappoint. It's the typical neighborhood dive bar that I expected it to be, but that's not a bad thing.  Some of the best things happen in a place like this!  TRUST me, it's nothing but fun, fun, fun, with a capital F-U-N!  It's a good place to do some day drinking, or hang out until the wee hours of the morn'.  As Tina R said in her review, lots of interesting characters lurk in this place.  Including \"that\" guy who likes to butt into your conversation, and then carry the conversation and not give anyone else a chance to talk.  But I won't dock 'em a star for that.  Every neighborhood bar has \"that\" guy in it.  It's a package deal.  Inside is kind of dark and it takes a minute for your eyeballs to adjust if you enter during the daytime. But after a few minutes, all is well and you'll soon be jamming out to the old school jukebox. You won't find any Touch Tunes here folks - yes, it still uses CDs (who would have imagined CDs would ever be considered old school?).  Here's the most important part of this review before I blather on with all of the interesting factoids:  If you learn nothing else this year, learn this my young Padawans: Many people say it's hard to find, so here's a tip - if you cross the railroad tracks on the access/frontage road, you have just passed it.  Turn right on the last street that you see right BEFORE you get to the tracks, and then take another right turn into the parking lot.  DON'T cross the railroad tracks!  There's a decent outdoor patio with plenty of picnic tables, and a few of them are shaded.  10 dollar minimum for using a credit card (pet peeve of mine).  Wi-Fi password \"cheapdr1nks\" all in lower case.  12 local and regional craft beers on tap (I counted).  They have about 30 brews in cans and bottles, most of them are from the ATX or at least regional.  The big name brews are only available in bottles and cans, not on tap.  It's a little pricey for a dive bar - pints of Thirsty Goat were 4.50  Full bar - liquor and eraythang!  Six TVs, and a large projector screen (yes I counted).  Yes, they do have food - I didn't partake, but they have tacos, a couple of salads, burgers, sammiches, and the usual bar appetizers.  Every one of the picnic tables on the patio has Cat's name carved in it (she's the current duchess but has fled the city, so it won't last long. Get out there and claim it boys and girls).  Rumor has it that this picnic table vandalism is why she had to leave the ATX, but who knows the real truth?"

It's not expensive at all, so it's really not upsetting. Just a funny thing I noticed. You're charged for condiments and celery. When you're paying 75 cents for wings and cheap drinks, it's a drop in the bucket.   The patio is great and so lively. It is fairly busy. I would even suggest getting there as early as possible because parking is limited. There is a weird gravelly lot for overflow parking, but I have a little sedan and not a 4-wheeler to get over the ditch that is there.  They do allow smoking outside, so if you're sensitive to that then the patio is not for you. At first it bothered me, but had a great time catching up with friends and eating up those wings!"

Its divey dark spot with plenty of room to chill and hang out. The bartenders were cute, funny and poured some very nice drinks. The long island is only 6 bucks and they had a host of cheap drinks but thats what we were drinking. Now...onto the fooood.  The wings...wangs...were delicious! I got the spicy BBQ and my friend got lemon pepper both well done (I hate a soggy wing). The only downside is that for 7 bucks you only get like 5...well damn! However I saw that they have a wing special every wednesday for like 25 cents or something like that so don't quote me.  Will have to come back on a wednesday."

I enjoyed the look and feel of the place and the cheap booze. My only gripe is that it is on the North side of Austin for me.   I will note that my husband and I ordered the nachos here. I wasn't impressed with them but honestly you don't come here for the food. You come here for booze and maybe the people if you are feeling up to it."

                "description": "So we are in Austin for a family holiday because daughter #2 has a home 4x the size of ours (for the same amount of money!) But I digress...  Daughter #1 is here, too. She once lived in in Austin for a minute; but that was five years ago and so much has changed since then.   She asked to go somewhere quintessentially Austin. Not much of that left, especially in the northern parts, but we researched a bit and came up with The Hideout Pub.   Only juke box music during our visit, so not sure if they ever have live music, which we were hoping for. Regardless, the drinks were good and CHEAP. I mean $5.50 for a Moscow Mule cheap. And that's not even Happy Hour price.   We also had burgers. The Austin burger, ($13) with grilled onions, mushrooms and goat cheese, to which I added the sweet and delicious Moonshine BBQ sauce. Big burgers that come with fries, onion rings, tater tots, salad or chips and salsa. I got the onion rings, she ordered the tots. Both delicious. We couldn't finish our meals and brought half of it home.   Atmosphere is strictly dive bar. Love it! But not \"biker bar\" as I saw it described somewhere. Dark, low lighting, neon, plain seating, wood floors, tv screens all around. There's also an outdoor, multilevel seating area.   Our server was as sweet as pie, with a faint cute accent to boot. Mixed crowd, mostly keeping to themselves.   New neighborhood if this was my permanent neighborhood."

These burgers are better than any other burger place I've had in Austin, and that includes P Terry's, Shake Shack, In N Out, Dirty Martins (does that still exist?), and scattered places here and there.  I got the hideout burger, and waffle fries.  Those FRIES!!! My goodness, my mouth is watering at the thought of them again.   This place truly is tucked away - making the name completely fitting.

So far I've had burgers, grilled chicken sandwiches, and fish-and-chips that were all above average for dive bar fare. Well-made drinks and a good selection of beer round things out.   Plenty of TVs tuned to different games as well as non-sports stuff, so everyone has a corner to gravitate towards if they wish. Servers are smart, friendly, and efficient.  I'd be here more often if they welcomed dogs in their outdoor area, but aside from that gripe there's not too much to find fault with here... cheers, and see you there!"

I always ask for extra crispy and they did not disappoint. We also got a burger with fries and onion rings. Burger was great but huge. The onion rings were so crispy; probably close to the best I've ever had. The place is really dark and play some questionable and loud music though. They do have a large outdoor patio that gets kind of busy when it's warm but there's usually always somewhere to sit! I definitely recommend this place, it's a great option to the trendy touristy places that are all around Austin. True neighborhood bar."

I ordered a specialty margarita on the rocks and it was just ok.  The table ordered the chicken fajitas, enchiladas and carnitas plate. The fajitas were overcooked and dry. The edges were burnt and the onions and peppers were sliced way too thin and were over cooked as well. The portion was very small from my last visit, but shrinkflation huh?? The enchiladas were very good and the carnitas were the favorite. The charro beans were awesome. The rice was bland and one dimensional and the street corn was overly sweet. The salsa was flavorful but at least one needs a little more heat. The restaurant itself is really cool and clean. I will definitely go back but on a different night maybe try a different dish and drink"

We got a reservation a little earlier than normal so we could take in the Christmas lights on the nearby Georgetown square.  Paige was our server and she did a great job. She was very attentive but didn't rush us. We started with chips and salsa, followed closely by the queso flameato, gooey and yummy .  Our meals included tortilla soup, shrimp chili relleno, street tacos and one of the special plates. Needless to say we waddled out... Our experiences in the past were a little inconsistent but this time they were right on point. Looked like there were enough employees to take care of the good crowd they had. It was fairly noisy though. Lots of families and groups.  Thanks Paige, keep up the good work! As I'm prone to say when it's appropriate, this is a repeater! Happy Holidays fellow Yelpers!"

I liked the Brussels sprouts and the chocolate cake, but why would I go to a Mexican restaurant for those?  I liked our waitress a lot, as we were a big party and she did her best.

Seating was quick for a party of three on a Wednesday night. They do take reservations so keep that in mind if you have a larger party.    ORDER  Chicken Flautas (start) Nachos (cut) Chips and Salsa (bench) Tres Leches   Food Flautas were good as were the chips and salsa. Nachos were surprising as the toppings were added to the chips and they're not the style where you can dip the chips. Not the style I'm used to but could be good for anyone trying to portion control.   Overall This would be a great place to take your out-of-town visitors because the service is good and the setting. I'd come back again and check out the bar area."

My favorite part about this restaurant is the outdoor seating and ambiance. It's relaxing, quiet shaded, and you can see the water below.   The service has always been pretty good, no complaints there.   The food is very good and the drinks too, their cucumber/jalapeno margaritas are perrrrfecccct.   I agree with many of the other reviews, it's much pricier than its competitors for very comparable tasting food. Post covid, you even have to pay for chips and salsa- which is unusual at a mexican restaurant."

The food chronically lacked salt, seasoning or any interesting edge to it. Can you say \"Food for the old folks home\"?  But last week a friend of mine said to try again. said it had greatly improved, so I took his word for it and reluctantly went in....and can say that I was glad that I did.  They started us off with chips and salsa. Both the green (especially this one) and the red salsas were excellent and actually spicy, thank God.   We also ordered queso flameado with shrimp and chicken tortilla soup, both packed with flavor and quality ingredients.  The guacamole the we got was passable. Not as horrifically bland as is used to be BUT still needs a healthy dose of lime juice and salt which we ordered with it. Even or waiter said that it always needs more lime and salt, so, hey,just fix it already.  Everything else was also very nice, like the great seating outside and the bar drinks. I can see that they finally got some cooks that know this type of food and I am very happy about it. I WILL definitely be back.  My suggestion. You guys are finally on a roll regarding a more authentic taste. Don't rest yet!  You are only a few bold menu changes from being something truly great!"

We started with chips and salsa as well as queso and one of the monthly special cocktails, the smoky jalapeño margarita. We also enjoyed the aqua Fruita non alcoholic beverage as well. Between the 5 of us, we sampled several dinner options including the street tacos, the enchiladas, and the relleno. They were all spectacular and even though I had no space in my tummy to finish it all, I couldn't stop.   Ryan, our server, made the experience even more special. I can always tell if a server is being nice to get a tip, which I can understand, but Ryan was honestly genuine and engaging without being intrusive.   The restaurant itself is beautiful with a generous deck that provides ample room to dine outdoors.   We will be back, sooner rather than later as I am already craving more Chile rellenos. You won't be disappointed!!"

                "description": "I spent the weekend in Austin to enjoy the holiday experiences that they have to offer. After a long day of exploring my boyfriend and I stopped in for an early dinner. Pleasant atmosphere and friendly staff. My boyfriend ordered the bbq ribs which came out absolutely perfect and delicious. I on the other hand orders the chicken parm which came out extra charred however not wanting to be a pest I didn't complain and decided to just work around it. The manager and the server were amazing and even tho I didn't complain they removed the charge for my entree. Overall the restaurant has a great vibe, very clean and the staff are extremely professional. I would most definitely come here again... for a less charred entree of course"

                "description": "Currently writing with one button of my jeans undone - Doc B's food has me full to the brim.   Not usually a big American-food person but I was curious why this place was so well-rated and wanted to try it for myself.   I asked the server to let me know what are the best things on the menu. She was very familiar with the restaurants' offerings and she killed it with her recommendations. Here's what we got:   For appetizers, Housemade Guac and Oven-roasted Wings are must-gets. The Guac is great because the chips are unique: baked sweet potato chips! I could munch on these all night. Thankfully, the Oven-Roasted Wings stole my attention as soon as it landed on my table. Best. Wings. The Chimichurri sauce is addicting!   For mains, our server mentioned that the West Coast Steak Sandwich is the best. One bite in, I wholeheartedly trusted her. It's cooked to perfection and the bed of greens helps to cut the fattiness of the meat. The Chimichurri Steak was also pretty good but the steak on the West Coast Steak Sandwich was better. The fries were well-seasoned, perfectly thin, and crispy. Oh, we also threw in a Brussel Sprouts Salad, which was needed to balance the heavy meal.   - Our server was knowledgeable about the menu (+1) - Everything came out so quickly, I think in less than 20 minutes (+1) - Our server's recommendations were spot on and the food was great (+1, +1) - Very reasonably-priced for how good this restaurant is (+1)   That's a solid 5-stars in my books. Highly recommend!  p.s. I dined at the bar to skip the wait, which was going to be 45 minutes (7:30 PM on a Wednesday night). Reservations are probably needed because of how busy the Domain gets."

                "description": "We were able to get a table right away and our server was really friendly, polite, and smiled a lot.  The food was good, but perhaps a tad overpriced.  I had the chicken parmesan and my husband had a wok bowl.  I felt my meal was good but it didn't wow me for the price.  My husband's meal was slightly oily.  The drinks were priced reasonably.  The decor and ambiance was really nice, and we sat outside which was roomy and cozy.  If back in the area, we'd probably stop in for drinks and maybe an appetizer, but I'm not so sure about paying the asking price for full meals again."

If you have not eaten here then it's a must. I stretched my neck out for what others were ordering and it all looked so yummy. I'll be a repeat customer for sure."

It's a nice gem at The Domain where no matter what mood you're in / the size of your group, there seems to be something for your appetite. Seriously generous portions of food, and I've not had anything bad yet (and I definitely try and order some variety from the menu when I do visit). Some of my favorites include Grilled Chicken Salad, Carnitas Sandwich, The Number Six (like an upscale Chik-fil-A sandwich!), Chicken Kebabs (enough food to share or have leftovers!), Crispy Jalapeño Potatoes (seriously dream about these!), Homemade Oreo Ice Cream (always go for the larger portion!). They take reservations, which I would recommend, especially on the weekends. The service is always friendly and attentive. It's got a good sized patio and my only complaint is the last time I was there, I had a patio reservation and they told me there were no tables (even though there clearly were, but were being \"held for other reservations\")."

We had a group of 15 out on the patio and it was so nice, open, and spacious. Our server was attentive and efficient, able to accommodate all of our various requests. We were corresponding with the manager, John, for the month leading up to the shower and he was so helpful, sending us pictures, answering any questions we had. He checked on us the day of as well and really took care of us. And of course the food was a hit, so delicious- highly recommend the candied bacon. We'll definitely be returning just to eat!"

                "description": "One of the places we went for my wife's birthday week. She had been hearing good things and saw great reviews, we went with another friend who also has a birthday in June.  The place was very nice, you had indoor and outdoor seating, the staff wore masks. We sat inside as it was hot, there is a parking garage, the purple one, right across the street so that was nice.  Service was great and fast. We started with some drinks and candied bacon and chips and Guac. The bacon was very good, agreed on by all three of us. The water did not come with ice which I found rather weird but maybe it's not but they keep it filled.  Our friend has the Cobb salad, Shana had the Turkey Burger, and I had Chicken. They both liked theirs, my fries were really good but unless you dipped the chicken in one of the sauces they brought it was pretty dry. Good flavor but dry.  The food was good, they raved about the chips but the guac was not as great as they were hoping. Overall it was good but not as good as many review make it sound, I admit I expect more when the food it more expensive and two of the three meals being good is great but while I am glad we went, not going to be on my normal rotation of places to go on date nights."

We started with the guacamole and sweet potato chips, which were to die for. I had the chicken Wok bowl with sweet and sour Thai sauce and it was very tasty. I did ask for sriracha to add because it wasn't spicy at all. For dessert we all split the Cinnamon Toast Crunch cheesecake, which was fantastic, although very rich. For the cocktails, I had the Crazy Beautiful, which was perfectly balanced with a little sweetness, nothing crazy. I look forward to going back!"

And one of the menu items that isn't listed on the menu or online is that they have a GF bun option! Much to my delight my meal was fabulous and fresh.

Man, Austin has definitely come a long way!! Doc B.'s stays packed because the food is delicious, they have just enough of a variety that it is not too overwhelming and they have great food options. I am a huge fan of their wok out bowls, the fried chicken sandwich, turkey burger with sweet potato fries and the brussel sprout salad with salmon. Recently, I tried the chimichurri wings and OMG....bomb! Beware, it has tons of garlic and while I love garlic, garlic does not love me, but for these wings, it's worth the night-long burps."

We have tried:  Triple Play - Served with guacamole, queso and salsa.  All three was great. The queso super creamy, the guacamole perfectly seasoned and the salsa was warm and not too spicy  Steak Salad - A large amount of steak lay on top of a freshly made salad - soo yummy  Beer Battered Fish and Chips - perfectly fried fish along side some seasoned French fries, cannot go wrong with this dish  Turkey Avocado Smash sandwich - Amazing sandwich and a must try  Blacked Fish tacos - There was pineapple in it which threw me off but otherwise, good tacos.  The fish was plentiful and you are served 3 large tacos with this dish along side some chips and that delicious salsa."

Takes 10 minutes for a server to acknowledge you and then after she takes your order, you don't see her for 20 minutes.  I like Twin Peaks, especially the one in Odessa, but the service at this one just sucks ass.  3rd times the charm, probably won't be coming back to this one  Edit: only reason I'm giving it one extra star is because the jalapeño vinaigrette is fucking good"

Recent server  took our order then closed us out as we were getting food ( she was changing sections) and told us someone else would take care of future drink orders which I was clear I would need.  No one ever came back so we left and watched  remainder of playoff football game down the street at a restaurant that wanted our business. Young lady at front desk seemed to think it was no big deal and dismissed it at common practice.  I'm pretty sure this happened to several others in our section as well."

(The girl at the front door (hostess) is crabby but no biggy.) the bartender is very good with staying on top of her customers needs. I do think there should be an employee bathroom because the gals have to hang out there and are in and out to maintenance their appearance, And as a customer it's not professional to go into a bathroom full of employees, whom are talking about customers, their hair and make up, their boyfriends etc. it makes me think that twin peaks doesn't value their employees enough to even provide them with a break/powder room."

I walked in after 10min only to find out they are out of all chicken wings and they are going to refund my order. Funny story is I only placed the order for 12pc of chicken wings and she failed to inform me right when I called to check in on my order. It would have been nice to give a customer call if you're out of something rather than giving false information and making me come all the way there."

They have a lot of specials during the weekdays, not too much during the weekend when we went though.  Clientele is varied...ranging from dudes by themselves to buddies watching the game to confederate flag t-shirt/jacket wearing fellas.   All in all, not as trashy as I was expecting and it was an interesting experience. The food was actually pretty decent so I may take out in the future but I don't think I'll be back to eat-in anytime soon."

This location provides consistently high quality from the food to the service, and now the environment has been upgraded!  I really enjoy the new look.  The restaurant is more open and some of the tables are cafeteria style which promotes a social atmosphere.  There are still individual tables though.  Hell I usually sit alone.  I just like seeing people having a good time.   There are some stunning as well as super nice servers here but it has pretty much always been that way since I've been coming here.    They offer a variety of food on the menu including healthy choices and a veggie burger that is just fantastic.  Best of all it won't break the bank...unless you go stupid on the tip.  P10 is down the street haha.  But the servers do seem to build rapport with repeat customers.  Overall if you haven't been here in awhile, it's worth another visit.  I suggest Friday during happy hour.  You're welcome!"

We arrived early to get good seating. We were informed upon arrival (PRIOR TO BEING SEATED) if we stayed past 8PM that we would be charged $5 for the fights. This is nice because we've been places where they try to up charge customers unexpectedly long after the fights have been on.   From the Hostess to our server (Jax) we were given excellent customer service. Watching the fights there was good and the food was even better! You can't go wrong with those burgers!!!   We had our child with us, and it was still a good experience, all the girls were soo sweet and kind to her and she loves the attention! We love coming here with our daughter because they always treat us kindly!  Still recommend!"

It was crazy packed on a Friday evening but they had plenty of seating indoors and outdoors!  We ordered the Foccacio cheese sticks (basil, mozzarella and goat cheese) - a hit for us when we ordered to go previously. We also tried something different which was the Monty. We also ordered a Caesar salad- pricey for a salad in my opinion but this is a good option if you feel like you need that balanced meal!  The Monty was the least of my favorite. We have stuck to ordering the Flying Garlic Pizza after our first visit and it never disappoints. It has become a must order for us and will continue to stay that way!"

                "description": "This is the worst experience I have had in awhile with management. To begin, with follow my pics.. I ordered a major tom (supreme pizza) with EXTRA sauce thru door dash. At 7:55 within a few min I received notification it was being picked up.  I call store to inquire how is that possible if it was freshly made. The store hung up on me. So, I worked w door dash who asked me to wait for delivery to see if there is a quality issue. I did just that, only to receive a pizza that was warm but based on the cheese amount, semi chilled veggies I knew I wasn't too off base when I had my reservations about it to begin with.  I call store - ask for manager, even though I know door dash will ultimately handle. However, I just wanted to know how you can make a pizza in 5 min and say its fresh. Manager says sorry for the hang up like she's singing to a tune of a tiny violin; then tells me they don't have base pizzas sitting around (kind of like Villa in the mall that adds toppings when u order). I ask why is there so much cheese then and no sauce. Clearly cheese is added and is already rubbered up. Short answer and ultimate answer from her was another unbelivable sorry and to work with door dash.   What's sad here..Villa Pizza (mall pizza) is better than this any day. And I'm kicking myself for not going with Salvation pizza instead. Aviator down south was awesome but this Parmer Lane site is lacking customer skills and good pizza."

                "description": "2nd favorite pizza in Austin!  I love pizza. If I were choosing my last meal it would be a toss up between pizza and beer or filet mignon and merlot (or Shiraz). I digress...pizza...it must have a great crust-never EVER soggy, a well-balanced sauce, and just the right amount of cheese. Lastly, the maker must not skimp on the chosen toppings.  Well done, Aviator! My friend and I shared the \"pizza of the day\", and it was fabulous (though I don't remember the name of it). The crust had that initial crunch followed by the perfect chewiness. We each had a light beer with hints of blueberry-um...yummy!  Aviator is new to this location, and still getting established, so it was dead inside. I suspect this will be a popular lunch place for nearby companies such as Apple, Oracle, etc. There is a huge outside play area for those of you who have kiddos-great for birthday parties.  I prefer quieter places, so it misses the mark for me regarding atmosphere. You can see the pizza makers through a glass window, and the kitchen appeared clean. There are ample choices of beer and lots of great food options too. I've been twice and suspect it will be a fav of mine. Give it a try. Let me know what you think."

                "description": "Currently writing this updated review in my car because for the 2nd time, my curbside pickup was messed up. My pickup time was 6:20 pm, and it's now 6:50 pm.  The 1st time I wrote off because I thought it was a fluke. Also, I know the staff is busy on a Saturday night and it's tough to find staffing these days during COVID. Maybe I'll try eating in store next time.   But cmon now, my wife is pissed off because I convinced her to get Aviator over another pizza shop. Well, whenever I get my order, I'll eat it in the doghouse when I get back."

                "description": "Yay, more pizza! I love pizza, and I feel like there's a lot of pizza places popping up in Austin over the years. So many options but I'm not sure if this will be high in my rotation of pizza places.   I do like the restaurant space. The outdoor area is nice and kid friendly with the playground. Aviator has a wide selection of beers (at least from what I could tell). I think the pizza is good but unfortunately I think there are better places for pizza. Weirdly, I think their normal pies (with red sauce) are kind of lackluster. I did enjoy their non-traditional pies. The chicken bacon ranch and the taco pizza were pretty great!"

                "description": "Today, I ordered a to-go order for pick-up so I could do yet ANOTHER lunch and learn... how much learning do I really need to do?????? I ordered two items: the caprese salad and the black olive and caprese pesto grinder.   Caprese-  Caprese salad is a simple Italian salad, made of sliced fresh  mozzarella, tomatoes, and sweet basil, seasoned with salt, olive oil, or  balsamic vinaigrette. This is a menu item that really can't be 'messed up'. It is simple and to the point. This caprese was accompanied by a side of vinaigrette.  Black Olive and caprese pesto grinder-  This item was unexpectedly good. This meatless Monday treat contained black olives, mozzarella, red onions, baby spinach, and a Roma tomato pesto base. This sandwich provided a balanced mixture of sweet (from the tomatoes and red onions) slightly sour (from the mozzarella) and earthy (from the pesto) bites. Although hearty in its contents, this sandwich was actually very light on the palate.   #supportlocal"

                "description": "Happy to see a local pizzeria that's in NW Austin and dare I say better than Pinthouse? Two 14 inch / Large pizzas are enough for 3-4 people which amounts to $50 approximately. Pricing is reasonable. Online ordering is straightforward and pick up time is 20-30 minutes after an order is placed. I noticed they had ample seating both indoors and outdoors.   Our personal favorites include: 1. Flying Garlic: Garlic butter base, fresh baby spinach, roasted garlic, grilled chicken, feta and crushed red peppers. 2. The Greek: Pesto base, kalamata olives, portobella mushrooms, artichoke, feta and fresh basil 3. Spinach and Artichoke: Red sauce base, fresh baby spinach, artichoke, and feta cheese.   Another pizza we tried was called \"South Austin\" (Red sauce base, prosciutto, goat cheese, wild arugula tossed in our home made honey balsamic wine vinaigrette) was also good but not as tasty as the other three.  The crust was the perfect level of crunchiness without being overly done. Toppings were all fresh and VERY generous. We came back a second time in the same week. It's that good."

                "description": "On this deliciously lazy Sunday, the darling husband and I knew that pizza was just the only thing that would do. Jersey Giant Pizza, he suggested? Quick, easy, cheap, and reliably tasty. Closed on Sundays, I lamented. DeSano's, I countered? His eyes lit up, but then I remembered that, although we adore DeSano Pizzeria Napoletana to bloody distraction, we should probably try something brand-new for a little variety...and for me to review! Why not? Enter Aviator Pizza and Drafthouse!  Local? Check! Solid reviews? Check. Hubby's a helicopter pilot and trying out this place is, therefore, too hard to resist? Check. Cute pizza names? Check. Yummy pictures? Check. Let's do this!   (Note: all three are takeout 9-inch pies with no mods, except for hubby's deletion of the green peppers on his Ground Control.)  The Greek: this one was my flavor profile to an ABSOLUTE T! It reminded me a bit of Joe's Pizza at Star Pizza in Houston, but better! A riotous feta, pesto, artichoke, basil, mushroom, and kalamata olive party on a crust! Hugely flavorful! This goes on the culinary Rolodex post-haste!    The Flying Garlic: very garlicky! Shocker, right? Lol! Well, we are garlic people, so we endorse this pie whole-heartedly! The buttery crust, the garlic cloves, and the feta were just unctuous!   Ground Control (minus green peppers): Hubby liked this, but he didn't super-love it. He kept snagging pieces of the Greek and the Flying Garlic. I asked him what his least favorite part was, and he said that it really wasn't fair to judge it on such a small pie. He wants to give it one more shot with a larger pizza! His theory is that small pizzas make the fillings hard to shine. Makes sense!   As I write this, though, he's literally humming Ground Control to Major Tom as he kicks back on the couch playing Call of Duty: Cold War with a warm and happy belly, so I consider this a solid win. We'll definitely be back soon to dine in! Thanks, Aviator!"

                "description": "I've passed by Aviator several times and finally decided to try it with a friend.  We came at 8pm and the place was fairly busy. Unfortunately, the ordering process itself was very confusing. You can either follow a bunch of arrows to the counter and order (with few menus available), or you can seat yourself and order through a QR code and have someone bring your food to you.  We chose to go to the counter and ordered two Bear King beers that had great flavor- we were allowed to sample before ordering which was a plus. There were 50+ beers/wines to choose from so endless options... you can opt for a flight too. We also ordered two small pizzas (BBQ Chicken and Spinach and Artichoke) that came out in ~10 minutes. The pizzas had a thicker crust and were DELICIOUS! I'd definitely order again.   There were plenty of picnic style tables inside and out, and the outdoor patio had beautiful string lights, a playground, umbrellas, and lots of open space. Parking is easy in and easy out, and the staff were friendly.  Overall, I'd recommend Aviator. Great quality pizza in North Austin."

I picked this place solely on my fellow yelpers reviews. They were spot on! I didn't go in as I was in a hurry and opted for curbside. I ordered both the Pepperoni and Basil pizza, as well As the grilled chicken bbq pizza. Both were amazing, especially the pepperoni basil. I now have my go to pizza place for my cheat day when I don't feel like driving all the way down to via 313, pieous, or home slice."

My husband and mom loved it but I felt they could do morr flavorwise with all the fun ingredients they had going on.

                "description": "This pizza was very good, but the curbside pick up did not go well. We ordered online a Major Tom, Thin crust cheese pizza, and two sides of ranch. I arrived a little after the estimated pick up time and waited a little over 10 minutes when a waitress came to our window and said they got one of the pizzas wrong and had to remake it. We ended up waiting another 15-20 minutes. Finally we received the pizzas, but they didn't not bring our ranch, which did cost extra so I asked if we could get those. The waitress was obviously annoyed by our request and went to get the then which took another 5 minutes. Pizza was cold by the time we arrived home. Pizza was still very good, but the thin crust was very oddly cut. I would not recommend ordering curbside or online"

After two other parties got their pizza before us after we were first I finally went to the front and complained. My pizza was on the side in a Togo box just sitting there. I said um is that mine cold just sitting there? The girl said oh I'm not sure sorry.    I was also charged a crazy amount for two small pizzas that a five year old could have made better. Don't go here. First and last time for me."

Food is what knocks this down a bit. I got the biscuits and gravy which was wayyyy to much biscuit for the amount of gravy given. Getting the chicken added is a must.   The carnitas poutine was super salty. I get that both things are meant to be like that, but this was just too much. I wish there was more pickled onions and jalapeños to balance it out.   The happy hour menu and times looked pretty good, so I'd definitely return to try that out."

My evening began with the Ancho Margarita.   Unlike some places this chili inspired drink isn't like drinking hot pepper juice and is delicious.    The fried cheese curds with ranch dressing were tasty but nothing particularly gourmet as a novice home cook could prepare this with the same results.     The disappointment came with the main meal.  The French fries were cold.   From our vantage point we could watch the kitchen workers.  They kept a big bowl of French fries that the kitchen leader would use to place portions on out going plates.   They rarely sitting it under a heat lamp, so they were cold and unmemorable.   This is probably the easiest and cheapest thing on the menu to prepare well.  The rest of the meal was perfectly ok, but noting that stuck out as particularly special.    The ambiance is nice, but extremely loud when there's a full house so you have to raise your voice to be heard across the table."

Reuben was good, with nicely salted corned beef and delicious German slaw. Pimento burger was too rich for my taste. Service was good. Overall experience was good.

This is the kind of place I would come to for dinner but I wouldn't bring anyone here to impress them or to treat them. I only say that because the impression of this place I got from the ambiance and the menu was that I would be in for a stellar meal. I ordered the Brie Burger believing the brie and the flavor profile would offer pizzaz but I was not razzle dazzled. It was just the feel of eating a better than average burger.  The carnitas poutine got me a little eager to taste more flavors as I had that to start.  It could have rivaled a couple of poutine offerings that I've had in Montréal aka the poutine capital of the world (sorry Quebec City).  I am happy that all the greens were fresh to round out the meals well.  I felt like portions and servings were well balanced.  If I lived in the area, I'd dine here again."

However everything was cooked nicely apart from the bacon. It was a little bit too charred for my taste. Potatoes were tasty, eggs standard, and the rye bread tasted more like a sour dough.

Good atmosphere for either friends' hangout or romantic outing. We had a great time there and will definitely recommend it! We arrived after 9 and could take advantage of their reverse happy hour. We were surprised how small our check was!"

                "description": "Came here for brunch after church on Sunday. I must shout out Henry because his service was awesome. He was personable, friendly and efficient. His service gets 5 stars (and we made sure his tip showed it). We started with the bacon beignets which were not really like beignets. They were crispy on the outside and more like cake donuts on the inside. Only got like two pieces of bacon in the whole serving.  The food came to the table very room temperature. My father had to send his biscuits and gravy back to reheat (no one wants congealed gravy). My mom and I got the boring breakfast plate. I asked for my eggs over medium and they definitely came fried hard. Also the house cured bacon was bland and extremely dry. My Aunt's chicken cacciatore pasta tasted good and we liked the strawberry pancake we ordered for the table a lot.  Overall, service was the highlight but the brunch options are not worth a second visit."

The service was really good (and timely/efficient) and we enjoyed the covered seating outside. They had a great beer/cocktail/wine selection and had several drafts i had never seen before. The chicken and waffles were really strong, and the chicken was almost like hot chicken which was a pleasant surprise and carried the dish but no complaints there. The carnitas poutine and the Cubano were certainly enjoyed as well"

                "description": "Oasthouse has been my periodic GrubHub treat when my standbys on another delivery service aren't available for several months. What more does one need in life when brie pimento burgers and coffee rubbed carrots with green peppercorn ranch are on the menu? I don't even mind that my average order for one meal is at least 35-40.00 with delivery. Sometimes it's just worth it for something so yummy.   I was excited tonight to share an Oasthouse experience with my daughter and was pretty disappointed at both a mediocre meal and pettiness on my bill. Even though I was happy to spend the 45.00 plus 20.00 delivery charges and tip to reward ourselves after a strenuous and stressful day of work, I felt shortchanged pretty quick when I couldn't even see the pimento on my burger, got an overly dry bun and was charged 2.00 after the fact for some perceived \"extra\" change to my order.   Whether this was an upcharge because they were out of mashed potatoes (usually substituted for fries since I'm gluten free) and gave me the more expensive brussels sprouts. Or maybe they changed me for the extra pimento I always ask for (#swoon) but didn't get. Since they didn't say what it was for I'm left wondering.   All in all, my highly anticipated Oasthouse indulgence fell kind of flat on a day when I really needed it. I guess nobody's perfect."

Cool atmosphere and decent prices for food and drinks. We ordered 2 carafes of mimosas for only $8 each, which I thought was a great deal. They bring out your champagne and orange juice in separate carafes so you can measure out how much you personally want of each, which I appreciated.   I was not blown away by the food, but everything we ordered was still solid. Two of us ordered the all day breakfast plate that came with eggs, uncured bacon, a slice of toast, and breakfast potatoes. Everything was good, simply nothing stood out. The other two people in our party enjoyed their eggs Benedict and strawberries field salad. Good service and she stayed attentive the whole time we were there catching up. Overall, good experience."

He was able to give great suggestions for food and drinks. We've had the fried mushrooms (featured) and the Reuben egg rolls for appetizers which were both amazing! For entrees we've had the chicken schnitzel, cheesy meatball sub (featured), and the strawberry fields salad which were really tasty. My personal favorite is the chicken schnitzel. Other reviews mention the drinks being so-so but every drink I've gotten has been quality with the alcohol. The hotter melon was recommended by Henry and was very refreshing. We plan to be back and would recommend!"

I love that the juice and alcohol are separate so you can adjust to your liking. I had the strawberry greens salad with chicken and it was refreshing and delicious.  I would recommend for a chill brunch spot on a Saturday! Not too crowded at all and we were seated right away at 11:30. Our server Kayla was great! Service was prompt and they easily made us a mocktail for our non-drinking guest! Will be back next time I come to Austin. :)"

                "description": "My husband and I were, once again, delighted with the delicious food and competent service via Megan at a the Oasthouse Kitchen.  I ordered the Truffled Prosciutto Bruschetta, consisting of creamy truffled ricotta, argula, mission figs and local honey topped by a generous dollop of prosciutto.  It was a dreamy combo of textures and flavors.  On the side I had the seasonal tomato soup, thick and creamy.  My husband was briefly disappointed when Megan reported that the ribs were sold out.  However, she recommended the Wagu steak and frites.  The steak arrived warm and beautifully sliced with a giant side of shoestring fries, delicate and just fried to perfection.  We topped off the meal by splitting a peach crumble adorned with vanilla bean ice cream - a desert to die for."

I would give it 5 stars but I can't bc of all the smoking. I smelled like cigarettes when we left after about 2 hours, and no one in my party smoked. This was my first (and unfortunately last) time here, so I was unaware.   Know b4 you go: -Dogs allowed on patio -Smoking allowed -Bring your own food or order from next door   -Great waitstaff   Overall, I won't be back due to the cigs, but that's a personal preference of mine. If you don't mind smoking, this is a good bar."

Only minor rub is that the outside patio gets direct sun, which is going to be a bit of bitch in the dead of summer, but for now it's fine. Outdoor bar, plenty of screens.  \"Jukebox\" (fancy MP3 player is nice). Allows you to bump something that is playing that isn't quite to your liking. Drink prices are fair for sure considering most watering holes are serving watered down and overpriced cough syrup.  This place is clean and seems well kept. The manager is almost constantly walking the place and fixing things. They went out of there way to find me an outlet to charge my phone.   Note: Pet friendly even having a water bowl for your four legged family as needed. Just please mind the leash, one guys dropped his momentarily to grab a beer and his dog tore through the kitchen/bar area, it was hilarious."

To the juvenile waitress with an attitude: you're in customer service. That means you serve customers WITHOUT the massive chip on your shoulder. If you don't like your job, find something else to do, but DON'T take your mistakes out on your customers.  The waitress got our order wrong and pitched a massive attitude when we kindly asked her to fix it - it was a DIET COKE!!! Slammed the new drink on the table and didn't speak to us the rest of our stay there.  THEN denied it all when approached by my husband, who had to escalate the situation to a manager.

Heads up, you won't be playing on your phone past your first drink. It may as well be Cheers personified. Customers and staff alike are all so friendly and hilarious, you'll get roped into ridiculous convos and debates. It's inevitable. The staff (myself included) will adopt you as our own. 15/10 would recommend."

Bartenders aren't too worried about giving good customer service, and their drinks are pretty lame as well. Could easily get their \"cocktails\" at the Bombshells down the road, with more of a kick and better attentiveness and service. The only reason I'm not leaving 1 star instead of 2 is because they don't care if you're drunk- they'll keep serving you! Lmao and the board games are a nice touch!"

We went to see Ghostbusters Afterlife the Friday night after the premiere. Everything started out fine: we placed our drink and appetizer order before the show started. Got our mozzarella sticks and they were slightly underdone. Eh whatever, not a huge deal. Our beer and Bavarian Pretzel pizza were good, no complaints. However, the service not so much. On top of the fact our waitress took forever, she accused us of smoking in the theatre. I told her there was a vape cloud that came up on the row in front of us and I never saw anyone go talk to them. So maybe make sure you're accusing the right person next time. THEN our popcorn was burnt and we still got charged for it after letting them know. We'll keep going to Moviehouse in the future."

                "description": "My husband and I rented a theater for a special occasion during covid. It wasn't exactly cheap ($150 for the rental, plus tickets and food/drink separately) but we missed movie theaters so much that we sprung for it. It was definitely worth it. The Alamo crew took so many precautions before and during our stay that although I was very anxious about the rental at first, I was able to relax and enjoy the show. Like others have said, all movie theaters are surely suffering right now and we need to support Alamo so that they're here when the pandemic is over. I love this theater chain so much, it'd be devastating for me personally if they were to close."

                "description": "I'm torn between nostalgia and the elevated level of service (and price) other theatres are offering.  This is classic Alamo.  It's like rediscovering your first car.  Fixed bar-style eating surface in front of the fixed seats, no leg rests or fully reclining seats.  The service was GREAT, albeit we were intentionally at a TERRIBLE horror movie (The Turning) that had maybe 10 people in the cinema with us.  Still, an employee could slack in that situation and they did not.    The screen and sound were good.    There was no lounge in the theater that I saw to relax and have drinks before or after the movie.    And, after many visits to other theatres, it was unusual not to have a button to press for service.  Rather, you physically put your order card up on the table for a server to see when they come by.  I was really concerned about this because I knew how bad the movie was going to be early on and drinks were part of the plan!! lol  But in retrospect, maybe having to physically check on the patrons is what made the service so attentive (I got the drinks I needed to get through the picture -- thank you, Jesus).  So, obviously I'm torn.  It is a retro experience for me having experienced my first dine-in theater at an Alamo. I would go back here again in a heartbeat.  But it is like getting in a classic car and then realizing you actually like modern bucket seats and power steering.  At the same time that classic car was less expensive and still brings a smile to your face.  I'm going to rank based on the model Alamo built and on fulfilling my memories of great service...and I'm looking forward to going back again! :)"

This is our second time for a family party and they rock! 45 minutes before the movie they have crafts for the kids (seems like usually 3-4 stations) and then they have an interactive dance or activity at the front of the theater immediately before the movie. It makes the movie an event for the kids.   Now if I could somehow watch a movie I want to see while the kids watched their cartoon!"

                "description": "My wife and I attended the Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring 3:00 p.m. showing at Lakeline Alamo on Saturday, March 27. It was our first public outing since last year before Covid-19 struck. We were excited and nervous to venture out, but trusted Alamo's protocols.  We walk into the theater and there is just one guy there, sitting a couple rows from the projector, American flag bandana for a mask sitting around his neck not covering his face, scrolling on his phone. He makes a couple calls and talks loudly, checking on his insurance apparently. He continues to do it halfway through the movie previews. My wife and I are already annoyed. Not a good start.  The movie begins and the guy behind us has been quiet for 10 minutes. Things seem to be turning for the better. That is, until a short while into the movie when he starts making comments aloud. \"No!\" to Gandalf leaving Frodo. \"Asshole!\" to Saruman betraying Gandalf. I grit my teeth and exchange glances with my wife as it continues, both of us hoping it subsides.  Nope. The loud asshole decides to keep making his commentary like it's his own personal screening. I finally have had enough of it about an hour into the film and place an order card that read \"Please tell the guy behind us to stop talking! He keeps doing it!\" The server comes five minutes later, takes it and nods. She does nothing.  Another 30 minutes goes by. This guy's behavior continues. He even plays a video on his phone for all to hear at one point. He's all I can focus on now, my enjoyment of the movie totally ruined. I storm out of the theater determined to get someone to kick him out.  I find a young guy with a pony tail who is clearly a server. I plea my case that this guy needs to go. He seems to take my request seriously and I return, hoping the Alamo's well-known policy of kicking out disruptors will finally be used on this guy ruining our movie.  Well, that wasn't the case. 10, then 20 minutes go by. I didn't see anyone come into the theater to handle it. The pest behind us makes comments aloud less frequently, probably because my wife yelled at him to shut up at one point. While I couldn't blame her for taking it into her own hands, I wanted the Alamo staff to do something about it like I know they should.  In retrospect, maybe it wasn't a bad idea because nothing was done to kick him out as I requested. The movie nears its end and the guy shouts again. Finally, we hear someone behind us address him, apparently letting him off with a warning. After all he had done throughout the course of the film to ruin the movie for us, it was far too little, far too late.  Amazingly, it actually worked that someone talked to him. He shut up for the 10 minutes left in the movie and didn't say anything during the cast reunion piece that followed the credits. So had the staff addressed this nuisance earlier like I wanted, perhaps this outing would have been salvagable. Mind you, I first brought it to the attention of the staff an hour into a THREE HOUR MOVIE. They finally say something to him with only 10-15 minutes left. Completely unacceptable, if you ask me.  Our server tells us shortly after one of her staff finally talked to the guy that she told a manager and that she was sorry the loud patron was like this. He seems \"a little 'special,' you know what I mean?\" is what she says. Whether that's true or not is frankly irrelevant. You have a policy in place that you remind patrons every single time they visit your theaters. No talking, no texting. Problem with a loud table? Raise an order card and a staff member will address it, eventually asking them to leave without a refund. Had this policy been followed as outlined, he should have been given a warning an hour into the movie and then instructed to leave without a refund 30 minutes later when I pleaded to the staff to take care of it. Case closed. The way it was handled in reality was an absolute joke and insult.  We were happy to attend this screening as our first outing. Now, after this incident, we will no longer give Alamo our business."

Love to get there a half hour early and watch the pre-show entertainment. It's unique, nostalgic, and always funny. None of the advertisement bombardment you get at other theaters.   The food is always excellent   The 2x2 burger is my favorite and I've never been disappointed. It's a 5 star version of the Big Mac. The Colorado steak salad is also a regular favorite.   Drinks are always cold and the buttered popcorn with real butter is ridiculously delicious.   Awesome selection of adult beverages.   Love this place."

We were served pretty quickly. We loved the Pizza which was the Meat Pizza. It was hot and fresh. My wife was not a fan of the Chardonnay. My son thought his Pepperoni pizza was great and liked the Milkshake as well. We enjoyed the reserve seating. Just before the movie started we ordered some popcorn and a beer to split.   What cost them a star in my opinion was the Popcorn. It was really cold and without Salt or much Butter and taste like it was made at home. The main thing I like about the Movies is the Popcorn is always unbelievable. This was the opposite and was memorable for the worst reason. The other annoyance was the lack of under the table lighting when the bill arrived during the movie. I tried and quickly gave up so my wife finally figured out what we owed and paid in the dark. Not sure I have a fix just saying this is not good for older people with less then perfect night vision.  Definitely more to like than dislike here. We will be back."

We have been here a few times and love their food.    My favorite so far is the brisket banh mi and their potato salad. The brisket is smoked perfectly and the bread texture compliments the heartiness of the brisket well.  I love the fresh veggies they put in this!  The potato salad is hands down the best potato salad I have ever had at a restaurant. You have got to try this!!  We have ordered a few drinks in the past - they have a great Happy Hour.  You cant miss it - follow your nose to North Lamar and treat yourself."

                "description": "Smokin Beauty takes the best of both worlds by combining traditional Viet style of cooking with American BBQ to give you a fusion you didn't know you needed... until now. You can find items such as the:  - Brisket Bánh Mì: I enjoy the twist of smokey, fatty flavors from the brisket as well as the creamy cilantro and soy sauce that it comes with. The fries are amazing, too! $13.95 (4.5/5)  - Leaning Tower of Texas: a brunch special that is a stack of 3 hash browns, brisket, jalapeño cheddar sausage, pork belly, sambal hollandaise (sambal is like chile peppers), and bánh mì veggies - this is a lot more filling than it looks, I definitely would suggest you share it. I thought it was pretty good. $23.75 (4/5)  - Pho Queso: you read that right, they take veggie pho broth and mix it in with melted cheese to give you a unique take on queso. The pro here is that it's vegetarian friendly, but the con is that the flavor is a bit faint and I wish they would use a beef pho base instead. It's still good however! $7 (3.5/5)  Overall, this is a great spot to visit if you're craving BBQ, but also want to try something different. They have an outdoor patio if you prefer to sit outside. They also have awesome customer service and the prices are good too. With that said, I give them a 4.25/5."

                "description": "This place was everything I had hoped it would be. Now I just wish there was another one in Houston!  This Texas Tower looks intimidating but just roll up your sleeves, topple that thing over, and dive right in. The jalapeño sausage has some sneaky heat. Perfectly crispy hashbrowns with beautifully salted pork belly. Loved every bite.  We also shared the pork belly and brisket banh mi's and smokin fries. Most banh mi places we are quick to grab the Sriracha and Maggie's Sauce but not this time. It didn't even cross my mind until days after.  The brisket has the most amazing flavor and so moist. Almost a shame to lose it into anything else. But a perfect addition to any menu item.  Such warm and friendly owners and staff.   Parking was easy on a Sunday afternoon.  CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK FOR MORE!!!"

                "description": "I really wanted this to be a revolutionary experience. The concept is so cool, but their menu is a little repetitive and the food was just good. Not saying that this wasn't an awesome meal, but I really wanted it to be something to write home about. And it just wasn't.   The banh mi sandwiches were very dry but the meat was insanely tender, though   lacking a lot of flavor. The cost is a little higher but the portion sizes are large and generous.   The real show stopper here though, is the bbq sauce. It's the right mix of Asian flavors and classic bbq sweetness.   It's worth the visit to see this take on two fairly different cuisines mashed together. But don't expect to be wowed away. It doesn't scream fusion to me, it just seems like they took some of the most popular parts of each cuisine and put them separately on the plate."

                "description": "Smokin Beauty is a fusion restaurant that combines Vietnamese and BBQ cuisine. They have lots of indoor and outdoor seating. They even have live music on some weeknights. You order at the bar counter and take your number to the table, and they bring out your food out to you. We sat outside, but the service was slightly lacking as we had go back into the restaurant for multiple items like silverware and napkins. The meat tasted good, I would favor the pork belly over the brisket- the bread was hard and crispy for banh mi. I definitely would view them more as a BBQ joint versus Vietnamese, although they do have some interesting drinks with Viet twists. Overall, a good place to go especially if looking for late night food. They have they own private parking lot as well."

                "description": "Smokin Beauty fuses Texas barbecue with Vietnamese cuisine. I popped in for the Double Fantasy Bahn Mi (brisket and pork belly). Served on a crunchy, fresh baguette, the meats were perfectly smoked and flavorful, and the pickled vegetables were crisp and colorful. If you prefer a bit of added heat, ask for jalapeños and sriracha. I also tried the slaw which was fresh and bright with Asian flavors.  There is plenty of seating outside. The decor inside is plenty nice with dark wood decor. The restaurant sports a full bar. This is such a great little neighborhood spot."

There was no parking so had to park with my hazards on and had asked the bartender if she could bring it out to since I had my dog in my car, she said yes. I guess she forgot cause I walked in 20mins later to ask and it was there. Got home to eat my food and it was okay. Honestly tasted better the next day, but probably wouldn't go again with so many other options available."

Smokin Beauty is in the Vietnamese area of North Austin, and is a Vietnamese/BBQ hybrid.  They're a small place but have good outdoor seating and parking, and the weather this Friday night was perfect for eating and dancing.  The food: I ordered their brisket and pork belly salad with a creamy cilantro dressing.  The brisket had nice smoke and a good bark, and the pork belly was soft without being mushy or all fat, and really lightly flavored, showing off the meat.  Fresh, crisp veggies made it perfect  They also have Banh Mi on the menu, and a Viet BBQ plate with Texas BBQ and Viet vegetables."

I told her we always carry mail past the pits and always wanted to try it. I ordered the brisket banh mi with potato salad as well as an happy hour cocktail. My friend got a two meat plate with slaw and potato salad. The salad was incredible, we both agreed. He loved the pork belly so much!  For the price point, it was absolutely worth it! Discussing the passion Matt and Tao have for opening this business during a pandemic is inspiring nonetheless. Stop on by!"

                "description": "Delicious joint serving a unique combo of Vietnamese and traditional BBQ. I loved my experience here, the food was absolutely delicious and lots of interesting drinks to choose from as well. It's also not often you see a bbq place serve brunch on the weekends as well, I will definitely be back to try that.   Some must tries are definitely the brisket and the sausage. The brisket was incredibly fatty and tender with tons of smoky flavor. I loved the sausage as well, the bites of melted cheese in the middle were to die for.   The bahn mi sandwich was pretty good too, the fatty pork belly goes super well with pickled veggies and cilantro. The sides were great as well, I would recommend the slaw for sure.   If you're looking for some drinks I would recommend one of the mimosa carafes. $20 and you get a full bottle of champagne mixed in. We got the guava one but I would love to try lychee next time.   I definitely think bbq and Vietnamese are a match made in heaven and would highly recommend everyone try Smokin Beauty!"

                "description": "Smokin Beauty perfects Vietnamese flavor meets Texas bbq fusion food! I loved the concept from the start and my belly was happy with the results. My boyfriend and I shared the brisket banh mi with slaw as a side, as well as the Viet king meat plate with potato salad and fries. Also ordered the Vietnamese coffee at the end.   Definitely recommend the banh mi - the bread used has the perfect texture - soft and bursting with flavor on the inside and crusty bite on the outside. The brisket was yummy and the pork belly was absolutely unctuous! Def getting the pork belly banh mi next time. Although neither of us are usually huge sausage fans at bbq spots, this sausage was amazing. So flavorful and stood its ground against the brisket and pork belly!  Sides - all were awesome accompaniments. The fries were nice and crispy, the slaw was a refreshing reprieve from the rich meat, and the potato salad had a delicious Asian twist to it.  If I had to provide any feedback, I will note that there was a frozen fry in the mix of the other fries and was quite jarring to bite into lol. But it happens. Also thought the Vietnamese coffee was pretty pricey at $7 even though the rest of the meal was fairly priced.  Overall, I would recommend this spot and will be back!"

                "description": "We came here on their pop-up mini mart fundraiser for AMA and APA in March 2021. We were very excited to support a local vietnamese startup! All of their vendors were very sweet and they took pre-orders. Next time I go, I need to pre-order  everything was all gone by the time we got there. It starts at 12 and we got there at 130. If you want good parking, get there early!! I suggest taking a smaller car if you're a bad parker. Their parking lot situation is a nightmare for a horrible driver like me.   We ordered the Thai tea boba, Spinach dip, brisket banh mi, king burger, and double cheese brisket burger.   Boba: I know this isn't a boba shop, but I was quite disappointed in the size of the drink. It was basically half the size of a normal sweet tea drink. The drink was fresh. It was hot when it got to me. I had to stir it to make it cold. I usually get it served already mixed and cold. Their tapioca was cooked so well. Usually some places have dry and crunchy boba. Not here! Their boba is well cooked and is very gooey.  Spinach dip and fries: wowza! That tasted fresh. We looked at the spinach while eating and not all of the leaves were fully wilted. That's how you know that they didn't use frozen spinach! You can taste the spinach and the fries are very flavorful. I love the way that they seasoned everything. I might be completely wrong though   The food was amazing in general, but to call it fusion was a bit conflicting for us. We looked at the brisket banh mi and the coleslaw to need a little bit more tweaking. The coleslaw was quite runny and very liquidy. The banh mi needs more veggies. We weren't quite sure if it had the pate. If it did, it was easily overpowered by the brisket. We personally felt that it needed more vietnamese oomph. The french bread was on point though  We prefer the soft bread over the crunch. Other than the fusion part, that dish was DELICIOUS.   The other two meals were amazing. We loved everything about them. Burgers were cooked well and the buns were sooooo soft!   We are a vietnamese family and we love Smokin Beauty! We think you did a great job with the restaurant and are extremely excited about your future. We're definitely coming back in the future and becoming regulars. My brother has asked for us to come here on birthdays and introducing our parents to this place!"

                "description": "Vietnamese BBQ? Sure, why not? I liked the idea - pickled vegetables, baguettes and smoky meat is hard not to like. Definitely feels fushiony as there's the drink menu but also boba and vietnamese coffee, side dishes that champion more so counterparts to texas bbq. It's a unique cultural mishmash that you just need to try for yourself.  I got a viet style king plate to split and overall it's pretty good. It's definitely a lot of food that I think can be pretty easily split between two people. Brisket, hefty chunks of pork belly and a whole cheddar sausage, baguette chunks and two sides. I would recommend getting an extra side of baguette if you're splitting because you are a bit bread light otherwise. Overall, while each meat was good and smoky, they were all a tad bit on the dry side today. Of the three, I think the pork belly was the best. The sausage has some kick but not that much, with a thoroughly emulsified texture. The brisket has the bark and smoke ring but even the moist was a little dry by the time we got it. Maybe just an off night but it's not disappointing with the sauce.  The sides I think are the best part - the creamed spinach is on point and the fries are crisp, with some extra crunch factor that I love and is great textural contrast to all the tender meat and the spinach. The sauces (jalepeno ranch and bbq sauce) are good too."

                "description": "If you are looking for a Blood Bros equivalent and find yourself in Austin, you need to stop by and see Smokin Beauty. This is a marriage between Vietnamese and Texas BBQ that makes a lovely couple.  When we arrived we were really looking forward to trying the Banh Mi's, but after talking to the gal behind the counter we were definitely sold on getting the King plate. We reasoned it would be the same as getting a Banh mi, only it will be less bread yet virtually the same ingredients. That was fine with us since we were heading to a conference and didn't want to get weighed down. But this allowed us to get a real birds eye view of their style and taste, and also to sample all the meats- the brisket, cheese jalapeño sausage, and the pork belly. And oh my, when the King plate came out, we were quite impressed. The brisket is one of the moist and softest I've tasted. The pork belly was nicely charred,  yet amazingly soft and smoked so well. The jalapeño sausage was also good and had a great kick to it.   However the advantage of getting the king plate was the two sides, which included the smokin fries, where they put on generous helpings of brisket, cilantro, onion, and cheese. That was so incredibly good. Combine that with their bbq sauce and the creamy cilantro sauce, and both of these fuse together to really bring out the tastes or the meat. Would definitely recommend this place!"

                "description": "Smokin Beauty is a great example of combining two cuisines properly to make something fun and delicious.  We ordered pickup and the process was pretty smooth.  Online ordering is easy and you can see what orders are ahead of you and their status.  You tell them when you're at the restaurant, and they'll walk your order straight to your car.  Staff was great!  I ordered the King Banh Mi with a side of creamed spinach.  I also tried their Smokin Fries as well.  The meats are great, and while the King Banh Mi was a ton of meat, I felt that the sandwich it was a bit overloaded.  Eating it was messy and everything was falling apart.  Still would recommend it if you wanted to try all the meats at once.  Like most BBQ, the meats can get salty and heavy, but the sauces, carrots, and cucumbers offer a nice refreshing taste.  Between the meats, the brisket was my favorite.  It was very tender; the fibers easily separate as you pinch down on the meat.  It had a nice fattiness as well.  The Smokin fries come with the brisket, so I would definitely recommend those as well.  The fries didn't get soggy either, which was impressive.  The creamed spinach was also really good.  The spinach wasn't as pulverized as in normal creamed spinach, so you get a nice texture and slight bitterness from the leaves.  Would definitely get this again.  Smokin Beauty's menu has a wide variety of items, so can stop by a lot of times and still try new things.  Can't wait to be back."

There's an outdoor patio area with a smoker as well as an indoor area that's designed like a bar.  This place is self service so once you ordered your food, you'll need to get water and clean up after yourself.  Since it was my first time here, I got both the bellies and waffles for brunch as well as a brisket banh mi to save for dinner later.  The waffles is more like a funnel cake style dough and I love it!  My friend got the brisket hash and honestly, I wished I had gotten the brisket hash cause it was amazing!  The brisket banh mi was the best banh mi I've ever had.  I don't like traditional banh mi sandwiches cause they're normally cold and I don't like cold sandwiches.  The banh mis here are made with warm meat and toasted.  Even after I microwaved it later it still tasted amazing.  I can't wait to come back again and get another banh mi to go!"

                "description": "Went here with my family for dinner for the Thursday $15 special (Half-rack ribs or tri-tip steak + 2 sides + pizookie) around 7. It took around 30 minutes to get seated which was understandable since they were pretty understaffed. I got the house salad with blue cheese dressing and tomato bisque soup as my sides. Both were pretty tasty although nothing super special. Portion sizes were really great though and could've been enough for dinner for me without the steak. I would definitely recommend coming for the Thursday special if you're looking for a good deal!   My family only ate one of the pizookies and got the other three to go. Our server Elias was very thoughtful and packed the ice cream and the mousse in separate containers from the pizookies to prevent them from getting soggy. I appreciated Elias providing great service despite the restaurant being understaffed."

I wanted to call and make a reservation the recording directed me to an app. I installed the app and it tells me there are no restaurants near me when I live 2 1/2 miles from the nearest BJ's. I called the store to see if they would put me on the waitlist and they patently refused despite their app not working. Sorry BJ's, you don't get my money tonight!  That is shitty service!!"

The tables in the bat area were closed to open seating. Though I was able to sit at the bar proper and received very quick, courteous service from the bartender and food runners. The queso is pretty good and comes in a generous portion. They have good, in house beers, the Kolch style and Red are good. They also have a good domestic and international beer selection too. You might have a little more than usual delay being seated but thats the COVID after effects..."

                "description": "So underwhelming. First the waitress had a \"smart ass\" attitude when asked about the size of portions. I did not appreciate this. The entrees were all barely warm and cool to the touch. Within a few minutes we were eating cold food. The $17 Alfredo bowl was dry and cold. The garlic knot was cold. The hamburger was tasteless despite having fried jalapeños and chipotle Mayo. The meat needed seasoning. The fries, although tasty, were cold. The tea had a strange bitterness to it. They probably need to clean out their machine. The only thing palatable were the avocado egg rolls as I love the tamarind sauce. They were piping hot. We got 2 orders for a total of 12 costing $26. We should've stopped there. In the end the manager did comp the Alfredo but for high prices and below par food and service I'd say go elsewhere. BTW we loved BJ's when we lived in McAllen (this location was epic!) so this experience was very disappointing."

                "description": "Never again! It's been years since I last ate at BJs and now I remember why smh. This meal was horrible, if negative stars were possible that would be my rating. Ordered the \"slow roasted\" tri-tip and it was the toughest cut of meat I've ever encountered so this piece must have been \"rush roasted\". The overall flavor of the meat would have been pretty decent if the meat were actually edible. Also ordered the fettuccine alfredo, comes with chicken and broccoli. Not bad but oddly tastes exactly like a Marie Callendar's TV dinner so at this point I'm convinced they purchased a family size dinner, warmed it, placed in their own packaging then sprinkled some Parmesan on top. Normally, I'd just take the loss but in this case I want my money back, this is just unacceptable."

                "description": "I've always enjoyed BJ's until this past Christmas Eve. My mom and I decided to use BJs curbside for our Christmas Eve dinner, just some burgers and fries. Well, when we brought home our order we were without fries. Bad on us for not checking the order when it was delivered to our vehicle before we drove home. I called BJs to explain what happened. I fully realize that they were busy due to the Holiday. I understand the pressures restaurants face during these times. But, I was told to come back to get the fries, which by then our burgers would be cold. The gentleman on the phone, who I'm sure was just having a bad day because he wasn't to friendly or apologetic, then offered a refund. He took down my information but I've yet to be refunded. I basically spent $33 on two hamburgers from BJs. Very disappointing as this was our Christmas Eve dinner and I'm on such a tight budget as it is. Needless to say, I won't be dining or doing curbside with BJs any longer."

This week i decided to branch out and go to the round rock location opposed to the cedar park location...that was my first mistake. There was a long wait, no problem i understand and didn't mind. As soon as me and my acquaintance sat down, our waitress haley was there to serve us. My friend asked for a children's menu which the cedar park location always allows. Haley said no until we begged and told her the other location gives it to us no problem. She hesitantly gave in. i felt as though she did not respect my friend and i at all because of our age. Later at the time of payment my friend asked if they offer a military discount, normal question right? My friends father was in the navy, serving our country, fighting for our freedom, for 22 years. My friend has a valid military ID with her picture on it that she was ready to present. Instead our server haley, when presented with the question of weather or not they offer a military discount said in a very belittling tone \"your not in the military\" instead of saying that they don't offer the discount for family members. When i go out to eat anywhere i always leave a very large tip, well over 20% because i work in a restaurant and i know the servers depend on these tips for their livelihood. I feel as though haley was rude and didn't deserve a tip that was anymore than 20% though. The way she spoke to us was belittling and there was so much better ways she could have said these things to us."

The waiter had walked away right after dropping off food.  He didn't come back for several minutes.  When he did he took the stake.  He didn't come back w it for about ten min.  Our family had finished eating before the stake ever came back.   When it came back it was over done  They didn't take it off the bill.  No apologies.  We understand staffing may be an issue with all that is going on.  Until staffing is fixed?  I would avoid here.   This used to be one of my favorite places"

Proceeded to ask what our waitress recommended as an appetizer and she said she didn't recommend anything on the menu.

I went on Saturday at about 11:00 this place had about 10 girls 2 at the front talking while I'm waiting to get seated , which took (5 min) for the girls to even come back from where they were at . So I finally got to the both still not being serviced properly. I waited 30 minutes before I got up and went to the front and asked \" So IS ANYBODY GOING TO SERVICE ME\" ? Like why come to work if you're not going to work .  I usually come to this place every time I'm in town but tonight was my last ."

We we're seated finally. Then after about 10 min with no drink order taken from us, a waitress goes to a table where a gentleman was just seated, sat down with him and started taking his order. He wa seated righ next to us. We got up to leave and let the manager know why we were leaving and she acted like she could care less. Have never tried the restaurant out and I can assure you we never will. Good luck with business. You're gonna need it with the staff you have. Sorry I can't rate the food."

                "description": "It was a pretty pleasant Sunday evening for me. I got out of work after being positively complimented throughout the day, just feeling pretty damn fucking good today. I decided to take a nap, then of course decided to get food to celebrate my day. I went on to take a nice hot shower, freshened myself up, and went out for food.   Initially, I was planning on going to Cheddar's but that wait time there was way too long. We're talking 45 minutes. I haven't eaten all day by the way. You know what was close by though? Bombshells. What was the wait time? 5-10 minutes. I wondered why but I didn't question it. It's kind of like when you need to take a shit, and you're just hoping to go to a nice restroom. Anyway, I was pretty surprised.  There was a younger woman who was the waitress our table. First thing she asked was the drinks we wanted. \"Three waters please.\" I was then asked for my card right away which was fucking weird as shit as I didn't receive any food yet, nor did I get an order placed for food. I just sat there and started to ponder a bit. We get the waters but no offering of a straw for our waters, which I also thought was odd. Not really working out the way I'd like for my first time actually dining in.   NASCAR was on for a bit on the TV monitor screen, and then it changed to Women's soccer for the Summer Series (GO USA!). We finally get an order in. I ordered the Grilled Tilapia entree with Alfredo sauce smothered on, steamed broccoli, and Spicy Mac 'n' Cheese. The thing was that the poor waitress didn't even know that there was an option to top the tilapia with Alfredo sauce and shrimp. She mistook it that I wanted to do two different dishes. I'm just like, \"I can guarantee something will be wrong.\" I kept quiet for a bit because I was pretty annoyed.  The food comes out. No shrimp on my dish. Eh, fine. I proceeded to eat the food and it was pretty decent. I liked the Alfredo sauce a lot. The Spicy Mac 'n' Cheese was okay at best. The steamed broccoli was good. I noticed one thing the entire hour being there--I've never once was asked for a refill on my drink, nor were we properly catered to with the courtesy of asking how everything was during the feasting of the food. I'm now really annoyed and frustrated.   The more I noticed things, I observed other tables and waitresses actually having an interaction with each other. The waitress at my table could have given two fucks about my guests and I. Cold shoulder was given to us several times, with the same waitress kissing the asses of the table served behind me to patrons that came in after we did. She was also missing for extended periods of time.  Little did she know, I actually am a frequent high-tipping gentleman with a whole lot of damn money to blow. Sadly though, she dropped the ball highly. I guess it could have been the way I looked or the stereotype that I may not be worth the time to serve--who the hell knows? What I do know is that I was still nice enough to offer a 15% tip even after all of the shitty service provided. I was thinking about stiffing her but thought to myself, \"I think she is new, and they've probably thrown her to the wolves.\" Mind you, we had to let her know that the ticket was wrong. That shouldn't be something on our end to do but we did because we knew something was already wrong to begin with. First impressions are EVERYTHING, baby.  I'll make it known that having a pretty face ain't going to cut it in a face-to-face customer service field. That has to be backed up with a great demeanor, capability, efficiency, eagerness to perform on the job, and always a solid first impression. This young lady needs to be trained more, and I think it's at the fault of the actual restaurant not properly training staff that I'm seeing all of these shit reviews about the service alone. My ass got to experience that instead of the positive side.   I'm extremely disappointed and just hope Bombshells fixes their BS quickly. This restaurant can be more than just the typical chain, especially if it was better ran with its employees. I don't fault the waitress for not knowing better because for all I know--this can be her first serving gig. However, this spot missed the mark highly. Easily, I'm a customer that can bring numerous guests with me, ordering items on tickets of several hundreds of dollars a sitting quite easily. Not going to happen now after all of the mishaps this evening. I'd rather drink bleach.  .5 stars/5 Stars: Absolute abomination. I certainly doubt that I would ever come back to this spot. I would rather serve life in prison in Angola than come back to this spot."

Also the batter that the pickles were fried in was pretty gross. The chicken wings tasted like they were barely seasoned. Drea our server was awesome and had a lot of patience because I know the group I was with was definitely annoying. The bartender was also cool. The drinks snuck up on everyone because at first everybody thought they tasted watered down and then all of a sudden they felt it (lol). Overall we definitely would not go back it just wasn't worth it."

First of all I guess they didn't get the memo that we are in a pandemic since the rent a cops weren't wearing mask or enforcing the rule to   customers coming in and out of the establishment.  They were to worried about flirting with the waitresses.  I get it..they are kind of cute but come on..do your job!  Also there were about 9 of them working last night and only three were wearing their mask correct or even at all.  The bartender had hers around her neck the whole time while breathing directly over your food...smh..very disappointing. The wings themselves were okay but nothing to go back for.  I will be going to a place that the employees know how to actually wear a damn mask."

Got seated and literally waited there for 15 minutes and still no server. I walked down to where the kitchen was, poked my head in and said hey can we get a server for our table. A girl came by afterwards and asked did she(the unknown server) come by yet we said no. Five more minutes went by and my brother had to yell at a server to come over and serve us. She was nice enough to do it considering she wasn't are Initial server. We order all our stuff drinks and food at the same time. Btw the drinks were very weak tasted like juice and syrup. I ordered the Philly cheesesteak which was nothing to brag about. My brother told the server it was my moms birthday so she offered to buy her a shot. When it was bill time my brother asked for the manager to come over to explain why we had to wait so long and to at least cut the bill down for waiting so long. She said the birthday shot was considered the \"freebie\" and that she talked to the server and that was it. No apology no nothing . I will never visit this place again. They didn't deserve my money or time !"

First of all the service was terrible, it took about 30 minutes after we sat down to get someone to take our order. We had to go to the front and ask for a server because no one was attending to us. After that, it took another 15 minutes to get our drinks. After we ordered our food, that took another 30 minutes to come out and when it did come out, my food was missing. The waitress didn't say anything so I figured that they were still making it. Only after 15 more minutes passed by and the waitress finally came back did she ask where my food was to which I responded that I had no idea. She then went back to the kitchen and after about 15 more minutes, my food came out. While everyone was eating, they found that my nephews chicken was raw and we had to bring up that issue as well.   The manager ended up coming out and taking my food and my nephews food off the ticket but it was still a very terrible experience. I wouldn't recommend going here to anyone."

If you're looking for hard liquor, take a look a their selections. If you are looking for beer or wine, go somewhere else. They used to have a good stock of specialty, quality beer and wine. For example, they used to have a good selection of micro-brewery beers, but now storied brands like Pabst Blue Ribbon seem to be the taking up most of the shelf space. The quality of wines have slid as well. My last visit there a couple days ago for Rieslings resulted in looking through a selection of less than 10 choices, all of which I was unfamiliar. The recommendations by staff resulted in two bottles ... one of which had lovely hints of chemicals and gasoline (lots of TDN; obviously a late harvest grape that had decomposition of the veins within the grape) ... and the other bottle offered notes of cat pee ... absolutely disgusting cheap, creamy crap. MD 20/20 would be a step up. I'd like to support my local business, but I'm quite done ... no more ... I'll make the trip across town to Total Wine from now on."

The exact same bottle that always costs me $17.29 at Spec's cost me $25.97 here. That's $8.68 more...over 50% higher! How much are you willing to pay for convenience? Since my office is right near a Spec's, I will continue to plan ahead and enjoy the 33% savings. If you are willing to pay the \"convenience fee,\" I will say this store was nice inside (like a Twin Liquors) and the guy at the counter was very friendly. My only complaint is the prices, but that determines where I shop. I'm a frugal person."

I went in, picked up what I wanted and headed to the counter.  Once there I was questioned about a bottle of peach ciroc.  I told the guy I never touch any ciroc, but he insisted I did over and over again.  A few minutes later a few other fellas walked up to the counter and he realized he had made a mistake.  I would have been ok with this if it were not for the way the clerk presented himself and kepting insisting it was me who picked up the bottle.  I was being accused of stealing a bottle of liquor wearing shorts and a pull over sweat shirt.  Where I could of concealed the bottle is a mystery to me.  Once he realized he was wrong he made a weak apology and continued on.  I will never visit this store again!  Just unacceptable..."

It took 14 minutes from the time I ordered till the time it is ready even though they were very busy!  The quality of this pizza is amazing I was very very surprised they also have other items such as wings and whatnot.  I suggest if you're in the area it's a must have if you're in the mood for pizza."

The sauce has good flavor and it was delivered really fast. Very close to New York pizza but the crust is a little thicker! When it arrived, I was pleasantly surprised to see that it looked 10x better than the pizza in some of the other pictures. I think because my slices were jumbo, that they are a bit thinner than their other pizza (which I love)"

I like to make homemade pizza from time to time as well and always like trying new places. I told my husband I was tired of getting pizza from the same places and wanted something new. This restaurant has almost all good reviews and they tout being voted best pizza in Round Rock. I really don't understand why. We got two kinds of pizza and two appetizers. The pizza was undercooked and you could still see the shredded cheese which was not fully melted. Flavor and quality was not great either. Definitely not legit NY style pizza. The garlic knots have no noticeable taste of garlic due to all the other herbs they put on them. Service was fine, but disappointed based on how many people think this is the best pizza. Based on reading other reviews, I am Expecting a rebuttal from the owner in 3, 2, 1...."

Once the pizza arrived it was piping hot so hot that when we took one slice of pizza all the toppings started coming off.  So we let it cool down I love the crust I have to say it was very crunchy my kids enjoyed their pizza. The other thing I loved was the sauce yummy very fresh almost like home made.  The only thing I did not like about the philly cheese steak pizza was that it fell apart.  The pizza in general has a good amount of topping and ratio for each slice.  Overall not bad I may try something else next time but my kids pizza was good"

For $20, I felt that was a great deal. I did feel it was a little pricey to add extra toppings on the pizza. I ordered it from my house which was about 15 minutes away and when I arrived everything was ready to go and bagged up waiting for me. A guy brought it out to my car curbside and made sure I had a mask on, which I appreciated for his health and mine. Everything was still hot when I got home and the pizza and wings were devoured quickly. I ate the chicken caesar salad the next day and it was tasty and fresh as well. Would recommend trying this local pizza shop!"

One day my spouse and I walked in to dine in there and service was awesome. The polite, welcoming male told us to have a seat and they'd take our order. We came back days later(to dine in)  and the tables were dirty, it wasn't very busy btw. We sat down looked at the menu. 10 minutes pass and no one helped us AT ALL. they didn't talk to us, acknowledge us. So I went up to just order while everyone stood around. I'm not sure what the process is here ?? But they sure as heck weren't going to come to us.  Well, as I ordered I felt so uncomfortable and as if our presence was an inconvience. 2 other times during this SAME week ( separate days) i walked in to order pretty large orders for my kids final days of school. Similar service was given. No one bothers to greet you and one of the workers said he'd help us when he had a chance. Ok sure, yeah we waited. Lol no biggie I guess?   Long story short we enjoyed the food and spent a lot of money here in just one week but eh the service here convinced me not to come back. Good food, inconsistent rude staff simple as that."

On the day of the party, pick up went smoothly. Food was ready on time and they helped my husband bring the food out to the car. Of course the food was delicious and all the hot items were still hot. They even gifted my son a present for his birthday. A very thoughtful touch. Overall a great experience! Pizza Delight will continue to have my business."

Then when contacted they said they were too busy to replace it and refused to refund me. Well this place has lost all future business from me. Try to help the local pizza place and they obviously don't care about their customers.  Goodbye pizza delight, never again!   Update: I find it amusing that this establishment tries to blame their own internal issues on others instead of taking responsibility for bad customer service (see Pizza  delight comment below) We had no problem contacting the vendor. Let me be clear. It was Pizza Delight that delivered the pizza, not a 3rd party. It was Pizza Delight that refused to replace the Pizza(within a 50.00 order) because they said they were too busy and it was Pizza Delight that refused to provide a refund for the broken Pizza. Any local business that cannot take responsibility for poor customer service, is not the local business I choose to help in these current times. As for 3rd party vendors, it was that vendor that stepped up with a credit to my account since the local establishment refused."

                "description": "Came in on a Thursday, some aggressive lady with glasses and bun, answers the door with \"Do y'all have ID's?\" We said yea and showed ours, then she says \"So then talk to this dude at the door\"... I walk in and there's a table with some merchandise on it and this little man, asked if we were there for the event? I said \"we didn't know there was an event\" and then he said it was $25 per person... well we didn't know, we just came for a drink and some parents night out. So I said sorry and we excused ourselves and then this same lady at the front was smoking outside so I said \"Sorry, we didn't know it was an event\" and she snarkily says \"Yeah! it's dwarf wrestling!\" Like I should be ashamed of not knowing this. I feel stupid, my bad.... But maybe next time have a sign on the door! We read the entire door and no sign about this, a cover of $10-15 we would pay but we didn't want to do $25 per person, since we had not  arrived for the event. I think if you have an event, try being a bit nicer. Some people are not regulars and just want to come over and you could sell it a bit, instead of making us feel bad for not know about your poorly advertised event.  I still like this bar and I like that people can smoke in doors (although I'm not a smoker) we have enough bars we can go too and this one is for smokers, so I don't have an issue and I know what I'll smell like when I leave."

If that's not a problem for you, then you're in for a good time.   We came in on a Tuesday night and easily found a pool table to ourselves. We opened a tab and had no trouble getting drinks without having to leave our games. The mixed drinks are nothing to write home about, but we had an excellent time drinking and playing pool. We also easily played some table shuffle board. They have computer slots/keno games to gamble with in a shady corner is that's something you're into.   The place was acceptably clean and the staff were all very friendly. Just make sure you have a VALID drivers license regardless of your age! This was place was a good time and I'll definitely be back again in the future."

When I got home everything smelled like cigarettes. This is completely illegal and just downright nasty. Everybody knows secondhand cigarette smoke is really bad for you so open up a flipping window if you're gonna let people smoke. If you're too lazy to go outdoors to smoke then this place should be regulated by the health department better, this isn't your house, and no one saying you can't do something but it's just nasty and it's really bad for your health right now my throat is on fire because I've been breathing secondhand smoke I don't wanna sound like a whiner or entitled millennial but it secondhand smoke dude and it's nasty."

                "description": "Shooters been a great home for me for 14 years, it has been like my Cheers bar, after a stressful day of work, on my way home I stop in, staff is always friendly, I love the entertainment offered, Golden Tee, pool, sweepstakes, karaoke, bands on weekends. Staff has always been good to me over the years, and have been like family, met many current friends because of Shooters. Never a cover, and probably the best drink prices of any bar.  This place has great potential, but they need to make the best of some of its best assets, especially the use that beautiful patio more for events, music, etc. You should have a solo acoustic artist out there in spring/summer/fall and promote some games on the patio, it just seems as it's used as wasted space currently, and that's a shame."

                "description": "Stopped by with others for a quick pop as we were beered out from Whitestone's delicious Oktoberfest beer. Bartender was patient with us as we pondered our last cocktail of the day. Notice I said day not evening. We settled on shots (why not??!!). We all received generous pours at a reasonable price.   Shooters is a great sports bar with multiple TVS (they do have the NFL ticket). There are plenty of pool tables and games to keep you occupied. I would definitely come here to watch games but the cigarette smoke stench is too much for me, and I'm a cigar smoker. We visited for about 10 minutes and my clothes stunk of smoke. I wish they would go smokeless like their other venue on 620 or at least add some additional smoke eaters. If you are a smoker it is a 5 star joint... for others 3 makes it AOK and a fair rating."

There was only 2 of us. There's nothing posted about this. We were tipping the bartenders as we ordered. So on top of the $32 in tips we gave, we were forced to pay another $23 on our bill. They should have a notice if you plan on keeping your tab open, a gratuity is automatically added. Even for a party of 2. Ridiculous"

If you like to hook up with ugly fat chicks or wrinkly smokers, then this is the spot. The Best Western is walking distance, just in case you drank too much.  I don't know if they still do free pool on Monday nights. That's a good chance to work on your game and save a few bucks. But watch out for scumbags. The meth-heads tend to pour in on this night.  Every now and then there's a few tough guys, but every town has 'em."

So you go pay to get horrible service from him.   2. If you go gamble be prepared to share the machines with the workers as they are on their shift and serving you drinks as they have their machine on auto play and by that I've only seen one person dong this by the name of Desiree or Mrs Des for short.  Last time I saw her was a few weeks ago when I went after work to enjoy myself for a few drinks and even tho I go alone I do have friends there and she was so occupied playing and asking around if her machine was paying her a lady was complaining about how she hadn't give her her change back. It took her a long time to pay that lady back. It's not the first time I've seen her playing specially when it's slow but busy days won't stop her. Chris and her make a fabulous team as far as proving the worst service!!   3. Misty and the rest of the girls are the best workers there.   Too bad they lost me as a customer and will never spend one cent on that place ever again. Seeing employees playing as they work while others risk their hard worked money was the end of that. I already had enough with Chris being rude when you bother him because it seems that way. Good luck Shooters! This place has gone down hill since the past 6 months or so!!"

It's usually sooo loud inside the bar area/on their patio so this is the happy middle ground and don't have to scream to hear your friend speak.  I've honestly never tried their food because I'm usually not in the mood for dive bar food, but can speak to how great their variety of beers is. My personal favorite is the victory sour monkey."

Our server was part of a family of servers we learned from the youngest server. She was the older sister that helped with our order. She recommended a beer my wider really enjoyed.   Our food was very well prepared and was on point.   My wife was overheating after we ate and we were trying to find our server who seemed to be on a break. We literally waited 15 minutes before going inside to see if we could fine her. It appears like she had 2 tables inside and must of lost track of us outside.   All in all it was a great lunch and we would have loved to give it 5 stars but paying should not be the hardest part of going out to lunch."

There's a terrific beer selection, a lot of different seating options, and a fun glass floor.   There are a lot good food choices here.  The pretzel is massive, fish and chips crispy and flaky, and classic burger always cooked to specification.  The fried pickles have a great batter and the Guinness brownie is thick and chewy and comes with creamy ice cream.  Service is generally spot on, and they have done well when I've come in with a group."

Right from walking in it seems like this place gets really into soccer games, so I'm sure it'll be a hit when Austin FC starts playing.  Their draft selection is solid, even looking at their menu they have a good mix of several types of beers. Thought the bock type was a little funny, they also have sours, tripels, you name it. Got a Mcconaughaze, witty name, good ipa from Twisted X"

Food tastes dry and overcooked (INCLUDING THE PRETZEL). Cocktail ingredients are not portioned correctly, so expect your cocktails to taste different from each other. Drinks can be compared to Dave and Busters, which is a yikes considering this is a pub/bar."

                "description": "Starting with the positives, the beer selection was really excellent. I absolutely loved the Austin Eastciders cranberry cider, very refreshing and tart. My partner got the Sippin Pretty sour which was also delicious with some hints of guava. There were plenty of options for whatever kind of beer you like.   In terms of the food, that's were the stars got dropped. My shepherds pie was very ordinary, nothing special about it. The potatoes were pretty chunky and it felt pretty heavy with the cheese and sour cream. The salad was airplane quality, just some greens and tomatoes. This was also pretty overpriced even for the Domain, $16 for very average food.  The fish and chips was the superior entree. The fish was ginormous and crispy, albeit pretty greasy. Fries were sitting under the fish which made them go soft pretty quickly. The green beans were pretty crisp but it was so awkward to eat with the low quality plastic utensils. I understand it may be more sanitary to eat with during the pandemic, but they were those small, bendy, cheap utensils you get with takeout which made it pretty difficult to pick up the beans and fish.   Overall, go for the drinks and atmosphere. Plenty of TVs inside and in the patio and friendly servers. Skip the food!"

Tons of memories here with good friends, sitting outdoors drinking whiskey and smoking cigars, minus the cigars. The irish coffees to the wide selection of beers on tap, you'll never run out of new things to try. They've got a killer happy hour menu, if you catch them at the right time, you might be lucky enough to get the worlds biggest pretzel with cheese/honey mustard dip. It's like $5 and it's worth every cent. I love pretzels and this one ranks right up there at the top.   The outdoor section provides excellent seating for 'people watching', especially during the night when the Domain starts livening up with interesting sorts of people. Love Jack and Ginger's, one of the nicest bars in Austin."

I do not live there though. They said they would mail it and I would send shipping. I said okay amazing I will even pay for the hours of the employee and tip etc. Then just crickets. Their phone number doesn't work first, no working voicemail. They respond every few weeks saying \"still waiting on tracking\" even though they claimed to have mailed it 3 weeks ago. So yea, someone stole it. I spoke with a Candace from their venture group and she assured me it was sent..but, never got it. Crazy. They blocked me from facebook even. Pretty wild."

Not only did it take nearly 30 minutes for it to be ready (while other patrons who ordered food after me got their food before me) but I finally got my food by the bartender rudely flinging it in front of me on the bar... and then walked away. No \"here you are\" or anything. In a hope to support a business during this time I would have expected a little courtesy. Let alone when you are operating at less capacity. Yikes, unfortunately next time I will be taking my late night orders from somewhere else.   I did add a star because there was a second bartender who was friendly to other patrons, but I had not interacted with her."

I'm not someone who's trying to play as a victim here. I literally never had an issue with her until I was closing out my tab for the night where she proceeded to ask me what my F**king problem was! ...no joke! I mean completely out of nowhere.   I was so surprised by it that my initial reaction was to say\" its probably not the best time to to talk sh*t while I'm filling out the tip section\"  She proceeded to tell me how she \"doesn't want my tips \" and \"management would back her up on that! \"  The other bartender was great so I didn't feel I should punish her for this woman's actions. I tipped my standard 20%  and left a not so mature message on the recipe. Not my proudest moment.   Funny thing is I still have zero clue why she was upset. Maybe she mistakenly thought I was someone else??  Either way, I'm now conflicted if I should give them another shot as this interaction was completely uncalled for.   NOTE- if the manager or owner cares to look into it, I'm sure you can find the interaction at the very end of the night on your camera system 11/28/2020"

Their queso has beer in it, hence the name, which I thought made it taste funky. The burger patty was cooked to perfection. The bun was ok, better than some, and at least it was toasted. The pickles on the side also tasted funky but I couldn't tell if that was a sign they're \"higher end\" or cheaper than standard dill spears. My side of onion rings was the best part of the meal.

There were not a whole options in the specific area aside from burger joints and a Chili's. I stumbled upon this place on Yelp and I am glad I did. When you first walk in, it is very dark and gives you a dive bar feel, which is totally fine with me. After looking at the food menu, I wanted to try everything. We opted for the pear, fig and Brie pizza and the Ruben pizza. Both were probably some of the best pizzas we had had in a very long time. The bartender and the entire staff were very friendly, in fact a few people checked on us while we were sitting down. $5 doubles were a bonus. This place didn't disappoint."

First off, their mimosas are fire and I haven't found anywhere in the area who can make them nearly as good! Definitely better than most of the brunch places I go to expecting a killer mimosa.   Their prices are great and the food is pretty good. I dig their queso fries because the queso isn't thick, but I have seen reviews where people aren't the biggest fans. Their sandwiches are good and it's always a good time on sundays.   Everyone there is welcoming, no matter the team they're rooting for. Also, the reason they get five stars is because the service is amazing. They all work together and truly pay attention to the customer.   I advise anyone (eagles fan or not!) to check it out."

There is a group of hardcore cowboy fans that meet up on Sundays to watch the game organized by a guy named Dan (he's awesome).  The service was excellent. Room full of rowdy fans and our food/drinks were on point with flavor, price, and the time it took from ordering to receiving the food. Our waiter was great! Didn't catch his name, but he was fantastic.   I'm in love with Mister Tramps."

I always get weird about going to new bars but we walked in and the atmosphere is inviting the and staff just makes it that much better. Drinks are priced reasonably and the food was great.

They can only stream 2 games at once and even though I called before they couldn't do it.  So I still had to pay for a watered down drink that was made wrong and missed my game.    I also question whether or not their streaming is legal feeds for a bar."

I'll go to my regular spot where they have a great selection of $3 craft beer.  The food is priced well here, but not the beer.  I also wish it wasn't so sports bar like with the bad music. This area doesn't have any other bars that I know of, and I live nearby, but I don't like to visit this place much with the expensive beer and annoying music."

My friends also got lots of drinks and I didn't hear any complaints coming from them so....I think it's safe to say that it lives up to its reputation as a good pub/bar.   The entire location appears to be dedicated to a soccer team, but as a non-watcher, I can't really comment on that other than to say that they play multiple kinds of sports on the many tv screens, and they are always open to requests as well from what I've observed.   The staff is absolutely lovely and very good about checking in with you, getting orders correct, and being extra friendly. (Don't forget to tip your waitress/waiter!)   I've only ever been for the trivia, but I know they also offer stand-up and I'm sure they offer more on other nights of the week. Anyways, this is a cool place and I will definitely be a frequent attendee!"

It's right off 183 in the middle of an Asian food strip mall paradise. It is somehow Coors Light good old boy divey without being gross - the staff and most of the clientele are Young People and friendly. It's a notch above your typical sports bar.   Why they choose to have a whole menu of spectacularly mediocre bar food (yeah some soups and salads, although you're better off ordering a burger) is beyond me. They have fish and chips - lots of breading, fish cooked well, soggy fries; a melty chocolate brownie (that was frozen before); thin pizzas laden with a shitload of toppings. It's not really that good. I almost made this review three stars just because of the food. Please note they also have \"Italian Style Lasagna\" on their menu and I am so perplexed; are there other kinds?  So, in close, go for the drinks and the atmosphere; it's all neon and cheap. There are TVs. There's also a good amount of indoor and outdoor seating."

They do offer some pretty decent standard bar fare: wings (they state they're \"oven roasted, never fried\" and I am totally perplexed at how they get that outer crispy goodness), burgers (not huge but good), pizza (especially after midnight - see tip below) would be in my top three. This dive-ish joint also has some of the friendliest staff around and a great beer selection with awesome prices - including some local craft selections: Infamous, Stash, Thirsty Goat and more - over a dozen different selections of craft on tap at any given time, plus all of their bottle selections and other libations. There is always a shot special board, so be sure to check that out if it's your thang.  And, if you Bleed Blue like me, you will be thrilled to know this is Cowboys country y'all!!! How 'bout them Cowboys?! Fans gather by the masses to Mister Tramps on game day...there's even an entire large viewing room with three HUGE projection screens that is curtained off by what else but Dallas Cowboys curtains (they support other teams as well; maybe more than one set of curtains?). If you want to partake in the fandemonium get there early to procure a seat at one of the many communal tables.    Overall: Yay, I'm a fan...I'll be divin' in again real soon! ;) Cheers!  Tip: Order a pitcher of beer after midnight and you can buy a pizza for a buck - yup, one dolla! Full menu available every day until 2am."

You had a perfect blend of affordable high-end food and now,,,, wow you offer such exiting fare as chicken sandwiches?! How is this something anyone looks forward to? Such typical bar food.  I told all my neighbors this and they were shocked. GET BACK THE OLD RESTAURANT. Guys, *that's what made you special and memorable. Your bar isn't that exciting or enticing without it.. think about your Rock Rose Street competition. We were sooo sad to see these food items go. I hate to say it, but we will NEVER be back.

From the outside it looked like a sports bar and it was. When you enter you can order food from a full menu of mostly seafood cuisine. We just skipped this and headed straight to the bar where located right in the middle of this establishment.  This place has lots of flat screens showing a wide variety of sports entertainment. The beer choices was excellent and enjoyed the one I had. Staff were nice and tended to our needs very well.  Fun atmosphere where there was an adult birthday party going on here. Another nice design is very open to the outside even if sitting inside unless way in the back. We enjoyed it and next time pick something off the menu."

                "description": "Was in the mood for a late night meal and decided to hit the Domain for Lavaca's 30th Anniversary Party to grab a bite to eat. An absolutely phenomenal decision as the food was delicious! Neither of us ordered drinks (I was a little disappointed - didn't see any special anniversary drinks available!) but the food was great.   There are several locations for Lavaca Street Bar, but we visited this one because it's closest to my house. As it is also a bar, you will need to bring along an ID because they do card to enter. This location, as with the others, features both indoor and outdoor seating. We opted for a closet table because I'm on crutches so mobility and accessibility were a main focus. Be advised, you order at the front and they will bring your food to you, but you cannot order anything from your table. Instead, when you place the order they give you a numbered placard to place on the table of your choice.   In perusing through the menu, there were several items that caught my eye, but when I went up to order I noticed a special on blacked tuna tacos for the month...of course this was what I ended up selecting based on the recommendation of the cashier. WOW! My tacos arrived to the table deconstructed as they do not have any suitable corn (gluten free!) tortillas so I couldn't actually eat them as tacos. (This was not the hill I wanted to die on with my celiac disease) It was a beautiful display and they were delivered by the nicest man (super friendly, very accommodating, etc.) but I was quite disappointed that I was unable to enjoy them as tacos because of the tortilla situation.   Despite my disappointment in this....they were amazing!!! The seasoning/rub used to blacken the tuna was probably the best I've ever had and I absolutely have to try it on other meats as well. My friend ordered the chicken quesadillas and also loved it, but I think mine was better.    We came at a pretty busy time (I mean there was a party going on for goodness sake!) and our food was still on the table in the blink of an eye. I will say that this isn't the place to go if you expect to be waited on hand and foot, because this is not that type of establishment, but the service was stellar and entirely met my expectations.   The only reason I'm unable to give a 5 star is because I was unable to enjoy my meal as it was intended and I honestly can't believe they didn't have corn tortillas I could use instead. They did get creative in deconstructing it a d it was still beautiful and delicious, but I really wanted those tacos and I'm sure the tortilla would have changed the flavor as well. Hopefully next time they'll have something suitable as I definitely intend for there to be a next time!"

                "description": "FOR FLYRITE    I usually visit the location on 7th street bc my bf is obsessed with this place. We went to the location at the domain bc it's closer to his place and it was probably one of the worst meals I've had in a long time. I already took a risk going to the domain which is like a scene from Mad Max as it is (no one wears a mask and acts like they don't know what 6ft apart means)  We decided to redeem our free sandwich promo from the app. Both our meals were incorrect and the tater tots were soggy. No, it wasn't from waiting to get home. I snuck one out of the bag at the restaurant when my bf wasn't looking and already knew dinner was going to be a no go for me. But I gave it chance. I had a long day and waited to eat until I could have a nice dinner with my lovely partner. After a hangry drive home I popped open my little box of incorrect disappointment and was instantly sad that my food was wrong. I powered through about two bites to find a long overly dyed hair in my chicken sandwich :(. I was tired and ready to end my night that I just pounded down my tots which later gave me a stomach ache.   I felt a call to rectify my order was unwarranted since it was a free sandwich and I still wouldn't eat there again anyway. My bf loves this place and it's a shame that we won't share that experience again. Oh well, onto finding the next chicken sandwich."

                "description": "The food is delicious! However is super overpriced. We got a steak poboy, ceviche, and dozen Rockefeller oysters and it was well over $70 with tip... we haven't even ordered drinks yet which is a separate process. Bartenders are usually slow and talkative to people they know and who seem to also work there. The place itself is open, has tons of tvs, and dog friendly which is why we've continued to come back. I just wish we got better service for the prices we're paying."

Everything I have tried is incredible, but my absolute favorite is the ribeye nachos and cajun fried corn. The ribeye is charred just right and the nachos are covered with a layer of black beans and cheese that just speaks to the heart. Instant fulfillment! The dirty rice is amazing as is the fried porkchops - and I am from the south so I know my fried y'all!"

                "description": "I am a huge fan of Lavaca Street Bar food! However, I write this with the caveat that both times that I have eaten here I may or may not have been in a complete sober state of mind.  What I love are the HUGE portions! After a night (or day) of drinking, this place will satisfy! On our most recent outing, I got their chicken fried chicken special. It was definitely the best value on the menu. For $16, I got a huge piece of chicken, fries, side salad, and a side of gumbo. I was very happy. My friend spent $16 on boneless wings and all that he got was a pound of boneless wings. Probably equally filling, but I'm a girl who likes variety and they get you because to order a \"side\" of fries, which they claim is 1 lb of fries, costs $8. My husband got the shrimp po-boy, which also looked amazing and is big enough to share.  The downside is definitely the prices. Because normally their food doesn't come with sides, you'll pay $16 for an entree and then another $10+ for sides. I highly recommend taking a more family style approach when eating here so you can try a variety of foods without breaking the bank because honestly, their portions are very gigantic."

                "description": "We were hoping for the most amazing brunch buffet in the city today, but due to Covid concerns, they have taken the responsible approach to temporarily put it on hold. In the meantime, the full menu is offered. Nonetheless, we were attended to by Alfonso whom we discovered was as knowledgeable about the menu and beverages as he is passionate about the company. Their version of pimiento cheese is phenomenal. My fried pork chop was incredibly juicy, and Edwyn's salad was well thought out.  The new GM Josh stopped by to make sure everything was as it was supposed to be, which they certainly were. In a nutshell, this is an absolutely amazing place."

Our work group met for lunch today, there were 8 of us.  Most had not been.  Our server was on point.  Management was in the dining room backing the servers up.  The team worked together to take care of all guests.  The food was generous in portions, outstanding in quality, and delicious in taste.  I had the Fat Jack Burger.  It was perfect.  One of the best burgers I have had since coming to Texas.  It was not dry, prepared med rare, and had great flavor.  The bun was awesome.  Restrooms were spotless and smelled clean.  Good job, thank you.  I will be back.  Support local!!!"

                "description": "*Update*.....Jack Allen's Kitchen on Anderson Ln is my go to eatery for fresh comfort food. They were doing farm to table before it was a foody phrase. Everything on their menu is excellent! Burgers and fries, fish tacos, salads and chicken fried steak are some of my favorites. These guys get it!!! They don't overthink their food and make the dishes something they're not. I often say, \"Simplicity is best served warm with a side of sweet potato fries.\" If you feel this way, Jack's is for you. In short, they prepare recognizable dishes with fresh ingredients at a good price point. I highly recommend Jack Allen's Kitchen for your next comfort food.culinary excursion. You simply will not find better food for the money anywhere in Central Texas. Run, don't walk, to any of their locations for great food."

                "description": "We've been coming to Jack Allen's for their heavenly brunch for years now (hello, tomato basil pie!), and I'm beyond remiss to only be reviewing it now, when we're eating \"linner\" here for the first time! If my husband were a restaurant, he would be Jack Allen's. Classic. Stylish. Cool Cat Texan. 90's grunge rock comfortable. FYI that Jack also feeds Camp Mabry on the regular, so we're both definite fans! You'll never ever go wrong with their boozy Sunday brunch. Period.  But does that culinary wizardry extend to Sunday linner? Why, yes. Yes, it does!   Can I say straightaway that the Slow Braised Beef Barbacoa Enchiladas were slap yo mama yum? If you're in the market for southwestern comfort food, look no further! The slow braised beef was flawless, cheesy goodness! Diet food? No. Excellent food? Yes!  First things first, though! The House-Made Pimento Cheese with Flatbread Cracker amuse bouche was stupid good! If pimento cheese was on your childhood menu, like it absolutely was on mine, you'll find this starter profoundly soul-warming! We bought a mason jar full of the cheese to take home because como no?   The Crispy Chicken Lollipops appetizer was out of this world! Crispy sweet heat and the most tender chicken thighs on earth with a pile of Jack Slaw that we would buy by the pint! This would actually be a perfect entree size for me for next time! I'm filing this away!   The Chicken Fried Pork Chop is straight up Sunday dinner at Mom's! If your mom is a stellar chef, of course, which we all know that they all are, right? The masher and the gravy were a cashmere throw! Ridiculous! Just look at the picture, y'all! You. Will. Not. Be. Disappointed.   The drinks all go without saying! The chemists behind the bar are wicked good! My agave skinny cocktail was on point! I knocked back three. No judgement! Hubby's Moscow Mule was bracing and bright! He knocked back three! No judgement!   The Blondie pie? Best dessert ever! I really don't know what else to say about it! I'm without words, and my husband is currently apoplectic!   By the by, our server, Christian, was the pitch perfect Jack Allen guide! Jack Gilmore is lucky to have him! As were we!   p.s. We picked up the Jack Allen cookbook while we were there. Tomato Basil Pie, we shall bake you!"

We had the Barbacoa Stackers, guacamole, and catfish to start, and all of them were very tasty but not really great for splitting among a large group.  Didn't try dessert, and the drinks weren't bad just a little pricey to me. The entrees were lacking however, I split a plate of Chorizo Stuffed Pork Tenderloin, and Pesto-marinated Crab Stuffed Chicken. Both dishes were fine I guess, but both were light on flavor. There was barely any chorizo or crab in the respective dishes.  Short version, I'd recommend the appetizers, but that's about all."

The service is always good. The food is consistently good as well.  My only -1 is the food tends to be a little bland imo. Still good, just missing a kick, if that makes any sense. I've had many things off the menu now, chicken fried chicken, enchiladas, pasta, appetizers, etc. They're all good, but never my favorite. In fact part of the reason I've tried so many things is I'm looking for that ONE thing that makes me say \"let's go to Jack Allen's for dinner.\" But again, the food is good. I wouldn't hate on someone if they suggested we come here for dinner."

We did have reservations so we were promptly seated in Phoebe's section. Phoebe is an awesome Lead Waitress. She was bubbly, fresh, and friendly from the start. She was ready to answer any questions we may have had. Being and avid yelper, I had already skinmed that menu on the app from the passenger seat. We ordered the seafood crab dip as an appetizer. It left us wanting more.. the Ruby Trout I had was absolutely marvelous. The glaze, the light but complimentary seasonings are out of this world. Okay I'm blending my experiences because the food is that good.The 13 spice Blackened chicken pasta was OMG.. the pasta.. made FRESH in house, you could taste the freshness. I don't remember the last time I had such fresh pasta. The seasonings on the blackened chicken was good enough to have me slap everyone's mama. The julienne serranos as a nice presentation an the hot sauce recommendations from Phoebe didn't go unnoticed either. Can you tell I'm pleased? NEW FAVE."

I forgot pics, bit there's a dedicated dog area, not just at the seating just outside the front door but also across the parking lot with lots of shade, picnic tables, and a water station.  Our server, Luis, made our experience the best as he was willing to serve us across the way under the trees since things were slow.  His recommendation for salad dressing was cool too as we mixed 2 on our Southwest salad and that was awesome (cilantro and chipotle I think).  All in all, the pizza was good, and there is a dedicated brunch menu, which was unexpected as well.  We'll be back another time to try more things beyond pizza and to take pics."

The Zilker Love pizza had become its own food group in our home, and there are many vegetarian delights to delight, as well as craft beer and a fabulous brunch! The staff is thoughtful and diners tend to be very pleasant as well!  If you see Miss Sophia while visiting, please drop by and say hello!"

Plenty of unique pizzas and burgers, Austin Terrier focuses on new American taste, mixed with the old.   Vegans rejoice, as there is a pizza and burger for you. The Greenbelt Pizza (sub for vegan cheese) and the Impossible Burger are going to be your go-tos. What makes the Greenbelt Pizza great is the truffle oil, the fresh and plentiful arugula, topped with red onions and mushrooms.  Add the Trio of Fries (sub the truffle parm fries), and you have a perfect meal for two."

I had a pretty delicious sandwich with Brie and apples, and my boyfriend had a pizza.  The crust on the pizza was perfect and probably one of the best crusts I've had on a pizza in a long time.  My sandwich was just okay....I definitely ordered wrong.  I would love to go back and try some of their other menu items and enjoy a beverage from their extensive menu."

Our go to's are the Diablo burger (spicy) and green belt pizza (delicious) ... swap the cheese for goat and request both to be gluten free. PLUS they were quick to accommodate for my child's allergies. The server went to the back and snapped a photo of what goes into their crust/bun so that we didn't expose her to any tree nuts. We love this place so much!"

Went last night with my doggo to meet a friend with her doggo, and we had the funnest and best waiter named Chad! I got the chipotle chicken sandwich and it was phenomenal. We also got a platter of 3 diff kinds of fries that were accidentally ordered for us and he told us to keep them lol. Then he covered our drinks for us because of a long wait time that wasn't even a long wait time! The dogs all played and got treats and tons of love from the staff. My enormous Bulldog couldn't get back into my car at the end because he was tired and my fiancé wasn't there to help me so Chad helped me lift him into my car lol. Anyways this place is awesome! 5/5 recommend!"

Lots of beer, the TVs aren't loud, and cute Terrier art is on the walls. Dogs are welcome in the outside seating area.  There are a few vegetarian options, and I'm pretty sure they can be made vegan.  After coming here several times, I have to suggest ordering the Trio of Fries. Three different seasonings and three sauces let's you try a variety of flavors and fill up on carbs. That's absolutely my jam. It's great for sharing with 2-3 more people and gotta really well with a sandwich. The Toro is pretty good. It tastes fresh and is really satisfying."

The menu had some fun interesting choices.  The waiter was friendly and accommodating.  We ordered and boy were we surprised.  We LOVED every bite.  This was 3 days ago and my daughter is asking for us to go back as the pizza was SO good.    My turkey burger was full of flavor thanks to the grilled apples and brie - hint - sub out the pesto mayo and bacon for garlic mayo and avocado.  Gadzooks my mouth is watering at the thought.   My husband's burger was perfectly cooked.  Bacon and fried egg on a burger? Yes please!  A 5 star win for all of us.  We will see you again soon Austin Terrier folks, thank you!"

We sat outside on a cool February Saturday. They had heaters, but not enough to keep us warm.  We still enjoyed our food and our dogs enjoyed the free treats.  The table started with the  trio of fries. The sweet potato fries were the best of the three.  I had the zilker pizza with the wheat crust. It wasn't crispy, but it was tasty. The crust was pretty flavorful too. The pizza was big enough to share with one other person and we even had a slice left over.  Parking was easy and the service was good."

Especially since it's right down the street.  So i ordered a Diablo Burger which was soooo good.  My only complaint is that it's a bit pricey at $11 (since it doesn't include fries), but i will definitely order more from there as a treat!  Btw, if the online ordering isn't working, just call them and they'll take your payment over the phone so you can do a contactless pickup."

She's not friendly, never smile and short in words, never say nice things like thank you, have a nice day .....after we made the payment/pickup. She's cold and means! She will ask you to show your order on the phone if match with the bag that you are grabbing but the way she did not so friendly.   Others staff is perfect, they're professional and friendly.   Food is good especially the fish dish. Fries as well. Love the new drinks that they are selling on the fridge. But if you use delivery service it won't taste the same.   3 stars because of that Asian waitress, otherwise 5. If manager or owner read this, please consider this waitress. She doesn't have a service mind!! She should find a new job that fit her style. I used to come here at least once every two weeks also order through DoorDash for pickup and sometime delivery, but I hate to see that waitress, so I might stop all."

We had to wait just a couple of minutes because they were getting a big influx of guest - seems like some sort of dance show had just let out. Gary was our server and even though my favorite pasta has been discontinued (RIP blackened chicken pasta) and they were out of my second choice item (turkey burger) Gary had a great attitude and solid recommendations and solutions to keep the night on track. I ended up getting the half rack rib special with a beer that he recommended to pair and of course everyone was more than happy to share my pizooki. Give it a try, nice staff, quick service, solid food and open late."

I got mine with mustard, his was plain. I had a side of fries which were delicious and he had a side of the grilled honey sriracha brussel sprouts, which are awesome. Service was fair, and our server, Kelly, didn't split the check correctly, minus one star, and more than half the tables were closed despite having shields between them, minus one star. They have a great food and beer menu and we will definitely be back."

We've tried to eat here on three occasions in the past month, every time we walk in, maybe 1 in 4 tables is seated. Then they tell us it's going to be a 1-2 hour wait. I'm all about social distancing and being safe during these times but that's ridiculous. It's either bad management unable to staff the location or just an EXTREME overabundance of social distancing. We gave them two chances and the third time we're done. We'll just go ahead and drive to the next nearest one and get seated sooner. Every single couple/group that came in during the 5 minutes we spent there had the same appalled look on their face when they saw the place practically empty and an hour wait."

                "description": "BJ's was always one of my favorite restaurants, but not this location.  I ordered a family bundle meal directly from their website.  I got a call from the door dash driver a bit later and he said they had no record of my order.  I texted him a photo of my e-receipt and he showed the manager.  Apparently they didn't have the Shrimp Scampi -Tri-Tip Bundle I ordered at this particular restaurant so the order cancelled automatically and I got no notification from the restaurant.  The Door Dash driver had to cancel my order and he said someone from BJ's would be calling me.  They called and said they could have another bundle with a different item ready and cooked in about 15 minutes.  I said ok. that works.    30 minutes later I get a phone call asking when I was coming to pick up the order? I said I ordered delivery, not pick-up. He said, \"you have to order on our website to get delivery.\"  I told him I did the first time.  He just, \"Oh\".  So I said, \"So you are not going to deliver this?\" he said he couldn't.  So I just said refund my money and this is the last time I will be going to this store.    You would think that maybe a manager would have called back to apologize or something, but nothing.  I just hope I get my refund.    Good luck with this store!"

We arrived and then, found out that they had not taken that down reserve ahead of time option, so I reserved a seat for nothing, still waited about 40 minutes.  By the way, you have to be present to get on the waitlist like any other restaurant in town.  When it was time to be seated there probably 5 empty 2 top tables, and they were seating us next to a large party of 10!  Hello, can we move a few tables down?  So we picked another table and sat.  The host came and asked if we would like to move to a booth once it's cleaned as he pointed to the table, never were moved, and the original hostess that sat us brought our silverware and we assumed we were no longer moving.  Waited 15 minutes for our beer after waiting for our server.  Placed our order at 8:25 and got our food within 15-20 minutes, luckily!  By then, we were starving.  Be patient since all dining is lacking employees.  No pics to show since we woofed down our food!"

Kyla was kind, attentive, and accommodating. You can tell she is an extremely hard worker and earns every cent she makes.

They brought out the alfredo sauce separately when I asked and it was awful, probably straight out of a jar. The croutons in the salad were all burned. Both of the steaks we got were very tough and chewy, although the flavor was not bad on this. The chicken Parmesan had no seasoning. I'm not even exaggerating, I don't think there was anything on it, same with the broccoli that came with it, but the white cheddar mashed potatoes were good. They also brought out another incorrect item, which I wouldn't normally mention because when I pointed it out they did correct it, but I mention it because it just shows more how much of a mess the kitchen is. My server was very friendly and attentive, did not have an issue with service, just quality of food. This meal cost $100 and I'm cringing over it. I wouldn't recommend going and I don't see myself coming back, personally. Which is a bummer because I liked this place! Definitely should have just gone to Longhorn!"

My boyfriend (who has a darker skin tone and has dreads as well might I add) and I go in and still, there's no wait time and it was not busy.  The woman at the front says we can sit anywhere near the bar and a server will be right with us. We sit anywhere as she said we could and about 3 servers walk pass by us and we make eye contact with all of them, multiple times, and they still don't serve us and I feel it had to do with our skin tone. Again, it was NOT busy and the servers were tending to all of the other tables but ours. We just got up and left after about 10 minutes of not being acknowledged. Writing this review to give others a heads up that if you have a different skin complexion you may not get served either :) There are much better businesses to support and this establishment is not recommended."

                "description": "Pretty nice for a hidden coffee shop in a large commercial complex. Would not notice it from the road or walking past unless you know what you're looking for, as it blends in with the rest of the modern building architecture. Not the warmest building from the exterior, but they've done a good job trying to make it welcoming indoors. A variety of seating with one high top table. Most of the seating is 6+ capacity tables, so if you don't like sharing, this is not the place for you to study/sit alone. There is bench window seating, but with two walls of windows I imagine those seats might get warm in the summer. Some outdoor seating as well, for those who prefer that.  I got the grilled cheese and apple sandwich. The flavor combination was well done, but I was a little disappointed by the ratio of filling to bread and felt the sandwich could have been fluffed out a little more in terms of filling. The chips were neither amazing nor terrible; pretty standard fare.   I also got two different hot chocolates. One regular with almond milk, one Mexican hot chocolate with oat milk. Of the two, I'd recommend the first one. Good flavor and nice quantity of whipped cream if you ask for it in a mug. The default seems to be to-go cups, so make sure you're clear if you want to sit and stay a while when ordering. My friend got the Mexican hot chocolate with regular milk and the spices smelled fantastic, but with oat milk they got overwhelmed and it was mostly an oaty flavor.   Welcoming and friendly staff. Would definitely visit again."

I don't think anyone would ever have trouble finding a seat and it seems like a nice quiet place to work for an afternoon. I appreciated the fact that they had a lot of flavor options. I decided to get a Vanilla Rose Iced Oat Milk Latte and it was so good. The flavor was subtle and it was perfectly brewed. The only reason I knock it down to 4 stars is because it's definitely on the pricier side. I would expect to pay minimum $7 for a latte when you go in. While it may not be an everyday stop, I would still go back for sure.   COVID Precautions: Masks required for employees and customers."

The chai latte was almost bland, vanilla latte tasted worse than an instant version I could buy at a grocery store, and even the normal latte lacked flavor."

                "description": "We've come here several times now so we must like it.   I have ordered a breakfast sandwich that's good. There's a pretty well endowed breakfast menu, not huge full breakfasts, like pancakes, but for a coffee shop there's a lot of offerings.  Our coffees are consistent.  It's definitely not my favorite, but it's always good. Consistency is hard, which is why I don't have a favorite coffee shop.   The outdoor area is great bc we always have my kids in tow and sometimes there's another kiddo out there for them to mingle with.   The details: It's an older, white, crowd. The industrial decor is neat, but the chairs are really loud when you move them.  There's plenty of parking. Staff is friendly.   It's always relatively quiet. *the reason i noticed the loud chairs *"

                "description": "Nice spot close by that had really flavorful drinks. We got a flat white and chai latte. I love coffee but I'd honestly would get the chai next time - it was absolutely delightful. We also sampled our fair share of pastries including a blueberry muffin, pumpkin bread, and croissant. The muffin and bread were really moist and delicious, but the croissant was very bready and not a flaky, buttery croissant I was looking forward to. I think they get their pastries from a local bakery so that was cool and I would definitely try out their other pastries. Will definitely be back!"

The owner, or whoever he was, was so terrified of people I wasn't even sure if I was supposed to be there. Pictures look great, I'm sure the place can be a lot of fun if it weren't for COVID-paranoia. Seriously, I went all over Austin that day and NO ONE was halfway as petrified as this guy.  My brother tried to take a sip of his coffee but was soundly rebuked for exposing his nose and mouth for 10 seconds. I understand we need to be careful, and we were, but if you go to a coffee shop you should at least be permitted to make sure the thing is edible before you leave!! BTW, we wore a mask and were very careful the entire time being there.  Won't be back. There are many other decent coffee stops in Austin."

Good food, excellent desserts, and consistent coffee brewing skills exist here.  4 stars because while everything is good overall, the nitro cold brew coffee on the other-hand well to honest...sucks! Its just weak cold brewed coffee, it doesn't pack a punch of caffeine like other cafes that offer it on their menu. If you're gonna do something, do it right or do it better!  But great little place. Indoor and outdoor seating. Good lighting inside and fairly quiet environment if you're working out of the office.   The staff is friendly but not super helpful."

                "description": "Tried this place for the first time this morning. They have a fancy, space-age way of making coffee here called Steampunk that's fun to watch. They put it in these tubelike, clear canisters, and a science experiment occurs where coffee and water get sucked back and forth and eventually a really smooth coffee comes out. This was my first time trying Cuvée coffee and it was definitely tasty. Looking forward to trying lots of different coffees and teas here. I saw nitro cold brew, Mexi mocha, chai and dirty chai, and a full slate of espressos.  The hubs got a hazelnut frap, which was delicious but probably too sweet for me.   Interior here is modern-industrial-ish (aka hard wooden chairs), so it doesn't have the cozy, comfy vibe I look for in coffee shops. I couldn't envision myself working here for hours on end, but I will definitely stop by en route to other places.  Oh, they have a bar with wine and tap beers too. I saw yard games (giant jenga and cornhole) and I saw that they have trivia night here too (the geeks who drink thing.)"

As you can see in my pictures we ordered a lot, lol. We created our pizza. The pesto was perfect. The crust on the pizza was crispy and soft. Great flavor overall.  I ordered the squid Ink. It was great spice and delicious. Only negative was the shrimp and it needed some type of veggie. The shrimp didn't hold flavor well in the dish. I think Argentina shrimp would be a better pick for this dish rather than basic shrimp.  My little one of course with her sweet tooth ordered the glazed Italian donut french toast. It actually was really good. The wild blueberry, honey lemon ricotta, hazelnut and mint combination was actually a really good combination. This dish is super sweet so make sure you have some milk or water to drink.  My other child ordered the breakfast sandwich. She loved it. She really enjoyed the hint of spice it had in it. And my oldest child ordered the Pollo fritto and asked for over easy egg. We also ordered one too so we all could try. Let me say how they cooked the perfect cut of chicken. Normally you order chicken like this and they give you a dark meat cut thigh. Not here! It was a juicy white cut. The crust was perfect! The hash brown balls were yummmmmy! We all enjoyed those.  Overall, great atmosphere, great service, great food! We definitely will be back!"

The pizza blew me away. I ordered thinking \"eh, that doesn't sound good but I'll branch out\" and WOW am I glad I did! The Pig was amazing. I was blown away by the meats! The sausage was incredible (this is coming from someone who HATES sausage on her pizza). The meats had so much flavor. Also, the service was incredible. The first time we came by, the wait after being seated was absolutely insane. We were so hungry! However, the waiter was so attentive to this and gave us a free dessert!   ....which leads me to how good the dessert is here! I am not a caramel fan, and this caramel ice cream was insanely good.   Please come to north italia. Trust me. It's our new fave!"

                "description": "An amazing experience with awesome tasty food. I may not be an Italian food expert but all I tasted was freshness, bold flavors, and great tasting meats.   The charcuterie board has figs, different types of meats such as salami and prosciutto. The char bread is awesome, nice char, mix of oils, and the crunch really helps break up the saltiness from the meats. The white looking sauce is actually cheese spread, I wasn't too much of a fan but it was ok. The best part of the board was the little Italian almonds, soft and firm yet nice crispy shell.   The beef carpaccio is yummy, tasty, and just look at the dish? You eat with your eyes and the dish appeals to your vision. Must try.   The zucchini chips are additive, nice crispy, salty, chips, a bit too oily but it's what is expected, very nice house chips.  The spaghetti and meatball dish is good but I wasn't blown away, I had a better elsewhere. The spaghetti tasted a bit too Al dente, too firm, just missing flavor. I would of spun the spaghetti in olive oil, salt, and black pepper then placed the sauce on top. Sprinkling parmesan cheese helps,"

Pretty busy but it was Friday night around 6-7pm. Had about a 45 minute wait however we were able to sneak into a table around the bar (first come first serve).  Wife got the chicken parmigiana. Probably the best option on the menu. Crunchy chicken with great sauce and amazing noodles on the side. She also tried the bread as an app. Very crispy and fresh.  I got the Caesar salad because I wanted something lighter. Not bad but it's a salad. Also got the meatballs. Pretty delicious.  Server was very nice and we had a great time. The domain area was very fancy with plenty of shops and stores to roam around in. Worth the visit."

I've tried so many Italian restaurants including ones where they make fresh pasta and this place was truly a miss. We had a large table so we had a lot of food to be able to properly judge. Short rib hash had literally 2 pieces of chewy short ribs, deep fried potatoes soaked in oil, etc. overall hardly any taste. Truffle butter had no taste or smell of truffle. Pesto Pasta was good taste wise, but chewy. Veggie pizza was dry. We also ordered banana coffee cake for table. We asked the whip cream on side and the cake came soacked in caramel sauce. Honestly cake would have been good if it wasn't for additional overwhelming sugar added from caramel. Top of the cake was super dry and hard. Zucca chips were good. My friends also had market scramble and Avocado toast that they really liked."

Our server rarely came by, and we actually had to ask for him to remove dishes from the table.   The sicilian margarita was okay, but the ginger blossom marg was absolutely delicious. I ordered the grilled bread, which was also very good but came out borderline cold. For dinner, I had the short rib cavatelli which was quite good.   It was a bit pricey, for the portions - but it was filling. Overall, the food and drinks were enjoyable but the service could've been better."

THE BLACK AND WHITE: I came here for lunch with my team from work (since we're located in the Domain). It's nice having a great Italian restaurant closeby to get your pizza cravings in.  The waiter came by and announced the soup of the day (lentil pork soup) as well as the pizza of the day (pepperoni w/ corn). I also had the same reaction when they mentioned corn. So....I had to try it! Fortunately they are able to have half and half pizzas. I chose the Funghi and the pizza of the day.  The Funghi pizza was delicious! Rich and creamy with the white sauce. Corn on pizza on the otherhand...questionable. Love the fusion thoughts though.   THE FINAL BAMBOO: Overall, the damage done for a half/half pizza was around $20 which is not bad. Delicious pizza and I definitely want to come back to try out the pasta!"

                "description": "This is a great option for Italian, especially at the Domain.  North has something for everyone, whether you're wanting a more Italian-American red sauce option or a something a bit more authentically Italian.  To add to it, they provide these options with impeccable service and in a beautiful atmosphere.  Today's review of the dining options.  First, the appetizer of crusty bread and olive oil was good.  The sprinkled cheese on top of the bread and the olive oil and balsamic vinegar already applied to the bread were surprises, but not unwelcome ones. (I'm always a fan of a separate plate of olive oil for dipping.)  The Bolognese pasta was exceptionally hearty and meaty and not the usual red meat sauce over spaghetti.  The hearty, rustic, meaty sauce combined with the flat tagliatelli pasta was both sophisticated and satisfying -- and quite possibly my new favorite for dinner as the weather in Central Texas cools. My dining companion also enjoyed her Caesar salad and the margherita pizza.  I tried the pizza and found the ingredients to be high quality.  When you combine the taste and quality of the food with the superb service, it's little wonder that North will merit a return visit soon."

We like North Italia and the variety of its menu so well, that this is where we ordered our very tiny wedding's meals from. However, the experience of dining in is a little rough - when the dining room is at full capacity (which it is mindbendingly at right now, omicron be damned?) the noise makes conversation difficult. All the surfaces in the restaurant reflect noise, which makes it more than just fun-bustling... it's ear splitting. It's got wonderful food, but don't expect this to be an intimate dinner or a place to quietly chat."

                "description": "I traveled to Austin for a work meeting, and the start up to that event was lunch at North. I've never been, and while I'm not a huge fan of dinning outdoors for a variety of reasons that include bugs and heat, the overall experience was lovely - until I was ruthlessly pursued by a bumble bee that appreciated my lemonade as much as I did and then by a fly that wanted it's share of my delicious meats and cheeses. Eventually, my coworkers helped rescue me as I was the only one the bee and fly targeted. While I didn't eat the Zucca chips, it was a favorite at the table. I could have ate the crispy calamari and arugula for days! For the seasonal salad, it had a great flavor, yet I felt the salmon was grilled to perfection. The texture was perfectly paired and was still juicy and flavorful. I can't wait to return to North, although I may opt for an indoor seat."

                "description": "North Italia, appropriately or coincidentally located in the northern part of the domain, a spot that's been on my mind but just never got around to it. Glad though this past weekend I had the perfect excuse to go for a friend's birthday. So I thought, italian fusion to celebrate a birthday? Okay I'm in.  Atmosphere: Top notch for the atmosphere here. I will say again the location helps it a lot with a nice patio dining outside and modern vibe on the inside. The location is a perfect spot to people watch and/or enjoy a nice drink or two with friends in a shaded area. The theme overall has a modernized upper casual dinning experience.   Food: My party enjoyed a variety of food, stand outs for sure were any appetizers that have bread included. Cheesey Garlic or Shrimp with bread, you name it, all were so good and sharable too. As for myself as an entree I was caught between the bolognese or short ribs. The server was kind enough to suggest one, so the short ribs will do! Tender with just the right amount of potatoes and veggies made for a great combination of flavors when put all together.  Service: As stated above, our server was beyond friendly. Since it was a birthday our group may of been having too much fun, but the service gladly played along and still made us feel welcome and helped us with any questions.  Overall: With the impeccable service and variety of courses North Italia has to offer, I'd easily recommend it as another spot to take a few friends out and/or to explore some great Italian options. I look forward to return to explore the other pasta-bilities they have especially again the bolognese."

They have something for everyone - salad, pizza, sandwiches, pasta, and also a big selection of starters, desserts, and drinks. I got the strozzapreti (chicken, roasted mushroom, spinach, toasted pine nut, parmesan cream) and it was delicious. The lunch portion was huge and lasted me 2 meals :)"

The atmosphere both inside and outside the restaurant is really nice and the staff are very friendly.  My go-to dishes are either the Chicken Pesto pasta (huge portion with a good amount of chicken and plenty of sauce to cover the pasta), the Funghi pizza (super flavorful and unique taste from the mushrooms), or the Cacio e Pepe pizza which is super creamy."

Extra sauce was requested and parmesan neither were added on side.   Noodles were chewy thick with absolutely no flavor. I don't blame the kid for not wanting to eat it.  Short rib brunch was wonderful, had to share since both were delivered."

Cocktails are amazing and they're always coming up with some new tasty concoctions!  During the holidays they had eggnog to go, and it was hands down the best eggnog I have ever had!   Everything I have eaten here is a 10 out of 10! We have tried almost everything on the menu and I've enjoyed every dish!  Our favorite appetizer is the brussel sprouts and if you want to splurge get the steak dinner.....WOW!  It could be the best steak I have ever had!  The servers go above and beyond and are always cheerful and accommodating.  The ambiance is super cool and hip from the lounge chairs, to the wall accents, they did a great job designing it! The owners of this restaurant really put in the time and dedication to come up with such a great concept and a great addition to the downtown square. I just can't say enough good things about this place!"

                "description": "I came here with our bridesmaid party for a lunch break during dress shopping and we had the best time! We ordered a few shareables for the table, including the Cantonese Riblets, Salt and Pepper Calamari and Carne Asada Fries. All three were delicious, but my favorite was hands down the riblets. They slid right off the bone and tasted a lot more authentic than I was initially expecting. The fries were the next runner up because you can never go wrong with fries covered in queso. For lunch, I ordered the Italian Sausage Burger. I really enjoyed it and it came with more waffle fries! I thought I'd love the sausage patty, however, I think I would have enjoyed a different protein to fill it out a little more. It was worth a try though!  The service was great here and everyone was super friendly. Parking can get a little tricky, but there's plenty of spots if you're not going at peak hours. I'm excited to stop by for dinner, when they have a lot more choices! I don't mind shareables, but I felt like the lunch menu was a little limited and nothing really stuck out to me."

                "description": "Really, really disappointing.  My husband and I have two kids 2 and under, so date night isn't the most common thing.  We were excited to get out of the house and try this place!  My husband ordered the fried chicken and it was fine.  I ordered the steak frite and it was somewhere between luke-warm and cold.  Waffle fries are NOT good cold!  I told the waiter and he said he would \"warm it up.\"  ...But he left it at the table!  Then he proceeded to go help like 6 other tables and finally got back to me 15 min later (by now my husband was done with his chicken), and take my steak frite.  It was so confusing.  He said \"sorry, I had to go check on other tables - I'll go heat it up now.\"  He came back with it literally 2 min later and it was EXACTLY the same - I swear, he didn't actually do anything.  I said \"ummm...it's still cold.\" And he said \"okay, I'll ask the manager if we can comp it.\"  WHAT?!?  Then he came back with a check and we paid and left.  I literally never ate!!!  I was so hungry!  I kept expecting him to bring something hot and it just never came!  He completely blew me off and didn't even try to make it right.  I don't care about something being comped or getting a free dessert or whatever, I just want to have dinner with my husband and actually eat (ha!)  when we arrange a babysitter and make it out!!!  We both commented we would have been better off at home cooking ourselves.  It was so bizarre!    Don't bother with this place!  The decor is super contrived - definitely trying to be something it's not.  The wine list is also very short and unimpressive - just a side note if you're looking for a nice glass.  So bummed."

I personally prefer the good old fashion but there is a drink there for everybody's taste and if you're into spicy alcoholic drinks they do some of those just right as well!  While drinking we tried out some of their deviled eggs and I was happily impressed each one of them is for a flavor and unique although the Sriracha was my favorite!  I've had dinner here before and I can say it's worth it but for our trip we just had a couple drinks and sat on the patio which if that's all you're looking to do is completely OK this is a great place to go!!"

                "description": "Wow, I want to give this place 5 stars, and I hope they trend up but the food is a 3 star experience - at best.  Ambiance is perfect! Less than a block off the square in downtown Georgetown with plenty of free street parking [when Georgetown starts going to valets, I'm moving.] Lots of people walking around: this is a walking little town.  The place itself has a very expansive outside deck with even a few more street side tables - with the fans and heaters I'm betting you get 9-10 months of outside seating here.  Inside the bar is not large but it is gorgeous and there are some table tops as well as lounge seating - comfy old chairs, some Victorian love seats - its really charming and inviting. You will love the ambiance.  Service was fast, friendly and professional - I dealt with three different mixologists and not a surly one in the bunch [try finding that percentage of happy people in Austin...] and the make a wonderful drink. PS: wines on tap (they're not bad) and you have GOT to try a smoked Old Fashion (try the alder wood - its delicious smokiness in a perfect drink.]  PS: At least two rooms for private parties too if you need that holiday gathering!  Why no five stars then? Sounds great! It is great if you go for friends, drinks and good times. But unless we picked the worst entries - chicken and a burger - the food is underwhelming. My neighbor to one side also said her deviled eggs were just average. To be fair, the food was not bad, but it was not good and does not compare with other places around the square.  So; for drinks and maybe an appetizer and ambiance this has got to be on your short list. Think twice about this as a dining destination though - that may not be your best option."

                "description": "I'll start with what The Golden Rule (TGR) got right.  The service was awesome.  Our server was very efficient and personable with great attention to detail.    The food arrived quickly and was good.    The seasoning on the waffle fries was something new.  It reminded me of Old Bay, but with a hint of brown sugar?  It actually worked well.  What needs to improve - I'm glad the window looking out onto the street is gilded with the phrase \"Always a Work in Progress..\" (or words to this effect) since I have some suggestions/observations.  There are three areas to improve - Seating, Selection, and Atmosphere.  First, Seating - why am I sitting on a couch using a coffee table to eat?  I'm dropping nearly two bills on a meal for three people and I'm sitting on a couch using a coffee table?  Maybe if I was just there for a drink, it would be ok.  But not to actually eat a meal.  (I'm sorry about the queso which dripped on the floor. But again - it is tough to eat queso at a coffee table.)  Also, sitting by the huge glass window feels like being in a fish bowl.. People walking down the sidewalk can stop and watch you eat.  Actually, they DO stop and watch.  It happened at least twice while we were there.   It reminded me of an old \"Twilight Zone\" episode. In the episode, an astronaut crashes on Mars and ends up on display in a Martian zoo.  (After he crashes, the astronaut is scared at first, but the Martians are very kind to him and give him a house to stay in.  The Martians show the astronaut the house has all the conveniences and plenty of food.  When the Martians leave, the astronaut discovers the front door is locked and the window won't open.  Later, the astronaut wakes up to find the window open, with dozens of Martians staring inside the house.  The astronaut realizes he is actually the newest exhibit in a Martian zoo, not in a real house.)  There was a sign out front, \"Earthling in his native habitat\"  That's what this seating felt like.   Next, Selection - the beer selection is very slim.  The beer portion on the menu was (verbatim) as follows:     \"Beers on Tap         Hazy IPA        Amber        Hefe        Lager  Ask your server for featured breweries...\"  I asked the server about the vague beer list:  SERVER:  \"And for you, sir?\" ME:          \"Yes, ma'am - Do y'all have Shiner?\" SERVER:  \"No, sir, we just have local beers.\" ME:          \"Awesome.  What do you have from Barking Armadillo?\"   SERVER:  \"Nothing.  What kind of beer are you looking for?\" ME:          \"Something like a Shiner?\" SERVER:   \"We have Brooklyn Lager.\" ME:          \"I'll just stick with water, ma'am...\"  Brooklyn? Local? Similar to Shiner?  You say you have \"local\" beers but yet you have nothing from the local brewery just on the other side of I-35?  As far as Brooklyn - Every so often, I find a restaurant (usually around Dallas) which lists Shiner on the \"Imported Beer\" portion.  I guess geography - specifically Texas geography - is not their strong point.  TGR has the opposite perspective, since apparently Brooklyn is now local to Georgetown.  Finally - Atmosphere.  It is very loud.  It wants to be trendy.  I'm not sure how to fix that.   Maybe this is why I had to sit on a couch."

They have exclusive membership options that provide you with a locker for your special stash, so you always have your favorite spirit on hand. I know this because my little bro is a member. He's got a cool locker with some great whiskey in there, and they have a great selection as well.   There is limited seating inside so all of the seating feels exclusive! It's also just a fantastic feel inside and out. The patio is big and adorable, complete with a picture wall the screams social media opp! If I lived in Georgetown, this is where I would hang out. I will definitely make it my spot when I make it over to Gtown!   All of the food we had was interesting and tasty! The pimento app was not your grandma's pimento. It was creamy and not abrasive at all. The Brussels sprouts were so good I could have eaten a couple helpings myself! The sauce is the same for the shrimp, so I was in sweet and spicy heaven! I want more right now just writing this review. The fam enjoyed the chorizo app.   I had moved on to the smoked old fashioned by then and was completely captivated! I added a video that you should check out or just go and order one. The smoke adds to the experience AND taste! Yum. They have a small, but very good, draft selection, creative cocktail menu, and the option to drink your own spirits if you're a member. I can't say enough that I love this place!  Hunter did an amazing job as our server. He was friendly, attentive, and showed his fantastic personality."

The atmosphere is very elegant, yet chill. The low light in the building added to the overall relaxed vibe. I ordered from the morning menu; there weren't as much options as I would have liked for there to be, so I just settled for the Calamari and Waffle Fries. The food came out much faster than I expected, so I am not surprised that it was a little cold. The food was delicious though... especially the sauce that came with the Calamari! The Ranch was very good and paired well with the food! The sweet tea was average, yet still good. The price is a little much for the quality/amount of the food. I plan on going back in the evening and ordering off of the evening menu."

                "description": "I was impressed with the entire evening. It's been a while since I've been to a restaurant where I loved everything I tried and had great service! It seemed like most people visiting sat out on the patio or at the bar. We were celebrating our anniversary so we made a reservation on a weeknight, but unless you want to secure a spot outside, I don't think you'd need one.   We ordered the glazed brussel sprouts app, the carne asada fries app, and the sea bass to split. Each dish was delicious for different reasons. The glaze on the brussels was addicting, the queso on the fries was delish, and the sea bass came out piping hot with a tasty chimichurri and sautéed vegetables. I would recommend every dish we tried, but my favorite was by far the brussels. We topped dinner off with the blonde brownie w/ ice cream - yyyuuummmm.   For cocktails: Our waiter suggested the Love is Blind with a spash of pineapple - tricky little drink. It tasted like candy but found out halfway in that there was definitely a good amount of liquor in it! The G'old fashioned was classic and strong.   Service was top notch. I wish I remembered his name, but he was super friendly and had great recommendations."

Well I like it for it's modern atmosphere. We got drunken fried and all the cocktails seems good mixes just a bit more alcohol would be nice. One star knocked off because of that and the waitresses seems slightly uppity. No one extra welcoming and excited to converse with us aside from the smiling hostess.   Will still come back since I like the environment."

We got the following: -  Brussel sprouts - soo good, would get again! - shisito - pretty average tasting - pecan crusted chicken - very good  - steak frites - the steak was pretty bland for me but fries were delish  - my family loved the deviled eggs"

                "description": "Date night for the wife and me. Stating off, the drinks were really good. Only downside was that we were looking forward to the cocktail flight but they don't allow on Saturday night (it's a major item on the menu - should be noted if it's only during the day).   For food, everything we had was really good. The Brussels sprouts and the fries (yes fries - you could actually taste the potato) were standouts. Lost of sauces to pair with things too. The only downer was the queso - good taste but the tostadas were a bit stale and the queso itself was a bit congealed by the time it reached the table.   Will be happy to come back - a great option for something a bit more upscale in Georgetown."

From the decor to the atmosphere to the menu and creative bar offerings - this spot definitely takes it to the next level as far as dining in Georgetown goes. Everything on the appetizer menu was delicious - loved the deviled eggs and the steak against the grain. I really wish they offered the craft cocktail flight during dinner service as it looked really fun to try. I would absolutely recommend making a reservation to make sure you get a table. The only downside was the service could have been a little better. Several items that we ordered were forgotten and our waitress was not very friendly. However, overall I really enjoyed coming here and would love to come back to try brunch. Definitely a great option if you're looking to eat somewhere on the square."

The drinks are largely bourbon based, which I love, but they have standard bar fare and beer as well.   The food is delicious and I think it's a testament to say that even the fried bologna sandwich is a winner!  The patio is lovely for this time of year and fairly generous in size. I really hope they can survive the upheaval of the dining industry during these crazy times."

The goat cheese makes it so creamy and the sharpness of it compliments well to the perfectly cooked burger patty.  The husband likes the Ahi Tuna burger. The ahi tuna is so fresh and all those ingredients meld together for a harmonious blend in your mouth.  Every one here is so nice and helpful and the place is always clean.  Good food, great staff keeps us coming back for more."

I didn't know how this place worked so I grabbed a table like normal but got kicked out by someone who was assigned that table lol now I know.   Got assigned another table and the service was fast and friendly. Got the bacon jam double and the big chuck with the bbq ranch fries. The fries were cold, unfortunately, but they were pretty decent so I assume it would have been good fresh. The burgers came out fresh though. Good taste without too much sodium. Even the sodas came out perfectly carbonated, not flat like at most restaurants.   I wouldn't call this place an infamous burger joint that I have to take my friends who visit, but I do appreciate the fresh, not overly salted burgers."

                "description": "Don't know where our last review from here disappeared to but it's gone. So frustrating how that happens on Yelp because we distinctly remember leaving a review about how one of our burgers was insanely spicy. Anyway. We're not at this location very often since there's a HopDoddy by us in the Triangle, but we decided to pop in on Monday evening since it's close to our kid's daycare and on the way to our local library where we were getting her her first library card (awww, preK nerd alert!).  First of all, the guy taking our order was off--and it was a bit frustrating trying to review the items with him. We forget how the whole system works here sometimes--that you have to give them your table number in advance, which is just odd since you haven't sat yet.   Drinks came out quickly and the mega frozen margarita had a perfect consistency and a sweet amount of tequila. The Llano Poblano was solidly good, though a bit too overcooked for our taste, and we enjoyed the sweet potato fries. Our daughter got their kids hamburger option, which was a nice deal for the price. The sleeper surprise was the side car salad, which we added extra kale to. It was so good! We usually get the kale caesar, but will likely stick with this for next time. Strawberry shake was fine.  For some reason, this location felt a bit dumpy to us--maybe things aren't as brand spankin' new as they have been in past years. But we had a decent meal, and it wasn't *too* pricey for what you got, so we're rounding up to 4 stars from 3.5. It's crazy how HopDoddy has come to embody \"old Austin\" now given the proliferation of so many new, aggressively mediocre places. We'll be back at some point; hopefully *this* review will still be up by then..."

You have the option of regular buns, wheat buns or bun-less (they'll place the patty and toping in a salad bowl). Their sweet potato fries are probably my favorite sweet potato fries from anywhere.   Food is generally out pretty quick (I'd say within 15-20 minutes).   There isn't really a service to review since you order at the counter and someone brings your food out. If anything maybe they can have people checking in on tables?  They also have a full bar, so if you would like am adult beverage with your food you certainly can. I'd recommend their margarita. Or you can always get their milkshakes too!"

I heard hopdoddy was the best burger spot in Austin, so I had to try. Plus there was a special for $5 frozen margaritas.  Ahi Tuna Burger: Thick piece of tuna with beautiful flavor. the nori chips added a nice crunch to the mix and it was very filling.  El Bandito: I'm a mixed veggie, veggie patty type of girl and this burger was incredible. I loved the beans, corn, arugula and guacamole mix. The burger did fall apart very quickly, but still recommend this veggie option.  Hot Honey and Sage Sweet Potato Fries: A little bit on the salty end, but the hot honey with little pieces of sage was so delicious. Fries had a nice crisp to it and the portion size was decent.  Overall, hopdoddy had very quick service and good portion sizes. Will come back again!"

I had the El Bandito Burger (made it vegan), Hot Honey and Sage fries and a Paloma cocktail.  Burger: Both times El Bandito Burger were very salty. My group's food was salty as well! So disappointing. The food was edible, but hours later and I still have the saltiness in my my mouth.  Fries: My Hot Honey and sage fries were delicious. It salty, the heat covered it.  Cocktail: Paloma was very good and the bartender (didn't get his name) was nice.  Customer Service: stop at the register for nice. This is definitely a restaurant where you get your food, sit down, and then you are forgot about. Both times a server did not come back to check on us + we had to find someone for a need. But they seems to be the concept so I get it. And when I did speak with staff they were friendly.   Overall....we like it but due to SALT are looking forward to trying the South Congress location."

                "description": "Sadly, you're a restaurant chain in decline. We moved from Austin 4 years ago and were back in town for Xmas this year. Totally excited to go back to Hopdoddy and brought another Austin family with us for their 1st visit. Service was VERY slow as they had only 1 bartender on duty, and the poor guys was underwater all night, which slowed down ordering. When we finally got our $65 worth of burgers for four people, we simply wanted to have ketchup for the burger and fries. I went to the dispenser, pushed the handle, and because the dispenser was basically out of ketchup (who needs ketchup at a premium burger joint?) is shot ketchup all over me and my shirt. Frustrated, I sought help from an employee who left us standing there, with my expensive burger cooling and the ketchup drying on my shirt for over 5 minutes. I then went and asked for the manager. She was working in the kitchen and sternly told me she had no time for me, and I could return to the restaurant tomorrow to speak with the GM. Full stop, end of the conversation. No interest in me, my concerns, or my dining experience. Totally shocked and dismayed, we finished our meal and left. The family we introduced to Hopdoddy with us was equally appalled. We all vowed never to return and share this bad experience with everyone we could, including via social media. Whoever the female manager was at this location needs to be retrained. You literally get better service at any burger joint in Austin at 1/2 the cost. So sad."

I got a regular burger and ordered it medium.  I made sure to tell them pink in the middle as they often serve it well done.   It came out and the bun was good, bacon was good, egg on top was perfect, but once again the patty was well done and dry.  Come on guys do it right!   I did not want to go back up to the counter and ask them to remake it.  Telling a cook they did it wrong is likely to get you a re made burger with a loogie on it.   Sorry but true.   I just wish after they brought it out that someone would have come by and asked how it was.  No one did.  They used to stop by and check on clients but no more I guess.    I'll be back and try again but please try to do it right next time.  Austin"

Not a fan of the tomatoes. Beer is pretty implied so it's a good place to go and drink and eat dry burgers if you're a tourist. Otherwise, I'd pick another place. This was my third time being here in 5 years and the quality of food hasn't changed much. Pre-covid, the staff was pretty unattentive and I had called people over a couple of times. I would say they were more attentive this time than the last two but still kind of annoying to see a bunch of them in a corner when I've been ready to go."

                "description": "Super tasty burgers and fries. Friendly, fast service. Food and ambiance is more upscale than your typical fast-casual restaurant, but has the convenience of ordering at the counter, seating yourself, and shamelessly loading up on as many condiments and house-made sauces as you like.   I got the Goodnight/Good Cause. It was cooked to perfection, medium and juicy. Their shoestring fries were a little overly crispy for my liking, but the hot honey and sage fries were a revelation. I'm a wimp with spice but I kept going back for more. Excited to try more of the menu.  P.S. am I the only one who has to stop myself from calling this place Hop Daddy?"

They just seemed like much more poor quality brioche than they used to use.  Maybe it's just me...  The burger patty itself seemed smaller and just fell apart way too easily. It was a chore to eat.  What a shame. This was once one of my favorite places. For the price, it's not really worth it any more and there are far better options."

                "description": "This place is so overrated.  We have to keep it real.  They don't use quality meat in their burgers.  They are BLAND. Sure, they offer fancy toppings and I guess that can hide some cheap flavorless meat, so if that's you're thing. Go for it.  Much better burger options out there.  The burgers are really small. If you're going to over price your burgers the flavor should make up for the size and justify your prices. I am not sure what these people are thinking with this place.  I guess it's the fries that keep people coming back. I didn't have fries. The meat is supposed to be the litmus test. FAIL.  Chicken sandwich was a little better but not by much. The food is mediocre at best.   Sorry guys I wanted to be wrong about this place.  First visit and last visit."

On Saturday night at around 8pm me, my boyfriend, and a close friend all decided to go to BJ's when the Cheesecake factory had over an hour and a half wait. We went in and were automatically blown away. We we greeted so pleasantly by the host who showed us to the cutest booth that was a semi circle which was perfect for our group, and we had the most lovely server. Her name was Tameika A, and she definitely deserves way more money than she's making, she was able to perfectly explain the menu and help us navigate when we couldn't decide on what to get.  We started our evening with Potato skins and Chips and Queso, which came out super quickly and tasted so fresh and like the kitchen staff poured their hearts into making it.  Once we started to order our entrées Miss Tameika again showed her knowledge of the menu and helped us by being able to go into detail with how the burgers were cooked, and how we could add/take off veggies as wanted. She truly took the cake in our eyes! Once our food was out she was prompt on ensuring we had any condiments or dipping sauces we needed, and keeping our glasses full. However my burger came out a little undercooked; but the manager and the server both apologized and offered to have the burger remade which I declined because I honestly filled up on chips and queso but I felt with 100% sincerity with them and he explained they did have new cooks in, but he ensured the behavior would be corrected. He gave our table a dessert and just went above and beyond with us. I cannot express how happy I was with everything they had to offer. We will definitely will be back for more dinner.  And to the manager and Miss Tameika Thank you so much for how kind you were, you definitely showed there are kind hearted people in this world"

They said five minutes for them to clean a table. We waited 15 and left. They didn't check in or anything. And there were about 50 open tables.   The group of three behind us was given a 40 minute wait for seating... what in the world is going on with this establishment. Disappointing.

                "description": "Okay so I came to this BJ's on the 29th of December after coming from the symphony with my little one and another party.   Act One: When we arrived, after being seated, we were greeted by our server. I ordered a glass of vino from the bar. When the vino arrived, it tasted like the glass that was poured was from a bottle that had already been corked and sitting out. While I understand that a restaurant is not a wine bar serving blends such as a 2007 Klein Constantia Vin de Constance, I do expect the mid-level glasses of Cabernet Sauvignon served to be palatable. Accordingly, I asked the wine be returned to the bartender as it tasted turned. When the waitress returned the glass to the bartender noting my comments about the glass coming from a bottle that seemed to have been opened/turned, he laughed as if I was being ridiculous.   Act Two:  Moving past this debacle, I ordered something else from the bar. My party and I also ordered nachos and mozzarella sticks.  The mozzarella sticks that were brought out to the table were COLD! The nachos were okay but clearly not traditional nachos, but that was not expected from this type of establishment.   The presentation of the check:  The turned wine was still on the check when it was presented to me. I asked that it be removed. When the waitress did come back with the revised check, it wasn't an itemized revision, thus I could not determine if the bill was indeed correct. I did not want to wait for the waitress to return again with an itemized bill as the rest of the visit here was less than stellar. Therefore, I paid the bill as it was and quickly left."

Door Dash delivered the food 50 minutes after the delivery time BJ's texted me it would be delivered. The food showed up cold and I only live 5 minutes away!  I tried to call the Door Dash driver (Sorannys) twice after my food was 20 minutes late, but he wouldn't answer his phone. He did text me that he was waiting on the order (for 45 minutes?). When he finally showed up he wasn't wearing a mask and when I asked him why, he just laughed at me. I called BJ's and talked to the Online Orders Manager. I asked him if he could confirm they were running 45 minutes behind on their Online Orders. He told me they had been running 15-20 minutes behind, but not 45.  I then asked if he could tell me when the order was picked up by Door Dash and he said he could not find me in his computer, even when I offered to give him the Order Number. He told me if I wanted a refund, I needed to talk to Door Dash. When I went to Door Dash's website to call them, guess what? There is no way to contact them; no email, no phone number and no way to review their service. I have been a loyal BJ's customer for years, but after this experience I will be taking my business elsewhere, and avoiding any deliveries by Door Dash!"

The perfect amount well seasoned and good presentation, I definitely recommend it.  The chicken was lemon thyme and it was wonderful I will get it again for sure.

Out of the group of 10 of us 1 was vegans and 2 vegetarian. Decent Vegetarian choices but next to nothing vegan choice and the server also not confident out the vegetarian choices which are or can be made vegan.   Did get seated properly and food did arrive fairly soon. The service attentive. The food - the vegetarian pizza and baked Ziti pasta dish were good. The Peruvian Quinoa Bowl was classified as vegetarian but could not get a clear answer if it was vegan as all the questions we asked came as negative. So the menu is not perhaps classified correctly. Even the Guacamole and Chips were not classified as vegetarian!"

                "description": "Disappointing service at this location. BJ's are a chain but are usually good at least the ones I've been to, but this one not so much. I walked-in and went to the bar area to sit myself. I sat at a table in the bar area and wasn't served. This guy working that area at completely ignored me and proceeded to serve everyone else who came in after me and sat themselves. I eventually had to get up and leave. I ended up at Yard House which had plenty of options and even a great steak. I was treated very well and promptly. I now know where to go and not go in my neighborhood in Austin. Again, who doesn't serve a customer?! I mean, I understand getting annoyed with your job but when you start denying service based on appearances maybe it's time to move on.   Maybe you'll have a better experience but be prepared to wait or even not be served."

                "description": "I had been to a BJ's before in New York and found my experience here to be much more in line with a Cheesecake Factory type restaurant than before which was more like a sports bar. The menu here is long enough that you could stare at it for hours on end and not feel confident in your order. Most of the dishes have enormous portions, with one notable exceptions, and the desserts are over the top.   My group started with the honey sriracha Brussels sprouts and the nachos. Knowing a few pizookies were coming later, I passed on the nachos. The Brussels sprout were cooked to a nice consistency where there was slight crunch. The flavor was good, but it was much closer to buttery than honey sriracha.   For my entree I had the shrimp quinoa bowl, which was the only dish to come out where i wished the portion was a bit bigger. It ridiculously small, but it was smaller than you'd get at a fast casual bowl place for about 1.5x the price. Unfortunately it also paled in comparison to most fast casual bowl places in terms of flavor. Any bite I had that wasn't covered in the hot sauce I asked for on the side was a disappointment compared to the ones that were.   By far the best part of the meal were the pizookies. For those unfamiliar (including me before this meal) a pizookie is a warm cookie in a small deep dish pizza plate with a scoop or two of ice cream on top. It is as incredible as it sounds and they have upwards of 10 different kinds. If you're with a large group I recommend sharing a few and immediately slipping into a food coma.   Overall, nothing too special, but for 3$ pizookies on Tuesday you can't go wrong."

                "description": "Wow. So much for family friendly. We came in, took the hostess forever to ask us how many, since she had her back to the door... Told her we were 7. She went back and forth looking around. Finally came back and said she had no tables for 7 so we could wait 30 to 45 min for the nite servers to arrive.  WHAT?! NO offer to split the table, no offer to clean a table where 6 had just left. We said we'd have to go elsewhere and we were sorry, but they were losing 7 covers. Her response? YEAH, THAT'S FINE WITH ME, WHATEVER. Never looked up from her cell phone either. No wonder you need help. What you have there now doesn't qualify as help. Bad service, won't go back. Too many other places with decent front end staff that actually want the business."

                "description": "So I am starting a whole new set of reviews based on TO GO services. This whole Covid19 thing has limited dining..but it should not limit quality.   I was grateful for BJs being open later than most other restaurants. However I was greatly disturbed by some of the I consistences. The most important problem I had was Frozen Chicken/super cold chicken. I ordered a chicken over rice pilaf dish, and the chicken was stone cold ( must have been ore frozen) after a long night I didn't feel like complaining since the other food was edible.  I specifically asked for no spicy items or spices on my sides , my veggies were laced with a spicy seasoning I can not identify.   The ribs were cooked well not great but he'll for this pandemic I'll take it.   I am giving this place a 3 (should be a two ) only because the person who helped me was so nice and accommodating, and everything was clean, and peaceful.   Support them but do complain if something is incorrect. I realized that as a supportive customer in a pandemic, the we shouldn't accept a lower quality of food."

I truly can't even rate the food or the service because we had none of the first and an absence of the second.

We were quoted 30 min wait for a table. We waited over an hour and when we checked with the staff, a red haired hostess sarcastically offered us to remove us from the waitlist as the solution to our problem!!  The kid at the front door kept saying he didn't know which party was next on line. Very sad. I'm the mean time I witness how some staff members wear gloves but the majority didn't (including our server). The tables did get sanitized but not the chairs that everyone's has to touch to be able to sit ... the door handles were not wiped once in the hour, we were waiting outside for our table. Food was average. Came back to my hotel room sticking to grease, yikes."

We spoke to management (Jerry) and all he could say was there's other parties that have waited just as long as you. Then once we were about to be seated we were told to hold our order in order to not crash the kitchen. We did our part and waited to order like they requested. We ended up leaving around 9:15 the food never came after they kept telling us it was plated and it would be 5 more minutes...5 more minutes. The service here has gone down hill. Highly recommend going to Lakeline or Rio grand location. I will say our server was very patient and organized he did what he could for us. Thank you Victor!!!"

Highlight was this long hair that I found baked into the holy Mac ... halfway through eating it. Completely ruined my appetite and I had only had one wing. Sad cause I wish I could've enjoyed it all. Wonder how this could've gotten into the center of the stick when everyone has hairnets, gloves and hopefully masks on when preparing food."

Customer Service A+! What I love and didn't know about Pluckers is you can actually get ANYTHING flavored with any of the Wing sauce flavors (like the fries)!!   I ordered the Spicy Lemon Pepper and the Spicy Garlic Parmesan Wings. I personally liked the Spicy Garlic Parmesan Wings better, solely because the Spicy Lemon Pepper is actually mixed with not only lemon pepper, but buffalo sauce as well, which just makes this flavor overwhelmingly salty.   I also ordered a side of the Tator Tots, which is an added bonus to the wings. Don't forget to order the Arnold Palmer!"

The liquor prices are better than those at other liquor stores/chain stores.  The beer selection is excellent.  The beer prices are competitive, and in most cases slightly lower than HEB and other grocery chains.  It is the best place for champagne, in both selection and price."

                "description": "Excellent customer service during the COVID-19 pandemic!   I've never purchased alcohol here before, but we were running critically low on supplies during the stay-at-home orders. A friend told me they had curbside at Total Wine and More. I called to confirm there was the ability to have contactless curbside pick up and the person I spoke with was very nice on the phone (even though I assume they are getting an annoying amount of calls during this time).   Placing my order online was extremely easy. The UI was intuitive and was not confusing at all. There were a few points where they reminded you not to pick up your order until you received an email (or text if you opt in) to pick up your order. I appreciated the multiple points of clarity.   Both times we have ordered (once on a Saturday and once on a Thursday), our order was ready within the hour!  Pick up was easy. All you have to do is pull up to the marked, designated spots and send a text to the number on the sign. You have to provide your spot number and name. Once they come out, just hold your ID up to the window. Then they will place your order in your trunk. Easy peasy!   Definitely give this place a try if you're looking for contactless curbside!"

                "description": "The order was to come between 6pm and 7pm and there was a big storm. I called the driver and they said they would reattempt delivery because the storm had cleared. I called the store and they said they would reattempt delivery that night with another driver. At 8pm I called again to reconfirm so I didn't have to come in -- and again, I'd get it if they had to cancel, but I just needed heads up.  Minutes before closing, I got an automated email that said it was canceled and there was no call or additional note. I'm very disappointed. I know that they use a delivery service like Uber so it's not all within their control, but what poor customer service to not explain the situation, or to personalize the situation in any particular way beyond a click/cancel. It's wine, so it's not the end of the world, but next time I'll just pop into an H-E-B."

They even provided tasteful suggestions that proved their knowledge of the selection in store. And when I couldn't find the 90 minute IPA I was buying for a friend, they were there to guide me to it.  The check out was painless also as the cashier Susanna was very personable and talked to my wife and I the whole time. She even made me toddler smile and feel a part of the conversation. Great people in this location. Will be back when I'm in Austin."

                "description": "I was a huge Total Wine fan when I lived in NJ.  I drove an hour + to stock up.  When they opened the Austin store a day before my birthday I was thrilled.   Still the same HUGE selection.  Still Conte Priola Pinot Grigio.  Sadly no Kitchen Sink red blend, but HEB carries it here.  Still fun tastings on the weekends.    Annoying cashier girl who awkwardly scans bottles in my cart despite me wanting to put them on the checkout conveyor thingie.    Overall a 4-5 star experience every time.  But yesterday we had a 10 star experience.  OMGoodness, you just have to find Stephen in the wine area.  He'll ask a few questions and recommend wines based on your tastes.  You will love each of his suggestions.  You will love his stories.  This sparkling wine was named after the granddaughter of the vineyard owner....  yes please.    Best liquor store ever."

There was plenty of hand sanitizer available at the entrance. There was a tasting station near the entrance with a nice lady offering samples of Mezcal from behind a plexiglass. We were warmly greeted by every employee we passed and offered assistance. The employees are very knowledgeable about their wines, I just told them the taste I was looking for and they led me right over to the options that matched. There's also a large refrigerated beef room in the back. Checkout was a breeze and our associate was engaging and sweet."

I was particularly impressed with the way they handled the  COVID mandates;  A sign was on the front door noting masks must be worn, ample hand sanitizers and wipes were readily at the entrance, and the carts are always clean.  From the very beginning of the pandemic, I was always comfortable shopping at Total Wine.  The store is arranged in such a way that although busy, there was plenty of room to social distance, including at check-out."

The samples are always plentiful and varied.  They have great deals and a huge wide varied selection as well as some high class expensive liquors for refined tastes. They also stock a ungodly amount of small sample, airplane sized bottles of liquor of famous and lesser known types.  They always have several check outside running and lots of neat extra items like gift sets, hangover cures, bottle openers, margarita machines and stuff to create your own bar.   For the holidays they have some unique items such as the moose cup from National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.  Check it out. I promise you will find new and known drinks and much more besides."

The problem is living in Texas you cannot buy the pods online from Keurig.  The only stores that carry them in Texas are Total Wine in Houston and Specs in Houston.  I called Specs and the person I talked to was friendly, she knew what I was talking about and said she would look into the distributor and how they could get them in Austin.  I called Total Wine and had to talk to 4 different people, none of whom seemed interested in doing what Specs offered to do.  We place monthly orders with Total Wine for wine and spend a significant amount of money.  Guess we will move our wine purchasing to Specs :("

On occasion, I'll sip an appletini or two. During game night, we were talking about one of our favorite subjects, liquor, and I mentioned not liking cognac. Well, my girl, Nickie, told me I've got it wrong and not to knock it until I've tried it again at this event- hence an invitation to a Hennessy tasting event at Total Wine. Talk about a lovely time! They served food (thank goodness), Hennessy (oh, yeah!), and even gave us recipe cards to try at home - oh, and did I mention the stainless steel martini-shaker? I learned a lot about the origins of this drink and how it's made. It was quite interesting. Everyone was having a good time, and the samples were very yummy. Real yummy! I'm a convert and hate to admit it. I hope my friends don't read this review!"

The employees act like they will run over you so you have to walk defensively. Seriously, it is like customers are invisible and they are running a warehouse because even when they cut you off, and they will, they don't say excuse me. If you are lucky enough to find what you are looking for you will get a great value but then you schlep to the checkout lane and that is hit or miss as well. Well, mostly miss in my experience.

She even pointed to the address on the coupon and walked off like we were illiterate.  But the coupon states it's for the retailer, not the consumer.  If your employees can't even be bothered to care, then I'd rather support a local shop, like Twin Liquors."

They have a great artisan soda selection, pretty much any ready-to-drink coffee you could want and some great snack options that are definitely a large step up from your typical convenience store.  But that's not really why you come here. Sunrise is THE neighborhood spot for craft beer. Walls of fridge cases full of beer on top of the tightly packed shelves displaying almost every beer you could want.They easily have one of the best selections of Jesterking in Austin (outside of the brewery). On top of that, Sam is the man! Become a regular and from time to time they'll hold something for you when it comes in (obviously within reason). It's nice to walk into a store and be instantly recognized. Not only that, if something just came in that fits the type of beer we are usually looking for, Sam remembers and lets us know.

She suggested that we go to Sunrise and I said ok, I know nothing about the northlands so lead me in that direction!   When we pulled up I was like ... ok this looks like your typical citgo gas station ... nothing special from the outside at all.  Then as I got closer to the door and could see a bit on the inside I quickly started realizing that I had pulled up to something pretty amazing.  The sun definitely had risen ... this was like the Live Oak of South Austin, but for the Austinites of the northlands.   Pretty much anything local you can get your hands on you can find in here, which makes it cool.  Craft beers out the wazoo, fancy special drinks of all kinds, specialty popcorn made in atx, lavender soap, or organic chocolate of all flavors for your liking.  This place was definitely a surprise to roll up on.    The other thing that I could tell makes this place so special was the staff.  My friend that took me here knew them by name and carried on a conversation with them about what they were doing for the holiday.  They also discussed the beer that he had recommended to her on her last visit.  I mean this was first class, friendly service.    When I am back in the northlands of Austin I will always remember this unassuming, hidden gem."

                "description": "Clark Kent's disguise was a pair of nerdy glasses.  Sunrise bottle shop is disguised as a hole in the wall gas and service station. Yes, there is gas outside (at least I think the pumps work), but inside is everything BUT seven eleven goods.  That's how I have driven past this place a thousand times and never knew of it's existence until a Hopdoddy bartender recommended my husband stop here to get a hard to find beer.    You won't find the typical junk food or grease pit delights here.  Instead you will find organic, gluten free, all natural treats and snacks (from local Austin companies when possible).  Instead of Hershey Bars you will find boutique quality chocolate.   Most importantly you will find an amazing selection of beer, ciders, mead, and wine at decent prices.  Often you will find hard to find items here, that you can't find anywhere else.  Everywhere else had run out of Eastside Pineapple Cider, except for here. The owners are extremely knowledgeable and nice.  Sam is great.  They have such passion for their job and the store.  So excited that Sunrise is in my new hood.  This place is amazing!  They have an active twitter feed that keeps you posted on new items that come in and any tastings that they might be doing.  I don't often set up tweet notifications, but for this place I did!"

There are a few other Sunrise markets in town, but none are anywhere close to this one.  If you are a craft beer lover, do yourself a favor, visit this place - if you are having trouble finding something new, ask - You will walk away with a something good to try -  An added bonus is that East Side pies is next door - great pizza by the slice."

There are several refrigerated cases and two main aisles chock full of a variety of craft beer for sale, including some of the harder-to-find bombers and special releases.  What you won't find is the most competitive pricing, *if* you can find the same beer at Whole Foods, Central Market or Highland Market   Recent Pricing Comparisons (rounded up a penny): * Stone Xocoveza  6-pack: Sunrise - $17 / Central Market - $15 / Whole Foods - was on sale for $15, now $17 but with a case discount = $15.30 * Founders Backwards Bastard 6-Pack: Sunrise - $18 / Highland Market - $15.60 * Prairie Artisan Pirate Bomb 12 oz bottle: Sunrise - $13 / Whole Foods - $12 / Highland Market - $12 * Deschutes Dissident bomber: Sunrise - $18 / Whole Foods - $16 * Epic Double Barrel Big Bad Baptist bomber: Sunrise - $18 / Whole Foods - $16 (in the 'secret' section) / Highland Market - $17  Pro Tip: You should bring your own bag or cardboard carrier if you are planning to stock up.  Otherwise take your chances on the single ply plastic bag provided or hand carry your bottles out of the store."

                "description": "thrilled to have discovered this little gem via Bon Appétit/food and wine. The incredible beer selection aside.. wine in a city like atx should be more of a thing and this place is a brilliant start. You can get a crisp Portuguese white for under $10 or a beautiful $50++ biodynamic rosé from the south of France. All kinds of fantastic reds, too. How exciting to see the remnants of unpasteurised goodness at the bottom of a bottle when you pull it out. It's not just about drinking organically it's about knowing what you're drinking, where it's made, who's making it, how to enjoy it the way the maker would want you to, supporting these smaller family oriented, sustainable, traditional winemakers without all the aids/additives/headache inducing sulfites. These are actual living wines that the owner clearly has a mad passion for. Sam truly is the man, thank you sir and I'll be sending everyone I know to your shop"

Imagine a convenience store with chips and drinks and and beer and wine, but everything is unique different and definitely thought through. Stuff you could find at Whole foods.    Speaking with Sam the manager, he talks about passion versus business, and he makes a good point. Passion first, business will come  Why not create a convenience store like what they have built here, and also feature quality, unique Goods available with knowledgeable staff?  Highly recommend."

                "description": "Sunrise remains a great place to find a huge selection of interesting craft and local beer. I am dropping a star from my previous review, because Sunrise is not a great place to find truly limited releases.  Those are held back and distributed to friends and insiders before normal customers have a chance. Other shops seem to be more transparent and fair about access to really sought-after beers. But, hey, if you are one of the guys that gets the hookup here, I'm sure life is good.  Sunrise probably deserves a better review, but I am disappointed in this business practice. I will probably be going elsewhere from now on."

I am 281lbs and i had to walk out from the bar area because it was way to cold. I walk out shivering! Not one person or staff member cared. They just stated you can just get on a waiting list. Which i did! But where is the common sense l? Its 80 outside and it feels like 67 inside???   Why is this the culture?  Customer: it's freezing in here Lakeline Pluckers: Well do you want to wait for 45mins to an hour?  How is this your business motto? No, ok paying patron we can take your concern seriously and see what can be done. It was so cold the servers glass started to fog up!! What type of weather manipulation is this?   Imagine a cold beer  and its under 66 degrees!! Un comfortable!   I swear if I stayed in that section long enough it would have start snowing. They dont even have to put ice in the drinks for crying out loud.   I also informed staff to address the situation or i will write a review in regards. Just acknowledge its over kill! They literally ignored me! So Pluckers you have two issues at this location the temperature and the fact your staff provides customer service but no customer concerns is a oxy moronic!   They way they duck my concerns rebranding should change name to Duckers!!  Any way wear a sweater, jacket and or bear skin if you going to the bar for wings. If you have any concerns they will kill you with kindness and ignore you with repetition as if you didnt hear them and also voice a concern. Based on my bites rating (check other post)   They get *2 bites and nibble!  Food Beetle"

The spiciness of the wings vary a lot though, with sometimes being not spicy at all and others being a bit too spicy. But if you don't want to get too messy eating wings and want a good dry rub, then I highly recommend the spicy ranch. You can also never go wrong with their tater tots or Mac and cheese- tater tots are always fresh and crunchy and the Mac and cheese is nicely baked and cheesy.   Overall, service has always been pretty good and is a great place to come to if you're craving chicken wings and want to watch sports and drink at the same time!"

When I called back to let them know was unable to cancel the order on my end, staff were still unable to help me modify my pickup time and said that since the order had not yet been received by their restaurant, the only thing she could do was wait until it came in and cancel the order at that time.

Their wings are just the best and their different sauces always satisfy any craving I have - whether that be sweet, savory, spicy, or crying spicy (shout-out fire in the hole!) the wings are big and crunchy and they always have some good cold beer to pair them with! If you're a fan of Micheladas, you'll love them here too! Especially the pickled green beans they add!   Their rewards program is awesome if you're a frequent buyer. You pay $20 and earn 1 point per every $1 spent on food. Once you get to 100 points, you can redeem for $10 off your bill. They also have specials which you can get for free when buying two entrees so really, the membership pays for itself rather quickly!   There's room for improvement in the Service but other than that, I love some Pluckers!"

We waited for an entire hour before telling the waitress we were going to just leave, and of course, the food arrives at that exact moment. Fine we'll eat, even left a good tip. We box our leftovers and come home to weigh the thighs (we track calories and macros). Each thigh was between 3.5 and 4oz each, and we each received 4 thighs. That means we got 1lb each when we were charged for 2 each. I never received a refill on drinks, and it was all around a bad experience. I never leave reviews  but this was horrible.

Several months ago, just as COVID was starting to escalate, we sat in the bar area and I saw the waitress carry my glass by the top.  I complained.  Several times since, when we sat in the bar area the service was horrible. They took forever ttake and deliver our orders, messed up our orders etc...  We decided that the service in the bar area was so bad we didn't want to sit there again.   Tonight, I used the pluckers app to join the wait list. We waited for 10  or 12 minutes. Once we were there the text said we only had three minutes to checkin (way too short in my opinion).. You can wait longer than that in line.   When we got to the host stand they asked us if... we minded sitting in the bar!! ??  My wife, of course, said NO.   The hostess basically rolldd her eyes then told us that she could add us to the waitlist again... At the bottom! ... And it would be another 15 minutes!  We left.  We are now eating at Texas Roadhouse."

                "description": "This place was really crowded on a Saturday. We had some time between basketball games and wanted to grab a bite to eat. I have not been to Pluckers in a while and I guess they have changed a few things.  We didnt have a lot if time so we sat outside, it was covered. They had the plastic rolled down and heaters going so it wasn't bad. We were seated close to a heater then they asked us to move because we were too close to an exit? We didn't understand. Either way we were moved away from the heater and closer to other patrons.   We ordered wings, both grilled and fried.  The dry rubs aren't as good to me so I had grilled wings with the buffalo hot sauce.  The staff was just fine, did a good job of refilling drinks, checking in with us, etc.   What they brought out were chicken strips, not wings. I was a little disappointed in this, they were tough and stringy as well. Maybe it is due to Covid, I dont know but I had prepared for wings. Along with these being chicken strips and not wings there was a substandard amount of buffalo sauce on my order.  Overall it was ok, edible and met a basic human need of food but I will wait awhile before going back and check if they have wings or strips before I order."

Go into the bar area and get told we can't sit and have a beer on the table tops because those go through the host stand. Can't sit at the bar because we have a kid. Ask the manager if we can just sit and get a beer that we order from the bar while we wait for a table inside and get told no. I have never seen a place that doesn't let people sit at an empty table to order a drink while they wait in a half empty restaurant. We left... I would avoid as the management is clueless and terrible."

                "description": "Inconsistent at best is how I would describe this pluckers location.  Recent visit on 5/29 both adult \"10 wing combos\" came out with the wings over cooked   What this location consistently does is over fry the kids meal \"chicken bites\". They come out hard as a rock and you can't even cut them with a knife.   I really like pluckers but the lakeline location closest to my home has gotten to the point it's worth driving to another location or entirely different establishment.  On a trip to San Antonio recently, I stopped by the pluckers in selma the food was great and really highlighted how bad the lakeline location is in comparison. I guess they don't have to try anymore since there's typically a line out the door"

The wings were not fresh and seemed like they were probably had been sitting there, sauce thrown on them and heated up.  For the price of $1.85/wing (before taxes) is highway robbery.  Even the fries were not fresh.  We WILL NOT EVER ORDER FROM YOU ALL AGAIN! Very over rated and over priced!!  I'd rather drive a little further and go to Wings N More!  Horrible horrible horrible!

They run around chaotically and can't handle anything. If you sit at the bar high top area you will wait 20+ minutes between food orders and drink refills. They do not bus the tables and bar top. It's a complete mess. Stuff stacks up. Why or how Plucker's corporate hasn't fixed this location yet is mind boggling.   Total incompetence. Food is cold. Food takes forever. Servers ring up extra charges. They forget drinks and napkins, they sneakily upcharge you for 2 wing dipping sauces when 1 is not enough for 10 wings."

Baked goods, produce, and assorted frozen items. The best part is that you don't have to pay extra for the convenience. Prices are the same that you would find at the bigger grocery stores.   The meat market here has almost everything you can get at Fiesta and at the same price as well.  I highly recccomend their carnitas and the green salsa you get with it. That was some of the freshest salsa I have had in Austin. If you're tired of the parking, long lines and the large crowds then come here."

What appears at first glance to be a medium-sized convenience store attached to a gas station is in fact a small grocery store, complete with produce, dairy, a meat market, basic staples and a decent beer selection. There's also an excellent and cheap short order taqueria within.  The offerings are overwhelmingly Mexican as the name implies (half of an aisle is dedicated to La Costeña products alone) but they have quite a bit beyond that too, just about anything you would need in a pinch in the way of canned vegetables.  Best of all, it's CHEAP. Grocery store prices rather than convenience store prices."

La Familia doesn't just have the typical gas station junk food (although they do have it). It's like a mini grocery store. They also have a taqueria inside - get tacos! Get migas! Don't forget to get an Alligator Ice on your way out. Man.... so sugary and delicious.   I would choose La Familia over any Walgreens just to pick up a few groceries because as the others mentioned - everything is reasonably priced."

                "description": "I came to World Market for the first time today and I fell in love! They have all kinds of unique home decor items along with beautiful pieces of furniture. The back section has lots of different imported coffee, wine, and treats. The employees were very friendly from the moment I walked in the store. It's definitely not an inexpensive store but it is easy to tell that the items they sell are high quality. I can't wait to return to shop again!!"

                "description": "Came here a couple weeks back to find a new dinning room table, I saw one for $660 and I wasn't sure if I wanted to get it then as we are leaving I look online to if there was other option and see that is actually on sale for $249 so I call and inquire. The lady checks for me and says yes but we only have the floor model left and you can have it but we need to break it down. So we turn around go up there and we had some tools with us and the staff jumped into action and started to lay out cardboard and assisted my hubby in taking it apart. Then they scanned and saw that the match bench was on sale too and then tracked down another one for me in RR which was still in the box; SCORE! So I got a new dinning table and two matching benches at an amazing savings... BUT wait it gets better as I am checking out the associate asks me if I am an \"Explorer Member\" and asked if I would like to join and explains the amazing savings and perks. Needless to say I signed up right then and there AND I saved another 20% so I got all of that for $400 bucks.  Pros: great savings, AMAZING helpful staff, variety of products, quality of goods and they have a \"member savings\" program. Cons: Only issues I that when we went in there the table has the original pricing on there, had I not looked online I wouldn't have known to inquire... however this worked in my favor so I almost could count that as a pro lol"

                "description": "If CrateandBarrel and Trader Joe's had a baby, it would be World Market. Although it reminds me of those two stores, I believe that World Market offers their own unique products.  I was navigating the interwebs for the perfect relatively priced end table. Do you know how hard that is?! Yes I can get one from Amazon, but they look tacky. Yes I know Target sells some, but they look cheap. And no I'm not going to spend $300 at West Elm for one!   And then I found World Market. A good looking table...check! At a relatively fair price...check! After looking at their catalogue, it probably took me 3 minutes to make up my mind about buying one.   But before I went to the store to purchase the table, I made sure to sign up for their World Market Explorer program so I could get a 10% coupon. After printing out the coupon, I was out the door and on my way.  Although I only had one goal in mind, it's so easy to get distracted by all the modern furnitures and decorations in there. While I was waiting for an employee to get the table from the back, I unconsciously wandered over to the picnic bench area and before I knew it, it had been 5 minutes! Poor employee who was probably holding my table wondering where I had gone.   To anyone looking for interior decoration ideas, World Market is the place for you! I didn't browse their food and wine selections, but I bet they're just as interesting!"

                "description": "We love World Market furniture, food and decor, but every department seems understaffed, the employees seem overworked, and the lines can get pretty long because of a lack of cashiers.  We purchased two of the Kendall chairs at World Market, and it took them 15 minutes to assist us, even after we told them we were about to spend $400 on furniture. We love the chairs, but didn't love the process at this location for making the purchase. We'll be back because it's the closest World Market, but there could be some improvement on the customer service front."

                "description": "I totally forgot about World Market. I've always gotten their emails but after I moved from the chain store wasteland of south Dallas, I never really thought to go here again until recently. I needed an umbrella for my patio STAT and it appeared WM was having a sale.   I had the best experience there. This girl who helped me out (beth??) was just amazing. Went to the back to look for the color I wanted, helped me figure out that one was cheaper than another and was basically my personal assistant through the whole process. She was fantastic.   I had to return one item (some umbrella lights) today and again, had a fantastic experience. I was *that* customer. You know the one. Didn't have a receipt, the original packaging or frankly any idea at all what the price was. In fact, I tried to return it with different packaging altogether from the set of lights I'd replaced it with. Yeah, real winner. Maxine got me all sorted with herculean patience and research on the interwebs. She went above and beyond to help me out.   Of course, there's a whole bunch of cool stuff, great jewelry, art, rugs, home stuff, wine, beer, snacks, toys but I was most impressed by how spot on the help was both times."

                "description": "Crack. I come here thinking I need one thing and walk out with a basket full of decor/housewares/crazy foreign food/wine/rugs/etc.  I love World Market and avoid it because I know how hard it is to control myself with so many cute items that would be perfect in my house and YEAH! they're on sale!  Don't get me started on the European candy and cookies.   For me World Market's strong suit are the little things. The interesting items you set on a shelf or hang on the wall, hoping someone will ask \"Where did you get that?\" And you can ramble on about some amazing, life-changing trip to China/India/Africa where you saved the life of a small child and their family gave you this item as a token of thanks. Well, maybe not, but if you like these types of items, World Market has you covered. They also have cute curtains and glass ware.   Like I said, this place is crack. If you enter here, be prepared to leave with much more than you intended."

Let's sing along with The Kinks, shall we?  [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9ObLGRq33o]  Saw a painting of violas and I took it back to my place. Feelin' guilty, feelin' scared,  For this desire, I am unprepared. Stop! Hold on. Stay in control.  Wine, I want you here with me, But I'm really not as rich as I'd like to be. But there's a red [wine], under my bed, And there's a little yellow pillow under my head, And there's a fon-due inside of me That keeps shoppin' me, touchin' ya, watchin' ya, lovin' ya.  Consumer Spoiler, cash destroyer! Consumer Spoiler, cash destroyer!  Well, I fell asleep, then I woke feelin' kinda queer. World Market looked at me and said, \"Ooh you need my beer.\" She said, \"Girl, there's really nothing wrong with you. One day your bank account will reconstruct. It's up, it's down, we can work it out. You got a good thing goin'; things you can't do without.\"  Consumer Spoiler, cash destroyer!  Consumer Spoiler, cash destroyer!  Silly girl, you got so much to buy for, So much to aim for, much to drive by for. You blowing it all at Consumer Spoiler. You're so insecure, you cash destroyer!  (And it goes like this, here it goes...) Consumer Spoiler, cash destroyer! (Here it goes again...) Consumer Spoiler, cash destroyer!  Banker, Banker, help me please. I know you'll understand. There's an avid shopper inside of me, I'm a cash-destructin' woman. There's a red [wine] under my bed. And there's a little green pillow under my head.

Then as I was checking out with 7 bottles of wine, the mean cashier did not even care to get a wine box for it, then she told me she had no paper bags or cardboard bottle-holders even though I could CLEARLY see them both under the cash register. She was very rude from the start."

                "description": "New things I found at World Market:  A large red plastic Japanese umbrella for an outdoor table.  But it's PLASTIC. Beautiful handmade paper gift bags with ribbon handles. The textures and colors are dreamy.  I purchased several. Large assortment of greeting cards. Really, where I get my card fix for special occasions. A small glass front cooler at checkout filled with assorted cans and bottles of waters, juices, and colas.  Where's the beer and cans of wine? A more open space plan that seems to showcase their foods and kitchen wares better. Samples of their thin ginger cookies and Kettle potato chips. Bright summery pillows. Several styles of outdoor furniture. Battery operated strings of outdoor lights. I will probably go back for some of these. Nothing on sale in the beer and wine department.  Waiting for my next coupon and a sale in the B and W department."

We came from a 3 day long trip from California and had a coupon that was about to expire, in the hastle of getting to our new hours, dropping off the Uhaul and unloading the car from the trailer, it was almost time for Cost Plus World Market to close! I called 15 minutes before they were going to close and begged them to let us buy a dining table that was on sale and use the coupon that was about to expire. Elisa answered the phone and was so kind! We came in 2 minutes before they were going to close, chose a table and some chairs. She was so helpful and cheerful! We know how crapy it is when you're about to close and people take their time shopping.... but I have never felt so comfortable! She reassured us that it was ok... they don't work on commission and she was still so kind! Definitely souther hospitality!  THANK YOU SO MUCH for your patience and knowledge on helping us get the best dining room table with a great discount!!!!"

I was checking out a rug and Cathy was one of the most helpful people I've ever had at any store period. She even advocated for me all the way up to the register to make sure I was getting all the discounts that were applicable. Really was a pleasure. Thanks again Cathy!"
