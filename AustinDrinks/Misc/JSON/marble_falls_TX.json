                "description": "Yesterday, I decided to do a day trip to Spicewood today. It was first to Krause Springs then found out Iron Wolf would be open lunch time. After a refreshing morning at Krause Springs, we headed to Iron Wolf Ranch and Distillery for lunch and drinks.   They have a wide variety of spirits with several award winning ones. Tiann was great in making our drinks! I had the New Fashion made with Hotscotch (a little sweet and spicy). My husband had the Luna-tic made with vodka and several fruit juices. We enjoyed the drinks while we waited for our lunch from Craigo's. We ordered the specialty pizza (sausage, pepperoni, green peppers, mushrooms and onions) and barbecue wings. Truly phenomenal pizza and wings! We also had the Giddy Up Mary with horseradish-infused vodka and Wild and Tea, an Arnold Palmer with bourbon.   We'll have to come back another time for the tasting and meet Luna, a wolf adopted by the family (she's usually there on Fridays). Most Saturdays they have live music. Definitely check their calendar online."

Disc golf. Cornhole. Food truck (Craig O's). We had a great time.   Specialty cocktails are a little off (and a little weak). Order your preferred cocktail and you'll be fine.   Didn't do the tour or tasting. Maybe next time."

Hahaha kidding but really this place was awesome, even though it was a day with drizzle still enjoyed it! First off the staff is beyond sweet, so warm and welcoming! The drinks were great and good price! Such a fun vibe with good music. Very mellow way to spend a Sunday afternoon. So happy they had a kids area because both my 8 year old and 2 year old had a blast and stayed busy so I could enjoy a delicious Bloody Mary. They have awesome lawn games to keep busy and a delicious pizza food truck parked on site. We will for sure be back!! Do yourself a favor and pay it a visit it was a lot better than most of the distilleries I've visited."

It has one indoor bathroom and one little pizza truck -which the pizza was Okay- the kids play area is huge tires with again NO shade. Please don't even say you have a play area when the only thing they could climb on are tires that would give them second degree burns. The solo artist singing was probably the only good thing as we also got 3 different drinks and didn't even finish half of it because it was gross."

Very shiny stainless steel still, immaculate polished concrete floors, easily the fanciest metL building I have seen!    And they have good liquor!  The tasting is informative and interesting, even if all of the idetails on the fancy bottles is a bit overwhelming.  But the real wolf is interesting.   Try it al!!  The Giddy'Up (horseradish) vodka is better than it sounds - and it makes a fantastic Bloody Mary!  Several things were good, but you must BUY this - it is excellent!"

My boyfriend and I did the tasting - $8 for a taste of 4 spirits with 6 to choose from:  Corn Vodka - hint of sweetness and great consistency Clear Molasses Rum - not my kinda thing but this was good.  Citrus forward Gin - also not my type of spirit but I actually really liked this. Clean and fresh - perfect for Texas summers! Horseradish Vodka - you really must try the Bloody Mary with this. Yum!  Hotscotch - butterscotch pepper whiskey. We loved this so much we are bringing a bottle home.  Iron Hot - cinnamon pepper whiskey. Good if you're into cinnamon spirits.   We also had two drinks. I had the Bloody Mary with horseradish Vodka and my boyfriend had the wild tea (Arnold Palmer with bourbon). The owners have big plans for this facility and you can tell a great deal of thought and planning has been put into this establishment and spirits. I look forward to watching this place grow and develop. I'll be back next time I'm in the area!"

Nice taste. The other had the special, The Irish Wolf, it was good.  Found out there isn't a full bar, so they are making drinks out of the liquor they distill.  They are engaging, entertaining, try to sell you a tasting but don't oversell if you don't show initial interest which is nice. You can take a tour if you get the tasting.  Great areas all around the distillery to just hang out with friends and chat, or play games, chill and listen to live music or wander around the grounds a bit. Beautiful location to be out in nature. Family friendly place, folks were there with their kids and everyone seemed to be having a good time."

                "description": "We stumbled upon this sprawling alcohol paradise on our drive back to Austin from San Angelo.  We originally stopped because the BBQ food truck they have on the premises is rated very high, but the liquor turned out to be the real star. Hubby partook in a liquor tasting that cost $10 for multiple samples.  They have some very unique flavors that I've never heard of anyone incorporating in a liquor before.  I ordered a bourbon and lemonade drink that hit the spot in the Texas heat.  This was a Mecca for bachelorette parties and large groups of friends.  There is plenty of room on the property to spread out and enjoy the weather.  They also host concerts on their stage next to the tasting room.  They are planning to expand their offerings here, so stay tuned as to what they build!"

Small but nice distillery has tours and tastings with a large outdoor area for hanging out and a stage for occasional music acts. I didn't play but the frisbee golf looked great.  Rum, gin, fireball, and few other mixed spirits to sample.  I personally liked and purchased the gin. Low juniper the way I like it.  Odd wild eye logo is off putting but very friendly staff."

It's a small operation but they make some great rum and know how to make great drinks. This was an awesome place to sit and have a few drinks with friends.

                "description": "GF and I both came in at 1pm on a Saturday afternoon via a prior RSVP to meet Ron Yates himself and do a full tasting experience with him as our server. This experience was amazing!  The indoor tasting room is large and open, welcoming and chill. Adorned with many award-winning wines of theirs that number beyond what I could count.   We got front-of-house seats together and begin our tasting journey through several whites and reds and sparkling wines. After what had to be 10-12 wines, we honed our picks down to the 'cabernet claret' for my GF and the 'tandem' red for me. However, not one of the wines we tried did we both truly feel we hated or disliked. Normally 1-2 are an easy pass but frankly, every wine we had was very good. My GF prefers sweeter wines across the board so the fact that nearly every wine she had still pleased her was saying something.  Ron was a top-notch host and server for us. His passion and love for wine is all but very clear in his conviction to his craft, knowledge of wine science and methodology, history of the business origins, name creations and labels to the wine bottles... all of it is an adventure with him as the animated storyteller of his wines and how the grapy goodness in the bottle got there and what you can expect to experience when it hits your lips.  I have to mention that they host an annual chili cook-off event every last Saturday of Feb with live music, 15+ chili contenders, and wine tasting all day long. It's their most successful event to date each year. When he spoke of that I made plans to be there for that for sure!  Ron and the team have a solid handle on this wine thing that is for darn sure! We only barely looked over the vineyard grounds so next time we come back, its gonna be charcuterie board, wine and time out in the vines for sure!"

                "description": "I am working on a plan to visit all of the Hill Country wineries at some point. I purchased the Christmas Wine Passport to help me with this in December, and Spicewood was one of the vineyards I passed through. The experience was good. The facilities were beautiful, and it was a peaceful place to chill and relax. I got there shortly after opening, and there was only one other couple there, so I was able to get my tastings quickly and easily. The wines were good, especially their dry sparkling, but I was not moved to come home with anything. The selection I was offered was more heavy on bolder reds, and as a matter of preference I would rather have a good mixutre of reds and whites. Nevertheless, this wouldn't be a place I'd cross off my list. Their tempranillos were quite tasty, and I did like their dry sparkling wine."

                "description": "So glad we stumbled upon this beautiful winery while we were visiting the horseshoe Bay Area. Walked in on Sunday afternoon, they took us without reservations. Beautiful outdoor patio seating or you can sit inside. They have 2 tasting menus to choose from for $15 each. Hubby went for the bold reds. They don't have all white tasting but our amazing server let me taste all the sparkling wines which was so fun! The sparkling Chardonnay was my favorite. Hubby's favorite was independence and tandem.  They have charcuterie boards ($25)  or you can bring your own food. We got the charcuterie board and had a great selection of cheese."

                "description": "Upon arrival at this gem a couple years ago, we had our doubts. The few Texas wines we had tried were subpar in our view. Spicewood's offerings opened a whole new chapter in our wine lifestyle upon completing that first visit.  When we first entered their tasting room, we noticed a plethora of wine award medallions on display. Being a volunteer on the Houston Rodeo, I was especially pleased to see many Rodeo Houston awards. But that wasn't all - Spicewood has awards from wine contests all around the country! Hmmmmm...  As we proceeded through our tasting, we were immediately impressed. Texas wine? This good? Yes, indeed! So good, in fact, that I joined their wine club without hesitation and remain a member to this day.   We visited again yesterday and enjoyed complimentary tastings of six nice wines and picked up our wine club orders from the past couple of quarters. We sat on their patio overlooking the vineyard and remarked how we are so happy to have found this spot. Oh, and the people working here are gracious and genuinely friendly.  Spicewood is a tad off the beaten path, but definitely worth the trek."

We came out on a Sunday morning got a couple of tables for our family and did the $15 tasting--6 pours but all around 14% Alcohol. Most are only sold on site from what I heard.  Great for families. Nice slow pace; bring whatever food you want they welcome it."

Of course things were a little different with Covid going on but everything was spaced out and carefully planned out for everyone's safety. When we arrived Ron was in the porch helping the guests with their wine selections. He is always very nice and makes everyone feel at home. It's always nice when the owner with everything he has to do remembers your names. After our picnic we got to sit in the Wine Cellar which was awesome. Highly recommend visiting, enjoying the scenery and trying out all the great tasting wines.   Hats off to Ron and Crew!   Adrian and Cyndi"

We love wine and enjoy going to new areas to try tastings so was really excited to try this place based on their reviews but my husband and I were sadly disappointed.   I will say however that they do have an option for an estate tasting that goes for $30 which could be amazing but we decided to pass on it."

                "description": "Hmm...it has taken me over a week because I hate to say something bad about someone's business. Last Monday we stopped here after a fantastic visit to Marble Falls. We felt...tolerated...at best. We were met by 3 huge dogs who barked incessantly upon our arrival and throughout the visit. When the host finally came out he didn't offer up options for the tastings like we've experienced at other wineries. I'm pretty clear on what I like and had some ideas of wines I'd like to try with the intent of buying enough bottles to make a case of assorted bottles upon departing. The owner, who has great reviews on Yelp, either wasn't there or was busy. We didn't see this person. But we pushed through the tasting, cut it a bit short, and left much, much sooner than we'd ever imagined we would. My intuition upon arrival was to just leave. We should have done that.  This is our experience. And it just wasn't pleasant. We were the only guests yet felt we were in the way.  Hopefully, for others, their visits will be more aligned with this place's other more positive reviews."

                "description": "This vineyard has a broad range of varietals for producing their many wines.  Some are very surprising like their Tempranillo Rose, Mourvedra, Cab, and Pinot.   Since they seemed to blend grapes from outside of Texas with estate, gives their wines a different character than most I've tasted from Calif and Washington for the same grape varietal.    For non-wine items to consider, the staff is super friendly and knowledgeable, dog friendly, indoor and outdoor seating with a nice babbling brook adjacent.   They do have an event facility and would make a nice venue for any type of occasion.  They have a hearty cheese plate that won't disappoint.  I would not use the spicy cheese however."

                "description": "I was pleasantly surprised by Spicewood Vineyards.  Spicewood was originally founded by the Manigolds.  Their vision was to make wine only from estate grown grapes. They were smart when they planted their vineyard.  They analyzed the soil and only planted grape varieties that would thrive in their soil.  Nine of the original 17 acres planted by the Manigolds are still producing fruit. For Texas that means something. That means wine sourced from grapes growing on vines that are now 24 plus years old.  Ron Yates took over from the Manigolds and is now the owner of Spicewood, and with wine maker Todd Crowell is making some good Texas sourced wines.  They now have thirty two acres planted on site, and partner with other Texas grape growers.    I like that the tasting room is a bit off the common path. That means it is away from the hustle and bustle of other Hill Country wineries.  The tasting room is spacious.  It has a homey lodge like feeling that is very inviting. They also have a beautiful tree shaded outdoor space.    The staff here are like family. They are knowledgeable and friendly.  I tasted through a selection of their vast options available. I found them to be well balanced.  Surprisingly I liked their Sauvignon blanc along with other of their wines."

                "description": "My experience was a 4-5 like many of those you will see here. However, our lovely day was ruined when one of the resident dogs or a customer's dog charged us aggressively while I was walking with my 10 month old baby in my arms. I cannot be sure if it was a resident dog or a guest's dog, but it was one of the gray colored Blue Lacey's).  Regardless, the dog was unprovoked by us. I had to hand my baby to my wife while I tried to protect them from this aggressive dog, hair bristled up and darting in at me aggressively as if to bite. Luckily it didn't bite us. The dogs owner chastised me for reacting strongly in defense of my wife and baby, which really frustrated me. We immediately left and I will not be returning. I wanted to post this in case a child is attacked by a dog on their premises in the future. It is documented and the owners have been informed that their aggressive dog or lack of leash laws are creating a liability and awful experience."

                "description": "I'm badly remiss in not posting a positive review for almost a year; what's more this is one of my personal favorite wineries in Texas Hill Country.  It's time I corrected this.   Spicewood has one of my personal favorite tasting rooms; while on the inside it's nothing special, the outside grounds and seating mimic an upscale, modern country house that I could see myself living in (*cough cough* once I win the lottery *cough cough*).  There's also a cool little stream they have running through the place so you can hear the sound of running or falling water when you sit to have a sip.  Nice touch.  Spicewood's won a bunch of awards for various wines but the two standouts IMO are their 2013 Syrah and their Riesling, which has a fruity taste and a magnificent green-apple crisp bouquet.  Note: As of May 2016, their site does not show the Riesling for sale, so I'd call ahead if you want to taste it.  As an added bonus, it's only 10 minutes away from It's All Good and Opie's, both of whom have some of my favorite BBQ outside the Austin area."

The lady working at the front was really kind, offered some great suggestions given our usual taste in wine is not on the sweet side but on the dry side.  Wine. To continue, I'm not actually sure if they have anything besides sweet wines since we parted ways from our syrahs and cabs to opt for a white peach sangria slushy and a chilled sweet red blend on this very hot day. The slushy was sweet and easy to drink (maybe a little too fast) and the red was good too. Next time I'll definitely have to drink the red first then the slushy to have it make more sense to my taste buds, they got confused. I'd get both again.   Price: pretty normal prices so I don't really have much to say here. Next time I'd like to come back and get some of the cans of wine and take them with me!"

One of my friends had never done a wine tasting and had never really drank wine so I wanted her to have a great first time. Well Laurie made this AWESOME! She took the time with each of us to go over what flavors we liked and made suggestions. She was spot on. Very knowledgeable, warm, friendly and entertaining.  She also shared a map of wineries and distilleries in the area.  We loved the cool, open store/tasting bar. We all walked out with bottles that I know we are going to enjoy.  Great stop on a hot Texas day!"

The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable and is willing to give small samples so that you can get a great bottle or glass of wine if you don't want to have a tasting. Rachel, Page, Rhonda and the manager, Patrice go above and beyond to make guests feel very welcome.  Their food is excellent, too!  We were also able to meet the owner during their Grand Opening and learned about the very interesting history of the winery."

He picked us up from our Airbnb and drove us 45 mins out and back, while we blasted some rachet songs to sing haha. He would check in on us during the winery to see if we needed anything or have any questions, and he would offer to help us take multiple pictures. He also got one of the wineries to allow us to explore their cellars!   On our last day in Austin, he drove by our airbnb to pick up someone else and honked at us as we waited for our uber. We were all so happy to see him again, as we all enjoyed our experience with him.   I recommend Texas Tipsy Tours with Arlen ;)"

Arlen was our diver and was so knowledgeable and friendly. He picked us up right at the hotel in Austin. I felt the price for the experience is definitely worth it. If you were considering this experience, I highly recommend this company. They care and that is important."

From the minute I called to book to the minute I said goodbye to our driver the day of the tour they were fantastic.   So when I called there actually weren't any times available. They worked with me to make sure they had a tour time and sprinter available for our group of 6. I had a million questions; they were patient and kind.   Our group was 6 but one of my friends asked if we could add an additional person. Reached out to TTT and they said sure no problem. Literally 3 HOURS LATER I got a call that another girl tested positive with covid and wouldn't be able to come with us obviously- they were so nice and made the switch back to 6. Very grateful for their exceptional customer service.   Day of our driver Bryant was early which was great! Got on the bus and let us have free range of the radio, answered any wine questions we had or any questions about Fredericksburg. He was a fantastic host. Always texted 15 minutes till our time at the winery was up and took as many pictures as we wanted. He was so sweet! He also made sure we were never thirsty or hungry. Which for a group of girls is very important- smart man! Haha   I've heard things about other companies having hidden fees and people getting charges after leaving Fredericksburg and we had none of that. Texas Tipsy Tours was very transparent with all of their pricing and they had no hidden fees.   Thank you TTT for making our trip perfect. You won't regret booking with them."

                "description": "My experience with Texas Tipsy tours was nothing short of perfect!!! From pickup to drop-off, Courtney (the owner) made our experience amazing! When I initially started inquiring about a tour a few months ago, many of the companies only offered private tours for a minimum of 4 people. However, Texas Tipsy Tours offers small group private tours (i.e. 2-3 people). This was perfect for me. She also made planning our trip so easy, and she promptly answered all of the questions I had.   On the day of the tour, she picked us up from our hotel in Austin in an Infiniti SUV (it was very clean too)! She even made a pit stop for me at a CVS on the way to our first winery. Throughout the 6 hour tour, she made sure we stayed on schedule. She even let us change a stop last minute because we wanted to check out a brewery!  One thing that was amazing was the comfort she provided! She allowed us to pick the music, provided phone chargers, and let us control the AC! She even opened our doors for us AND dropped us off/picked us up right in front of each place we went!  Overall, I highly recommend Texas Tipsy Tours, and I will definitely be back!"

We chose the half day option and were picked up right at our vacation rental (Farmhouse on Elder Hill) We wanted to just stay nearby so we visited Driftwood Estate Winery and Fall Creek.  We were planning to also see Vista Brewing (all in Driftwood), but we chatted and laughed so much that we ran out of time and Eric, driver/owner was flexible with our change of plans and let us just extend our time enjoying the fabulous view at Driftwood Estate.  The tour service was absolutely awesome and professional.  Everything done with excellence.  Thank you Courtney and Eric!"

I have taken quite a few van tours around the hill country and Texas Tipsy Tours sets themselves apart by not just being drivers but they truly host you the entire day. I will ALWAYS use this company going forward. We did a private charter from Driftwood to Austin, TX and back and Keaton our driver was a delight. He made sure we were picked up on time and each of our stops were easy and flexible. We did a mixed tour around Driftwood and Dripping springs the next day and our guide Eric executed the BEST DAY for us. He even picked up on what we were liking and recommended a change to our final stop to Vista Brewing and we were SO glad he did. At each stop he made sure we had plenty of water, snacks and chairs to enjoy the gorgeous venues. This is totally above and beyond what we would have expected from a driver. Courtney was so easy to work with and she helped make recommendations for our group ultimately making our weekend get away FLAWLESS. I promise if you don't use this company, you're wrong."

It was as easy as getting on the phone, explaining what I wanted, and Courtney took care of literally everything else. We picked the breweries we wanted and even included a food stop. She coordinated the bus pick up, drop offs, schedule, and even reserved tables for us at each stop. I love that we had our own bus (very nice one, by the way!), and had the flexibility to create our own tour based on beers and food my husband liked. It was the perfect Saturday in Austin! Payment was very easy as well - they sent me an invoice to my email and I was able to pay directly online for everything. Highly recommend, and thank you Texas Tipsy Tours!"

Would highly recommend if you're looking for a relaxed tasting without the hubbub of big party buses, AND if you're looking for a more personalized experience with people who can really throw a party. Fredericksburg can be confusing because of the many, many options, so Courtney's expertise in the wineries proved incredibly helpful. Highly recommend!!"

We were staying in the adorable town of Wimberley so I researched tours in the area.  Jodie's Taste of the Hills Tour got great reviews and went to wineries close to the Wimberley area. The day of the tour ended up being chilly and rainy. As soon as Jodie pulled up with her spectacular shuttle-like van she was out like a flash with pretty umbrellas for us! We went to 3 different wineries which we thoroughly enjoyed! After the first one, we returned to Jodie's vehicle and she had a gorgeous tray for us of cheese,  sausage,  crackers,  grapes,  olives, dips.....simply divine!!! The tour was also just the 2 of us and we loved that Jodie still did ALL of this for a tour that I believe takes up to 12 people! The next time we plan a trip to the Hill Country we are going to do one of Jodie's Beer tours!! We had such great conversations with Jodie too! Thank you sooooo much for the GREAT time! Sooooo much fun!"

Thanks again, Jodie! I highly recommend Taste of the Hills to everyone."

                "description": "Amazing tour!!! My wife and I came into Wimberley during Spring Break to relax from teaching and this was the perfect trip to do so! Jodie made us all feel like we were old friends, even though we had never met anyone else on the bus.  She was very detailed with the stories of each winery, and explained all the different varietals, answering our every question along the way. The bus was very comfortable and clean, and she stored each bottle we purchased until the trip was over, but we could have had the bottles on the bus had we chosen to.  The wineries all seemed to know her, so they were expecting us and were incredibly friendly. We were not rushed anywhere, and still managed to make it back into town to enjoy shopping on the square.  My wife and I were pretty hungry by the time we had lunch, since we didn't have breakfast, but the tapas style lunch was perfect for the glass of wine we purchased to have with it. The lunch was delicious and filling.  Overall this was an amazing experience and I will be recommending this tour to everyone I know."

Jodie is such a pleasant and inviting soul. She asked about each person's preferences as to be able to personalize the tour and pick which wineries she decided to take us too.  She is very knowledgeable of the town and the wineries.  The lunch she provides is just amazing. By the time we were done I felt like I had made an incredible new friend. I can't wait to go back and do more tours."

We were fortunate enough to have great people touring with us, and it made the tour all the more fun.  She prepared the best picnic lunch I've ever had.  Sugar Shack cake balls, meats, cheeses, crackers, hummus, a goat cheese something served on crackers (that I LOVED, and I hate goat cheese), spinach feta rolls, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something.  She was fully prepared for everything.  Boxes for the wine we bought, umbrellas in case in rained (it didn't), plenty of water...this wine tour couldn't have been more perfect if she tried.  Thanks, Jodie!"

She provided an excellent variety of foods including a hot portion and gluten-free (just in time `cause I was lit after the 1st vineyard). The three vineyards for that day were selected based on the wine preferences of the tourists that day (A+ perk). We never felt pushed or obligated to buy wines, but we all did because they were very good (!), and Jodie kept our purchases organized and stored for us. She also gave a good background on each vineyard and on the Wimberley area in general. We learned a lot about Wimberley and wine and were able to get tipsy knowing Jodie was an excellent driver of her comfy bus. And have you been to Wimberley? That hilly countryside is beautiful!"

Our tour was originally scheduled for 10:30a, but got pushed back to 1:15p due to shuttle trouble (we had the option to receive our money back, but actually liked the later time).  We stopped at three wineries, including Driftwood Estate and Duchman Family Winery.  The views at all of the wineries varied, but each were unique to their locations.  Jodie provided an amazing picnic-style lunch, including a charcuterie (meat and cheese) board, chicken salad, nuts, walnut and feta salad, grapes, chocolate cake balls, bottled water, etc. At the second stop, Jodie was kind enough to call in people's orders to Salt Lick BBQ and had it all ready to take home by the third stop.

She gave us a lot of background information on the wineries as well as the town of Wimberley. She had a delicious assortment of snacks for us to munch on while we rode to and from each winery. She helped package our wine purchases and brought us umbrellas as it started to rain. She even went the extra mile, literally, and drove us back to our hotel since it was raining as we had walked to our meeting spot earlier in the day. We had another couple on the tour with us which was really nice since we had people to mingle with. It was a very personal experience and I felt as though we were all just great friends spending an afternoon together. Who needs Napa, everything is better in Texas!!! We will definitely be repeat customers."

                "description": "So first....let me say that our group totally dropped the ball on planning.  We reached out to Carla 3-4 weeks before but did not confirm until the week of the wine tour.   By the grace of the \"wine\" Gods, Carla could fit us in her schedule!  She is completely open to letting you choose your places or you can follow her lead!   She picked us up at our accommodations which were several miles outside of Fredricksburg.  We did introductions and she laid out the things that were already scheduled for the day.  On our way to the first winery, we decided to \"reroute\" the tour to hit some lesser known spots.  TBH, we were excited for Carla's recommendations.    Our first stop was Six Shooter because of their variety of dry wines, sweet wines and meads.  You have to try the Jalapeno shooter!!!  SO GOOD!   Second, we made our tour time at Real Ale and did a beer tasting. Third, she realized the majority of our groups like Whiskey, so we stopped at Andalusia Whiskey in Blanco!  This place met the needs of our entire group (even the non-whiskey drinker) and was by far the most unique stop of their day!  If you go here, try the Cherry Cola cocktail!   We stopped for lunch at Pecan Street Brewing in Johnson City, where we drank lots of water and had really great food.   Our last stop of the tour was Zero815 Winery which had a cool mix of wines and friendly staff.   At the end of the day, Carla made sure that we made it back to our accommodations safe and sound.  We had the very best time and she knows some of the coolest places that you might miss without her expertise.  She was extremely professional and very down to earth.  She was always around to help with recommendations or just to snap photos of the group!     We highly recommend doing a tour with Carla and Texas Wine and Spirit Tours!   You won't be disappointed!   We'll be booking with her again the next time we are in the area!"

The weather was pretty bad that morning, so we started a little late, but the van that they have is really, really nice, clean, and spacious. She even has a little stool in case you need help getting into the van, and she helps everyone get in and get out. We went to three places around the Johnson City area. The first one was a quick tasting, the second one we learned A LOT about wine and got a lesson in how to properly drink wine, and at the third winery we got the most interesting history lesson about President Johnson and Lady Bird Johnson from the winemaker himself. Leslee personally knows the places and owners and was just the best tour guide. One of the places on the tour where we were supposed to also eat dinner at cancelled due to the weather, but Leslee was quick to find a different place for us to go to. She took us to a cute cafe in downtown Johnson City where we ate a ridiculously good dinner. We even went to Leslee and her husband's bar at the end of the day for one last drink and got a chance to meet her sweet daughter as well. I thoroughly enjoyed the tour with Leslee and highly recommend D'Vine Tours!"

The points of interest were superb and the last stop we made provided one of the best meals I've had in my life and most likely the best ribeye ever.

                "description": "First I would like to start with the facts.  1. We booked this tour months ago but unfortunately had to reschedule to a later date. (due to Covid19) This was not an issue for anyone attending the tour and the company got all $2800 paid for in full. 2. Yes $2800. We had 28 people in our group, It required two buses that were at their max capacity.  3. I would give a HUGE ZERO if I could.   The buses arrived at the pick up location 25 minutes early and expected us (all 28) to load up. Not all 28 people were even there yet. The male driver already seemed annoyed at this point.  We ended up pulling out at the agreed on time. When trying to leave the 2nd winery we couldn't. The drivers HAD LEFT and weren't there to pick us up. We waited outside in the sun outside for 30 minutes before they even got back.  But that unfortunately is not why I am writing this review   As we were loading the bus to go home the male driver said that would be charging us for a cleaning fee ($300) because someone spilt something on the floorboard. Pretty steep for a small spill that could be wiped up with a Clorox wipe but she agreed to pay it she sat down. Comments started to be exchanged about the steep fee and how the day had been complete chaos up until this point. The man began to get pretty heated and slammed the door. When he opened the door to his seat he said \"who the f**k spilt something in my seat.\" Nobody had spilled something on his seat. Upon looking at the \"spill\" it appeared to be sweat from Him. He continued to cuss and yell and eventually told us to \"get off his bus.\" We all piled off and the other bus also unloaded.  Now it is important to note the other driver said we didn't do anything wrong and that she didn't agree with how he was handling things. He told her he was in charge and that he would make the call. She became quiet after that. They ultimately left us there to find our own rides.  The male driver was rude and didn't speak unless spoken to the entire day. A beautiful day with amazing company was RUINED by this company and I will not recommend them to anyone!"

                "description": "I booked a birthday trip for 6 people, hoping to add 2 more. Dale told me I could book the trip for 6 and then add the 2. When I called to add the 2 he told me he would have to see if that was even possible. I didn't understand why after he assured me it would be fine and a sprinter van hold more than that. He had given the sprinter van to a larger crowd and downgraded us to an SUV without asking me (same price). I asked him when I would hear back and he said whenever he located another vehicle. I made some calls and found a better business who really wanted to host me and our guests. I called again to cancel with Dale and was told I am not the type of customer he would want. I guess a customer who wants to pay more money to add more people isn't good... very strange. Talking to a woman like that is not ok. I hope that he was having a bad few days and that he doesn't always behave like this, but I was really shocked how rude and unprofessional he was. Pros: I got my money back."

                "description": "One of the WORST experiences I have ever had with a \"wine tour\" company. I have been on many wine tours in my days, across different parts of Texas, and their unprofessionalism and lack of customer service and just blatant disrespect was appalling.   This \"wine tour\" had a total of two buses and a party consisting of 28 people. A group of people that I have known for years that have the utmost of respect and common courtesy for any company that they hire or work with.   From the start of our experience, both drivers were incredibly rude and unfriendly. The bus lacked any amenities one would think this \"Premier Hill Country Wine Tasting Experience\" would consist of.  The first winery.  * We arrived at the first winery at 10:48am to learn that the winery doesn't even open until 11:00am and that they WEREN'T expecting us at all... * Not the wineries fault. They were fantastic.  The second winery.  * Again, wasn't expecting us, causing us to have to sit at a tent down a road from the winery. Again, not the wineries fault, they handled it incredibly.  * When trying to leave the second winery, we couldn't. The drivers HAD LEFT and weren't there to pick us up. We waited outside in the sun outside for 30 minutes before they even got back.  The third winery.  * As we were loading the bus to go home, the male driver said that they would be charging us for a cleaning fee ($300) because someone spilled something on the floorboard. Pretty steep for a small spill that could be wiped up with a Clorox wipe, but she agreed to pay it. (*To clarify, open containers were allowed as stated on their website: \"Consumption of alcohol on the bus is allowed unless there are minors present.\") Minor spills like this are inevitable when providing a service as they do. Comments started to be exchanged about the steep fee and how the day had been complete chaos up until this point. The man began to get pretty heated and slammed the door. When he opened the door to his seat he said \"who the f**k spilt something in my seat.\" Nobody had spilled something on his seat. Upon looking at the \"spill\" it appeared to be sweat from him. He continued to cuss and yell and eventually told us to \"get off his bus.\" We all piled off, and the other bus also unloaded.  I know these times are hard, especially for small and locally owned businesses, and by no means and am I trying to make it harder for them; in fact, I am going above and beyond to support them. After yesterday, I do think that they need to take a step back and re-evaluate their actions and really think long and hard about what they do and why they do it. In the end, when providing a service, the client always comes first."

To be honest, the cost seemed a bit high at first but having never been on a wine tour before and I really had no idea. Afterward I realize it was worth every bit of it. Dale picked us up at our BnB along with everyone else on the tour that day and we were off to the first tasting.  He seem to know everyone along the tour and at each place they were very welcoming and grateful to have our group. It really was a fun time and we had the chance to try many different wines that we would not have normally picked.  Lucky for us it was a beautiful day and everything was just perfect. I would definitely recommend this tour to anyone interested in checking out some Texas wines, for a nice weekend getaway, or just to try something different.  It definitely helped that we had a good group of people who were also on the tour that day as well. It was a blast...I just wish we had taken more pictures."

First off, Dale is a pretentious, \"underpaid monkey\" as he likes to be called. He is rude, unprofessional, and has the audacity to 'hate mail' potential clients and I know I'm not the first one because I've seen the reviews! I don't have much else to say but be careful and do your research before spending any money on this place! The owner seems to not have a care in the world if it's not benefitting him. Also, be ready for rude phone calls and emails from Dale if he doesn't get his way. He was hard to get ahold of from the jump, not to mention I live out of town and couldn't wait for days in between responses. After not being able to make it to my appointment because he had failed to get back to me promptly, I proceeded on with my day. The next morning I wake up to the most rude, despicable email I've ever received. Just be careful and read reviews because from what I've read, if you want a beautiful wedding with NICE, FRIENDLY people, this isn't the place. I'll attach one of many emails. STAY AWAY FROM THE HEART OF TEXAS RANCH ALL TOGETHER!!!"

Picked us up at our hotel in Fredericksburg, went to pick up lunch, and then on to first of 4 wineries. She took care of everything. Even loaded up our bottles/goodies in the back of the bus and kept the AC on to keep it all cool.  Christy went above and beyond to keep everything organized, she set up our lunch, picked up our trash, offered to take us anywhere we wanted to go, and she kept us on time to all of our tastings. We bought a bottle of wine at the 3rd winery and drank in the bus on the way to the 4th. Lunch was a boxed lunch bought at local deli (very good). Everything was included. Everything was professional. The bus was large and comfy. Highly recommend this tour company!"

It was raining that day and he had an umbrella to escort everyone in and out of the tasting rooms so no one got soaked.

We went to a store in downtown marble falls, an art studio, a grocery store and at the very end an actual winery. This constituted our day.   This is NOT a day of going to wineries in the hill country. Everyone was disappointed on Valentine's day.   The guy who led the tour was nice but they clearly got kickbacks where we went.   When we went to lunch no one got their order and right when we were leaving this sandwich shop the tour guide asked, \"everyone went to the tasting room, right?\" We're talking about a sandwich place being a stop on the wine tour people.   Horribly disappointed. Considering tastings were at most $10 for each of the four \"wineries\" we went to, it was a rip off in value.  The company clearly avoided going to respectable wineries and instead went to dead end places where they could maximize their profit margin.   Avoid at all costs!!"

                "description": "We wanted to book a party bus to do a distillery tour. I did not have a lot of information on the distilleries and Daniel was incredibly helpful when figuring out where we should go. We had 19 people on the bus and we had SO much fun. The bus was super clean, Daniel was great and we had the best time. We originally had the bus for 5 hours but Daniel was nice enough to let us add an additional hour to our trip for just a small charge. I would recommend ThunderDome Party Bus to anyone.   We definitely want to plan another trip in the summertime to go floating.  Thanks Daniel!!!"

The bus was on time, and even made accommodations to pick up a second group at a different stop. The bus itself was spacious and clean, and everyone had an awesome time! Once we were done floating, the bus conveniently picked us up at the exit of the river. I would highly recommend Thunderdome for big group parties."

                "description": "This review is long overdue.  I booked the Thunderdome Party Bus for a bachelor party back in May 2017.  The bus was perfect!! Seated our group of 15 comfortably.  The stereo system was bumping, and Daniel, our amazing driver, had no issue with us turning it up to 11.  Our group was most guys in their 30's and Daniel gave us good recommendations on spots to check out that were age appropriate.  In between spots, Daniel drove me to a gas station to help me restock on beer. He even came in and helped me carry and load beers into the coolers.  Great communicate from Daniel from beginning to end, and he someone found the perfect spot to pick us up on busy Rainey St at the end of the night.   Great value and great experience.  Highly recommend."

What a surprise when he told us!  Didn't see that coming.  Three great tastings with good friends.  Discovered some very nice 2015 Texas wines.  The grapes have matured immensely since 2008 and glad to finally enjoy some good Texas wines.   Can't recommend this company any lower than *****!  Thank you Discovery Wine Tours for a memorable afternoon."

He called me a couple of days before to introduce himself and to confirm the pickup details. He also called me the day of and was on time. He made sure we were settled at each location and made it a great experience. Felt very safe - John wore a mask the whole time. Also, Kathie helped plan the itinerary. She's familiar with the wineries and distilleries in the area, and was very friendly. Couldn't recommend them more!"

                "description": "I was so impressed with this tour the first time we booked that I had to book it for another party! Well, this time it wasn't as impressive. I don't know if the business has just gotten bigger than the owners can handle but communication was subpar. It took several calls and emails to get answers sometimes.   At our first tour, Kathie took tons of photos and would pose us at the wineries. This tour, we had to prompt her. It was a cloudy day so not the best for outdoor pics but I was disappointed we took most of them ourselves or had to ask her to take the pictures.   Our tour was April 11, it is now almost 2 mths later I haven't received the few pictures we took. I emailed twice and have finally heard back that the SD is apparently not working. I'm not sure why I had to email to find this out, seems like this info should have been divulged as soon as the problem presented itself.   I hate to downgrade the star review but my second time with this company just wasn't as epic as the initial tour I took with them. The wineries all seem to love this company though."

DTWT was very accommodating, scheduled the wineries we wanted to see, ordered the lunches, and then confirmed our selections a couple of days prior to our tour. At the last minute after visiting with a couple in our third stop, we changed our fourth stop to a different winery. Jason (our driver) was happy to accomodate us. My only regret is that we didn't choose a few wineries a little further out of town, so we could spend more time in the limo listening to our Willie Nelson songs. Jason was awesome, and I highly recommend this tour."

                "description": "We started researching half-day wine tours for my BFF's bachelorette party several months in advance and chose this company because of its good reviews and cancellation policy (full refund up to 7 days in advance).   First, the bad news. The booking process is way more arduous than it should be. My initial discussion about the tour plans happened over the phone, so I asked for a written, e-mail confirmation of what we had discussed - specifically how the deposit and refund policies work. It took me more than three weeks to get that first e-mail confirmation of our booking and deposit payment. I then went back and forth, back and forth, back and forth with the company, hammering out the details, like setting a pickup location and our choices for the winery stops. Many times, three weeks would pass and I'd have to make multiple attempts before I would get a response to my e-mails. Sometimes, the responses would be incomplete and we'd repeat the process of trying to get information confirmed. Seriously a pain for an experience that costs $129 per person.   Now, the good news. The online payment portal for each attendee was a breeze to use and eliminated the need to handle money all through one person. As for the actual tour itself, we couldn't have asked for a better experience. Our driver, Bobby, was on time and wonderful on the day of the tour. He was funny and polite and had good knowledge of the area. Also, very importantly, he was a good and safe driver! The Mercedes bus we took was very clean and spacious, and they provided water, cups and napkins. They also allowed us to bring our own food onto the bus. The three wineries we visited, Driftwood Estate, Duchman and Fall Creek, were all accommodating and fun. The views were lovely and we never felt rushed and made it back on time. It was raining when we got back to our car, and Bobby was so nice and helped us get our stuff back into our car in the pouring rain.   All in all, despite a wonderful wine tour, I'm not sure I would recommend this company, only because I spent way too much time hounding them throughout the booking process. While the wine was excellent, I NEEDED to drink after dealing with their horrible communication. Discover Texas Wines should strongly consider re-evaluating their communication practices and hire more people to keep up with the demand for their service. It's the only way they will stay competitive in the long-run!"

I made the reservation back in January, gave my card for deposit and was told I'd be emailed a link for everyone to pay. Over the next two months I called and emailed asking about the link so my friends could pay their part and I was repeatedly told they were having issues. Okay fine, no big deal- I also emailed again saying we can just pay the day of if the link wasnt working and never received a response. The day before our tour, as I was driving from Dallas to Fredericksburg I get a call from Some guy at the company and he seemed very annoyed with me saying no one had paid yet. Um.. I'm sorry I didn't realize you finally sent it after months of my asking. (He had sent it the day before calling me to tell me no one had paid) The vehicle I requested was not the one that showed up. The driver Julia was late bc she did not write the address down correctly. We also had 3 girls cancel last minute, so we were down to 5 instead of 8. Considering there minimum is 5 I wasn't expecting that to be a problem but Julia felt the need to bring it up multiple Times as if it caused some inconvenience for her. Rude people, horrible communication."

Organizing a full day wine tour for 50 people in the Texas Hill Country may not sound like an easy task, but Noel at Discover Texas Wine Tours made it smooth and most importantly, unforgettable. His main goal is to make sure everyone is comfortable and has a good time! Most companies were not able to host a group this size, but Noel made it happen. He made sure our bus was the best he could find, worked to have a lunch catered for us at one of the stops, set up private tastings with many of the wineries to accommodate a group our size, even stopped to let one of the guys who didn't drink wine buy some beer. I can't say enough good things about Noel and how hard he worked for our group. I highly recommend him and look forward to another tour with him soon!!"

                "description": "I rented a party bus through this company a couple weeks ago. In the beginning, Robert was extremely accommodating and friendly. And our driver, Terrell, was great. We got dropped off at COTA for a show and had a great time!  But where it turned south was at the end of the night. I texted our driver 30 minutes before we needed to be picked up (like he requested) and he said no problem. Then we left the concert and were walking to the pickup spot where I gave him a call. He said he got in an accident but would only be 20 minutes and I said that's fine. 20 minutes roll by and I gave him a call again, no answer, but texted and said it would be another 20 minutes. We ended up waiting in the cold for almost an hour and well after most people had left COTA. Multiple people in our party ended up just taking ubers because they didn't want to wait. The whole point of a bus is so you don't have to wait.  The next day, I texted Robert saying we would like a refund for the extra hour we paid for waiting that we wouldn't have used if we had been picked up on time. He said he would call to discuss but never did. I've now sent him multiple emails - mind you, being incredibly nice about it. All I asked for was an hour refunded back - not the whole thing, not even half. But still no response.  The customer service level of this company is terrible should anything go wrong. So hire them at your own risk."

It was also Prom weekend so the schedule was packed for them but they still took care of us and worked with our schedule.   Our boat ended up staying out on the water longer than scheduled which through our plans all over the place and Robert was there waiting on time. Given his packed schedule, the driver did have to leave without us but Robert made sure to get me in contact with another service and they sent a bus over right away.   All in all, it was an incredible experience!"

Missing panels inside of bus missing or duct tape together.  Another party bus parked next to the one we had and it was so obvious how terrible looking our bus looked.   Can't believe owners would let this bus represent their company. Hope they use our $700 toward getting it fixed.   Driver was pleasant."

They also provided ice, cups and a cooler for us so we didn't have to worry about taking our own. I would definitely recommend them, and will do business with them again. Thank you Robert for the awesome service and thank you Walker (our driver) for keeping up with my crazy friends and brining us home safe."

                "description": "I'm incredibly frustrated with this business.  We had spoken a couple times in the months before I decided to book and I initially felt great about potentially booking with these friendly people.  When it came time to book I called them and was told, once again, that our requested date was open and we talked out an agreement.  The owner tells me we're good to go, and that all he needed me to do now was to send him my information so that he could get a contract sent that same day.  I'd explained to him that I was booking this bus ride to and from a party boat, and that I would be booking with them that day as well.   SO, I get off the phone and send my info.  I call my party boat folks to let them know I've just confirmed my bus, and I'm ready for a boat.  I book with them based on my discussion with these guys and put down $400 to hold our reservation.  It's been two weeks since I last spoke with this company and they have ignored my calls, texts, voicemails trying to figure out why the contract hasn't come through.  Our event is next month, and at this point I've been researching new solutions, and unfortunately the new solution means I can't use the same boat company, and therefore I've lost my $400 deposit.  I did not have this money to lose, but after being ghosted by this company I guess I have to take the loss and move on.  They seem like nice people, and it takes A LOT to get on here and write a negative review, but this has caused me a lot of stress and I want to prevent this from happening to anyone else.  I hope at some point I find out a reasonable explanation and can revise this review, but not counting on it.  We'll see I guess."

But how is that supposed to work when you have a huge group? I called austin nites party rentals for a few reasons 1. I love puns and 2. I'm am austinite and 3. My group was over ten people and we wanted to go out and have nothing to worry about. Great party bus, great personable driver, great experience definitely reccomend these guys!! DONT DRINK AND DRIVE!! Call someone you can trust call Austin Nites!!"

                "description": "BOOK WITH THIS COMPANY!  Robert did a solid job taking me and a bunch of my friends to Lake Travis and back on July 4th. His price was WAY lower than other companies I called, being the ONLY one that actually sticked to his regular prices during this busy day. He arrived early and was 100% responsive to my emails and phone calls. He arrive early to pick us up and was extremely friendly and professional. He helped us carry our coolers and accommodate everything on the bus.  The bus itself is amazing. Seats are stacked in two rows facing each other, which is great for dancing and socializing, since you are actually facing half of the crowd. The sound system is also very good. I almost feel that the bus trip was even more fun that the boat.   In summary, Austin Nites Ent. is the best on price/quality, Robert and his wife are responsive, professional and friendly, and the whole experience I had with them is positive. Would highly recommend anyone to use it, and will definitely consider using them again if I ever need to.  Thank you guys!!!!!"

I called about 10 other companies looking for fun and safe travels with almost all of them being ridiculously overpriced to take advantage of the prom goers. Robert was very accommodating, professional, and had awesome rates. He called two days before the scheduled time of arrival to check in and verify everything was still good to go. He asked if there were any changes in the amount of people and offered a bigger bus just in case. Our drivers, Patrick and Joe were awesome! Patrick called me early the day of to verify everything and let me know he'd be there at 8 and then called again when they were almost to our pickup location. They arrived right on time with an awesome bus just for us. He had coolers with ice, a flat screen tv, music system, AC and even a bathroom in the back. What more could you ask for? Part of the evening was spent at Graham's Central Station in Pville. We didn't realize prior that Graham's doesn't serve food anymore and had to order pizza to the bus. Patrick gladly retrieved our pizza and brought it to us when it arrived. We all had a blast, felt safe and were taken care of. Highly recommend Austin NItes and shout out to Patty PartyWagon, if you had a Yelp page, I'd write a review for you too."

Sam, the owner and driver, was unbelievable. Very accommodating, great driver, and super chill.   We planned to hit up the Salt Lick on the party bus and then venture around to some breweries afterwards. Sam made sure that the group got where we needed to be on time, had great suggestions for breweries, and made sure we were having as much fun as possible.  The bus is great. Fit everyone comfortably with enough room for a cooler in between all of us. Sam had her playlist turned up or she would hand over the AUX cord and we could play our tracks as loud as we wanted. The whole experience was incredibly laid back and worry free. I would absolutely recommend Cool bus ATX to anyone that wants to have a great time with a big group in Austin.   On a side note, if it is Sunday, make sure that you buy beer on Saturday because they don't sell it on Sunday before noon.   Thanks again, Sam!"

The grapes used for their wines are locally grown and processed.    Also, if you have a couple hours to spare, then take their Winemaker's Tour and Tasting.  Our tour guide, Greg, is very knowledgeable and he will keep you entertained throughout the entire tour.  My current favorite is their 2018 Racker's Blend which is a mix of all their leftover reds of that season and a close second would be their Malbec.  All their wines are great though!  Overall, a beautiful vineyard with amazing atmosphere and people!  A must go if you're in the area."

                "description": "Perissos is in a beautiful location in the Texas Hill Country, and it is a good place to get delicious wine and kind, friendly service. I went with my family the week before Christmas, and as the only one doing a tasting (the only drinker), I was able to enjoy wine while they set up a picnic outside in the beautiful setting. The winery has a lot of picnic tables to sit and enjoy among the scenery, which includes a lot of labeled vines. The inside is spacious and tastefully-decorated, and the staff is so nicel I especially loved talking with the blonde from Kentucky - I wish I had gotten her name! My favorite wine was the rosé for sure. I liked it so much that I paused my tasting to enjoy a glass with my lunch, then resumed with the others. I find different places suit my preferences differently, and Perissos is filed in my mind for their rosé. But don't get me wrong - all of their wines are quality, and this place should definitely be on your Hill Country tour!"

The property and the facility are really top notch.  The atmosphere was great. There was seating inside but it was a nice day so we sat in the shade under an oak tree.  Dalton helped us mostly and he steered us in the right direction. Everything we tasted was good. We preferred some wines over others but really didn't have anything bad.  We're looking forward to a return visit!"

I told her I like semi-sweet, there were no semisweet wines on there tasting menu but still she poured one instead of wherever there was on a menu and I absolutely loved it, it's like she read my taste:) All the wines on the tasting menu was good, they taste like they describe it. They have few tables outside with shade, it's so calm, peaceful and nice place to enjoy the wine. Will be back soon, Definitely visit this place!"

                "description": "OMG !!! Be there or be square. If you like wine; If you like to drink wine; If you want to drink wine in an absolutely gorgeous setting, plan a day to come to Perissos vinyard. We have had the pleasure of visiting vinyards in Tuscany, Italy and this rekindles those memories. It is an easy ride. You enter through the vinyard and arrive at the beautiful tasting building and picnic table area under the live oaks. This has become a family destination for special celebrations, usually birthdays. We usually bring our snacks, sandwiches etc. The tasting room is beautiful. Their wines are world class. We usually purchase bottles of Montepulciano and Temperillo but have sampled others and they are all exceptional. Our usual mode of transportation is our personal vehicles but on one occasion, we rented a limo (Good idea). The place is pooch and kid friendly as well. You will never be disappointed."

We were lucky that visitors had the option of wine tasting booths outside or buying a glass/bottle inside. Considering it was so busy, their lines moved fairly quickly. Having not been before, we opted to purchase a bottle and relax on the grounds since it was a beautiful day. The bottle was $50 and it was a mediocre wine. Not the best, but not the worst. They might have better options than the one we chose. The setting was beautiful and the guitarist they had playing outside was fantastic. Worth a day trip!"

                "description": "I have never not loved a winery and the tasting experience... until now. I went with a few girlfriends for a birthday party. We ended up having to wait on another party for almost two hours. They were running late, then had wrong directions... it was a family birthday outing for them as well so we were trying to be gracious but dang... it was over two hours and we only got an ounce of complimentary wine to hold us over. The location is lovely and the live music was great. The winery was packed full of couples, dogs here and there and locals. There was a fun bachelorette group there as well. We finally got started on the pairings and I must say that I literally thought it was a joke. Dorito dust on a piece of shaving of a commercial block of cheese, a tough stale piece of beef jerky that I stuck in my purse and brought home to my dog who had been at home waiting on me for hours and he doesn't turn down anything edible or non edible for that matter but he wanted nothing to do with the pairing jerky. The wine pours were the weakest I've ever tasted. Jeremy was nice but he just didn't bring it. We all left starving and thirsty. We all four agreed that it was a long drawn out one hitter quitter.  The customer service and personable attention just was not there. We finished with a half a mini s'more and were so ready to get back to our weekend lake house and enjoy our own wines and snacks.  I would definitely revamp the tasting menu and be a little bit more generous with the pours, especially if you make a pre paid group of ladies celebrating a birthday wait to get started at 5:30 when we rushed to all get there by 2:45 to start at 3.."

                "description": "We've been visiting this winery for several years.  Every time we are in the area we take time to stop by there for a wine tasting.  The location is beautiful and the buildings, grounds and vines are very reminiscent of the wineries and villas around Tuscany.  In addition to a lovely wine tasting room, they have outdoor seating, which as been especially delightful during the Covid issues.  They encourage people to bring their own cheese and crackers, fruit, or whatever else they like to enjoy while tasting their wines.    We opened one of their 2015 reds to accompany our Christmas dinner.  It was the perfect accompaniment for lamb chops.  That bottle of wine rivaled not only Texas and California wines.  It was better than any wine we've tried in Italy, France or Germany.  That's saying something.    Sometimes, we make up reasons to be in that area for an excuse to stop by and say \"hi\" to the incredibly friendly and knowledgeable staff and owners.  Several of the staff have been there for as long a we've been visiting, which is about ten years.  It is truly a family business, and it's always a joy to visit.  They make everyone feel like family."

                "description": "Perissos exceeded my expectations!! Its my new favorite vineyard in Texas. Out of all Hill Country wineries I've visited, this is most reminiscent of Napa. From literally first moment you drive in, you're surrounded by unending acres of vines. As you venture in, you'll see vineyards galoreandits breathtakingly beautiful. Great photo-op!  LOCATION/ATMOSPHERE: About an hour out from Austin, its close enough for day trip. Its also right by Inks Lake, so take a detour if you want nature too. Tasting room itself is nice- very clean, modern, and country-like with stone walls, wood tablesandindustrial steel chairs. Outside are many picnic tables on a shaded porch or under big trees, so enjoy sipping your wine while looking out at the gorgeous view...nothing like Hill Country! Very laid back.  WINE: Tasting menu is preset ($15 for 6), but offers well-balanced variety. I'm generally not a fan of pre-set menus because there's typically at least a few I will not like. But I loved Perissos' menu and found it to be a strong pre-set (preface: I love wine, specifically dry wine, so my opinion may vary from your palette). All 6 are exceptionally smoothandeasy to drink. Whether light, medium, or full-bodied, my friends and I were thoroughly impressed with each. Each wine is substantial, boasting many wonderful notes. My favorite was the 2015 Racker's Blend. It is made with 8 different redsandpacked with flavor, yet so easy to drink and delightfully smooth with silky long finish. Pours are decent size. All wines 100% Texas grown. Great value tasting!   SERVICE: Excellent! We were immediately greeted by the sweetest lady upon entry. Our server was attentive and came back often to check on us. She was great at not rushing the tasting, letting us enjoy our wine. She also gave detailed descriptions/history of wine before each pour, which I definitely appreciated.  Overall, I absolutely loved Perissos! It is so adorable and perfect escape from the city. I could easily spend the whole afternoon here on a beautiful Texas day...oh wait, I did! Come here for a day-trip getaway and gorgeous views, chill vibes, good wine!"

                "description": "A good family-owned vineyard, with some fine wines.  All in all a pleasant stop if you're on the Texas wine hunt!  Perissos is located somewhat off the usual 'Texas Wine Trail' along the 290, as it's in Burnet County and relatively isolated from fellow wineries.  Either coming south off 29 or west off 281, the route Park Road 4 is one of the prettiest in Hill Country.   The location is more functional than luxurious, as the tastings take place in a sort of upscale barn-style facility.  However the views off the deck are quite nice and one can see the horses that the family keeps on-site.  Flights cost $15 for six wines on a single pre-selected list.  The selections vary in flavor, and of course YMMV with any recommendation.  But of special mention is their 2015 Fiore Secco, which is a variant of Muscat with notes of ginger and honey.  Also recommended is their cheese plate, which nicely complements their wine.  While I'd have liked some more flexibility in what one could try with a flight, this is a definite recommend so far as a place to try local Texas wine product!"

We walked in on a Sunday afternoon for the $15 tasting and found the grounds beautiful, all the occupants friendly and knowledgeable, and the wine definitely up to our standards.  The tasting included 6 wines (ranging from sweeter white to dry reds) made from Texas-sourced grapes and rather than having you stand at a bar they have table service. The bottles themselves are reasonably priced and the wine club would be a definite investment if we lived a few hours closer."

One drawback right now is that you have to order at the counter, which can get a little chaotic and covid-unfriendly. You also have to touch the doors to go in and out every time you get a new wine for your tasting. It's not ideal, but under normal circumstances, it would be fine. Def recommend."

The wines have begun to sing...they are really coming into their own. The Syrah is one of my favorites. The menu changes frequently and I like that. I'm usually tempted by one of the entrees, but I typically end up with one of the pizzas. They are always delicious. Piping hot out of the pizza oven with a crispy crust. My boyfriend had the sea bass and he said it was delicious. We had another great night and look forward to our next visit."

Our service was impeccable- a very nice waitress who was attentive throughout the meal from the beginning to the end. Avocado wrapped with cheese was great, as well as as a shrimp lemon pasta dish. Everything except the bacon wrapped dates. I think the bacon wrapped dates would have been enjoyed if we expected date paste, rather than whole stuffed dates as we are accustom to being served as an appetizer.   Our wine was $49 a bottle.  Unfortunately, it had much too much sentiment and was not the best wine.  I am not familiar with the pricing of Texas wines, but basically for fine restaurant, it was not as nice as the decor, service or food. Yes we plan on going back!"

The wood-fired margarita pizza was fresh and delicious, accompanied by a baked Brie with fruit and marmalade which was fantastic.  But the real surprise was the Flat Creek Cabernet Sauvignon, a Texas wine that really delivers.  Final word?  We came back the next night for the filet mignonette and salmon.  My wife loved the salmon and the filet was cooked to perfection, one of the best, most tender I've ever enjoyed.  Noah did a great job taking care of us and the proprietor, Rick, was a pleasure to meet and chat with.  Highly recommend!"

                "description": "Hey, you know how the line at Bluebonnet Cafe sucks? Walk 20 feet over to this hidden gem instead!  Flat Creek is a strangely fascinating find. The exterior looks like a 1970's strip mall. The parking lot is cracked and disjointed, with room for perhaps 10 cars. To call it unassuming would be an understatement. Hell, even the website bills it as \"an urban wine bar.\"  And yet, the food here is incredible. Flat Creek is actually an extension of their winery, located North of Lake Travis, just off 1431. Is the wine good? Hell if I know. It looks fancy. They have a private tasting room and a really high tech looking chiller thing. What I can say, definitively, is that they're serious about both their wine and their food.   We started with the blue fig flatbread, which was well balanced and fairly large for an appetizer. So much so, that between a party of three, we couldn't finish it off.  For the table, we then ordered crab cakes, the sausage and mushroom pizza, and an avocado truffle salad. The pizza was the clear winner here, crispy crust, not-too-salty toppings, and a strangely addictive sauce. My wife gave the crab cakes a big \"meh\" and proceeded to help herself to more pizza. The avocado salad was really fresh avocado slices wrapped in crispy Parmesan cheese. Delicious, but very, very rich, and the side salad was necessary just to balance the dish. We finished the meal with a lovely light pear dessert.  Downsides? The service was friendly, but glacial. When we entered we were 1 of 2 tables in the entire place, and when we left we were 1 of 2 tables in the entire place. In between there were quite a few \"haha, okay, but really, where is our server?\" moments. If you don't favor wine, you're not going to find much else to imbibe. I get it, it's a wine bar, just be forewarned.   Seriously though, next time you're stuck in line at Bluebonnet, send a wayward glance across the street to Flat Creek Enoteca, you'll be pleasantly surprised."

                "description": "Wow. This was incredibly disappointing. This is supposed to be a tasting room and restaurant for the Flat Creek Winery. We went there to - hopefully - do a tasting, buy a few bottles of wine to take back with us, and have dinner.  This is kind of one of our things ... we enjoy visiting vineyards or sampling rooms and tasting and buying nice wines.  To start out, the parking out front isn't the greatest. For some reason several people had parked over the lines taking up two spots, which made it even more difficult to park.   We ordered a flight of reds. The Super Texan was flat. We thought that the bottle they served us from had been open and sitting around for too long. It was definitely showing signs oxidation as colour was shifting to brownish from red. (Why did a tasting room serve a flat glass of wine?)   The next wine in the flight was Montepulciano.  Eh. It tasted slightly flat and had a funky smell - sort of wet dogish.   The final glass was Barbera. Actually this was crisp and tasted good, so we ordered a full glass to enjoy.  We ordered a gluten-free cheese board with our flights. Warning: if you are gluten-free, dine here at your own peril. (We believe if you offer gluten-free, know what is and how to do it.)  The kitchen is open to the tasting room and dining room. We saw the male chef remove wheat-based crackers off our cheese board and put supposedly gluten-free flatbread triangles onto that same plate and send it out to us. When we pointed out that the entire board was now contaminated and we couldn't eat this due to cross-contamination, he seemed perturbed with us.  They offered to remake the cheese board. It took forever. We had finished our flights and had ordered a glass of the Barbera. The male chef (?) put the \"new\" order of flat bread into the pizza oven with the wheat-based items. (Thank goodness my spouse was watching and caught this.) He seemed to not understand that you cannot put gluten-free items in the same oven with wheat based items. IDK why, but it was a fiasco. ‍  The young boy that sat us was very shy and seemed not to understand us; we originally asked for a table, but he asked if we had reservations. No. Did we need reservations? No. (There were empty tables and this week is apparently slow for the resorts and restaurants.) Well, we'd like to have dinner. (Looking at empty dinner tables.) Can we have a table in the dining area? Do you want to sit at the high-top or a regular table? We'd prefer a regular table. Do you want to sit at a high-top or a regular table? The third time we answered that we guessed we'll sit at the high top. And that's where we were seated. Mhmmm   Our server, Anna, was good. She was trying to get the cheese board delivered properly; she knew enough to suggest that the Superbly Italian flight wines would be less dry than the Fireside Reds flight.  Our impression was that the staff here are not pros trained and experienced in hospitality. Disappointing. We decided that the getting seated and the corked and flat wine combined with the cheese board \"not gluten-free\" experience was enough and left to find a better dining experience elsewhere.   For my spouse and I the bill came to $72.  We each had one flight of 3 wines, shared a cheese board, and had a single glass of the Barbera each.  Pricing is typical for this combination of items at a dating rooms, but the wines were not. Disappointing."

I ordered a filet, and it was perfectly cooked and had a flavorful glaze on it.  We had crab cakes for an appetizer, and that was also very good. The people sitting at a nearby table ordered flatbread, and they said the flatbread was really good. The decor and ambiance of the place was very nice, and there's even an outdoor patio area.  The people were friendly, and the service was great. I think I found my new place in Marble Falls. I will definitely be back!  I would like to add one last thing.  Bring some cash to tip.  When you pay with a card, their system does not allow you to add a tip.  I usually do not have cash on me; but, thank God I had enough on me that day to leave a decent tip."

We sat outside with the patio kitties (thanks COVID, kitties are the best company anyway) and it was wonderful. Cheryl was the perfect server. She was very knowledgeable and helpful and just a sweetheart. We tried the Rosé and it was light and delicious. My husband loved his pizza, the fire brick oven makes an excellent crust. The truffle Parmesan avocado is outstanding, truly one of the best appetizers I've had. We also had the Old School Cheese Plate which was incredibly fresh and delicious. The portions were quite large. I highly recommend this gem of a spot. And while we didn't get a chance to bring any wine home tonight we are going back tomorrow for some."

                "description": "I had had this resort on my list of places to go for a couple of years. Unfortunately my expectations of quality service were not up to my expectations.  Now to be fair it's very challenging time to hire and properly train servers and staff. However some very simple things could have made the stay more enjoyable.  360 bar - This restaurant / bar offers a good atmosphere and a fun place to gather.  When we were there it was where the staffing was the biggest issue. I got up to get a menu off the bar and someone cleared our table including our drinks that were just ordered.  Inside restaurant - best service but when our food was up in the window (which I learned to keep an eye on) I couldn't find a server to bring our food to our table. The cook started pouring on more sweet potato fries on to try to keep the plated ones warm!   Pool staff - utterly clueless Now I didn't think it was possible for a resort to run out of pool towels late in the season but they found a way. The drinks they make are ok, but I haven't found a better margarita than my own.   When I had a long conversation with a manager named Michael, I was more frustrated than when I started with him. In one ear and out the other ear (he didn't seem to care about our issues during the stay).  Golf courses are amazing, that's the part that brings people back. Excellent service inside the golf shops and golf courses are in excellent condition."

                "description": "My daughter and I had a delightful stay at the hotel at Horseshoe Bay Resort starting on Labor Day afternoon 2021. Horseshoe Bay Resort is a 7,000-acre AAA Four Diamond resort about 45 minutes from Austin in the Texas Hill Country. We had such a great time and it was a perfect time to be there. It's a beautiful resort! With all the palm trees and beautiful vegetation, it seemed like I was in a tropical paradise instead of Texas.  We ate at several of their restaurants, which were all great: Yacht Club, J's Restaurant, Slick Rock Grill, and Whitewater 360 Sports Club.  We really enjoyed their lovely beach on the lake with an ample choice of nice lounge chairs and beach umbrellas. We also enjoyed the Yacht Club Pool near the Marina. They took reservations, so the number of people using the pool was always small. There were also other pools available.  At the Marina, they had wave-runners, canoes, and boats available for a fee.   There were also bicycles available with no fee.   We very much enjoyed so many amenities at Horseshoe Bay Resort.  They also had a great spa and FOUR beautiful 18 hole golf courses! In addition to the lovely hotel rooms, they had villas and homes that could be  rented.  With so many acres of fun, it was wonderful that they gave shuttle rides anywhere on the property with a simple phone call...golf carts, Suburbans, and vans were always available on the property.  The staff were all very helpful and so friendly!  We had such a great stay at Horseshoe Bay Resort!"

                "description": "Before deciding on this resort, we had already checked into two different hotels on this day only to check back out. The reason was because their mattresses were badly stained with urine and poor quality bedding. Before staying at any hotel, you should always pull back the sheets and mattress cover to see just what you're really getting into. The bed in our room at this resort had a mattress that was like new and the bedding was perfectly clean.  Upon checking in, Jimmy was extremely helpful and gave us a fantastic rate. Now for the pros: The room was well furnished with a large flat screen, a mini fridge and a good size closet. The bathroom was equally well crafted with a nice shower and had good hot water pressure.  The curtains that cover the balcony door were excellent at keeping out direct sunlight. There is a nice restaurant called J's in the lobby of which you can find separate reviews on yelp. There is also a nice small coffee shop downstairs with some fresh baked goods. It is quite obvious they have poured some serious money into this place especially as you walk the grounds. Everywhere you look there are fountains, rivers and waterfalls along with meticulously cared for gardens. There are also numerous tennis and pickle ball courts, so bring your gear. There's even one of the most beautiful putting courses I've ever seen. There is a very nice outdoor pool and a fairly sizable hot tub, so make sure to bring your bathing suit.  If I could change anything about our stay, I would add a ceiling fan to the room and a microwave. We were going to use the hot tub, but after testing the waters we found that it just was not hot enough for our liking. That aside, this was definitely one of the nicest places we've ever stayed at and we will definitely be back"

I'm going to start with the positive: - we received a free room upgrade because it was our honeymoon - the massages at the spa were wonderful, but the pool wasn't open - The staff working is very helpful and attentive   The negatives: - our first meal here was dinner at Jay's and I got food poisoning, which ruined our entire honeymoon - A lot of the drink machines are broke - I sent management an email regarding the food poisoning and have been completely ignored, but the banquet manger helped us while we were there - food is pricey.. very pricey  - I wish there was an adults only pool or area. If there was one, I couldn't find it. I made reservations at the Yacht Club because I thought it was adults only. We got there 5 minutes after our 3:30pm reservation and it was packed. I don't think the reservation times are enforced  - we waited 20 min for someone to come up and help us with our luggage. We finally decided not to wait anymore. They actually brought our car around without us asking, so we were late to our Spa appointment.  In all. It was mediocre. Some positives and negatives. But getting food poisoning and being completely ignored from management left a sour taste in our mouth. We probably won't be back."

Rung in 2022 at HB, hoping for another fantastic time. We enjoyed the complimentary wine and cookies upon arrival in 2021. At that time, enjoyed all meals at J's Restaurant-breakfast, lunch, and dinner. No refreshments were given this time and was disappointed by J's meal options. The lunch and dinner menus were very similar. Salads, bar foods and sandwiches are fine for lunch, but not as a repeat for dinner (a slight variation was made). 2021 dinners were hearty and comfort-type foods. We loved the dinner last year at The Yacht Club, so much so, bragged about it, and made sure we made reservations again. For us, (good) food is LIFE, and was what brought us back again. Was never told in advance about the $120 5-course menu. This should have been advertised for consumers to make an informed decision to dine there or make arrangements elsewhere. The courses were tiny, boring with no flavor. We were starving about an hour later. Gratuity was automatically added to any sized party. We felt robbed! New Years buffet breakfast at J's was buffet style, not a wise choice with Covid/Omicron running rampant. The white young man at the omelet station's gloves were torn and needed changing. Protective face masks weren't enforced- didn't see disinfecting between guests, dividers, etc. There were limited activities available.  Not sure why they would offer fitness classes early morning New Years Day as most people slept in...particularly since your facility had 2 parties for guests (one complimentary and the other $50 per person) that ended at 1 a.m. Not a good choice. Overall, not a good experience. Would not recommend."

It's just my husband and I but she felt so bad that she upgraded us to a much larger villa with better views, balconies and full kitchen. Needless to say, she took a bad situation and made it all good for me. Grace is a valuable employee and should be recognized by the Horseshoe Bay management. She handled the situation perfectly."

I thought the fire Marshall was going to come. Way too many drunk people and people in general.  There is a huge wait to get into one of 3 very pricey restaurants. They don't have enough workers bc the town is just too small. They don't have enough room for boat storage, in fact they are sold out.  They said they're putting in a lazy river, not going to happen. (Apparently they've been saying this for years) Their workout gym is less than subpar. Not enough equipment, half of machines are broken and don't work, not enough mirrors, it's very dirty.  I've called to complain and I was told all they care about is heads and beds.   HSB is in the business of selling you real estate and that's it. They're building more condos which leads to more people, more wait times, no parking, no boat storage, etc etc."

                "description": "My friend had a girl's weekend at Horsehoe Bay to celebrate her 40th birthday. She had booked the rooms a few months in advance which was good because the room rates increased significantly after she booked. Getting to the resort was a little confusing because there's a huge sign off of 71 (I think) that looks like the main entrance, but it isn't. When I arrived, I was greeted by staff. They let me leave my car at the drop off area so I could unload. One of the greeters helped me with my bags. Parking is free (though I imagine it is covered in the resort fee). They have the option to valet (I believe it is $25 a night). I got lucky and found a spot in the parking lot directly across the street from the main tower (the walk was less than 5 minutes).  We were advised to book amenities and activities at least a month out. I was able to get a spa reservation for 9 am on a Saturday. I was interested in doing a winery tour but it took two weeks for someone to get back to me so I decided to skip it. I was almost late to my spa appointment because I was waiting for the shuttle that never came so I ended up walking. I had the 50 minute Himalayan Salt Stone massage and it was really nice. They give you a locker, a robe, and sandals to wear around the spa. The waiting area was a bit awkward because everyone is sitting in their robes. I also hung out in the sauna for a few minutes but could not figure out how to turn on the lights. One of the women in my group had a massage scheduled, but the masseuse had an emergency and had to cancel. Another woman in the group got a mani/pedi and was pleased with it. Some of the ladies did the stand up paddle boarding at the marina and had a good time.   We reserved a cabana at the Yacht Club which was nice because we had it all day. Our group had 12 people and it was big enough. My only complaint with the cabana is that they are kind of distant from the pool and lake. Our attendant was nice. We ordered food and the Caesar salad was so small that my friend had to ask for a second one. The margherita pizza was very good. The hot tub looks like a kiddie pool and there were many kids swimming in it which was very strange.  I went to J's three times. On the first night we had drinks and the service was incredibly slow. The crowd was also loud and obnoxious so we sat outside near the pool. I tried a beer from Save the World brewery and it was good. The next evening, we had dinner and we were disappointed that it was buffet instead of full service. The food was good and they had many of the menu items available, but it was just unexpected. The last morning, we had the breakfast buffet and it was good but over priced.   They serve Starbucks coffee in the market. I had a white chocolate mocha and it was good, but I got double charged. I didn't realize it until I was checking out, but they took the charge off of my invoice. Unfortunately many of us had issues with our invoices such as charges that weren't ours, to mixed up charges amongst ladies in the same room. I had to fill out a form with the accounting department to have a charge moved from my friend's card to my card. It is fixed now but it took a few days.   The rooms were nice. I loved the double sinks and the oversized shower. The water pressure was amazing. Our TV remote didn't work well but we weren't in the room much so it was okay. Housekeeping is currently only every three days but we were fine using the same towels since it was just for the weekend. The bed was comfortable and I slept well. I found the room to be very nice. Horsehoe Bay is a nice property, but it is over priced in my opinion. It felt more like a really nice hotel rather than a resort."

Use some money and replace the grills that Still don't work. It's still not a luxury resort. If you are expecting Ritz class this isn't it. The resort has so much potential but it lacks in food quality and the Yacht club is packed. I witnessed non resident folks going in but we had to get an appointment! Unbelievable. I personally don't know why Members allow hotel guests and random folks to trash out their Yacht club the pool water was gross! Do yourself a favor, spend your cash at a nice Ritz Carlton Resort!"

They are in immaculate condition with scenery that is breathtaking. The service and the people were fantastic. The home owners in the neighborhoods are very nice. The Villa I resided in was nice, not a full kitchen just wet bar and fridge. There was not daily cleaning so be prepared for that. Overall great place, great stay and I will visit again."

At first encounter, she offered us cold drinks while we waited for our suite. Dawn took care of us the entire weekend as though we were her personal guests. She made sure we didn't lack food or drinks or ANYTHING for that mater. She is by far one of the most amazing human beings my husband and I have EVER encountered not to mention a great employee and manager.  Dawn is an asset to the resort and a hidden gem to your organization.....Tess"

When the room was ready a few minutes later I went to check it out, it wasn't the room reserved. We paid for a balcony lake view room and they gave us a mostly parking lot and sliver of pool view.  I went to the desk and they were trying to change our room to a non balcony smaller room at the same rate.   They finally upgraded us to a suite, for extra money of course.  Then today we get back and we were relaxing in the room when the power went out.  After close to an hour without a/c I called down and they said they were moving everyone. They offered a small queen room in they apartment looking condos. All at the same rate as we were paying originally with no view. We told them no thank you and checked out. Came to the Laquinta down the street. It is super nice.  We have the presidential suite with a nice balcony and river view for a fraction of Horseshoe Bay."

                "description": "Our wedding weekend was insane. My maid of honor, AJ's sister and brother in law all tested positive for covid a couple days before our wedding. We all had to rush and get a covid test to insure we were negative because we had dinner with his sister and brother in law a week prior. We were negative and I told our venue, @hsbresort, that we were going to have 15 guests instead of 19 on the Thursday before our wedding day on Saturday. They said they didn't have a protocol and that this was okay. I thought we were in the clear. We thought about postponing because some of our favorite people wouldn't be in attendance, but we didn't know what the world would bring later on and we just wanted to be married. So Friday, Rehearsal Day, around 3 pm our event coordinator at the resort called us and said hey can we meet real quick and I thought perfect, I wanted to touch base on the details of this weekend! So once we arrived, they let me and my parents fully check in to the hotel and then they led us back to a little conference room. They proceeded to tell us that we couldn't have our \"banquet\" there. I was stunned and confused because we only had 17 people attending an outdoor ceremony and then 15 people staying for a very spacious dinner indoors, while proceeding to have an 80 person wedding that night. They said \"we can still have you stay here and we can bring your dinner to your rooms, y'all can golf because that's outdoors.\" I said okay so can I still have our ceremony outdoors here, for pictures I thought that would be nice. They consulted with their team and then proceeded to kick us out of the hotel. We had friends that checked in on Thursday night, and they kicked them out of their room. Other out of town guests that we hadn't seen were about to check in and they wouldn't let them stay there either.   They gave us a full refund, but Horseshoe Bay Resort hasn't contacted us after they completely kicked us out of our wedding venue and hotel, 2 hours before our Rehearsal."

                "description": "This was my husband's and my first time to Horseshoe Bay Resort, but it certainly won't be our last.  We went specifically to check out the Wine, Dine, and Jazz Festival.  Festivities are on a Friday and Saturday, but we checked in on Thursday so we could fully enjoy the resort and the surrounding areas.  This festival was well worth the trip.  The food, wine and service were 5 stars.  The chef demos and the direct interactions with celebrity guest chefs were a lot of fun - especially if you are a foodie like we are.    Service at the hotel was perfect.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  The resort is lovely.  If you drive only 25 miles or so you end up at gorgeous sprawling state parks, wineries, caves (to explore), etc.  We spent one full day exploring the area and the rest of our time was spent enjoying the festival and resort.  Other attendees were friendly and chatty.  We had a great time talking with other guests.  This was a nice time of year to be at the resort if you want a \"get away\" that takes you away from kids for a bit.  I have a feeling that this resort is (understandably) teaming with kids during the summer, but when school starts it's nice and quiet.    Temperatures dipped down one day, but the sun was out, so we still made use of the hot tub.  There is also one pool that is heated.  We had a lake view room.   The room was nice, clean, quiet, and had a comfy bed.  We were able to keep the temperature controlled well in the room.  Our view was nice.    There was a frig in our room, but no microwave. There is also a small Keurig coffee pot with complimentary pods in the room.  Next visit, we'll probably rent a villa with a full kitchen or kitchenette.  I did miss the ability to heat food.  The closet was large and spacious as was the shower.    We'll definitely return."

                "description": "First time at Horseshoe Bay Resort. Came here to celebrate our 17th wedding anniversary and decided to upgrade our room to top floor balcony with a lake view. This is what we got, picture speak for itself. Can't even enjoy a cup of coffee on the balcony with the sound of the Massive AC units below. Do not waste the money. We could've saved over $100 and probably had a better view with no balcony. If you do decide to upgrade, make sure you're not on this side of the tower. They don't show you this in the online photos. Other than that, resort is ok. Food is ok but overpriced. *Covid-19 review- Definitely not enough hand sanitizer stations throughout the hotel (I'd expect to have one near elevators and not one in sight)"

Beach area stinks and full of drunks. Good luck finding parking within walking distance at all.

He was super reasonable with pricing and sent along restaurant and sight-seeing options before our trip.   The day of, he was right on time and beyond courteous in helping us get all of our stuff to the van. He even stopped on the way for us to grab food and alcohol.   Since the weather was iffy, Alba made sure to let us know that he was standing by and flexible with timing so he could bring us back to town early if we wanted.   The van was clean and comfy. I'd absolutely recommend him to anyone going to Austin and hope to use his services again soon. :)"

We had a bachelorette party and because of the weather we had to change our plans -- not only was he super flexible and nice, but he had lots of great suggestions and helped us salvage the day with a lot of fun activities. He was really friendly, on time, and continuously checked in to make sure we were all comfortable and had what we needed. Not to mention was great about us listening to our own music and helping with literally anything! I would definitely recommend him for any group trips."

He was incredibly kind, helpful, thorough and prompt. He showed up fifteen minutes early at our place and helped us load into the car. Alba then brought us to a grocery store on the way so we could get supplies for the boat. He packed two coolers which we were able to bring on the boat - another big plus. And he was prompt and helpful in bringing us back home afterward.  As a bonus, he's incredibly knowledgeable about the surrounding area and was able to offer up tons of great suggestions. Last but not least, he's a really nice guy! 10/10, would definitely recommend Alba to anyone."

He took us to Dripping Springs and Spicewood for my Bachelorette party and we had a blast. Several girls said it was the best bachelorette party they had been to!! You can eat and drink alcohol on the van. I shopped around, and his 14 passenger van was the most reasonably priced. We went to Treaty Oak, Spicewood Vineyards and Poodie's!! Definitely recommend this company."

Liked the place out on their own land and sat on the porch enjoyed a beer and some good conversation with a local.  We were visiting from Wisconsin and it was interesting learning about the brewery and the local sites while we were at STW.  Since I am more of an IPA guy and my wife a stout person their beer wasn't our overall cup of tea.  However, as mentioned above we did enjoy our time there and had to get a couple of shirts, hats etc. to support them and the cause. Definitely a recommended place to stop if you are in the southern hill county outside of Austin."

                "description": "STW is definitely the place to spend a Saturday afternoon. Qiuinh and David draw a wonderful amiable enjoyable crowd. Their servers are so nice so kind so friendly, I especially enjoy Leigh and Emily and the new girl I can't remember her name it's just as sweet. Oh did I mention their brews?  Their predominantly Belgian style ales are enough to keep you coming back. I especially like the scotch ale and the quad ale. My wife likes their coconut ale and the cherry scotch ale.   Now for the coup de grace. They donate all of their profits to charities. Some have gone to Africa to help the captured women and waterless villages. Local charities include habitat for humanity.  The local charities' donations come from the tip jar. So when you go, you're doing something philanthropic and getting a good beer plus meeting new friends that are like-minded.  And they have socially distanced outdoor seating as well as the brew room socially distanced seating with air extracting vents above each table. So you'd have no concerns about C-19.   As former physicians, David and Qiuinh know how to protect us from contagious viruses. So we feel safe visiting often.  It just gets better. You can join their club for about $35 and that get you your own personal glass which they keep for you then every time they come out with a new release, you get to have it free. And if that's not enough, you get a T-shirt with their logos."

                "description": "Ever since STW has been putting out beers, I can't say my boyfriend and I ever really buy any of their beers when we're out and about. None of their mainstays have ever really been standouts and in this cramped market, your beers have to be good and clean. That being said, we've been wanting to check out their taproom/brewery and it finally came to be when we spent a night out in Marble Falls.  Since the taproom is only open on the weekends, it was busy on a Saturday afternoon. It appears a lot of locals come here, which is GREAT! Families, couples, it's a great space for everyone. The taproom itself is air conditioned but if you want more seating, the warehouse space in the back is setup with extra picnic tables--just no a/c back there. There was a food truck out front in case you get hungry.  We went with a tasting paddle with a couple of their mainstays and the rest were their seasonals. The pricing is just right (about $1-$2/tasting).   Almost everything we tasted was phenolic (band-aid tasting-ish). The only thing that we could really drink was the wit, peach saison and our favorite was the Flanders red. The Flanders red was a great sour that fit to style and no off-flavors!   I want this place to do well because the owners are SO NICE (I mean, she's Vietnamese, so I obviously support my peeps) and I love what they're about -- but they need to fix their brewing process to get cleaner beer. All of our homebrew friends that have been here have had the same experience with the beers, so we're not alone.   If they can fix that, I might consider buying their beers when I'm at a bar, but otherwise, I just can't."

                "description": "This place was so highly talked about by one of my husband's coworker that is had been added to our list. They could not say enough about it - they even talked about making it a road trip. Marble Falls is a little over an hour and a half from San Antonio. So Saturday came and it was a perfect day for hubby and I to go check it out- we had no plans, it was sunny and early.   We got there a little after 1pm and well...I didn't get it. I mean the hype that was so over the top - I just expected something out of this world.   Yes there are a few picnic tables out front on a hill and the obligatory kids jungle gym (at a bar nowadays) -there was no one there but I thought- wow, if there really would be kids (little ones), I could see them tumbling down the hill and not in a fun way.   Once inside I realized this is not what we had in mind. It's lovely for sure. Old wine barrels as a few tables, a sectional and another sofa and a larger table right next to the bar. Because of all of this furniture, it makes it hard to get to the bar to order.   The staff was nice and knowledgeable - we ordered one of the flights and that included a stout, quad, dubbel, cherry, barley wine, and something else - fine beer but not fantastic. Staff let us know there was free pop corn out in the brewery side. - apparently they sometimes have a food truck but not today. They had more tables with some games with the door opened to the outside which made for a nice breeze. We did get some popcorn but it was so salty that I felt I was just eating salt.   We looked around for other places in the surrounding area and there was nothing appealing via my yelp app. We thought about going to Austin but is is over an hour drive.  I had envisioned Jester King-like place but it was far from this.   We left after our one flight - another 1 1/2 hour drive back home. I think that is part of the challenge- you know if you are somewhere off I-35 you can always drive 15 min and find somewhere else to try. Here? You are pretty limited."

The brewery sits atop of a hill in a serene scenic area, and as you enter you're warmly welcomed by locals, tourists, and experienced brewman to help you pick the most delightful beer.   I definitely recommend the Wit if you're looking for something light and crisp. The brewery then opens up to a second floor seating area filled with picnic benches, tall standing machines, and yummy popcorn machine popping away.   We spent the afternoon playing jenga, and took in the outside to have a few games of corn hole. If you're in Marble Falls, this is a definite must."

                "description": "We stumbled across Bear King Brewing Co. as we were driving back to our lodgings. Here was a chance to stop for a cold one and a little taste of Texas with their Pimento Cheese appetizer. Both were great.  I had a Wandering Blonde Ale, which was excellent. Light and refreshing, but with real flavor -- something often missing in a blonde ale. The Hubs had a Hazy Ale, which was crisp and had an almost grapefruity tang on the tongue.  Being out-of-townersof the California persuation, we spotted pimento cheese on the menu and decided to give this southern staple a try. It was fantastic -- cheesy, garlicky, oniony, with a very slight spiciness to it. It's served with excellent ciabatta bread slices that have been grilled with olive oil, I think. The bread was great on its own, and the pimento cheese raised it to a whole new level of tastiness. I'd have happily ordered a second round of just the appetizer if dinner wasn't awaiting us elsewhere.   They have a good happy hour M-Th from 4-6 where the beers were $2 off. The pimento cheese app was $5.50, the happy hour beers were $4 each (16 oz), so we got out of there for just $13.  Great seating areas inside and out, too. Big fans in the large covered (non-smoking) patio made it a nice place to sit on an early evening. Pups are allowed on the patio if they're leashed at all times.  All in all, this place really does it right -- good beer, good food, and great ambience. Can't ask for more than that."

                "description": "After checking out Sweet Berry we took to Yelp to find a place to lunch. Our first choice was closed and we felt like we'd be ok to give this place a try. Upon arrival around 230 PM there were tons of empty tables. We figured we had missed the lunch rush but apparently we were wrong. We immediately placed our order and having frequented many breweries across the state and country we knew there would be a bit of a wait. After about 20 minutes we got 1 appetizer and 1 meal (burger) for someone in our party. The food runner assured us the remaining appetizer and 3/4 of our meals (also burgers) would be out shortly. Time went by and at 20 minutes since the first food came out we stopped a food runner to check to see how much longer the remainder of our food would be. She said,\"Our kitchen is backed up and it'll be out soon.\" 10 more minutes goes by and we stopped another food runner to see if they could check for us. Again nothing. Finally a 3rd food runner see's that we've been sitting there awhile (mind you were watching people who ordered after us get their food) and comes to ask if we're still waiting on food. We said yes and while we weren't upset there was a wait we were upset 1/4 of our party got their food 40 minutes ago. She went and checked and 5 minutes later the remainder of our food came out. One item was requested without onion yet their were onions right on top. The food runner had offered to take it back and fix it but after waiting 1.5 hrs and 40 minutes after the first person in our party received their food we told her not to worry about it we'd just pick them off. I'm not sure what was going on in the kitchen but I'm not sure how the cooks/chefs can make 1 burger and yet  it the other 3 at once.   As far as the food it was mediocre at best. We had 4 different burgers and they were ok. We also had the Tx poutine and Buffalo wings. I'd save your money on those. The gravy on the poutine was the best part but fries were soggy due to super wet brisket and pico on top. Wings again were ok. I believe they're smoked but the skin was not crispy at all. Can't comment on the beers as we didn't order any. Maybe that's their money maker and the food is an after thought."

There's only been one that I haven't liked, and that was the Milky Way chocolate beer. The thing that really sets Bear King apart though is the quality of the food. You usually don't expect a lot from a bar, but I have enjoyed their queso and their tacos. I personally did not enjoy the poutine, but several of my friends did.  Not a bad place to go for dinner and a drink."

Great vibe and great beer. Wished we had skipped the late lunch at the Bluebonnet and had eaten here. Everyone around us had great looking meals. The reason for the 4 stars and not 5, was that we did not have any food. Maybe next time. BTW, the Hefeweizen was great."

My husband liked his burger and fries, however my southwest style El Oso salad was marginal.  It was mostly lettuce and some chicken but not much else as the menu described it.  The dressing wasn't a dressing but more like a dipping sauce.  It didn't pour out of the container at all.  Our friends had the child's chicken tenders and the shrimp tacos.  The chicken tenders looked good."

We stopped in in mid September and the weather was not too hot, but still sat inside.  Liked the overall ambiance of the place. Crew there was nice and responsive to both questions and orders. I would say the beer was good, but not great.  We had a couple of apps that were decent, but again nothing to write home about.  The disappointing aspect to the night was that they were out of a fair amount of the beers, which should not be the case at a brewing company pub.  However, would definitely recommend if you want a good beer in Marble Falls"

We've been here a couple of times now and and they consistently have good beers. My boyf really likes their black IPA.   Their COVID-19 protocols are a little annoying though - it just takes so much time to order through the site. Not sure why places do this, I think it's fine if you want to take the order at the front and not have waiter service, but ordering through a site on your phone is my least favorite thing a biz can do while I'm at the restaurant.   Anywho - the food is good. Well seasoned burger and good tacos.   If you're in the area, give them a visit if you're looking for good beer!"

We had a the hefe and the pecan porter, they were both fantastic!   They followed all COVID-19 restrictions to a T! And we felt very safe and comfortable dining in (it was my husband's first time dining in at a restaurant since March, so that's saying something).

The nachos...I inquired where the cheese was and come to find its was under the top level of chips. So half your nachos has a queso underneath the chips. The brisket was about 4 chunks of meat hidden between the layers of chips so you had to literally break the meat apart. The pickled onions didn't taste well or the sour cream sauce drizzle didn't work well. This was shared with the other 3 people. The chocolate marshmallow stout was superb. The pimento cheese you really need to use Price's. The guacamole and chips with cheese were very good. We have faith!!!!"

It seemed to us that the best time to be at Marble Falls is during the off-season where the rates are great and the restraunts are not crowded. This restaurant came well recommended to us from some locals that we talked to.  As someone who works in the beer and wine business, I'm always looking for a great brewpub to explore. This place definitely did not disappoint as all the beers styles were right on point when I got a sample flight. My wife had a salad and I opted for the fish and chips. I think I found the best item on the menu because it was a huge piece of perfectly cooked haddock. I will actually say it was one of the best fish and chip baskets I've had in my life. My wife loved her salad and all in all it was a great meal at what I'd call a very great price. We will definitely be back."

The food menu was quite extensive and we settled on the spicy sausage pizza with mushrooms. Lots of food and you won't be disappointed. My favorite beer was one of the IPAs I believe it was called lake water. Regardless, lots of good choices and they even had three guest beers which we took advantage of one. My only complaint was that social distancing was not enforced here enough such that we felt uncomfortable and left a little in it earlier than what we would normally have."

We entered the restaurant and we greeted by cheerful servers and seated (socially distant of course). We did not know what kind of beer to get and our server recommended the \"beer flight\" which is few oz of 4 beers.  We tried the blond to the dark to see which ones we might want to order in a larger glass.  We also tried their super pretzel and pepperoni pizza.  All of the food was very good as was the beer.  We choose to go with a Blond Growler to bring home.  Definitely a good experience.  Easy in and out in Marble Falls off the 281."

Four of us were seated quickly, unfortunately that was the only thing quick all evening.  Three of us ordered beers.  Seems like they needed to go over the river and thru the wood to bring back the beers.  It was quite the wait.  At least they were cold.  Ordered our food.  Three of us had burgers and the fourth had the fries appetizer, covered in cheese.  Family of three sat down at the table next to us about 20 minutes after we had arrived.  They ordered, ate, and were leaving at the time we got our food.  Over an hour wait, for something that is fairly simple to make.  Waiter came by once to get another beer order.  Finished both beers slowly, and still had not received our food.  Finally delivered our burgers,  ready to dig in.  Presentation was nice, looked good.  But took a bite and realized looks can be deceiving.  Patty was drier than the Sahara desert.  All of the flavor and juice had been cooked out.  Maybe this is why it took so long to get our food, they were too busy overcooking it.  The fried okra was not any better.  Almost had a doughy texture to it.  Not crisp and definitely no flavor.  Also two of the beers on the menu were out."

I had two others that were even smaller.   Had to order a second order of sweet potato fries because they reduced their portion size there as well to only a handful. I don't usually bitch and whine about this kind of stuff, but this is kind of ridiculous.  The staff is nice but no one was wearing a mask which is against the law at this point too."

The restaurant was only 50 % full. I could hit someone with my burger across the table with it and knock them down, then I started thinking about playing beer pong with it, but I don't think the meat could bounce. I asked for ketchup and it never arrived to our table. They beer was good but they advertised some beers that were out. We sat down quickly,  that was only the fast thing they knew how to do.

I'd imagine before covid the dining room held a few more tables.  The Paul's chicken is a large breast breaded in chips, topped with lots of hatch Chile and shredded cheese. I liked it better after asking for a side of white gravy.  The green beans are honest, not cooked to death, still green. The baked potato was typical, though not seasoned on the outside like I'm used to.  All in all, it's plenty.  The chicken fried steak was two pieces, actually seasoned in the breading, tender enough, and disappeared quickly. Gravy is good too.  The scratch cheesecake was good. I got plain, without toppings, which they offer a few. It's baked, not too dense, thick enough crust.  The bread pudding was a cereal bowl full of yummy. Pecans and raisins all smothered in a bourbon sauce, not an icing. Very good.  Prices are a smidge high, but expected for the area.  Staff was pleasant, quick to respond.  I'll come back next time we are in the area."

Perhaps try flattening the chicken breast instead of cooking a big lump piece. My fault to have eaten it!  Fries were not fresh either.

There's outdoor seating as well as indoor seating with large window with beautiful lake view.  The service is very fast and attentive. I ordered calamari which are top with cheese powder which seems strange, it's also like a calamari fingers instead of rings. With cheese is not my favorite part. The fish taco came in three large pieces of taco with the two pieces of filet in each taco, huge portion. The green chili burger is juicy and has a good kick to it but the buns are soggy which needs some improvement."

In a world where so many restaurants are understaffed and waiters overwhelmed, the team here could not have been more attentive from the moment we sat down. There was no waiting for anything - they were incredibly intuitive and knew just when to check in with us and offer refills or bring extra napkins. 5 stars for the service.   The food was pretty good which is why I'm giving 4 stars. I had a delicious green chili burger, but the calamari fell flat for me. I don't know why they sprinkled parmesan cheese on it. My recommendation would be to offer this on the side.   Overall, solid option in Marble Falls with beautiful views over the lake. Sit outside when the weather is tolerable."

I told the hostess this was our first time here and wanted to celebrate our anniversary on the patio. She immediately took us to the worst table on the patio. Thanks. The waitress had no problem putting us at one of the best tables on the patio. Your awesome! All staff were wearing masks. We ordered the Texas grilled Reuben and the Buffalo Chicken sandwich. Both were wonderful. Very seldom does Glenda finish a sandwich! Fries were good and the coleslaw was wonderful. I'm a huge fan of  Long John Silver's coleslaw, sweet and creamy. Very few places make it like that. River City Grille's was a perfect copy! Glenda stopped me from licking the bowl. Now, if your eating wonderful food on a wonderful patio at a wonderful restaurant facing a wonderful lake, your going to pay through the nose. Nope. Normal prices. That's why 5 stars. We will definitely be back."

The food was good but what stood out was the green chili and cheese potatoes, they were fantastic! The waitress was very nice , the food good and the view great. With a little more effort they could make this place epic. Either way, I recommend stopping here when your passing through , you won't be disappointed."

                "description": "Nice local restaurant right in the water. They are socially distancing with masks for all so definitely felt very safe.   We started with the BK salad which was quite enough to share with a large amount of chicken.   I would definitely recommend the chipotle vinaigrette dressing. I had the Buffalo chicken tacos for dinner. The chicken portions were huge and tasty. The rest of the dish was plain but solid. My wife had the fried shrimp. Food quality was overall good. Price a little high for hers for what you got but not terrible. The salad and tacos were quite reasonably priced.   Our server had a trainee so not sure if the reason our service was slow but definitely slow service for how empty the restaurant was when we were there.   Overall still a solid dine at a local place and would definitely consider going back on a return trip."

Location wise, this is a great stopping point for a pre-Fredericksburg wine tasting afternoon.  You'll be able to arrive in wine country after digestion has commenced with no hunger, ready to consume some good wine, mead or beer.  The service and food are decent.  The buffalo chicken tacos were excellent.  They have a well stocked bar, including some Fredericksburg wines."

                "description": "So this is our SECOND time here. In town for another golf tournament at Horseshoe Bay. I remembered this place from last time and figured we could give it another try. There are a few more things to note this time around... 1. Staff is underwhelming and not friendly. I mean, they're cordial enough, but for a small town, it doesn't seem like they try to get to know you.  2. The patio- so we were able to get a table out on the coveted patio. To re-use the word \"underwhelming\", the patio is such, super outdated and could use some TLC. Cobwebs beneath some of the metal mesh dining chairs should not exist if daily sweeping and wiping down of seats were being done. The floor could also use a major cleaning. Rails could use a new coat of paint and the patio could use an overall power washing.  3. No wonder the wait for patio seating was 45 mins long the last time we were out here. They only have about 8 tables out there. And being on the Colorado River, it's easy to see why people would just want to loiter and hang out, which means tables don't turnover quickly. Although we are in the \"dreadful times of COVID-19\", I believe they could easily place at least four 2-seater tables to dot along the patio rails and still maintain the appropriate/safe distance between tables.  4. I tried the pork chop tonight (the hubby enjoyed them so much last time). They are small, 7 oz. including bone, marinated in a brine overnight. Even found a few whole peppercorns on my chop. I'm used to a simple salt (or garlic salt) and pepper seasoning of my chops, so the flavor was off-putting for a simpleton ingrate like me. LOL! But the brine makes them very moist, so that was a plus and they are definitely cooked over an open flame. I had char marks for days!  5. Had the chips and queso/salsa appetizer again and enjoyed it. I'd recommend that.   Re-reading my first review, I realized that I was too generous with the 4 stars last time, so I'm down-grading to 3. My recommendations to management on this trip would be to spend a little money for a minor facelift and add some aesthetic appeal for the comfort of their customers who appear to be \"regular\" locals and visitors like us visiting the area.  This is for both the inside and outside dining areas of the restaurant. Considering the cost of the food here, I don't think this is too much to ask. Please also train your seating staff (hostesses) to be friendly and communicative. This is our second visit and the second time we've felt this area of staff were \"cool\" and unprofessional. Our server wasn't jovial and offering foot massages, but at least she spoke more than a few words to us and was professional and effective. The 3 females at the front hostess podium are just awkward, staring and make a strange impression. These are the first (masked) faces your customers will engage with and whom will represent your business, your brand and set the tone for your customers' entire dining experience. Take this seriously. I don't think we'll be back. There are other places to try out, but we wish you much luck and success."

I ordered the New York Strip with fried okra (yum) and macaroni and cheese, along with a \"skinny\" margarita. They had a bit of a snafu with a brand new busboy who cleared my drinks while I was in the restroom but they fixed it quickly!  I will probably drop in again while I'm here this week and try some different menu options!"

                "description": "Worst night in a very long time, thanks to Brass Hall!  We had been unimpressed on a prior visit but decided to give them another shot when we heard that a band we like was playing there (Back in Black - a tribute to ACDC).  We bought tickets weeks ago and paid extra for \"reserved seating\".  Brass Halls FB and ticket page said show at 7.  Because we were making the long drive from Austin, we FB messaged to confirm time.  We were told \"maybe 8\".  We showed up at 7:30 and our paid for and reserved seats were two barstools behind a giant mirrored pillar, with NO view to the stage.  We were told that was all that was available.  Brass Hall is a total dingy dive bar with pool tables, noisy game room, watered down drinks and a stage in the corner.  Because we had already had a few beers with dinner at a brewery, we decided to pace ourselves with drinking and wait until the band came on.  8:00 went by, then 8:30.  People around us, who'd been waiting for a band to come on at 7, were on rounds 4 and 5 of drinks and becoming louder and more obnoxious. 9:00 goes by and Back in Black is finally starting to enter the building one at a time to set up their equipment.  It's 9:20, Back in Black are still not in their stage clothes, no sound check has been done and they seem in no hurry.  9:30, we've had enough and leave.  We wasted a long drive and $50 of tickets all because a venue that BOOKED a band could not even accurately say when they would play.  Very poor management and booking.  And shame on Back in Black for not caring about what time was posted or about fans like us who drove a long distance to see them.  One final \"cherry\" on the steaming lump of goo that is Brass Hall....    The bathrooms.  There are no stall doors in either the men's or women's bathrooms.  What you have instead are... (wait for it), TA-DA -- velvet curtains!  Not only are they totally lacking in privacy but what an absolute hygenic wasteland.  Blue light anyone?"

We were relative strangers to the place, but, we were welcomed by the bar staff and everyone was very open and friendly. The drinks were not expensive. The wife and I had 2 drinks each and the tab was $12.  They have an arcade, good sized dance floor and pool tables.  There is a DJ stand supposedly for weekend entertainment.  They do have weekend entertainment.   The place gives you a warm Texas feeling. The people in this small town so far have been neat and friendly. Very nice place to visit."

The straw that broke the camels back was when I ordered my husband a double crown and my drink.  The bartender poured my husband's drink and went to get mine, the other bartender picked up a bunch of dirty glass which included my husband's drink.  When the other bartender saw it he wanted the drink back so he could serve it no way my friend! Not coming here again."

DJ sucked ass - he needs to adjust his speakers, they crack when the music plays... he plays music so old-  today's 20's patrons their parents were  having sex to that music ... not up to date with music that draws a crowd.  More people were on the balcony smoking than being inside dancing... get a better talent if you plan to draw in the crowd.   Out of date music - too old school - not worth a shit--- his mixing sucks!! Hire someone with more experienced- if I wanted to see one lady show her twat I would would have gone to a strip club.  80's country - Keith Whitley Don't close your eyes(1988)  is his closing song... what a waste of time...  there are better DJ's in Marble Falls... guess you get what you pay for.  Check out his video of the club and you will see the only person dancing who said she's a friend of the DJ's and needed to come support her friend. Dated Friday Night / Saturday Morning - 9/29/18-9/30/18. Sad thing when your family doesn't even want you to DJ for their family reunion because you suck that much - let's go Brass Hall step up your game if you want real people to spend money at your establishment. The floor was danced on 10# of the time that alone says something."
