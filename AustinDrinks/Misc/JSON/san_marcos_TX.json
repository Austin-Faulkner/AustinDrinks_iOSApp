We were both disappointed and decided to find a place to eat to salvage the night. That's where AquaBrew came in. The environment of AB is warm and comfortable. The service is nice, attentive, and happy. And the food and beer...  My husband got the fried chicken sandwich and I got the pulled pork sandwich- the spicy slaw was delish. Both were really tasty and hot, fries were crispy and salty. The IPAs were delicious with the food.  Definitely looking forward to the next chance I have to go back."

There is plenty of indoor seating, a great patio and of course the bar area.  It was easy to social distance from other people and very clean. We will return. The staff was very nice and helpful. If you are looking for a good local brewery to support, AquaBrew is the place."

When we walked in we were very disappointed in their craft selection. I had researched this prior to choosing to go there based on their craft choices showed online. Again, something else that needed to be updated. Also, they aren't serving food. There was a large dog walking around that would come right up to you or sneak up under the tables and lick your feet. I like dogs so it was ok but for someone that doesn't..... Would not go back here until they get fully moved or opened."

                "description": "They've thought about everything at this brewery.  Great food, live music, seating inside, outside, and UPSTAIRS on the deck!  When the weather is right, they have the big glass garage doors open.  Yeah, they brew their own beer here and they have a decent selection.  It's not your typical brewery where you can just stroll in and choose the table you want to sit at.  That's because they have full table service for food and drinks.  I prefer breweries that let you wander around from the bar, to an outside table, to an inside table, and then back again - you know, rinse, lather, and repeat (relaxed and unstructured - I need that once in a while).  If you just want to stop in for a quick beer, you can sit at the bar.  The bar is quite large but also very popular with the college crowd, so it's hard to get a seat at times.   Now to the serious stuff - the beer!  I've had their Kolsch (San Marcos Blonde) and their Vienna Lager.  The blonde was the run of the mill Kolsch, not bad by any means, but the Vienna Lager - wow!  It had a great malty taste to it.  I liked it so much that I purchased a crowler of it to take home.  I rarely do that, so that tells you it must be good.  Enough useless banter - here's everything else you need to know about this place:  Free parking lot right next door or free 2 hr street parking.   Patio areas in the front and the back with overhead infrared heaters and fans with misters (they have both Texas seasons covered).  This place is popular with the college kids - TOO popular.  Growler refills are $12 or $18 for 64 oz, and $24 or $36 for 128 oz, depending on the beer you select.    Crowlers to go:  $8 or $10 (depending on the beer).  You can get three for $20 or $25 (depending on the beer).  Plenty of food options.   And I almost forgot to tell you - they have a FULL bar, not just beer!"

                "description": "Aquabrew is definitely a gem in San Marcos. I learned about it through the purchase of the brewery tour on Groupon. The tour was quaint because it's not that big, but very interesting.  The gentleman who gave the tour seemed a bit rushed at the end, but he answered our questions and seemed very knowledgeable.   At the end of the tour we got to sample some beer. They also have a beer club where you buy a growler, we got the one for $100, and join their beer club. You get a punch card for 10 refills on the growler. My husband and I got one each for $200. I was thinking it an \"okay\" deal i guess. Truthfully I wasn't that thrilled cause of the price. But OMG!!!! IT IS WELL WORTH EVERY PENNY FOLKS!!!!.   Aquabrew has some of the best beers around. I am Army and have lived and traveled all over the world and this lil place holds its ground when it comes to beers! Purchasing the growler is the best deal too.   I have not had the food yet, but the place is always busy and people seem to love it. And they have some of the cutest guys behind the bar.  In all, I give this gem an A+"

None of their food is offered (you get two options from a backyard stand) standoffish servers and a gloomy vibe. Sooooo disappointed and hope to see this place make it back to its prime."

                "description": "The first thing about AquaBrew that I enjoyed was the vibe. This place really has a community feel with longer style tables and an incredible open patio with fans and lighting, ping pong and live music... and of course... beer.  The food was very flavorful. Thai chicken had good spice and the chicken thigh was tender and juicy. The Margarita flatbread was fresh tasting. The arugula salad was huge and bursting with fruits and flavor.  The beer was excellent and just what you'd expect from an onsite brewery.   Overall, if you're looking for a fun place for you and your peeps to chill, eat and drink in San Marcos... you'd do well to try this place. Plus it's right up the street from the Cheetham St warehouse."

Not even my 11 year old daughter would eat it. Supposed to be medium and came through well done.

Long tables instead of individual tables to encourage people to meet new people ! Which is a really awesome concept . Also there's a large bar since it's also a brewery.  Food- my food was about a 3.5/5 , but my friends was a solid 1. Her salmon Benedict had almost uncuttable biscuit since it was so hard , and the most burnt potatoes I've ever seen. My food which was the stuffed French toast was pretty yummy, but not a lot to it.  Noise level - 1/5 THE BAND WAS SOOO LOUD. I couldn't here my friend talking 1 foot in front of me :(  Price - 2/5 wayyyy overpriced for what you get. My French toast was 11.91 and my friends meal was 15.91  Probably won't return unless it's for a group outing , but still a cool little place to check out !"

Easy to get a seat and our waitress was very attentive, despite it being happy hour and slightly busy on a Friday after work.  As a table, we ordered the: a) Brew House Pretzel - Amazingly soft and the beer queso is a great pairing  b) AB Bacon Jam Fries - HOLY! The bacon jam itself is something I've never had before and I must say this makes it a must return for me  c) Glass of Imperial Pilsner - Smooth and pretty standard for a Pilsner  d) Glass of Artificial Intelligence Tripel (9.72% ABV) - Yeah...the ABV tells the story itself  This spot has a great atmosphere, very rustic and cozy. Definitely a nice place, just wish you could order directly from the bar for faster access to beer."

I wish I saved room for the Porter Ice Cream Float.   The AB burger was solid, maybe a little messy tho.  Forget the fries tho. The regular fires were under seasoned and chewy. Think Wendy's fries when you  don't finish them at lunch and try to eat them at the end of your shift. Bleh  The staff was super friendly.   The outdoor portion looks great but a bit too hot out today to go and enjoy it."

                "description": "You know when someone takes a picture of themselves and posts it on Instagram,and it's at just the right angle to make them look super attractive? The Yelp reviews of this place kind of remind me of that. It's not that it was bad, but I was expecting a lot more.  The highlight of my meal was the Mosaic IPA. Balanced and drinkable, this beer was really enjoyable. I also tried the Swine Dive IPA. The taste of this was a little too clean for an IPA and just didn't have the hoppy depth to add to its character. Not bad, but I wouldn't get it again.  Overall the food I ordered was really lackluster. I didn't hate it, but it certainly wasn't a memorable meal. My chicken empanadas were oily, and had very little chicken in the filling. The whole thing struck me as more of acorn dog egg roll hybrid, and didn't really seem like an empanada at all. I was grateful for the spicy sauce it was served with, which was pretty tasty. I also ordered the brussel sprouts. There were some decent flavors here, but I would have really preferred them to have a little more char on them. They came across as slightly undercooked and worse yet, very wet. A little crispness would have gone a long way.  Service was fair, friendly enough but really on the slow side. It took me almost a half an hour to get my food and it wasn't crowded. The couple at the bar sitting next to me ordered hamburgers. I have to admit I was a little jealous because they looked good. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. Maybe it was a bad night. Whatever the reason I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again."

But the reason I come to AquaBrew and recommend it to everyone I meet is the food. The \"new\" salmon dish isn't even close to the goodness of the previous balsamic salmon with veggies. Dry. Lacked flavor. Sticky rice instead of the delish potatoes and only green beans instead of a mix of seasonal veggies. Hubby had the tostadas and 'meh' reaction. Will give it one more try before relegating it to happy hour only place with 3 stars. So sad."

I was so excited to try these fries but they were very underwhelming to me. $4 is steep for an up charge but had I enjoyed them I wouldn't have minded. The burger was the best bite on the table. It was small in size but very juicy and tasty. Not one to split.   Next up was the fried chicken and eggs. It has so many things I typically like - fried chicken, cream gravy, bacon jam, eggs, but I didn't like this dish. It lacked dimension of flavor. It needed something. The herbed fries that came with it were good. I liked them better than the $4 bacon jam ones.   Our kids split the stuffed French toast. The only ate a little bit because it was too sweet. If a kid thinks something is too sweet you know it's toooooo sweet. Neither ate it. It was a waste of money.   Overall I'm glad we tried it but don't need to return on our own accord."

We saw a guy walk from the kitchen with a bottle of what looked like vodka and went outside to their outside area and was playing around.   The food was DELICIOUS!! My husband got the fried chicken sandwich and I got the pulled pork sandwich. He for regular fries for his side and i got a sweet potato. We weren't a fan of the regular fries, so I highly recommend the sweet potato.   We also ordered the mimosa flight and were kinda impressed. For $20 you get a whole bottle of champagne and 4 different flavor options. We chose chipotle pineapple, watermelon, passion fruit and lavender. All amazing.   This place is spacious. The food is amazing. I was just unimpressed with a few waitstaff/bar staff members. We went next door to Chances afterwards and they mentioned the management has gone down hill.   I hadn't mentioned we aren't from the area. We are from Austin. This place had stellar food and for a night shift it wasn't awful. Give them a shot!!"

Friendly, and more importantly, knowledgeable tap masters that can match your beer tastes to the selections on tap.   You can order a pitcher of beer at this place!  I don't see this in many growler stations.  All in all, it's a very fun place.  The staff and the customers are very chill and down to earth.  It's in a strip center at the corner of LBJ and East Sessom Dr.  The address is listed on LBJ and while you can enter there, it's a lot easier if you enter from East Sesson Drive.  And there's a LOT more parking on this side."

Very interesting pieces. But enough about that.  This place is loaded with craft beer from Texas. Texas is apparently pretty big in that regard (and nearly every other regard). For a place as small and intimate as it is, there's a lot of seating packed in it and even some outdoor seating. There's games, lots of games. Card games, board games, darts, pool, and sometimes even a live DJ.  If you dig the craft brew scene this place is surely right up your alley. If you find yourself in San Marcos come check em out!"

They have all Texas craft beers, 28 on tap, fresh, and they even have a few selections in cans and some wine!      I was shocked when I saw they had The Infinite Monkey Theorem Rose' ....impressive.   The vibe is awesome. Super laid back, chill, artsy, and hipster. Loves it.       The owners are lovely people. So nice, great service, and very informative on every single beer. They make it their priority to get the perfect beer for you.   They have some savory oyster crackers for you to enjoy while you booze it up. Cards Against Humanity is also available to play for free!        The decor was my favorite. I was super into the refurbished wooden pallets, the art work, the baby succulents, and the colors!   Will definitely be returning many more evenings."

Great selection of Texas beers. Very helpful staff who encouraged us to sample several based on our likes including several blends we may not have thought of trying. 2 beers led to 3 and then 4. Sad to leave but had a game to catch. Until next time, keep up the great cheer and beer!"

                "description": "As far as growler places in San Marcos, The Growling is as good as it gets!  With that being said, I've been to growler places in the greater Austin area and IMHO, I think The Growling is better than most of them.  As previously mentioned, there are 28 beers on tap, all Texas-made stuff, but unlike other growler places I've been to they have a bar and you can drink a pint, invite friends, and just hang out. The owners are super friendly and work hard to set you up with the perfect craft beer experience! They even have a stage setup for live music and get live acts mostly on the weekend.  Also, as previously mentioned, there is no kitchen but they allow outside food and with Pie Society, Bobcat nation, Dos Gatos, Mocas/Javas, Rose Garden (Chinese), and Thai Thai in close proximity; you won't have to go far to fight off those hunger cravings! They haven't been open very long (less than 2 months) so they're off to a slow start but hopefully as word gets out they'll start getting busier and maybe even expand on what's an already great start! If you're in San Marcos for the River, the Square, the Hill Country, or in school looking to skip class, The Growling is every bit worth checking out!"

What a great spot - the staff is very welcoming and friendly and are very knowledgeable about the different brews on tap to help you find the right one to fit those taste buds. The beer flight the bartenders picked/poured for me were great and I look forward to coming back and tasting the other brews on tap. Looks like I found a great alternative to overcrowded beergardens in Austin so cheers to more trips I'll be making to San Marcos!"

                "description": "Industry leading!  Well I was finally able to get to San Marcos and got to walk around the square. In doing so I found several bars and coffee shops which was great! The bars were still pretty empty being that it was only 3pm and I needed human interaction! That was when I found Industry. It's no secret that Industry is great, based on their reviews and I was happy to have found it to be so close. For me, there were 3 things that really separated Industry. The first being my bartender, Madison. She did an outstanding job making sure I felt welcomed and was quick to present water in which I especially appreciated given the heat. She knew the beer menu and gave me a few recommendations, eventually nailing it with a beer called Easy Rider. I recommend it if you're into a craft blonde ale. I also ordered a dirty martini  and ask her if she would make it the way she usually does, which turned out great. She used Botanist Gin which was perfecto with just the right amount of floral. Thanks Madison for the solid recommendations and the hospitality. Very much obliged. I ordered the Brussel sprouts, of course, which were cooked perfectly and had a wonderful (light) mustard finish. My only complaint was the size of the sprouts, not to be confused with the portion size, which was more than enough for one person. I just figured it had something to do with the season and happily ate up. I was 3 for 3 and couldn't have left happier.  Industry is a really cool, upbeat spot and I will most definitely be back when I get the chance. They are dog friendly, too, with water bowls and treats in the patio area.   Highly recommend!!  Sincerely,  MLA"

The big flaw was I didn't get the beer battered squash I ordered and paid for, but as Mr R didn't check the bag before leaving we cannot lay that all on them. It was a very busy night and mistakes happen.  The other error was I didn't get the 30% off to-go booze still advertised on their online menu which is why this isn't 5*  Mr R is besotted with their black bean veggie burger. I think there must be spice in the patty as none of the other listed ingredients explain its lovely low heat. He also likes the texture of the bean patty, he wanted me to mention that.  The salmon burger was good, huge, nice fresh veg, I love the spice in the aioli and poblano ranch, but I REALLY wish they still did the smoked salmon bagel I had one brunch there long ago.  The farm beet salad? Gorgeous. Mr R gleefully ate most of it on his own and he often eats salads with a sense of duty rather than joy. I loved the white balsamic vinaigrette it came with, I'm going to need that more often in my life.  The drinks to go? Hooray! One note, bring your own standard brown pulp drink tray if you think you'll need one because they didn't provide one. The pours were fabulous on our mimosas, The Closer and White Box. Ice was the perfect amount.  The transaction could have gone smoother, but the meal went down great. This remains a place Mr R wants to go *every* time he's in town."

We had an awesome time with Thor as our bartender last time we were in town. He was there this time and we got to say hi again. We sat at the bar and Raina took great care of us! We tried 2 lagers from different TX breweries and had some great shots. I could not decide among 3 choices for dinner, so I let her pick and surprise me. She chose the al pastor tacos. They were delicious! We are only staying in San Marcos 4 days and are already planning to go back for dinner on Monday! Ps if you are a whiskey drinker, try this! It was so smooth!"

The $11  mimosa carafe special immediately got my attention. I knew I had to have that. Found us a booth on the left corner by the bar. Ordered the mimosa, 2 industry burgers, Parmesan fries and the tater tot casserole. The mimosa was disappointingly room temperature. The burgers were bordering on salty but were good. We especially liked the chips and salsa that came with it. The fries were good but a little expensive for what you get. The tater tot casserole , we didn't like at all. Very salty and the hot sauce did not go with the dish at all. Don't think we'll come back."

We also had the chicken tacos and the person who had those raves about how good they were! We also had the queso, salsa, fried squash, loaded fries and Brussel sprouts for appetizer and all were a huge hit!! Most of the teenagers had the burgers and did not like them. They said they tasted like sausage. I think the issue is the burgers were very, very lean and smoked so they were a little dry.  The BIGGEST COMPLAINT were the flies...OMG!!! So freaking annoying to have to constantly be waving your hand back and forth so a darn fly does not land on your food!! Do something about that bc we would never come back solely for that purpose!"

Brunch is amazing, honestly i feel that no matter what you get you cant go wrong. I LOVE their Parmesan fries and their CFC with queso. Those boozy milkshakes are small but yes, boozy such as the rest of their alcoholic beverages. The industry burger and brisket tacos are also so amazing."

Masks are being worn by staff and limited capacity allows for social distancing.  There is patio dining however being right off the street with cars passing by frequently Tonight's food was good..Delicious smoked chicken thigh then fried much like a chicken fried chicken..Boy that smoke came through so well. Not a gargantuan serving like a chicken breast but nonetheless yummy.  The Reuben was great-toasty and melty...love Kraut so I would've doubled up. Cool college vibes and can see how this place might pack it in easily on any night of the week"

My favorite was definitely the sweet benny and chili cheese fries. I'm not usually a chili cheese fry fan but this chili is legitimately so delicious with chunks of brisket in it! The biscuit and jam combo is delcious but it was definitely more suited for 3 to 4 people instead of 2 with other dishes ordered. In hindsight, ordering 2 types of fried potatoes was probably over kill but still delicious none the less. I didn't try the half off mimosas but for sure next time, I'll definitely be getting a cocktail to try!   The staff was super friendly and great at getting our food out in a timely manner. The vibe out there was perfect and a lot of fun with the live music!  They seemed very on top of the cleaning and everyone wore masks when standing."

Also, since we sat at the bar, we watched Tiffany in full \"go-time\" mode.  She was professional and personable; making it look easy to provide drinks for a whole bar/restaurant single-handedly.  Although the process was apparently moving slower than normal, the interactions with her made it much more tolerable and it was a lot of fun talking to her.  We will definitely return."

They seemed to have attitudes of a bar that is not in a college town but a boujee downtown bar. The bartender who was close to my age charged me for regular priced drinks when we ordered 2/3 of our drinks in the happy hour range. When I came to close out and order our (3rd) last drink. The bartender said \"do you mind if I close you out?\" I thought this was very odd as it was a Wednesday evening and I was purchasing not only alcohol but food. I do believe they have an amazing food truck that supplies great food. I am sure this was a one time fluke as the rest of the experience was great. I do stand by my opinion that the staff maybe biased to certain crowds so be weary."

I always have a great time here. There's a variety of games throughout the place (corn hole, washers, big jenga) and there's a variety of spread out seating locations / areas. They frequently have a variety of seasonal things on draft as well as a good variety of beers in general. Definitely recommend going to check this place out if in the area and looking for a chill vibe."

That being said, we all got burgers so I feel like it could have been faster? The food hit the spot after a day on the river but just to get the waiters attention was hard work as they only had 4 people on duty. Then to pay the check again it was another long wait. I can't recommend this place if you're hungry, but if you have the time, sure you should go. Prices were reasonable."

Their menu is very over priced and boy do they love their micro-transactions or add-ons.  Fries are extra with their expensive and average burgers. BACON is like $2 extra.  They charge you for using a credit card and so much more.   Their queso is Velveeta and rotel and not even that good. Most of their chips they serve with the queso is tiny broken scraps and they get annoyed if you ask for more.   The staff is either uncaring or over-worked. I have had many incidences where I am eating solo and am ignored in getting service initially and after.  This is most likely because the server is more interested in dealing with the beer drinking frat guys. Almost every time I have been there I have been left without a basic refill of water. Many times i have also sat waiting for my food with no sight of my server.   The only saving grace of this place is the half price wings on Wednesday, but even then I would get them to go."

Place was not that crowded (in the front) and the tables were spaced out.  View was nice to enjoy those strolling by  the sidewalk.  The sign at the front said $3.50 bloody mary's, so I ordered one and it was the bomb (see pic).  Perfect drink that had all the fixin's.  The Chicken and Waffle Bites caught my attention, so I ordered that to hold us over.  These were really good and worth the appetizer! The reason for 2 stars knocked off were the service that was absent throughout our time here.  He disappeared all the time and couldn't find him once my sister and niece showed up.  This service made me decide to go somewhere else for lunch.  The other star was due to being charged full-price for the 2 bloody mary's.  I didn't say anything, as I wasn't sure when the waiter would come back and also felt small businesses need any extra cash during these times.  I still tipped the waiter, since they need money too but not sure how he was so busy with a light audience in the place."

They are my go to burger when I get a burger craving. However, I have heard that all their other specialty burgers are amazing as well.   My one complaint is the service. It's mainly a bar, it's going to be busy- I get it. I've worked the industry. But every time I've gone, something is wrong with my order, I'm double charged on something, or the waitress hardly ever comes to check on us.   I'll keep coming for the amazing burgers- and they deserve the stars, but the service needs some improvement."

They refused to serve me and I refused to stay quiet. I escalated to the owner after his employees all worked together to ensure that customer service is not important to them at all. I spend a lot of money eating out especially to try new things and I support local businesses. But I couldn't try their food because they don't accommodate properly to accept mastercard payment on a to go order (which they now claim they do allow). Hope you all decide to go somewhere else that values you as a customer. Support black owned businesses.  I hope the COVID hits them hard in the pockets."

We were promptly seated by a super sweet hostess. We have a toddler and we were able to grab the booth highchair on the way to our table instead of getting to the table and then waiting for a highchair. I know that doesn't mean a lot, but 90% of the restaurants we visit, we have to wait for them to seat us then they bring a highchair to our table. By them having the booth highchairs at the hostess station, they are \"working smarter, not harder\". Big kudos the them for that.  Our waiter was (forgive me for I didn't catch his name) was extremely knowledgeable of the menu and helpful for all questions.   I had the Cherry Limeade to go along with the Gringo Dip and Chips we ordered for our appetizer. Both the limeade and the chips/dip were outstanding. I would recommend both.  For entrees, we had the Prime Rib French Dip and the Havana Club. The French dip is the first sandwich listed and I didn't read any further. I'm a sucker for a good French Dip and this sandwich delivered. The wife commented that her Havana Club was delicious as well. The kids had grilled cheeses with fries. All looked great and they devoured them.  All in all, this is the spot you're wanting for an easy off/on when traveling north on I-35. We'll be back when we are in the area."

I checked in online before we showed up, and we were seated immediately. We both had the vodka strawberry lemonade cocktail, which was very sweet and weak. I ordered a chicken avocado sandwich with sweet potato fries.  My husband ordered the chicken quesadilla. Our food was prepared quickly. My sandwich was tasty, as well as the fries. My husband said the quesadillas were spicy."

Thanks to a friends recommendation we tried it today. Seriously the best steaks that we have had in a restaurant. They were literally cooked perfectly. It was the right amount of portions. I also got the basil lemonade. Our waitress was super sweet and efficient. Both my husband and I give this place a two thumbs up."

After tonight we will no longer be returning to 54th street restaurant. We had family come in from 2 hours away to try the food we always talk about, and were turned away, REFUSE us service because our party of 13 was \"too large\". Yet there was a party of 12 that didn't show for their reservation and still we were refused service. It was supposed to be the graduation dinner for my fiance and this is how it turned out. It is not our fault that the restaurant is understaffed, but losing us as loyal customers definitely is their fault. Save your time and $ take your family somewhere else."

Cooked and seasoned perfectly.  My daughter ordered the butter penne pasta with side of sweet strawberries, ice cream and strawberry lemonade. The lemonade was fresh and not overly sweet.  My husband had ribs. My friend had ribeye with blackened shrimp. Everything was tasty.  Waiter tried but kept forgetting stuff. We didn't get straws till 20 min after our drinks were served. Like no one got straws to drink.   then he kept forgetting the refills and my glass of water.  My 5 yo noticed and commented on the server's forgetfulness. He was nice but he's obviously new-- he didn't know the menu well at all. But it's fine, we had a good dinner. Price was very decent."

I had the Havana Club sandwich with the Chicken Tortilla Soup on the side and the Key Lime Pie for dessert. The sandwich was great! Pretty big and definitely worth the price. The soup was also good as well. The pie was great and unlike any other pie I've had, tangy and with amazing crust.  Overall the atmosphere of the restaurant was great, especially for the night time. Its got a cluttered pop-culture type decor style, similar to that of Beyond Burger, nice dim lighting, and huge comfortable booths. Our waitress was also very kind and did a great job. I highly recommend this place, especially in the night time for the atmosphere."

In addition this time we ordered the same Plate, Flat-iron steak and shrimp with mashed potatoes, I found the steak cooking to be perfect, as well as the shrimp just right.

A gentleman from North face recommended it to us and we are thankful we listened. The best way I can describe this place is a pub like feel with amazing pub like food and even better personal service! The gluten free menu was AMAZING and I felt safe eating here as a celiac! The rest of our group had plenty of option as well. Two of us had burgers and the other had soup and sandwich and we enjoyed every bite! Jeanne was our server (hope I spelt that correctly) and she did a great job helping us choose menu items! If we ever come back to Austin/San Marcos this will be a stop on our list!! The gluten free burger was so good, the bun was not crumbly or taste like cardboard but perfect! I actually took home half of the bun to eat later... ha! Thanks 54th Street, it was great!"

The establishment is adorable - informal seating inside and out.   I first got some pappadum and a few chutneys-tamarind and mint. They were spicy! Caught me off guard but delicious for sure.    My mom ordered the Curry Trio with chicken curry, paneer tikka masala, and saag paneer. I ordered  a beef kabob curry taco. Every bite of every dish was delicious. While I loved my taco, I highly recommend the Curry Trio because you get a great choice.   When we first got there, I was like meh. Only a few tables were seated outside and the inside was empty. But right after we ordered, the place quickly filled up! Wow.   The service was superb. I couldn't have asked for a better server. I'll definitely be back!"

I got the vegetable samosas, and the samosas were nearly perfect, with the potato and pea filling having just the right level of seasoning. They came with beautiful mango chutney whose chunks were visible and a lovely green chutney. Both were so delicious I was hard put to decide which I wanted to put on each of the three samosas.  For drinks I had two of the Wasatch Polygamy (a nitro porter), and it was fantastic. It had a hint of sweetness, but wasn't as overwhelming as a milk stout, but also the delicious flavor of a porter.  The patio dining was great, with plenty of shade.  The only reason I'm not giving five stars is that service was... slow, with respect to both drinks and food. Otherwise, the whole thing was outstanding."

We sat inside it's smaller but very cozy. They have a bar with many draft beers, wine and specialty drinks.  We started with the vegetable samosas and it came with side of mint sauce and mango chutney that was so tasty. Both complimented the samosas in a wonderful way. The flavors were amazing.  I ordered the tiki masala taco that was filled with so much flavor and very filling.       A must try!! And hubby had the trio which he choose tiki masala, curry chicken and butter chicken along with coconut rice. All three were fantastic.  Service was good and food was fantastic and very reasonably priced.  I'm excited to come back and try something new on the menu and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND North Street!! #supportsmallbusiness"

Went to lunch with coworkers on the first day of fall, so we got a table outdoors, never stepped foot inside. Service was slow, but it seemed it was only one waiter, so no points taken away for that.  Server was detailed in explaining what everything was and the level of spice and comfort. We had one vegan and one spice sensitive guest in our group, so he pointed out what would be best for the group to order. I ordered chicken nachos, and paneer tacos, wanting spice and meat. Other guests ordered samosas with mango chutney, vegan nachos, and spinach paneer. It was filling enough with a beautiful presentation! The jalapeno cream mixed with tamarind on the tacos mixed perfectly with the Indian spices.  The curry on the shredded chicken and tortilla chips (couldn't tell if they were made in house or store bought) had me trying not to lock the bowl. Will definitely go back to try more items on the menu!"

But seriously, if you're not already in San Marcos, come here. And eat this. It's that good. If you think you're a foodie and haven't tried this, fix that. So incredibly good. And for $9 per taco that's basically a meal and a party in your mouth, it doesn't exactly set you back much. They have a great beer selection too and cool ambiance and attentive service. But the tacos are the draw. Come here. Eat the Indian style tacos. 5 stars."

                "description": "Unique spot with a mix of great options of drafts and curries!  We enjoy having different types of beers and this place has a good unique assortment of drafts to try.  I was able to get some lavender cider since it was pretty early in the day, but the porter and stout options were very tempting (some at over 12% alcohol).  The dogs were with us so we settled outside in their spacious yard that has a lot of shade and a fan blowing.  We ordered curry fries as an appetizer and they were wedged exactly like chic fil a fries seasoned in a curry mix powder.  These were good, but can do with a pinch of sugar and lots of extra spice.  I had the chicken Tikka masala plate and my husband got the chicken 65 taco.  The taco looked more like a wrap and wasn't as filling as what he expected, but tasted pretty good.  Fried chicken seasoned in sauce inside the taco had a good kick to it.  My chicken Tikka masala plate was delicious, but a little extra spice would help.  Also, I think the restaurant can do better by adding naan! Great concept to check out!"

                "description": "In the latest wave of gentrification in this town, it seems like all I can find are hipster breweries that serve \"craft\" beer and overpriced food served on rectangular plates. If you like that kind of crap, go to aqua brew, you animal. If you want to go somewhere with cheap drinks and cool people (and if you live north of campus like this guy), look no further than Treff's. Some highlights.  You call it nights and you call it week:  Every Sunday, Treff's does $2.50 you call its, and $2.00 you call its on Tuesday. In addition to that, Treff's picks one week out of every month to be You call it week. That means $2 you call its all week. Going there, getting piss drunk, and stumbling back to my apartment, is among my fondest memories.   Atmosphere:  This place is dirty and divey in the best of ways. I used to go here with my friend from work all the time, and I always enjoyed seeing the bartenders and regulars. Really interesting people. Another upside is the patio, which allows filthy smokers like myself to smoke, drink, and have interesting conversations with other people. Another thing to mention, though, is that Treff's is much more of working people's bar. If you're a frat bro or sorority girl looking to blow mommy and daddy's money on a night of partying, you probably won't have a lot in common with the people here.  The glasses: This is just a little nitpick of mine, but I always hate going to the square and getting served drinks in a plastic cup. Treff's gets ridiculously busy some nights, and they still manage to serve all of their booze in glass, which is something I like. On another note, the bartenders here are absolute rock stars, and they don't take shit from anyone.   I haven't gone in a while since I don't have anyone to go with, but you can bet your ass the first place I'm taking my girlfriend when she turns 21 is gonna be Treff's."

He has expanded, added alot of TV s and updated the interior, but it will never be the place it was in the late 80's.  Keep blowing smoke, Patrick, - the Green Parrot is calling your name."

Can't beat it. Karaoke is also offered on Sundays, which is my favorite day to visit. Different events are hosted just about every day of the week. Although they don't serve food, they allow you to order at the restaurants near by and enjoy it there while washing it down with a cold alcoholic drink. Pretty awesome!"

A few minutes later another friend met up with us and brought a round of shots. Within 10 minutes of being there a bouncer came up to us and told us we need to leave because we were \"too drunk\". I told him we weren't and we hadn't drank at all before we got there, we had all just been at a work function. He told us the bartender saw us walking to the bathroom \"looking drunk\". He wouldn't let us finish our drinks that we had just been served and only made the 4 people with shots out of my friend group leave. I think the staff there is racist just like other reviews are saying. Won't be coming back."

As a longtime bartender being served by a long term bartender, when I'm told \"wells are $2\" I trusted that Chad would be honest with us. Instead, he took us to the cleaners. If I could give no stars I would. I have been in San Marcos for over 10 years. About 6 years ago I was man-handled by a door guy for no reason. I did not return to Treff's for almost 4 years. Since then, I have gone back a handful of times in hopes that it was just \"one bad apple\", but now I see that the employees at Treff's are out for nothing more than money. Even the door guy tonight was short and smile-less. I have received nothing less than awful service at this bar and I will not be returning."

Their selection of beers was so/so, although I had heard that they had more than what they actually had.  The parking lot was awful. Construction going on and one way in and out. Only about 10-13 cars could park and you can forget it if you're driving a truck, as the guy driving a f250 found out after hitting the parked Mercedes.  Not a great place for a huge group of people, but not bad for a San Marcos bar. When visiting just be wary of the parking lot and crazy drivers."

Well, as usual, we squished into a parking spot in the front of the tavern, walked in and sat at an open bar stool. I ordered an Ace pear cider and started chatting with friends while the jukebox was going with a vast array of music choices! Thats the beauty of a jukebox and I love the diversity!  Okay so I decided to check in (via Yelp) and saw that they had an offer for $2 drinks which really excited me because it wasn't a Tuesday and I still could get some $2 drinks? HELL YEAH!  WELLLLLLL.... it was more like a HELLLLLL NO because the bartender didn't allow me to redeem my deal. He even said he texted the owner and that the owner had no idea what kind of deal I was talking about? Well, the offer is still open on my Yelp app and I plan to find the owner next time I'm at the bar and ask him about it because that offer didn't magically come to be!!!  Anyway, yes Treff's is a super chill, casual and cool bar but they lost some points with not accepting my Yelp offer (I mean that's what the offers are there for hellloooooo)!! Guess I'll stick to only going in on Tuesdays..."

Though that is just the tip of the iceberg. Got here 2 hours before the fight and they would not turn any of the TVs to the prelims out on the patio. We asked 3 times and the 3rd time they said they could not cause people wanted to watch the soccer game that wasn't even on yet, also we are the only people at the time watching on the patio. Next is there was no cover when we got here, walked in sat down been drinking and eating and they are coming around telling us we have to go buy 15 dollar tickets at the door. On top of that the food is not high quality but the most expensive on the square and the service just isn't really there.   Also half the TVs are the fight and they are small TVs! Like super and low quality  Just ripping regular people off cause they are the only people on the square that show the fights. Bad business."

                "description": "WiFi password is Guest2018...  I haven't been to Sean Patrick's since I graduated from Texas State in 2011... Not much has changed and I'm glad for that. It was nice to reminisce.   Meet a couple for dinner while going through town. They recommended this place because they have \"The Incredible Burger\", a vegan burger option. They have driven to San Marcos a couple of times from Kyle just for that burger. One got it on a Patty Melt and said the Texas toast was the perfect addition. The other got it on a regular bun. Both with fries. Both disappeared quickly! They also had a Bloody Mary each. The staff was very accommodating in regards to one's request for extra olives.   My husband had the fish and chips Irish style, so a Guinness based batter. I had the fish and chips Texas style, so a corn meal based batter. Both were fantastic. I tried some of his. His better was crunchier and crisper than mine. Both were very good.  My husband had the Solid Gold lager. He said it was pretty light but good.   The overall noise got a little loud quickly but it's a Saturday night in a college town so that's not unexpected. There are a couple of pool tables and several TVs. It's a great college hang out place.   Lots of beer options.   My husband said there was a trough in the men's restroom... The ladies could have used some attention but mostly well maintained."

                "description": "I've been going to Sean patricks for a couple years now regularly with my girlfriend and my service dog. Every time we go someone always makes a comment to me about how well trained and well behaved my service dog is, and this evening was no different in regards to that. I always had a great experience with nice employees who were very welcoming.  I've never had a worse customer service experience in my life as I did today. The manager on duty Marshall Wyatt or Wyatt Marshall kicked me and my service dog out because he didn't have a vest for show that says service dog on it from Amazon. I explained to him more than I legally needed to in regards to my service dog. He at first turned me over to his manager under him, who was very nice, as employees usually are at Sean Patrick's. I compromised with sitting outside as they were busy on the inside anyways, and I didn't want to cause any issues. Then we were getting stormed on outside with winds blowing everything off our table and getting rained on while we ate. We only needed to have their coverings for the outside patio rolled down, but they took forever, and after asking multiple times for someone to come take care of it, I began taking care of it myself when finally Marshall Wyatt or Wyatt Marshall comes out and attempts to take care of it, but the covering just kept flying into our table and hitting my girlfriend. While we are getting pummeled by their outside seating covering. I pointed at it while making eye contact with Mr Wyatt, he makes eye contact, but continues being fixated on a tv while he leisurely walks over to assist. He walks back inside after putting a chair in the way. Well, the chair blows back on us with the crazy winds. We walk inside and get harassed by a bar back because Marshall Wyatt instructed him to in regards to my service dog. After explaining the law to the bar back we sit down, and I determined it was time to talk to someone about the experience I've had tonight. I spoke with the manager under mr Wyatt. Again, she was very nice, welcoming, and apologetic. After speaking with her mr Wyatt comes over to ask me how he was \"rude\" to me. I explained to him my experience, and he proceeded to argue every detail to defend and deny his lousy service. I thought he would come over to take responsibility as a manager and apologize, so I was caught off guard and told him that I didn't want to hear his argument, he then snatched everything off our table and kicked myself and my girlfriend out, saying that my service dog was in there \"illegally,\" even though I tried to explain to him that he can simply refer to the ADA website. I cannot say I will be coming back until Mr. Wyatt is gone.  Owner Brian Jeffrey, please make this right, and reach out to me. I will miss going to Sean Patrick's, but who my money goes to is a huge thing for me."

If you are looking for a place with some great food with an Irish flair, you are good to go.  If you like cold beer, and a great selection of it, again, you're good to go.  If you like good service, yep, good to go.   Lots of TV's.  Great place to take in a game.  Wonderful place to hang out in a college town and pass some time.  They've got pool tables, shuffleboard, a nice outdoor patio for you and your dog.    Overall, great drink selection.  Great beer selection.  Tasty food.  One of my SMTX faves, and certainly my GO-TO when I am in town!"

Me and my boyfriend came in to watch the World Cup game because I remembered this place had tons of tv's, and the most seating out of pretty much any bar in San Marcos . We ordered drinks , chili cheese fries, and a DELICIOUS 2$ scoop of pistachio almond ice cream in a waffle cone . All the food was awesome ( which I can't remember saying in past experiences .)   After the game we opted for some shuffle board and darts , which was a great end to an awesome World Cup game . Couldn't have asked for a better place/ environment for watching , enjoying great food, and hearing a lively crowd !!!"

When their order came out the fish and chips were awful, breading was soggy and the 'white' fish was grey in color, they were refunded the meal, but didn't want to take a chance on anything else. Later I went to use the restroom, only to be in a stall that has no toilet paper. Very disappointed as I was from out of town and looking to try something local. Very disappointed."

It's ok to make it with beef but one must correct their menu as it's correctly called \"Cottage Pie\" when made with beef.   Blackjack Burger - Pretty Good Philly Cheese Steak - No Flavour (yes, there's a damn U in it) Smithwicks - Ran Out (pronounced incorrectly... don't say the W)  As a immigrant this is far from Irish, in fact so far removed from anything Irish it's an insult. No offense, but an American would never know the bloody difference! In addition, the bathrooms are named \"Lasses\" and \"Boyos\".... the ladies is a SCOTTISH name and the men's is WELSH name; no S at the end. This damn place needs to learn some shit really quickly, because they look like fuck'n idiots to everyone out of county.

We tried to tell him separate tabs, handed him a 20 and a credit card for the two tabs. He kept the 20 and didn't bring back any change, and charged all of the drinks on one tab- never saw him again.

Also the cider flight is $10!  The pizzas are pretty good! I got the white blanc both times and added pepperoni and jalapeños to one and just jalapeños to the other!  Again, i place to stop by after floating the river( normal times) or shopping at the outlets!"

We were a bit more casually dressed as I would've liked, but it's okay because it was our first visit.   The vibes here are amazing. Everything looks nice and sophisticated. We both had drinks, a couple of martinis and something else that I can't quite remember.   The Brie was something new to my boyfriend, and we really enjoyed it. My Margherita pizza was perfect and my boyfriend Chicken Blanc pizza was also sooo good. I think his was better than mine, lol!   I recommend this place to everyone I run into. It's so cute and the perfect date night"

This is the only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars Bec we expected more selection. They have a few cheese plate options and small gourmet pizzas. I chose the pear and bacon pizza, which was delicious. my husband had a pepperoni pizza. I also ordered a sangria flight, which was quite nice. On Thursday nights they offer a free lava cake with the purchase of a flight. The lava cake was tasty. The servers were friendly and the decorations were nice."

                "description": "Trendy spot in San Marcos for wine and cheese. Can get crowded if it's too hot for anyone to want to sit outside. There is overflow parking across the street, appropriately signed as extra parking for Patio Dolcetto.  Someone put a lot of effort and love into designing the space.   Alex the bartender was very friendly and our group had good conversation with him.   They have a Sunday Special right now: a bottle of wine (5 options) and a cheese board for $25. The cheese board had water crackers, Marcona almonds, dried apricots, craisins (?), jam, Olive tapenade, a smoked Gouda, a cheddar - almost like TJs unexpected cheddar, but more firm and reminiscent of Parmesan (not crumbly like UC), and a chèvre (I think). All very tasty.   We did the special twice. The White Zin was given to us on accident (instead of the merlot we requested) but they're very low key and friendly and we try to be easy going (especially about wine!) so we enjoyed the Zin.   I look forward to checking out other specials and enjoying the nice atmosphere outside when it gets a little cooler."

I ordered the white sangria, which fair warning was very sweet but it was still delicious. The menu said the white sangria had ginger in it, although I didn't taste that specific ingredient I was hoping for, it was still a good choice. They do wine flights as well, and have a pretty good happy hour.  We ordered a cheese board and sat at the bar. The cheese board was generous and filling, the service was great, and the atmosphere was on point. It is a casual wine bar, and they had live music outside which would have been nice to watch aside from the cold weather. They have a lot of seating outside, and a good amount of community seating inside.  Overall, great experience here and will be hopefully going back!"

We were staying in the adorable town of Wimberley so I researched tours in the area.  Jodie's Taste of the Hills Tour got great reviews and went to wineries close to the Wimberley area. The day of the tour ended up being chilly and rainy. As soon as Jodie pulled up with her spectacular shuttle-like van she was out like a flash with pretty umbrellas for us! We went to 3 different wineries which we thoroughly enjoyed! After the first one, we returned to Jodie's vehicle and she had a gorgeous tray for us of cheese,  sausage,  crackers,  grapes,  olives, dips.....simply divine!!! The tour was also just the 2 of us and we loved that Jodie still did ALL of this for a tour that I believe takes up to 12 people! The next time we plan a trip to the Hill Country we are going to do one of Jodie's Beer tours!! We had such great conversations with Jodie too! Thank you sooooo much for the GREAT time! Sooooo much fun!"

                "description": "Amazing tour!!! My wife and I came into Wimberley during Spring Break to relax from teaching and this was the perfect trip to do so! Jodie made us all feel like we were old friends, even though we had never met anyone else on the bus.  She was very detailed with the stories of each winery, and explained all the different varietals, answering our every question along the way. The bus was very comfortable and clean, and she stored each bottle we purchased until the trip was over, but we could have had the bottles on the bus had we chosen to.  The wineries all seemed to know her, so they were expecting us and were incredibly friendly. We were not rushed anywhere, and still managed to make it back into town to enjoy shopping on the square.  My wife and I were pretty hungry by the time we had lunch, since we didn't have breakfast, but the tapas style lunch was perfect for the glass of wine we purchased to have with it. The lunch was delicious and filling.  Overall this was an amazing experience and I will be recommending this tour to everyone I know."

Jodie is such a pleasant and inviting soul. She asked about each person's preferences as to be able to personalize the tour and pick which wineries she decided to take us too.  She is very knowledgeable of the town and the wineries.  The lunch she provides is just amazing. By the time we were done I felt like I had made an incredible new friend. I can't wait to go back and do more tours."

We were fortunate enough to have great people touring with us, and it made the tour all the more fun.  She prepared the best picnic lunch I've ever had.  Sugar Shack cake balls, meats, cheeses, crackers, hummus, a goat cheese something served on crackers (that I LOVED, and I hate goat cheese), spinach feta rolls, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something.  She was fully prepared for everything.  Boxes for the wine we bought, umbrellas in case in rained (it didn't), plenty of water...this wine tour couldn't have been more perfect if she tried.  Thanks, Jodie!"

She provided an excellent variety of foods including a hot portion and gluten-free (just in time `cause I was lit after the 1st vineyard). The three vineyards for that day were selected based on the wine preferences of the tourists that day (A+ perk). We never felt pushed or obligated to buy wines, but we all did because they were very good (!), and Jodie kept our purchases organized and stored for us. She also gave a good background on each vineyard and on the Wimberley area in general. We learned a lot about Wimberley and wine and were able to get tipsy knowing Jodie was an excellent driver of her comfy bus. And have you been to Wimberley? That hilly countryside is beautiful!"

Our tour was originally scheduled for 10:30a, but got pushed back to 1:15p due to shuttle trouble (we had the option to receive our money back, but actually liked the later time).  We stopped at three wineries, including Driftwood Estate and Duchman Family Winery.  The views at all of the wineries varied, but each were unique to their locations.  Jodie provided an amazing picnic-style lunch, including a charcuterie (meat and cheese) board, chicken salad, nuts, walnut and feta salad, grapes, chocolate cake balls, bottled water, etc. At the second stop, Jodie was kind enough to call in people's orders to Salt Lick BBQ and had it all ready to take home by the third stop.

She gave us a lot of background information on the wineries as well as the town of Wimberley. She had a delicious assortment of snacks for us to munch on while we rode to and from each winery. She helped package our wine purchases and brought us umbrellas as it started to rain. She even went the extra mile, literally, and drove us back to our hotel since it was raining as we had walked to our meeting spot earlier in the day. We had another couple on the tour with us which was really nice since we had people to mingle with. It was a very personal experience and I felt as though we were all just great friends spending an afternoon together. Who needs Napa, everything is better in Texas!!! We will definitely be repeat customers."

The stereo system was bumping, and Daniel, our amazing driver, had no issue with us turning it up to 11.  Our group was most guys in their 30's and Daniel gave us good recommendations on spots to check out that were age appropriate.  In between spots, Daniel drove me to a gas station to help me restock on beer. He even came in and helped me carry and load beers into the coolers.  Great communicate from Daniel from beginning to end, and he someone found the perfect spot to pick us up on busy Rainey St at the end of the night.   Great value and great experience.  Highly recommend."

He picked us up from our Airbnb and drove us 45 mins out and back, while we blasted some rachet songs to sing haha. He would check in on us during the winery to see if we needed anything or have any questions, and he would offer to help us take multiple pictures. He also got one of the wineries to allow us to explore their cellars!   On our last day in Austin, he drove by our airbnb to pick up someone else and honked at us as we waited for our uber. We were all so happy to see him again, as we all enjoyed our experience with him.   I recommend Texas Tipsy Tours with Arlen ;)"

She was friendly and very informative.  She helped make the experience exactly what I was looking for. I wanted less sweet wines and a winery with food options. Arlen was our diver and was so knowledgeable and friendly. He picked us up right at the hotel in Austin. I felt the price for the experience is definitely worth it. If you were considering this experience, I highly recommend this company. They care and that is important."

They are organized and timely. If you're an out of towner like myself and decide to book accommodations in Austin they will pick you up from there and bring you back.   All of my future bookings I will definitely request Wade. He was very professional and personable, he made sure we were taken care of at each location on our tour. He also was more than happy to take our pictures along the way."

From the minute I called to book to the minute I said goodbye to our driver the day of the tour they were fantastic.   So when I called there actually weren't any times available. They worked with me to make sure they had a tour time and sprinter available for our group of 6. I had a million questions; they were patient and kind.   Our group was 6 but one of my friends asked if we could add an additional person. Reached out to TTT and they said sure no problem. Literally 3 HOURS LATER I got a call that another girl tested positive with covid and wouldn't be able to come with us obviously- they were so nice and made the switch back to 6. Very grateful for their exceptional customer service.   Day of our driver Bryant was early which was great! Got on the bus and let us have free range of the radio, answered any wine questions we had or any questions about Fredericksburg. He was a fantastic host. Always texted 15 minutes till our time at the winery was up and took as many pictures as we wanted. He was so sweet! He also made sure we were never thirsty or hungry. Which for a group of girls is very important- smart man! Haha   I've heard things about other companies having hidden fees and people getting charges after leaving Fredericksburg and we had none of that. Texas Tipsy Tours was very transparent with all of their pricing and they had no hidden fees.   Thank you TTT for making our trip perfect. You won't regret booking with them."

                "description": "My experience with Texas Tipsy tours was nothing short of perfect!!! From pickup to drop-off, Courtney (the owner) made our experience amazing! When I initially started inquiring about a tour a few months ago, many of the companies only offered private tours for a minimum of 4 people. However, Texas Tipsy Tours offers small group private tours (i.e. 2-3 people). This was perfect for me. She also made planning our trip so easy, and she promptly answered all of the questions I had.   On the day of the tour, she picked us up from our hotel in Austin in an Infiniti SUV (it was very clean too)! She even made a pit stop for me at a CVS on the way to our first winery. Throughout the 6 hour tour, she made sure we stayed on schedule. She even let us change a stop last minute because we wanted to check out a brewery!  One thing that was amazing was the comfort she provided! She allowed us to pick the music, provided phone chargers, and let us control the AC! She even opened our doors for us AND dropped us off/picked us up right in front of each place we went!  Overall, I highly recommend Texas Tipsy Tours, and I will definitely be back!"

We chose the half day option and were picked up right at our vacation rental (Farmhouse on Elder Hill) We wanted to just stay nearby so we visited Driftwood Estate Winery and Fall Creek.  We were planning to also see Vista Brewing (all in Driftwood), but we chatted and laughed so much that we ran out of time and Eric, driver/owner was flexible with our change of plans and let us just extend our time enjoying the fabulous view at Driftwood Estate.  The tour service was absolutely awesome and professional.  Everything done with excellence.  Thank you Courtney and Eric!"

I have taken quite a few van tours around the hill country and Texas Tipsy Tours sets themselves apart by not just being drivers but they truly host you the entire day. I will ALWAYS use this company going forward. We did a private charter from Driftwood to Austin, TX and back and Keaton our driver was a delight. He made sure we were picked up on time and each of our stops were easy and flexible. We did a mixed tour around Driftwood and Dripping springs the next day and our guide Eric executed the BEST DAY for us. He even picked up on what we were liking and recommended a change to our final stop to Vista Brewing and we were SO glad he did. At each stop he made sure we had plenty of water, snacks and chairs to enjoy the gorgeous venues. This is totally above and beyond what we would have expected from a driver. Courtney was so easy to work with and she helped make recommendations for our group ultimately making our weekend get away FLAWLESS. I promise if you don't use this company, you're wrong."

It was as easy as getting on the phone, explaining what I wanted, and Courtney took care of literally everything else. We picked the breweries we wanted and even included a food stop. She coordinated the bus pick up, drop offs, schedule, and even reserved tables for us at each stop. I love that we had our own bus (very nice one, by the way!), and had the flexibility to create our own tour based on beers and food my husband liked. It was the perfect Saturday in Austin! Payment was very easy as well - they sent me an invoice to my email and I was able to pay directly online for everything. Highly recommend, and thank you Texas Tipsy Tours!"

Courtney and Eric are just the sweetest people! Would highly recommend if you're looking for a relaxed tasting without the hubbub of big party buses, AND if you're looking for a more personalized experience with people who can really throw a party. Fredericksburg can be confusing because of the many, many options, so Courtney's expertise in the wineries proved incredibly helpful. Highly recommend!!"

As a new resident to the area, it's important for me to know what high quality tour guides are available. Well, Winding Road Hill Country Wine Tours with Billy is definitely the way to go, folks."

                "description": "Looking to experience great Hill Country wines and barbecue - we had both taking Winding Road Wine Tours Salt Lick Sunday Wine Tour.  The tour picked us up in Gruene in a new luxury bus at 10:30. We were greeted by the tour owner Billy Martin.  The bus was very comfortable with a u shaped seating arrangement and a table in the aisle.  Should seat around 12 people comfortably. The bus has a great sound system that is Bluetooth enabled - Billy played whatever we wanted from sources such as Pandora and Napster music service. First stop was Driftwood Estate Winery. Driftwood has perhaps the best winery views in the Hill Country.  I really enjoyed the reds and came away with a bottle of Longhorn Red to enjoy at our next stop Salt Lick Barbecue. Yes, Salt Lick is byob. It was beginning to rain and Billy dropped us off near the check in stand. He's thought of his customer's needs providing us large golf umbrellas. It was busy with people waiting to be seated. However, he got us seated right away. Our final two wineries were Fall Creek right across the street from Salt Lick and then Wimberley Valley Winery. Fall Creek has solid wines and the service for our group was outstanding. Wimberley Valley Winery was an unexpected pleasure. Their tasting room is roomy and comfortable with plenty room at the tasting bars and a comfortable seating area facing a large stone fireplace. They have a variety of wines bottled on site along with other wines from around the world. The grounds were spectacular with numerous large shaded decks to enjoy a glass or bottle as you wrap up your tour.  What a great Sunday drinking Texas wines, eating Texas barbecue and meeting new friends!"

Throwing a surprise weekend is stressful enough but Woody was SUPER accommodating especially for being so last minute.  There were many tours that I could've chosen to stick with but Woody was so authentic about his services and was a person of integrity when it came to what he offered.  He personally picked us up from our little hotel we were staying at and drove us to all three of our tours. His tour bus was super clean and we all had a blast! He even offered to pick up some cheese and snacks at the HEB close by to have on the bus if we wanted! I really appreciated Woody taking the time to answer my numerous phone calls with questions I had as this is my first Bachelorette party I threw.  I HIGHLY recommend using Woody if anyone wants to have a great time and looking for someone to trust. I will be booking with you again Woody, thank you so much for everything!"

If you come across Fredericksburg Uncorked Wine Tours, stop your search and make the booking.   Organizing a wine tour for 18 girls as part of a bachelorette party was a breeze with Woody, the owner/operator of Uncorked. He gave great advice, offered competitive pricing (especially for the expectant mothers/non-drinkers in our group), and was easy to communicate with. Woody was incredibly patient during the lead up to our tour, and then was a funny, gracious, and attentive guide during our wine tasting experience.   Our tour was fantastic from start to finish, and I can't recommend Woody and the rest of the Fredericksburg Uncorked team highly enough. All (18) of us had the greatest time!"

I honestly called three or 4 more tours throughout the week and left messages and he is the only one that called me back. Not only did woody come through, he came through at the last minute when I thought We weren't going to make a tour.  He was funny , knowledgeable and overall a great guide. He even recommended a few things that weren't apart of the tour (Alamo Springs Cafe) which we ended up going to and was delicious.  Lunch was not included but the place we went to was pretty great for a sandwich . I'd hang out and grab a beer with woody any night !  Thank you for making my boyfriends birthday a good one !!"

I was upset and apparently he was too so he threw customer service out the window. I never agreed to Woody keeping my credit card information on file after he charged the wine tour for 11 girls (almost $1,300).   The driver Tommy was nice but he did nothing special and didn't know the basics of Woody's business. Had he known even a little bit about Uncorked Tours, there wouldn't have been confusion about lunch.   As far as the wine tour: William Chris and Lost Draw were my favorite wineries. Hye Market pretended we weren't there half of the time. Pontotoc was greedy with their pours.   Woody was very unprofessional and difficult to work with at the end. I would not recommend him. Book early to get the highest rated wine tours (2-3 months prior)!"

It was a really great and memorable experience and I would definitely consider doing it again! We had our own spacious limo that we could sip on wine we brought with us, as well as some we purchased at the wineries we visited, while driving from one vineyard to the next (drive time between each location was max. 15 minutes).

We got dropped off at COTA for a show and had a great time!  But where it turned south was at the end of the night. I texted our driver 30 minutes before we needed to be picked up (like he requested) and he said no problem. Then we left the concert and were walking to the pickup spot where I gave him a call. He said he got in an accident but would only be 20 minutes and I said that's fine. 20 minutes roll by and I gave him a call again, no answer, but texted and said it would be another 20 minutes. We ended up waiting in the cold for almost an hour and well after most people had left COTA. Multiple people in our party ended up just taking ubers because they didn't want to wait. The whole point of a bus is so you don't have to wait.  The next day, I texted Robert saying we would like a refund for the extra hour we paid for waiting that we wouldn't have used if we had been picked up on time. He said he would call to discuss but never did. I've now sent him multiple emails - mind you, being incredibly nice about it. All I asked for was an hour refunded back - not the whole thing, not even half. But still no response.  The customer service level of this company is terrible should anything go wrong. So hire them at your own risk."

                "description": "Apologies for this review being so incredibly late but Austin Nites was the best! We had rented a party bus on pretty short notice to take a Bachelor Party to and from Lake Travis and Robert and team were amazing.   It was also Prom weekend so the schedule was packed for them but they still took care of us and worked with our schedule.   Our boat ended up staying out on the water longer than scheduled which through our plans all over the place and Robert was there waiting on time. Given his packed schedule, the driver did have to leave without us but Robert made sure to get me in contact with another service and they sent a bus over right away.   All in all, it was an incredible experience!"

                "description": "For $700+ for four hours we would have expected a better looking bus. Multiple dents around outside of bus. The AC barely working. Missing panels inside of bus missing or duct tape together.  Another party bus parked next to the one we had and it was so obvious how terrible looking our bus looked.   Can't believe owners would let this bus represent their company. Hope they use our $700 toward getting it fixed.   Driver was pleasant."

They also provided ice, cups and a cooler for us so we didn't have to worry about taking our own. I would definitely recommend them, and will do business with them again. Thank you Robert for the awesome service and thank you Walker (our driver) for keeping up with my crazy friends and brining us home safe."

                "description": "I'm incredibly frustrated with this business.  We had spoken a couple times in the months before I decided to book and I initially felt great about potentially booking with these friendly people.  When it came time to book I called them and was told, once again, that our requested date was open and we talked out an agreement.  The owner tells me we're good to go, and that all he needed me to do now was to send him my information so that he could get a contract sent that same day.  I'd explained to him that I was booking this bus ride to and from a party boat, and that I would be booking with them that day as well.   SO, I get off the phone and send my info.  I call my party boat folks to let them know I've just confirmed my bus, and I'm ready for a boat.  I book with them based on my discussion with these guys and put down $400 to hold our reservation.  It's been two weeks since I last spoke with this company and they have ignored my calls, texts, voicemails trying to figure out why the contract hasn't come through.  Our event is next month, and at this point I've been researching new solutions, and unfortunately the new solution means I can't use the same boat company, and therefore I've lost my $400 deposit.  I did not have this money to lose, but after being ghosted by this company I guess I have to take the loss and move on.  They seem like nice people, and it takes A LOT to get on here and write a negative review, but this has caused me a lot of stress and I want to prevent this from happening to anyone else.  I hope at some point I find out a reasonable explanation and can revise this review, but not counting on it.  We'll see I guess."

But how is that supposed to work when you have a huge group? I called austin nites party rentals for a few reasons 1. I love puns and 2. I'm am austinite and 3. My group was over ten people and we wanted to go out and have nothing to worry about. Great party bus, great personable driver, great experience definitely reccomend these guys!! DONT DRINK AND DRIVE!! Call someone you can trust call Austin Nites!!"

                "description": "BOOK WITH THIS COMPANY!  Robert did a solid job taking me and a bunch of my friends to Lake Travis and back on July 4th. His price was WAY lower than other companies I called, being the ONLY one that actually sticked to his regular prices during this busy day. He arrived early and was 100% responsive to my emails and phone calls. He arrive early to pick us up and was extremely friendly and professional. He helped us carry our coolers and accommodate everything on the bus.  The bus itself is amazing. Seats are stacked in two rows facing each other, which is great for dancing and socializing, since you are actually facing half of the crowd. The sound system is also very good. I almost feel that the bus trip was even more fun that the boat.   In summary, Austin Nites Ent. is the best on price/quality, Robert and his wife are responsive, professional and friendly, and the whole experience I had with them is positive. Would highly recommend anyone to use it, and will definitely consider using them again if I ever need to.  Thank you guys!!!!!"

                "description": "We rented a party bus from Robert for my brother's 30th birthday. They were one of the only companies I found that didn't increase their rates because of prom season. I called about 10 other companies looking for fun and safe travels with almost all of them being ridiculously overpriced to take advantage of the prom goers. Robert was very accommodating, professional, and had awesome rates. He called two days before the scheduled time of arrival to check in and verify everything was still good to go. He asked if there were any changes in the amount of people and offered a bigger bus just in case. Our drivers, Patrick and Joe were awesome! Patrick called me early the day of to verify everything and let me know he'd be there at 8 and then called again when they were almost to our pickup location. They arrived right on time with an awesome bus just for us. He had coolers with ice, a flat screen tv, music system, AC and even a bathroom in the back. What more could you ask for? Part of the evening was spent at Graham's Central Station in Pville. We didn't realize prior that Graham's doesn't serve food anymore and had to order pizza to the bus. Patrick gladly retrieved our pizza and brought it to us when it arrived. We all had a blast, felt safe and were taken care of. Highly recommend Austin NItes and shout out to Patty PartyWagon, if you had a Yelp page, I'd write a review for you too."

Sam, the owner and driver, was unbelievable. Very accommodating, great driver, and super chill.   We planned to hit up the Salt Lick on the party bus and then venture around to some breweries afterwards. Sam made sure that the group got where we needed to be on time, had great suggestions for breweries, and made sure we were having as much fun as possible.  The bus is great. Fit everyone comfortably with enough room for a cooler in between all of us. Sam had her playlist turned up or she would hand over the AUX cord and we could play our tracks as loud as we wanted. The whole experience was incredibly laid back and worry free. I would absolutely recommend Cool bus ATX to anyone that wants to have a great time with a big group in Austin.   On a side note, if it is Sunday, make sure that you buy beer on Saturday because they don't sell it on Sunday before noon.   Thanks again, Sam!"

                "description": "Do NOT recommend! We booked a tour for 8 people and everything was a mess from the beginning. We were told we would be upgraded to a 15 passenger bus. A 15 passenger VAN showed up with a dent in the side and ripped seats. We were told we could bring coolers. We were only able to fit 8 adults in the van with our two coolers- no way we could've had another person in the van. None of the wineries had been scheduled yet and the ONE we had specifically requested was not available. We had to scramble ourselves to find wineries, in which we were promised everything would be done ahead of time. The meat and cheese tray that was promised was a small tray that was bought during the tour at a convenient store to feed 2 people. Our driver was great, however the owner did not deliver what was promised and we were highly disappointed. There are plenty of companies to choose from, and I would NOT recommend Open Range."

He cares about his clients, and goes out of the way to make sure their experience in the wine country is the best it can be. We've used him so much, that we will never use another company when we're in the region. You can't do any better than Open Range, trust me."

He picked us up from San Antonio, drove us up to Hill Country and around to 3 wineries.  As this was my first Texas wine tour, he did an AMAZING job of helping us select which wineries would be a good fit for the group.  As we had a decent amount of guys with us- he suggest Garrison Brother's Distillery which ended up being a HUGE hit!  He was extremely professional, courteous and just an absolute delight to spend the day with!  He also has a wicked funny sense of humor.  He was also very accommodating and ordered and picked up lunch for us so we could continue to enjoy beautiful Hill Country.  I would use him again in heartbeat and highly, highly recommend him to anyone wanting to enjoy Texas Hill Country!  Thanks David!"

D'Ann was extremely responsive and gave me several suggestions of where to go. Since I'm a wine club member at quite a few wineries in the Hill Country, I opted to do a custom tour and made my own reservations. Greg, the owner (and D'Ann's husband) arrived on time and drove us to 3 wineries where we were able to enjoy a nice, relaxing afternoon. Greg was so friendly, helpful and accommodating. I would highly recommend Open Range Tours...thanks, D'Ann and Greg!!!"

They know a lot about the wineries and have personal relationships with the owners/managers/tasting staff.

                "description": "We went to Fredericksburg for a girls trip and wanted to spend a day at the distilleries and breweries. David was fantastic to work with planning everything out. I wouldn't have changed any of that part. But, once the day rolled around we were met with a hiccup. The driver, not David like I was anticipating after multiple conversations, arrived in a mustang for 5 of us. Obviously that wasn't going to work so I was offered by the driver only to cancel or reschedule. Our trip was planned around spending our day out and about so cancelling wasn't an option for us. After a phone call to David, we were assured our day wasn't ruined just a bit delayed. The driver left and showed back up with an SUV and away we went. The driver wasn't interactive and she didn't seem to even be having a good day... It happens I get it but come on. Anyway, we made the best of our day and enjoyed ourselves. When we were dropped off, I tried to pay but she said to get with David. No problem but I did have a problem with her then saying that she'd go ahead and take the gratuity and that the standard is 20%. I didn't even know what our total cost was to figure 20% but asking for the gratuity before I even paid for the day was in poor taste. We did go ahead and tip, and well mind you, because that's the kind of people we are. I ended up calling David and finishing out the transaction and once again, he was a pleasure to deal with. Overall, we'll use them again because I appreciated David that much. But, I'll definitely make sure we don't have the same driver. 5 stars for David but 4 stars overall for the above mentioned."

The transportation (van) was very clean and well-taken care of. We had the van to ourselves on the couple's tour but it can easily fit a big party!  Booking a couple's wine tour on their website was super easy (and I'm sure it would be for big groups too)! The date availability, cost estimate, and customizability is spot-on. The moment you book, they send you a comprehensive list of wineries and distilleries (!!!) with rankings of the view + wine. They also have great options for add-ons, such as a charcuterie board or stopping by for lunch mid-wine tour. Love that.  There's no doubt I would choose and recommend 830 Elevated again for any future wine excursions in Hill Country. Thanks again, Brayden and Deb :)"

From start to finish everything was so easy and customizable to what we were looking for while planning our annual girls trip. Prices are incomparable with Five Star treatment on a PRIVATE tour. Right after booking we got an email with a list of the area wineries and restaurants that had notes and ratings so we could choose where we wanted to go. This is a private tour so Brayden picked us up right in front of our Airbnb and we were off. We toured four wineries and he kept us on schedule but never rushing us. After the tours we opted for the night service so he dropped us off on Main Street so we could grab dinner, sing some karaoke and when ready to be picked up to end the evening just had to shoot him a text and he was there. We just cannot say enough good things about this company. Do not second guess - book with Brayden and Deb"

I believe they were on the city website as a recommended tour, but also Google directed me to them. Either way, I am so glad it happened this way - our experience with 830 was indeed elevated!!! The customized tour that Deb set up with me over the phone was exactly what my husband and I wanted - a distillery, a brewery, and a winery that made you feel like you were in Napa. Without even knowing us, Deb helped picked the perfect places for us to enjoy. Communication up until the tour and the day of the tour was prompt and courteous, always with our best intentions in mind (example: Deb texted us and offered to pick us up even earlier than planned due to the heat at one of the outdoor locations). The drive in between locations was full of great conversation, and we were thankful they provided cold water for us. The van was immaculate and the drive was very comfortable - I didn't know the luxury that a private vs public tour would offer! Deb was so knowledgeable (she's a local, of course!) and so sweet with helping us newbies figure out what to do. Her service went above and beyond, and she made us feel like celebrities. It was an absolute pleasure to work with them - do yourself the best favor and book with them!!"

But the best we could find was a limo driver that would charge us almost what it would for 4 people. Then we found 830 Elevated. They're filling a niche most tour companies aren't by providing an affordable private tour option for couples. They were great. Small, young company. They don't have deep knowledge on wine like veteran companies but they are personable in that they also tour wineries themselves and can share their inputs."

Here's my story-   I booked with this company over a month in advance prior to my trip to Fredericksburg for my fiancé and I's anniversary, as well as his birthday. After booking, the company was very communicative for the first few days. After the first few days, I did not hear a word from them until the week of our trip. I had told them a month in advance which places we wanted to go. The week of, they inform us that Augusta vin is not taking people for reservations. Which was fine, we went ahead with the other vineyard they had suggested. We had booked for a Saturday. That Friday at 3:00AM, they had informed us of a change of driver due to a family emergency which we completely understood, and now that our pickup time had changed to 11:30AM instead of 1:30PM. I wake up to that email Saturday still understanding, and we changed our plans to be at the pickup destination by 11:30AM. We are waiting there over 15 minutes for them to show, and no one does. We call, leave voicemails, and still hear from no one. 30 minutes passed, they send a TEXT MESSAGE informing us they aren't showing up for the entire time and that we are on our own for the entire day. LEAVING OUR PLANS FOR THE ENTIRE DAY RUINED. Incredibly horrid communication from this company. DO NOT BOOK WITH THIS COMPANY!!!! I seriously am understanding that situations happen in life, but they had guaranteed us a driver for the day regardless of what had happened. I was truly heartbroken to have not received a personal phone call from the company, instead they just send us a text that they are not coming. I have NEVER written a review for a company before, but this needed to be shared. We discussed the situation with multiple locals in the town, no one had ever heard of this company. Whatever you do, save your money and time."

He ended up being our driver on our own private bus for a 40th birthday trip with 4 crazy girls. He was at our beck and call and did not complain once. We had 3 wine tour stops and then Luckenbach, and it was soooo fun!  All 3 places were each different than the other which gave us a great variety. Thank you John for a wonderful time!"

It was so relaxing to sit back and enjoy the day with friends, all while knowing every detail had been taken care of.  This coming from a very \"type A\" personality is a huge 5 star! We did the \"red rose\" package, touring 3 wineries and had a few hours in Luckenbach.  John was friendly, fun and a great host. All we had to do is drink wine, visit with friends and enjoy the day! If you are looking for a fun experience, try Yellow Rose! We will be back next year to do it all over again!"

                "description": "Do not use this \"tour\"!! It is cheaper to pay the tasting fees and hire your own driver. The owner is greedy and a complete A. We originally had 5 ladies who were going on the tour with us and one backed out. We didn't ask for a private tour and John (who I'm guessing is the owner) didn't tell us until we were already at the first location that he would stop the tour until we paid for a fifth person that wasn't there. No wonder he kept pushing cash, it was a complete rip off. It was either go home after that tour paying $125 a person..Or have two more tours while paying for a person who wasn't there. PS it's about $15 for the wine tastings. ($15x3=$45) It was not worth it. On a positive note, Gary at Hanhe Estates winery was amazing. Highly recommend this guy and his wine."

                "description": "\"Tour\" is an awfully strong word. We were picked up and then drove for 45 minutes without our driver, John, saying a word about where we were going or how long it would take to get there. He then picked up 3 other people when it was supposed to be a private tour. He took us to the wineries but never said a word about where to go or what to do. He followed us around at the wineries and sat with us. He was 30 minutes late then forgot what the schedule was supposed to be and tried to keep us at the 2nd winery until 30 minutes after we were supposed to be home. He told us we could pay with cash or card, but he only actually took cash or PayPal, which put some people in a real bind. He hounded us about payment the whole time. It was awful and we will never do it again."

                "description": "My husband and I are from the North East Austin area and wanted to get out of town for the weekend to pre celebrate our upcoming one year wedding anniversary. I searched online for fun things to do in the area, and this place was consistently popping up. I took that as a sign!   I was worried because my husband isn't too into wine but he wanted to go! We arrived in mid-afternoon and it was pretty quiet. The restrooms are separate from the tasting room so I went in before we start our tasting, my husband went into the tasting room. The restrooms were clean and nicely decorated. When I joined up with my husband he had struck up a lively conversation with the two dudes behind the counter. No, they weren't two of the three dudes, but they took great care of us during our stay here!   We tried all 6 of their available wines and my husband only disliked two of them. I was impressed because he's sooooo picky. We decided on the Texas Red, and we picked up a bottle to share on-site! We also ordered a cheese and meat tray and were told they would walk it down to us so we could go ahead and start enjoying the scenery of their River Deck!! I was impressed by these guys and their customer service.   The winery has such beautiful scenery. As we move into the fall and winter seasons, this is THE place to have a big glass of wine. My husband and I enjoyed the Texas Red SO much, we bought another bottle to bring home so we can have it on our actual anniversary 10/20/2019.  If you're in the area or looming for something to experience while in San Marcos, go for a visit!"

I  have been out of town for quite some time, they were kind enough to hold my wine for me  without any issues or drama.   I believe this was my 3rd visit. The girls actually remembered me.   I love their red blend. It is fantastic. I love the environment at this winery. It's very laid back and comfortable. They have a deck that overlooks the river where you can gather and barbecue if you would like."

Most of the wines are pretty sweet, which I wasn't surprised by, I think it's generally a Texas wine thing. The woman behind the counter was really friendly with us and was happy to engage and talk about wine. She was very well traveled and knowledgable on many different kinds of wines and not just Three Dudes.   It's dog friendly and kid friendly here. It used to be named Three Dudes and a Dog but I guess they had to drop the The Dog part due to some legality thing.   The wine was a little too expensive... we bought a box and normally places will throw in your tastings for free when you do that, but they charged us for it. It wasn't a huge deal but I was a little surprised when she tacked it on to the bill."

                "description": "Any event with endless wine and a riverside deck is worth attending. At Three Dudes Winery, the rustic atmosphere is a perfect balance between classy and casual. The wine tasting room is open daily from 12:00-6:00 PM, and their friendly staff make it a fun and relaxing experience.  The guys behind the counter are extremely knowledgeable about each of the house-made wines, and you can sample four for five dollars. Our selections, from sickeningly sweet to normal sweet:  Texas Black Gold. A dessert wine so rich you almost can't finish it by itself. A bite of dark chocolate cuts the sweetness of the wine to make it bearable.  Texas White Zinfandel. Fruity and floral. A little too floral for my taste.  Texas White. This one is a customer favorite with a great balance between sweet and tart. Served chilled, it's light and refreshing.  Texas Red. Smoky and slightly chocolate-y. They say it pairs well with barbeque.  The only downside of the wine tasting is the size of the room. Any more than six people, and it starts to feel crowded. However, the Three Dudes (and their dog) are talking about expanding the space. You can also take a glass outside to the patio or the deck.  I left with a bottle of Texas White and a slight feeling of disappointment: I did not run into three dudes or a dog. But I wouldn't complain if I had to come back a few more times to find them."

They have the grapes sent down from the hill country. They have been in business about 12 yrs and do not mass product or sell commercially...yet!. The white wines I thought were better then the reds! They were crisp but not to sweet, the reds were to heavy for my taste! Apparently they have a deck on the river to sip wine on but today they had wedding and reception to prepare for so we couldn't go down there. Certainly worth a visit!"

The seating is nice but it's very limited!   The service was great though! The lady that was serving us was very knowledgeable on the wines and the history of the place. There are obviously better wineries in Texas but you should definitely give five dudes a try if you're in the San Marcos"

Then... my sweetheart started planning our wedding reception  (the ceremony had been out of state). Bit by bit, I fell in love with this place. It was raining on our first visit, so I hadn't yet  realized how expansive it was.  There are 2 levels of deck that sit right above the river. This provides an amazing view of sunsets and allows a nice breeze. The structure is partially covered, with a stage area (we plugged in and jammed no problem). They have tables to rent, and are super helpful with setup ideas and flexibility.  They provide servers for the wine, and totally allow you to bring your own beers (no kegs). They also offer catering suggestions. You can opt to have them do the clean up or not.  The best part: our gal, Angela! Angie is professional and communicative, but more importantly  (for us anyway), she was nice. She was wonderful in offering suggestions and patient with our changing needs. She's genuinely just a cool chica, and an asset to this backyard treasure."

We had our engagement party here and the package included setup and cleanup, tables, linens, wine, and food from a local bbq restaurant for 50 people. Overall, everything was great!

Now let's talk about the wine. No it hasn't been aged for decades but it suits the down home Texas atmosphere and the service there is outstanding. The Cabernet is dry and light and the Chenin Blanc is refreshing with notes of pear and green apple. They also have frozen wine daiquiris perfect for a hot Texas day!   If you swing by I hope you get Angie to help with the tasting or general service. She captures the sweet southern charm of Texas and knows her wine like the back of her hand. I would recommend this winery to anyone. It's reasonably priced, fun and a great overall experience."

We were hoping to stay and enjoy a leisurely bottle of wine since the weather was nice and the winery has a lower deck that looks out onto the river.  We graduated from Texas State and have spent many afternoons at wineries around the hill country, and this area is near and dear to us. Unfortunately, our experience at three dudes left us both with a bitter taste. The lady who was conducting the tasting wasn't very friendly and even though we tried to engage her in conversation she just gave short answers that left no more room for discussion. She then told us that they were holding a wedding at the venue and that we weren't allowed on the upper deck and could only go to the lower deck. This could have been conveyed in a friendly way - the upper deck is reserved for the wedding, but check out our lower deck, there's a great view of the river! Or something like that. Anything other than just flat out telling paying customers that they were too busy to serve us wine on the upper deck.  To sum it up: we were so thrown off by how unfriendly she was, we just left, and likely won't be back.  They do have good peach bellinis though and the Cabernet is decent"

They have a wonderful covered deck like area and a lower deck a little closer to the river.   The wines were good. The port was surprising, it was a big hit that night. There's enough space and areas that people could spread out and have a good time with out being too far away. They have a little stage were two bands played.   I never saw A dude, let alone three. There were two women serving the wine, Alex and Dara, who were pretty awesome. Super nice girls, helpful to the newbies and a pleasure to chat with. They did a great job all night despite the horrid heat. The manager was always around to keep things running smoothly. Super nice lady, Angie.   -100 imaginary stars for the heat but that's on Texas, not the winery."

I love that with every flight purchase included is a souvenir wine  glass. Flights and by the glass were very reasonable given the type of wine  served.

However, do not fret if you didn't, because the grounds are stunning. You can order a glass or a bottle, no judgment ;), from their double decker bus, that gave me some serious harry potter vibes. Then take it and enjoy the view. There is ample sitting. I would love to come back with reservations of course, and try a flight in their beautiful tasting room."

Plenty of outdoor space to social distance along with animals to interact with: donkies, goats and miniature horses! A decent selection of wines with one standing out in particular to our taste-buds, can't remember the name specifically but it was red wine cherry blend, maybe seasonal?   The staff is friendly, place was very easy to find, there is a bit of construction going on in and around the place but it's not too big of an annoyance to take away from the overall great experience."

The tasting reservation process was pretty easy. The tasting price is very fair (5 glasses for $18) and the pours were generous. The wines were very good. I left with a couple of bottles. I definitely recommend the Christmas Cuveé and the Sangria wine. Once you finish your tasting, there is plenty of space outside on the patio or other areas to just sip more wine and just be.  A lovely experience."

I did like the outdoor patio and the arrangement of all the things. I enjoyed the red wines that they had. I really liked the season fruit wines--tasted like juice with how fruity they were (I mean that in a good way).   The food truck also served some pretty solid food. Really enjoyed the chili and cheese tator tots. The pizza was good too! The burger was a little disappointing though.   All in all, nice place to visit! Come check it out!"

Because of Covid, they are doing tastings by reservations only so that they can control number of people and properly space out in their tasting room. I'm sure you'll love a bottle to buy and you'll have ample time and space to enjoy it on their deck or yard after your tasting. Our tasting guide, Robert, was very knowledgeable about the different wines and a joy to converse with! They do have a good truck on their premises that bakes wood fire pizzas. I didn't try any this time because we already had brunch before coming. The port was my favorite wine. You've got to try it for yourself!"

                "description": "A year later and Wimberly Valley Winery is just getting better!  Our friends are members here and we joined them to go out and pick up their wine. While we were there we had a tasting.  They now have a full line up of \"fruit\" wines like Blackberry, Cherry and cinnamon, honey crisp apple, and others. They are on the sweeter side but for me were seriously tasty! I loved the cherry and the blackberry.  However at this time of year it is the mulled wine that truly wins the day for me! If you haven't had mulled wine I suggest you get off your butt, drive the distance, and sample some right now! It is so worth it!  A hearty and loud Ooooh my Goddie toooo Hottie to this wonderful glass of spiced wine that is served hot! It brings flashes of warm fire places, deep snow, thick sweaters and holiday cheer with every sip. It is my absolute favorite!  They are adding more structures to the location, the outside area is a divine place to grab a bottle and just sit and soak up the outdoors while enjoying a good sip with friends, and the inside is a great lush environment of comfy lodge like decor.  It is a great location with good people and a great selection of wines... not only theirs but a plethora of other wines as well. We always enjoy our time here!   One last note.... try the mulled wine! It is the holiday season in a bottle!"

They don't even use Texas grapes so these are all from out of state and only a handful are barrel aged. They were basic and not anything special. We came for a tasting so we tried a total of 5 different wines each (10 between the two of us.) They even serve store bought wines here!!! I've NEVER been to a winery that serves what I can buy myself at HEB. They didn't tell you anything about the wines other than \"this is dry and fruit forward,\" no explanation of the grapes used, how long its aged, etc that we've become used to at other wineries. Also the alcohol content must be very low in thier wines, we went on empty stomachs and neither of us felt a thing which is not the case at other wineries we've been to. I'd give it a try if you're in the area, but don't expect much. The grounds are nice and they have a cute double decker bus they converted but for us one visit was plenty."

                "description": "Honestly, I'm disappointed in the experience of this place. We saw the reviews of this winery and thought it would be a fun part of our weekend trip, so my three friends and I came in for a wine tasting inside their bar and we were surprised about the snooty service and multiple issues we had. First off, when we were pointed to which bar we'd be tasting at, there was a dirty tissue on the ground that was at our station (which I had kicked away, not wanting to make a fuss out of it). It apparently wasn't cleaned yet before we arrived, so our sommelier wiped it down before placing the menus down. In addition, we were placed right by the exit/entrance door to their storage room where we constantly shuffled away to not block the staff coming in and out.   When she quickly put down some menus and expo markers and asked us to pick 5 wines to try and walked away, she didn't really care to pause and help us with decisions, so I stepped in to help my friends who were less knowledgeable about wines. Throughout our wine tasting process, our sommelier also made really strange comments to us, saying multiple times: \"This particular wine is really expensive, so that's why you only get a splash.\" Not sure why that was necessary to repeatedly state that? It wasn't encouraging us to purchase anything, especially when we weren't enjoying the particular tastes of our wine and she didn't bother helping us give recommendations, other than asking if we had any questions after we already picked our choices. When one of my friends asked about the bathrooms not working, she just curtly answered it was because the pressure gauge was off for the whole place due to the Wells. I understand that's not entirely in their control, but she did not have to respond in a rude way, and unfortunately my friends had to hold their bladders until we got back to our cabin bathroom.  Overall, I recommend people skip the wine tasting indoors and just go straight to the outdoor patios to check out the cute red bus that has the express wine bar service. The person in there seemed a lot nicer, and there were places we could've sat down and enjoyed the nice weather, instead of standing the whole time interacting with our rude sommelier indoors."

My niece and nephew love taking carrots for the horses and donkeys and kicking the soccer ball around. The venue is just beautiful and even when their are tons of people there it just doesn't feel crowded, the layout is perfect.    The wine is top notch. I  like sweeter wines so most on the menu suits me but they have some dry wine as well for folks who love a dry red or white.  Slushes in the summer, warm spiced wine in the winter, fruit wines in the fall ... this place has it figured out!  Grab a Cheese tray and hang out for an hour or stay all day!"

                "description": "Winery on the Gruene is the perfect little spot to grab a glass of wine and relax.   If you've been to Gruene you know parking can be a little bit of a nightmare, that is why we love to come to this place since they have their own parking and is also located near the entrance to the town. They have both indoor and outdoor seating, with a cute little garden which is great for photos during spring. They have a decent selection of wines, which you can purchase by the glass or a bottle. If you are hungry, they also have a BBQ food truck but is not always open. Last but no least, if you are parent searching for a changing table, this is not the place for you. We had to change our baby inside our car, which was a little annoying since it was 90+ degrees outside."

                "description": "I'm hesitant to call this a winery because they don't grow their grapes however all of these stars are location location location. They're right on the Guadalupe River in downtown historic Gruene TX. If you're having a bridal party, etc. this is an ideal spot with great social distancing and a recently added BBQ Food Truck. I'm not giving it more stars because 1) they're not growing grapes and 2) I'm really not impressed with their products BUT I don't like sweet wines which they specialize in from the looks of their menu. Their service was impeccable and quick and attentive even though it was a busy Saturday. Dog and kid friendly. Cheese and crackers available."

I gave her a $5 tip on a $5 glass of wine. She poured it in a plastic cup and I asked for a glass. She told me a wine glass would be $2 additional. OK! I just gave you a $100% tip, not happening.  Only reason this place is getting an additional star is bc the hostess was sweet. Don't waste your time on this place, it's crap. Also, be prepared to wear a mask and not get good service."

                "description": "Recall when I said I had reviews in my drafts? Ughs, this one is from 2018 (don't judge me).   Winery on the Gruene is a small 'boutique' style winery that makes vino on the premise. There are a variety of vino's to sample at a reasonable price (4 tastings for only $4.00). If you know what you want and are a true vino drinker like me, you can 'go for it' and just order a glass (Vino Blanco in my case, $5.00 per glass; see my receipt).  The vino selection here is decent and the customer service is even better. The only facet about this location that is not great is the lack of room inside when you go for a tasting. However, if you have time to come here and have a glass of vino while you sit outside and enjoy a nice spring day, you will not be sorry.   Happy Drinking!"

Pictured is the wine-a-rita, mix your favorite wine with a frozen margarita mix. These wines are seriously delicious. I'm usually not into fruity wines, but these are done right and are amazing. The employees are super friendly and it's a good time every time we go. There's even a bbq food truck in the parking lot if you get hungry!  Dog friendly patio, with some more secluded picnic benches if you'd like. Highly recommend!"

                "description": "Wow, how have I not written a review about Winery on the Gruene?! It's like my best friend's favorite place to go in Gruene so I've actually been so many times... We've been visiting since they were at the original location down the street like ten years ago in one of the new strip centers on the outskirts of the little village of Gruene! Winery on the Gruene got lucky when this location became available, right in the center of Gruene!  Winery on the Gruene is located just up the hill from Guadalupe River about a block west of Gruene Hall. Great location, easy to find. Lots of room to sit inside or out. There is even space upstairs to sit or rent out for private parties.  All the staff have always been amazing... Thank you! That is always one of the reasons to go back to any business.   Winery on the Gruene is not a vineyard. Most grapes are not from Texas. Maybe not even any. That is my only complaint as I like to keep my wines local, although that is what works for these guys. They are not limited in their creations. They purchase grapes from all across the country to make their wines. They have a large selection on their menu, so you will find something you like. Winery on Gruene specializes in these sweet fruity wines, which is one of the reasons why my bestie LOVE them!  My favorite is Blackberrry Merlot. On my last visit for Tami C.'s birthday surprise, that is all I had... no need to sample, just give me a big full glass and I'll be a happy camper!   Yeah, you  know I'll be back for some of that Blackberry Merlot!"

Very charming staff and was helpful on wine tasting. We choose four wines to taste from their menu and have different emo fave on what we thought of the wine. I must say the tasting serving are healthy pour and provide the opportunity to enjoy a little more of each wine.  For me most of the wine was somewhat sweet and berry tasting as the Merlot wine has a hint of sweet berry. Reminded me of when I was had my first drink of Boonesfarm wine but not that sweet...lol.  Charming with that modern industrial farm decor.  I would come back to just sit on the porch with glass of vino. Cheers."

The views are breathtaking, and the main house is absolutely impressive, I was so impressed with the property I had to explore it further on my own.   They have been operating since 2004 and turned the former residence into a tasting, event and sales space. The sunroom and patio are perfect for enjoying a tasing or a bottle of wine among friends.   I actually sampled all of the wines on my visit to the vineyard, of course my preference is red, but I found many of the whites quite refreshing. Although the pool is no longer used for swimming, it makes an excellent backdrop, stop in and set a spell! Cheers!"

I'm not weeping with joy from any of the wines but they're easy enough to drink.  It's particularly lovely for violet crown sunsets, so save it for your last stop if you're making the rounds in this neck of the woods.  They don't have any ice, which I find supremely odd being that it's Texas and they serve white wine! If you want to keep your wine chilled while sitting outside (they've got plenty of gorgeous trees to provide shade but shade is not a wine bucket!) the only way to do so is to drink it real fast while thinking cold thoughts."

We were a little disappointed to hear that, as of our visit in May, they weren't doing tastings due to Covid because I do think it can be done safely and would've made for a better experience. Otherwise, you either have to buy a full bottle or multiple bottles if you'd like a well-rounded understanding of their wines. We opted for a blend that we absolutely loved, described on the bottle as a \"patchwork quilt of grapes.\" It was honestly worth every penny--so delicious!   We took our bottle and glasses outside onto the expansive lawn which is just perfect for picnics. They have lots of shaded tables under the old growth trees.   Perhaps for safer tastings they could serve them \"beer flight\" style with the informational flyer and direct you to sit outdoors so that you can still experience a handful of their wines without breaking the bank? That would make it a 5-star experience for me!"

I've done the tasting before and also just purchased wine by glass. Both are delightful. Tasting is nice for first timers to explore a variety of wines Duchman produces. Because of the tasting, I was able to find my favorite red and white wine of theirs. And for $10/tasting, it is such a steal!! (Price may have changed. This was based off of 2018). After my first visit, I just opt to get a bottle or glass of my favorite red and sip it on the patio taking in good wine, views, and company.   My friends and I always love to end our Hill Country winery trek at Duchman and drive over to Salt Lick after for good ol Texas BBQ."

                "description": "This was actually one of my favorite stops in our Driftwood wine tasting day. This particular winery has outdoor picnics for groups and benches for smaller groups for one to buy a bottle , bring some of your own food and enjoy their wines. During this pandemic time, this is the perfect scenario to drink wine while still practicing social distancing.   They do allow you to use the restroom with mask wearing enforced for you to go inside the building.   Their wine was light and refreshing. We chose  a white wine.   If you go near the end of the day you enjoy a nice sunset followed by lighted trees giving you a Christmas vibe. Up until that day , I never knew that Texas had a winery side like Driftwood but places like Duchman Family Winery proved to me that they do exist and they have really good wine too. Highly recommend you make a stop at this winery."

I had a review but it was taken down by yelp for whatever reason, I was so surprise when from rude employee message me on my yelp apologizing personally, and apparently there was a guy anonymously message me regarding my review to be reposted. Eventually found they are working together and engaging me on whatever conflict they have. Thus, proven that they really have poor customer service , very unprofessional.I wont be surprise if they will ask yelp to take my review down again."

                "description": "Over priced tasting . $17 tasting for very small pours of 6 wines . No water in tasting room. Had to go get it yourself . No crackers or palate cleansers . If it was a free tasting I wouldn't care as much . When I made reservation I was specific about food and was not given accurate info. You are not able to order food or eat during the tasting. Food only available to purchase after tasting was over. Servers poured wine on top of previous tasting . Missed poured twice . Server changed frequently and not consistent. They obviously are not organized to keep track of what wine we should be on . Huge red wine fan( live in Europe for 6 years ) was not a fan of  any of the reds . Surprisingly liked 2 of the whites, Beautiful atmosphere and building . A shame the tasting experience doesn't match . Could be so much better!!"

                "description": "Nice stop just outside Austin for a wine tasting! The outside setting is very cool, spacious front lawn and some tables/chairs for hanging out. Dropped into this place for a quick wine tasting, consisting of 6 small pours of wine. The whites we tasted were all very smooth, not overly sweet but just the right amount of smooth and dry. Definitely recommend sampling all the whites if you have time, you won't be disappointed!  We didn't go check out Trattoria next door for food, but have been there in the past and pretty good Italian food, pairs well with the winery.  If you come here and the weather is looking good, you can expect a very scenic, picturesque spot to spend some time at!"

                "description": "I live in California and only an hour away from Napa. I wasn't expecting anything close to what one would experience in Napa. However, I still wasn't fully pleased.   The only way I can imagine that someone would really enjoy it, is to bring your own picnic and use their outdoor seating area. This is of course conditioned on the weather and also whether or not there is gonna be any bachelorette party there during your visit. (We saw two when we visited and they were so loud and they had overtaken all the outdoor seatings)  We tried their tasting. It was only $15 which is relatively cheap. In Napa you pay 2-3x more than that in a good winery. They let you choose your own 5 wines out of their selection or go with their recommendation. The tasting overall was okay, nothing that I disliked and at the same time nothing wowed me. I'm not sure if I'm gonna go back there, but it was worth to try it once."

                "description": "Duchman is a great winery to visit near Austin that makes great wines.  I've recently been on a kick to learn more about and try Texas wines.  I've tried wine from several different Texas wineries in the past couple months (all purchased from wine stores) and Duchman is so far my favorite.  I prefer red wines and my favorite Duchman wines are the Aglianico and Sangiovese. Since the winery is so close to Austin, my husband and I decided to visit.  The grounds are beautiful - the perfect place for a picnic.  I appreciate the precautions they've taken due to COVID-19 too.  You can't go into the building (though they will let you in if you need to use the restroom), so they are set up outside selling wine by the bottle and require everyone to wear a mask.  There is plenty of space to picnic and social distance.  They sell some picnic meals on-site, but we brought pizza from Pieous, bought a bottle of wine, and had a lovely time relaxing at a picnic table in the shade.  I highly recommend visiting Duchman.  I'm happy there is a winery that makes great wines so close to Austin.  Even if you can't do a tasting during COVID-19, it is still worth the drive to drink wine in a pretty setting!"

                "description": "Really beautiful property. We wanted to go to Salt Lick and wanted to find some other activities in the area so came here for a tasting before lunch. They do $15 for 6, which is pretty good, and was offering 5% off your total bill for following them on Instagram.   There's some beautiful benches set up outside to go with your glass of wine. It unfortunately seemed to be drought season when we visited so the actual grape plants were pretty bare. Once you step inside, there's a small room where the tastings happen and the shop where they sell bottles and all kinds of souvenirs. There unfortunately wasn't any seating indoors so we had to stand the entire time. If you walk in more, you can see barrels and label making rooms. Wish they had given us more history during our tasting but it was fun nonetheless.   It was pretty easy to get an uber out here from the city but be warned getting an uber out here may take a little while."

I highly recommend the diablo wine! It's a dry red but super super smooth! The whites were all amazing! But the sangria's? #givemeabarrel they both were excellent! I will definitely have to bring my grandma back to wine taste!"

                "description": "What an amazing, hidden gem near Canyon Lake! First, all the wines are made by natural fermentation (aka natural wine) with organic grapes- this winery is even featured in a Natural Wines book. The owner is so friendly and also has the sweetest dog. The decor is unique, interesting, and definitely sets a mood. The wine is delicious- we had a bottle of the \"on-site-only\" Lambrusco Pet-Nat, and we bought a couple others to-go. All the local websites were advertising Dry Comal Creek as the only local winery (and I'm sure it's great), but we stumbled upon La Cruz de Comal because Dry Comal closed at 5 and La Cruz was still open until 6pm. We will DEFINITELY be back for more organic, natural wine!"

So mad when our family members open the paper wrap. The corks on both bottle are soaking wet and cracked. The wines tasted nasty. 1 bottle (supposed to be sweet) taste like nasty medicine. The other one is red wine,  taste like someone opened it for a long time and then put the cork back, we didn't want to drink it anymore even it cost us money. Because it was so nasty.

One of the most intelligent and yet one of the most obscure and eclectic people I have ever met. A true pleasure to meet and chat with.   Do yourself a favor. Check out the hours and plan to visit this little piece of heaven. You will be thrilled and so glad you did.   I highly recommend!!"

When we drove in, right away we noticed the winery's main building and it felt like we were in France. It is an authentic European building, small and cozy and welcoming!  The owner was there to serve his 100% estate grown grapes which boast of no additional acid, sugar or sulfites to his wine. The owner, who is a retired lawyer, Mr. Dickson, calls his wine, \"real wine.\" We tasted four wines and our favorite was the port, it had a smooth and delightful finish. There also is a sweet winery dog who loves to visit with the customers...we had a relaxing time there and would recommend it to anyone who wants to taste \"Real wine.\""

                "description": "I decided to take a trip and visit this place. I researched all the vineyards nearby but this place not only had the highest reviews, it seemed to have a nice scenery. The interior and exterior has french touches to it and you can tell each piece was well thought out.   Now the wine.... my husband and I FELL IN LOVE. At first the prices seemed to be pricey but once you do the wine tasting, you'll know why. The wine is so pure and has so much grace you have to walk out with at least a bottle (we bought three). I like wine but I'll only drink one glass because I get dizzy but when I went hope my husband and I both finished a bottle. The wine here has no sulfites and you can just taste the purity of the grapes.   Pricing: When you buy three wines the tasting fee is waived for one person ($15). The owner gave us a discount so after one wine tasting fee and 3 bottles of wine we paid around $160.   The interior is just lovely here you can just tell each piece in the room was placed there for a reason. The bathroom outside looked very old so I was very hesitant to use it but one you go in it is so cute and was not uncomfortable at all.   So, overall this place was an excellent experience!"

It is very obvious the owner should have stuck to being a lawyer. I understand the all natural thing. But it was awful. I tried to like even one of them or even find something interesting about at least one. With all of the time spent in Napa Valley and in France you would have thought the wines would at least be palatable. The only thing I can figure out is most of the reviewers don't drink wine. And if your thinking about going to see for yourself...I'm being nice in my descriptions."

                "description": "I love everything about this place! It's a hidden gem tucked away in the hills just south of Canyon Lake.  Lewis, the owner, is a former big-time defense attorney in Houston who found his calling to be one with the grapes and wine. Listening to him wax poetically about what he's doing differently at his vineyard gives you insight into what you're about to experience. He's also a hoot!   Instead of using commercial yeast, the wines ferment from wild yeast/bacteria on the grapes and whatever bacteria is in the HillCo air. This gives the wines an obvious farmhouse character (mild funk/horsey, slightly sour). He doesn't filter so the wines are a bit hazy and have some sediment/yeast on the bottom.   Grapes are either grown on-site or purchased from farms in the Hill Country and they don't add sulfites.  If you like traditional wines, you might not enjoy the wines that much but I still think it's worth a visit.  Tasting: $15 for 6 samples Bottles: Range from $25-$60 Times: Tasting room is open on Sat and Sun from 12p-6pm. What we bought: a bottle of Rose.  The tasting room is an adorable limestone building and the vineyard can be seen from the windows.   If you can't make it to the vineyard, Jester King Brewery just started carrying their wines in its taproom! It's a match made in heaven! Wild yeast for everyone!"

The tasting pours were generous and we enjoyed learning about the differences between their preparation methods versus the larger, more commercial vineyards.  I have to assume it's those differences that led to such pleasant flavors.  I've always been a red guy but found the first white I've enjoyed here.  Another first, I could really discern the various ingredients/flavors in each glass of wine, and the reds didn't have that strong bite to them.  I've been to Napa and Senoma, as well as France and Italy, and I just haven't ever enjoyed the taste of wine as much as I did during our trip to this little winery."

We just parked, shared a tasting and left in about 15 minutes because we felt kind of unwelcome and found the wines to be awful. And we wanted desperately to love this place, because it is GORGEOUS. I'd have been very easy to please to be able to spend time in this beautiful place. But the owner was kind of frosty, barely spoke to us (but was more vocal with others), didn't tell us anything (not even the names) about any of the wines. I complimented him effusively on the place when we first got there and tried to get him to chat during the tasting, but he didn't thaw. I don't know if we made him mad because we chose to share a tasting?? We would've gotten a glass or two once we found a wine we liked. We felt like we weren't wanted, which when you're sitting at the little wine counter right in front of the guy, is really uncomfortable. I could've ignored all that if one of the wines worked for us, but I hate to say it, we thought all 4 were terrible. We drink a lot of wine, not cheap or sweet ones, and none of these tasted like anything we've ever had before. I'm confused that every other reviewer LOVED them and we had such an opposite reaction. We are at a loss for the experience we just had. The winery is so so beautiful though, it rivals CA wineries. So bummed. :("

After visiting wineries in Fredericksburg/Hye/Stonewall area, this one falls a little short. The wine itself is okay, but I didn't like it enough to buy a bottle. The building is a little strange, as is the decor inside. There's a lot going on in there. There were tons of kids running around which for a kid-free date weekend sort of dampened the mood for us.  I failed to get her name, but the young woman behind the bar serving was working hard, helped all the customers, and was courteous and friendly - probably the best thing about this place.  All said, we do not regret the visit, but there are definitely areas for this business to improve on."

                "description": "Whoa! A winery in Seguin? I had not idea. Met friends here for a surprise birthday get together. The tasting room is quaint with 4-5 tables. Was very shocked to find out they started as a meadery. And very impressed by the mead selection. There was 3 meads on tap, raspberry champagne on tap, and a plethora of wine and meads by the bottle available for tasting or a glass.  They do sell growlers, so you can enjoy the tapped mead and champagne at home. I was impressed with the meads and champagne. I did not try any of the wines.  Beautiful landscaping and large windows, which allow you to look out into the vineyard and at the property."

                "description": "They have the best mead and one of the best wines I've ever tasted!!!!  If you like sweet wines (like I do) they have great wines, especially their white wines. They flavors are so complex and have underlying subtle flavors that come out as well.   The meads are really sweet and very smooth.   The wine tastings are 5 tastings for $5 which is an amazing deal. Their selection is somewhat limited so if you go with someone else you practically get to try everything they have.   The only downside is that t is out in the country, and looks a bit shady... But they are expanding so it's starting to look more legit.   If you're ever in Seguin area, I definitely suggest this be one of your stops."

Mead wines are based with honey. They offer delicious food and a beautiful property to walk. They will even show you things like fresh picked grapes fermenting from the morning to unbottled wine tastings in their winery.  The couple that runs this winery are amazing and down to earth. I will definitely be coming back."

Everyone is exceptionally helpful, they have a very comfortable tasting room, but I felt the tasting was way overpriced, so I decided to just buy a bottle of the Fall Creek Vineyards Tempranillo to drink while the rest of the group had their tasting.   They have an impressive operation and make some wonderful wines, definitely worth the stop. Cheers!"

                "description": "TLDR: relaxing atmosphere with nice white wines. Good on the spectrum of Texas wines but not on the level of French or Napa wines.  This is a great spot right across the street from salt lick. Parking lot is gravel but there's plenty of parking available. Hostess was extremely friendly and great conversation.  The wines themselves are good- we especially loved the Chardonnay and reserve wines. Based on Texas wineries, I have to say this is hands down one of the better vineyards. That being said, I have a deep love for Russian river valley wines (especially green valley pinots and Chardonnay's) and Texas grapes just don't measure up. Is that an unfair comparison? Probably.  Overall highly recommend visiting and supporting local. You'll want this on your wine tasting list of stops for sure, and best of all it's fairly close to Austin."

I love coming out here for a wine tasting and enjoying the outside patio and having the vineyard to explore. The landscape is gorgeous and the staff are so knowledgeable and friendly.  Most importantly, the wine is delicious.    Pro tip- for an additional $8 you can add on an extra tasting of the ExTerra Tempranillo (usually a $100 bottle). It's amazing and a must try."

                "description": "Fall Creek Vineyards totally exceeded our expectations! We have been super strict about staying home during COVID-19, but my #1 birthday wish was to get out ... in a safe way. With young children. My husband called Fall Creek ahead of time and was told that kids were allowed and that there was plenty of outdoor space.   We arrived around 2pm on a Wednesday afternoon and were greeted by a super friendly and knowledgeable gentleman. I wish I had grabbed his name, because he was seriously amazing. He let us know that a food purchase was required to be served on premise, which was not a problem at all because everything looked delicious (we chose a cheese platter), and gave us a wine menu as well.   We selected our own seats and were able to stay away from the party that came in after us. Our sommelier was so knowledgeable and provided everything in a COVID-19 safe way. He was also super sweet to our kids, even though our three year old was crushing crackers on the table (we cleaned up after him before we left but it was still so embarrassing).   All of the wines were delicious. We ended up leaving with their Tempranillo, their Sauvignon-blanc (vintners-selection) and two souvenir glasses.   We spent about an hour at Fall Creek, which ended up being the total highlight of my birthday, but could have spent more time there exploring their beautiful grounds  had we not had a dinner reservation."

Of course, there is wine tasting and a variety of bottles for sale.  Fall Creek makes wines in all price points. From the quite good inexpensive wines to award-winning bottles for people who really know their reds. I am a fan of their Tempranillo.  If you are in Austin, it's worth a visit!"

My mom's in town so I wanted to take her to a winery semi-close to Austin but not too far away. ENTER: Fall Creek. It's been recommended to me by several friends so figured I'd check it out for myself:  PROS: Seriously the nicest staff in the world. Thank you Daniel! Plenty of socially distanced tables and chairs in LOTS of different areas of the winery A bottle of their amazing Sauvignon Blanc - $22! Great snacks to accompany (I got Pimento cheese) They had live music on a Saturday with a full band. swoon! Across the street from Salt Lick if you want foods  CONS: Seriously none. Couldn't have asked for a more perfect day. Can't wait to visit again!   Pro tip: go to Desert Door nearby for more fun. :)"

As a personal recommendation, if you're trying to social distance, I would suggest visiting here only during the weekdays when it's less busy, otherwise it may seem too crowded since the place is on the smaller side.  The food menu mainly consists of cheese and snacks that go well with wine but it's a little overpriced. The staff was nice but they were just there for the most part, nothing more to enhance our experience.   3/5 staff/service 4/5 nicely decorated interior and exterior 5/5 with the right company"

We opted for two full glasses of their most standout wines and although it was much more expensive wine than I'm used to, we did get a generous pour. The backyard terrace is peaceful and has many seating options. I would've loved to see an option where you could do a wine tasting outdoors, perhaps the same way you order a beer flight. I saw this because wine tastings are only offered inside."

Our 2nd stop was Falls Creek....it was so pretty with perfect sunny weather and enough seating inside and out. Covid is still among us so they offer hand santizers but you bring your own mask. Most patrons didn't have on of course once they had their wine in hand.   We opted to sit outdoors. Tables are 3-4 ft apart in some spots so choose within your comfort zone for social distancing. We grabbed a quick glass of wine and made our way to the next stop.   Looking forward to returning with the hubby this summer."

We requested the tasting - 5 wines that are pre-selected, you aren't able to choose.  After the second (extremely small) pour, we had to request water.  Decided to order a couple of apps for the group..we were brought store made hummus and pimento cheese - still in the plastic container, propped on a plate with a wrapped package of crackers.  Had to request small plates, which seemed to surprise our server.  By the end of the tasting we were all sweating as the sun was beating down on us and there seemed to be no AC. The wines were okay, but the experience and service could have been much better.  I wouldn't return."

Place was fairly full but I don't know why.  Wines we tasted were fair at best.  Too many good one in the area to waste your time here."

The wine picked by my group was light , refreshing and the perfect compliment to have after we had made a lunch stop at a brisket place. We had been feeling stuffed but this wine was so light and enjoyable to help digest our food while we enjoyed their peaceful tranquil outdoor seating area near a cute little pond. We also took advantage of their photo opportunity landscapes."

                "description": "I've had my fair share of vineyards from local like Grape Creek in Fredericksburg then to Castello di Amorosa in Napa Valley. I was embarrassed after taking my family to experience the wine tasting here. Although, some of the wine were fairly tasty, but the serving was small compared to the vineyards I mentioned in the beginning. I had never been to a wine tasting with a pour stopper that was new to me. Mind you they charge $20 per person for wine tasting. We were observing a table near us that was getting extra pour from the pour stopper technique. We decided to order 2 cheese plates ($25/plate) that came in this container after we finished it, which was a small portion by the way. We noticed that the container said \"Best By: 2/12\" we visited 2/13. So we alerted our server she politely checked with the back she was told that it meant Arrived By, which to me was odd. If it was \"Arrived By\" I think that's what they would've put on the container but I guess just to shut us up.  As to COVID capacity the patio was full we couldn't wait to leave. This is my family and I's experience I wish it could've been better."

The lady on the other end of the call was quite nice suggesting they had PLENTY of space for our cars to park.  Well, they weren't wrong. Quite possibly the best photo opportunity of the entire weekend. Our attendees overlooking 24 cars perched in the beautiful trees of Hays County overlooking some of Mazda's genius. Free samples of crafted rum too?   I'd call that a win! Owners were quite attentive as soon as we arrived. Telling us the story of the brand; walking us through each tasting. Some drinks were ordered; maybe a bottle or two bought. Not sure we were the most receptive group being on a car tour in the Hill Country. Service was excellent!"

They offer free samples of the three different whiskeys with one of them being bourbon barrel aged using Rebecca Creek barrels.   The staff was friendly and well informed on the products. Currently they are distributing to smaller local stores and will start distributing to more stores in the future.   As it is August right now we couldn't tour the distillery because it was too hot but we were informed that the tours would start in October when it cools off.   The bottles are decently priced for hand crafted rum like this.   There are plenty of tables and chairs for groups, drink cocktails were decently priced, and property is a great change from the city."

                "description": "This place is the cutest, most quaint little gem.  If there's a local distillery, I always want to try out their goods.  I didn't expect it to be at someone's home, though!  Not that it's a bad thing.  Rum, for me, is a take it or leave it type spirit.  I typically use it only in cocktails.  I don't think I've ever wanted to sit down with a glass of rum.  Now bourbon?  That's a different story.    On arrival, I just expected a tasting only, but they actually make cocktails.  They have a small menu, or you can request whatever you want from the mixers they have.  Mojito?  Of course.  Want to go dive with a great rum and just some Coke?  They won't judge you for that, either.  They make their own version of Rumchata in house and it was SO DELICIOUS.  For real.  And they'll give you the recipe.    Pick your favorite of the three varieties: Crystal, Gold, Vanilla and buy a bottle.  Then pick up a bottle of vanilla extract.  If you don't cook, make your mom very happy.  That stuff is fantastic.  In the hotter months, don't be a jerk and demand a tour of the actual distilling barn.  We all know how distilling works.  If not, the internet is your friend.  They don't want to be in the high temperatures, and neither do you.  Let them explain the process to you while you sip a nice, cool drink instead."

I have been to other rum distilleries and have never stumbled upon such a \"harsh\" flavor that could never be drank alone. That being written we decided to have a drink on the patio...I'm glad alcohol kills germs because the guy serving us had the dirtiest hands and fingernails I have ever seen in my life and I have children. For example when he grabbed our glasses from the cabinet it left a dirty grip mark. I was pretty much grossed out. It's too bad because again the location is great."

The place wasn't too crowded but they just opened in November and I think people are going to be learning about this place and packing it out very soon!   They grow grapes on the property but all the wine I had was outsourced since their weren't ready yet. They had three wines to try (white, rose and red) but will be having six very soon as their home grown grapes are about ready. I enjoy dry, less sweet wines and these were perfect. Highly encourage you to put this spot on your wine tours of Wimberly! They also have some snacks/small bites if you are hungry."

They now have 4 wines and all of them were delicious. I'm not a sweet wine drinker and gratefully none of them were sweet. One crisp white, 2 rosés and a red. We left with a bottle of the red and one of the rosés too. The property and views are beautiful. They have two decks with tables and umbrellas to relax and enjoy the wine, the views, the weather and a fabulous charcuterie platter. It is a bit tricky getting there BUT it is well worth it. Don't miss this delightful vineyard!"

They are an outdoor only venue which is totally fine but don't have any outdoor heating yet they have a huge firepit that they wouldn't start. Then our friend showed up with their 4 year old and wouldn't let them come in. So not kid friendly, bad customer service and no outdoor heating."

Out of the five wines we tasted, we only liked one wine. But that's ok, we will always keep our tastebuds open for you! The environment is incredible. Beautiful oak trees, beautiful building, bathroom was clean and nice. Had a great experience, $20 each for a wine tasting? Yes! Sooooo worth it. Live music and great food trucks!"

Friendly staff, dog friendly, and some unique and very tasty wines.

                "description": "Totally chill relaxing place to enjoy some wine with friends.  Nestled back among the oak trees off 46, this place is a little gem.  Patio has a view of the vineyard, and when the weather cools off there is nothing better than sitting under the trees enjoying the fire pits. Community tables make for great conversation and an easy way to meet people when new to the area. Check Facebook for date nights and various events. To really get the feel for this spot, it's best to go when there is a band and food trucks.   Experienced friendly staff really make this place stand out. I don't know much about wine so staff was great about helping me select an excellent \"Wurst Red\" wine. This place probably deserves a 5 star for good time, but I lowered it to 4 since seating indoors is limited.   And chairs on the patio are not very comfortable. I will certainly update my review if changes are made. Would love to see some comfy coffee house style couches indoors to make it more comfortable.   Pro Tip:  Order the red or white frozen sangria. It is the BOMB!!  Tastes like a fruit slushy in the most delicious way."

They offered for us to try the two bottles we selected before we purchased them which was excellent customer service, above and beyond.   The staff was pleasant, had a sense of humor and were quick to accommodate guests to keep them dry and happy when a wild rain storm blew in.  We made reservations to return at the end of the summer when their wine list changes, they gave us lots of information!  Lots of outdoor space and a great ambiance.   Very enjoyable afternoon."

We didn't realize we needed a reservation until after we arrived, but the sweet lady at the entrance helped us make a reservation so we could get seated. The outdoor seating was very spread out, and there was a lot of shade from all the large trees. Our server helped us choose a bottle, and brought us any sample we wanted before purchasing a bottle. The wine was so good we left with a couple bottles to bring home. The pricing is very affordable ($20-$30 a bottle). I would highly recommend visiting this gem near New Braunfels."

My fiancee and I have come out here several times on a motorcycle ride to enjoy the peaceful surroundings and get away from the traffic in the city. We love their frozen sangria and the Comal Red. They offer a plastic boot for $20 that they fill with their delicious frozen Sangria. Bring the boot back and refills are only $10!   The staff here are so nice and helpful too. On our last visit we were going to each have a glass of wine and the lady told us for a few dollars more we could buy the whole bottle. You don't have to tell me twice! Grab a seat outside, either by one of the many oak trees, or under the shaded pavilion and enjoy the beautiful surroundings."

There are a bunch of wines to sample as well as one champagne and their famous sangria slush (my favorite).  The ladies are so helpful with the samplings and very knowledgable about the wines and where the grapes come from (not all can be grown on site due to certain bugs and climate reasons). I was very intrigued that they decanter their wine when you buy a bottle. I have always heard of this but have never seen a place do it. We were able to taste a wine before and after decantering and WOA what a difference!! I'm not sure why more places don't do this  This is a fun place to get away to with the country feel and relaxing atmosphere."

We paid 15.00 for these really tiny tastes. We didn't really like their wines and do not enjoy sweet wines. We ended getting 3 glasses of their Sangiovese. Total bill was over 50.00.  This was pricy for a tasting and 3 glasses.  Normally if you end up buying glasses most wineries don't charge especially if the tasting pours were so non committing I don't think we even got through our tasting before deciding just to buy full glasses. So you should Be a little more generous with your pours if you are going to charge 15.00.  You all need something a little dryer and bolder."

It is not available to the public but available to those that participated in last years stomping event. People are very friendly and outgoing. The different wines are delicious. I like all of the reds, especially the Black Spanish Dark Red Lenoir 2012 Reserve , which has a nice bold berry flavorI am not a fan of white wines but their French Colombard is amazing. It is a great light summer wine that is soft, fruity and mellow and so is the Spanish black and white wine. The vineyard is a great place for weddings and parties. It is a very quiet and restful place."

They do wine tasting but I just opted for a glass of what I knew that I would enjoy.    The cafe was not open but they had items that paired well with wine.  I'm sure it is busy in the weekend.  The Cafe is small so get your food to go and enjoy one of the many cozy spots to view the vineyards.   The staff were very friendly and the store was very clean.  They have gifts as well.  If we were in town longer, We would have come back for lunch.    The road to the vineyard is gravel so drive slow.  Parking is free and plentiful.  Follow the signs as the vineyard is about a mile up from the main road."

Everyone of the varietals lacked depth, character and complexity.  Everyone of the reds tasted blah, and I mean blah. They all lacked the distinctive aroma and notes that each of the grapes are known for.  The Rose  lacked any minerality that one would expect, and was as bad as the others.  The tasting room experience was as bad as the wines. The server had zero personality or character either.  We came away with the same thoughts as we have from other Hill Country Wineries.  They should not, nor should they be attempting to produce well known wines, and in fact do a terrible version of Cabs, Merlots, and Chards.  They should stick to Italian varietals, as well as a few others that might be better suited to the Texas climate, even though most people have no idea about those varietals. I suppose its just marketing to attract people in to the tasting room, and once they get toasted enough it no longer matters, since once the minds fogs, its just pour me another."

My wife enjoyed the Chardonnay as well. The servers were very helpful and help guide us to their more popular wines.   We ended up buying a couple of bottles and really enjoyed the experience and the view. We plan on coming here again soon!"

                "description": "Gorgeous property...Hill Country vistas at their finest.  Lovely people running the place, too. The wine was fine but definitely not the sole reason to visit, so make sure you have a couple places you're bopping around to in the area. Cute little tasting glasses and there's a shop for kitschy items featuring a lot of wine puns.    I do think the crowd skews a bit older, so better suited for entertaining folks than a bach party!"

                "description": "Beautiful winery 25 minutes from Wimberly! We stopped by during 4th of July and was surprised there wasn't more of a crowd. Strict 21+ policy (many signs warning you to turn back if you aren't 21!) but the servers were so nice and kind. We did a wine tasting which was $20 for 6 samples of white, red, and sweet wine. You can also split the sampling between people, which I shared with a friend. Server (I think her name was Julie) was so sweet and knowledgeable about the wine flavors and gave us recommendations and some history of the flavors. Our favorite was the Starry Night, or the Orange Muscat wine! A bit disappointed they didn't give chocolates or nuts during a wine tasting and overall felt a bit rushed through the process as more people showed up, but it was still a unique experience.   The patio has a beautiful view of the orchard, which is why we came here versus other wineries in the area. Outdoor seating is plentiful, many round tables for larger groups too. Definitely would've spent a good half of day out here sipping wine if it wasn't for the rain. The Bistro (food/restaurant area) was closed because of Covid so eat before you arrive so you don't get hangry or wine drunk! ;)"

                "description": "This was the second stop on our wine tour during our anniversary celebration. The ambiance is fantastic and is worth the visit to just get a bottle and enjoy the panoramic views.   Pro tip: they do not allow children, so know that before you go. I believe most of the poor reviews are about this fact, but if you are prepared beforehand it will help with the planning."

Bring a few friends and drink a bottle outside under the tree shade. They have a nice bistro menu to pair with your wine.   Prices are really reasonable $25-50 a bottle. Nice selection of whites, reds, sweets. Enjoy."

Prior to this place, everything I tasted was a mixture of sour fermented grapes. Not knocking Texas wines but they are just not my style. Maybe it needs an ice cube. Every wine here, ones that I tasted, is 100% Texan and done the way I think it is suppose to taste. Also, the view from the estate is beautiful. Very worth a stop for tasting and buying."

They wipe down tables in between people and staff are all wearing mask. Plenty of space outside for proper social distancing and enjoying some wine. We grabbed a bottle and ate at the small restaurant they have there. Would recommend you make reservations if you want a view. Service was great and food was amazing. My favorite was the pizza, don't remember the name of it but it had honey on it and it was the perfect amount of sweetness. Never thought I would like a pizza with honey on it, now I can't wait to go back."

They have an outdoor sitting area where you can admire the views and the bottle that you order is brought to you by a server who wears a face shield and gloves.    My group ordered a bottle of the 2017 Newsom Cabernet Sauvignon and we were pleased with our choice. It was not dry like a Merlot but just right. This winery does not allow you to bring outside food only the food offered in their bistro outdoor facility. This was not an issue for us.   Overall, it was a pleasant experience."

We went an 75 minutes out of our way to stop in for a tasting to see what peaked our interest in their current offerings. We loved that they have so much beautiful outdoor space. That is something that was always a major draw for us at Driftwood.   We called ahead, let them know we had a pup with us, and wanted to do a tasting. They told us to come on in. (It was a Monday and the place was very slow)  Upon arrival they told us they will only to tastings inside? What? In the era of COVID? As for the dog, they said one of us could do a tasting.   Between the lack of customer service, unfriendly attitude, and most importantly lack of outdoor tastings we will never bother to come back. WAY too many options with just as beautiful of grounds, equally great wines, safe tasting environment, and more importantly good customer service."

                "description": "Good wine, good scenery, but the lady checking us in made it bad. First, I'm 21 and so is my best friend. We went with her parents, and her dad likes to joke around. We shared our ID's (after already confirming with someone else that we are at least 21 and allowed to enter), and he made a joke about us having fake ID's. Obviously we don't have fake ID's, this lady could've scanned them and checked. Anyways, she then proceeded to yell at all of us about how we can't allow anyone under 21 in the winery, she even yelled \"NO ONE IS ALLOWED IN HERE UNLESS THEY ARE TWENTY ONE, PERIOD,\" she really did say \"period\" which immediately made my friend and I annoyed. Just very mean and disrespectful. I understand that she was trying to enforce the rules but we are over 21 and she did not have to explain the rules in such a rude way. Even her coworkers seem to not like her that much, they gave her the side eye, like she's THAT lady at work.  Then we did the wine tasting and the lady who poured us our wine was absolutely lovely. So sweet, gentle, kind, and even in the wine tasting area we had a great view of the hills and nature around us. The wine was very good. we liked almost everything, and even bought a few bottles.  After this, we went to buy some bottles and a glass of wine, again meeting the lady from earlier. A hand washing towel that my friend bought wasn't scanning correctly snd she got VERY mad at my friend for it. She took out her frustration from the computer on my friend. She was basically yelling at her and telling her to get another hand towel of the same price, she was interrupting us, I was ready to snap at this lady. She was VERY rude the whole time. She got the entire room of customers quiet from her yelling at my friend. She was just clearly very frustrated but should not have taken it out on my friend, family and I. This winery is incredible, but her attitude, frustration, and behavior knocked my rating down from 5 to 3. I was gonna put a 2 because of her, but the winery was amazing, it deserved a 5, but this woman made a serene and calming experience a bad one. My friend and I are both 21 and it isn't our fault the computer messed up scanning a hand towel. There were a few more negative experiences we had with her but these were the worst ones. Even the other customers in the room who were complete strangers to us saw her being this rude, controlling, and mean and visibly for uncomfortable. This company would be a 5 star place without her ruining everyone's experiences.  EDIT: Her name is Aileen. I don't know how it's spelled but my friend that I mentioned remembered her name because we were planning to call the company and inform them about her rudeness to customers."

The woman on the phone said no reservations needed and the last tasting was at 5:30pm (winery closes at 6pm). We walked up to the check in host at 5:31pm for him to say in a smug tone, \"Oooh we just closed up\".  I told him what the lady on the phone said and he said, \"yeah sorry\". I was surprised at the lack of hospitality as we would have been out of their way by closing time and were looking forward to supporting a local winery during these difficult Covid times.  Better luck next time I suppose but left a less than wonderful taste in my mouth. I'll wash that taste down with wine from another winery!"

Anne was very welcoming and friendly. She also gave us information on other wineries/breweries/distilleries to try. I had the $15 flight of reds and she also gave me an extra cup of red wine, Needy B*tch, I ended up buying a bottle! I finally found a great bottle of red that I actually enjoy, sad that I can't get it shipped to me in California. Drippin' Sweet is also great, bought a bottle as well. Love the descriptions given to the wines it made them sound all delicious. And they were! (According to all the ones I tried)."

So we are there enjoying wine glasses, wine flights, food, the atmosphere. Everything about this place is so cute and amazing. But trying to get an Uber home seemed unlikely. Everyone kept cancelling on us and the bartender Ann or Annie (plus the last two customers) kept telling us that we were not gonna walk the 2 miles home. Annie made sure that we stayed till she closed and literally DROVE US BACK TO THE AIR BNB!!!. She was the sweetest thing and didn't even want to take any money from us. We had a back and forth of take it, no keep it, take it!! Haha I'm 80% sure I got the money in her cupholder before I left but I was the tipsy one so who knows haha. I really hope I did because driving us back to our Airbnb was above and beyond."

They have wine flight options or you can enjoy a glass if you chose. The server was incredibly knowledgeable and had great recommendations for everyone in our group. She let us try what we wanted before committing to our drink of choice. I ended up going to wine cocktail called the Texas Kiri and it fresh rosemary in it which I though was a nice touch! They also have live music outside and plenty of areas to sit and enjoy listening to it. Definitely try this place out!"

                "description": "We were in town for another winery quarterly wine pick up party.  That winery no longer allows you to open your bottles of wine at the party or allow dogs.  As such, it wasn't a great day.  We decided to go some place else.  We showed up around 4pm on a Sunday and had the entire place to ourselves. It is so cute.  I love the decorations and the vibe. We did the wine tasting which is $7 or waved if you buy a bottle of wine.  Megan was wonderful.  She was full of information and funny.  We had such a wonderful time we decided to join Bell Springs wine club.  Three bottles a quarter. No sign up fee. They have a wine pick up party that allows you to bring your dogs.  20% discount the first year and the discount increases every year you are a member.  Free wine tasting for you and four people either at Side Car or the winery itself. You also get to pick which three bottles you want. We signed up on the spot. What is NOT to like! We enjoyed many of their wines but really it was Megan.  She made us feel so welcomed and was so friendly.  Bell Spring treat her right, she is a HUGE asset to you.  We can't wait to attend our first wine pick up party.  Hope to make it to first Thursday soon and hang out at the Side Car.  If we lived in Dripping Springs this would be a weekly stop for us.  What a great place in this sleepy town.  We are so glad to part of their wine club and excited for the many cool events moving forward.  This should be a place to stop if you are in Dripping Springs."

It's covered with trees so mostly shaded but I thought it was really cool that they had misting fans going for muggy hot days like today.  If you're in town and want to hang out with the girls or spend time with your significant other, this would be an amazing place to come and try something new while relaxing.  Everything was also labeled: sweet, red, white, rosé, and even organic. I didn't know organic wine was a thing but apparently it is and they have it.   The guy working today was not the nicest. He barely said anything and didn't really help us out much. It seemed like he didn't want to be there."

                "description": "This store/wine local is in the center of Gruene. It is across from Gruene Hall and Mozies restaurant.  The store is filled w wine glasses and coasters (other items relating to wine) w funny quotes. They have a very large variety of wine that they sell by the glass and by the bottle.  We got 2 glasses of their \"best seller\", the Texas Southwind Blackberry Wine and one of my friends bought a bottle ($29) bc she loved it so much. Each \"glass\" was $9 and it came in a small plastic cup. I have an eye for a serving of wine and this was DEFINITELY short. Our cup wasn't even HALF way full.  Unfortunately, they do not do offer Wine Flights. I'm not sure why. This could be such a great addition to their business. They have a huge variety of wine. It'd be nice to try 4-5 wines and then be able to buy a bottle (or 3 ) of your favorite wines to take home w you. IMO, they are hurting their business by not offering flights. If we had been able to try more wines and not have to pay so much for each tiny glass just to TRY the wine, I'm sure our group would've walked out w more than one bottle.   There is a small courtyard next to the store where you could just sit and drink if you wanted to. There were numerous dogs w their owners. (So, dog friendly! ) We chose to walk around w our tiny glasses  and find a place w live music. (and find a place that offered wine flights...lol)"

We visited on a Saturday, which it wasnt too busy, and enjoyed people watching while waiting for a table to become available at the Gristmill.  I enjoyed the frozen sangria and my husband enjoyed a beer while live music started playing outside in the court yard. Great weather although a little warm for a fall day in October. They did have misters and a bar outside so people didn't have to go inside if they didn't want too.   Plenty of parking nearby. Clean restrooms. Friendly and Quick service."

We did not partake of their wine but on a hot October, Saturday a cold beer or two was in order.   The beer line moves fast and there is a good selection of local and corporate beers. Masks are required indoors while you order and the outside tables are set pretty far apart.   There is a good-sized shaded courtyard with live music (on this Sat afternoon). We opted for the people watching section by the street and we were not disappointed.   Like most places in Gruene everything is a bit overpriced but if you know where to go there are good (nontourist priced) deals. The Grapevine is a cool place to hang while planning your next stop in Gruene."

While there was plenty of out door seating, and a live band playing...definitely still crowded.   Drink wise...we got the frozen wine-a-rita - sangria and peach bellini......very sugary.. but very good if you like sugary drinks. Also kinda on the pricier side for 2 slushy type drinks after tip.  You'll probably make your way here while waiting for your table at the Gristmill to be ready."

It's family/children friendly. There are plenty of seat options outside. And it's very reasonably priced! Especially when you consider that your 3 wine tastings are FREE. I recommend!"

It is my favorite place to go, especially this time of year when the weather starts to cool off they will light up a fire pit. It is the perfect place for a date or group of friends to hang out. Before ordering, you are aloud to taste three wines. There is a wide selection to choose from with categories: sweet/dessert, red, and white. My husband and I usually will take one small sip of our glass and then switch so that we can try six and then buy a bottle of the one we love the most. They give you the option of having a chilled wine in a bucket of ice. In the summertime, we will do this with one of the sweeter wines. Our favorite thing to do is to get them to open the wine and bag it, then give us two plastic cups. This allows us to carry the bottle around and sip on the wine while we walk around town to the different shops."

                "description": "What better stop while you're in Gruene than to stop in to taste a few wines.  You never know what you'll find.  My friend and I had gone in for a tasting to see what might be tempting.  It never hurts to buy a bottle of wine, right?  Well, it was fairly crowded, being such a beautiful day out.  However I have seen it busier.  Anyway, we had walked up to the counter and were greeted and asked what we would like.  We took a few minutes to decide and got our sample.  A little dry for me, so we got another.  Now a few minutes have gone by as we've been standing there.  People come up to the counter and get help.  We finally decide what to get and the person who is been helping us keeps on walking by, as she is helping others.  But there are a few other people working the counter, including a gentleman less than four feet away.  Well, we stand there, just looking, waiting for someone to help us.  That help never came, so we decided to walk out without a purchase.  It's always important to keep track of everyone that comes into your business.    Because I did like the wine I will be back at some point in the future, hopefully to get the bottle that had caught my attention."

                "description": "You get 3 free tastings of either wine or draft beer. OR you can choose to do 5 tastings with a souvenir wine glass (stemmed or stemless, you pick.)   The customer service here cannot be beat. On a weekend day, you will find it to be a happening place, but you won't be waiting in line as you would expect. Sometimes they even have Peach-A-Ritas and Frozen Sangria!   The Grapevine offers a plethora of bottled wines for sale, or you can buy a glass..   There is ample seating outside of the Grapbine building, where you can enjoy a glass of wine, beer or maybe you bought a bottle to share. They will give you a bucket with ice to keep your wine cool in.   The bathroom situation can get a bit tight, as there is 1 male restroom and 1 female. But there are plenty of restrooms available at Gruene Hall which is not far at all.   I like that you can open a tab, so you can grab a beer or glass of wine, walking around Gruene and shop, then stop by when you need a refill.   I was bummed they no longer offer any of the wines from Val Verde in Del Rio, but the waiter did suggest a few wines for me to try that were comparable.   They also have small cheese and cracker boards available."

                "description": "First time trying Sotol, and there wasn't a cocktail on the menu that wasn't incredibly delicious. We sat outside in the lovely fall weather, enjoyed some acoustic tunes by a talented duo with a female vocalist, and tried several cocktails -- all of which we enjoyed. My friend tried the frozen Bartender's Choice which was like a frozen apple cinnamon cocktail, and I tried the Comanchero, the Yipping Coyote, and the Rugged Flower. Each were so smooth and well-balanced. This place not only makes a flavorful Sotol with a smooth, clean finish but transforms it into mouth-watering mixology masterpieces!   Aside from the bus loads of out-of-town tourists who looked like they were part of an Instagram filter for an \"Ashley/Ashleigh\" compilation (complete with brimmed hat, scarf, and boots), this place is a must-visit if you're in Austin. Couple it with a trip to nearby Fredericksburg and you've got yourself an amazing day!"

They've got their sotol, of course, but also a whole bunch of (sotol and other) cocktails, food, and a pretty cool outdoor space with plenty of place to chill. Best of all, there's pretty much always some sort of musician doing their thing (this *is* Austin after all!)  If only it wasn't a decent drive away...."

Very Instagramable location with the truck outside and the silo.   PARKING I went when it was pretty busy. I found parking but I did have to wait for like 5 minutes so cars could clear the road. It gets pretty tight once the parking spots are all full. It's all free. A lot of cars parked on the road. Just be careful crossing the road.   FOOD When I was here they only had one food truck. The options were limited. The prices were a bit too high for the food options available. I didn't try it out. My friends ordered a few things and they felt the food was just ok. I'm not sure on the current food status here.   AMBIANCE  They only had outdoor seating when I was here because of COVID. I sat on the covered outdoor seating which was great since it was around summertime. It was HOT! Really cute tables, friendly/helpful staff, and live music! I don't remember his name but there was a gentleman playing guitar and singing. He was fantastic!   DRINKS I ordered 3 drinks. The first two were the Comanchero and the third was The Copperhead. I'm glad I stopped there. They are strong!   I'm giving it four stars because I felt like the size of the drinks didn't coincide with their prices. I hope I get to stop by here again. It's a bit of a drive for me. It's a really beautiful drive though. Keep kicking butt y'all! I want to try everything!!"

                "description": "Finally decided to take a day trip down to dripping springs and had to finally stop at Desert Door. To start, this place is designed so beautifully. I wish I could steal the décor and put it into my own home. Both the inside and out were so inviting, I don't know how someone could go and not spend hours enjoying the ambiance, food, and drinks. What I thought was so cool about Desert Door was that they educated you on what you were drinking and the history of Sotol. What I did not know, is that they are actually the only Sotol distillery in the US.  We started off with the Sotol flight, and two drinks. Although we did enjoy tasting the Sotol by itself, it was a lot to start the afternoon off with! We also ordered the The Copperhead (my personal favorite of the day), the River Rita, and the Sotol'd Fashioned. I loved each drink but the copperhead was definitely the star of the day, which was a Sotol version of an espresso martini. They also have a food truck on site serving out very unique food. We ordered the tacos and vegan \"queso\" and both really surprised us by how unique and amazing it was. We loved this trip out to Desert Door, and will definitely be back."

But every rule has its exception, or exceptional. Desert Door is a destination in itself. Beautiful southwestern interiors and stylish furniture. The space is cozy but didn't feel crowded, though every table was full. They do have a large patio for outdoor seating and bigger groups.   Now, the sotol. I had never heard of it and didn't know what to expect. The best way I can describe it is an agave spirit, clear, between a vodka and a tequila in its thickness/smoothness. In plain English, it's delicious.   We did the tasting flight, which was a great way to get introduced to a new spirit, followed by a round of cocktails. The cocktails were excellent and reasonably priced.   They also had a lovely food truck on site but we didn't have enough time to try it."

Great patio vibes: chill, mist fans going , and live music about to start. Inside is nice too, super clean and cute/trendy.   The sotol is great and their cocktails are delicious, as well as unique. Had a difficult time deciding which one to get but our attentive and extremely friendly waitress, Nicole strayed me the right way with the Comanchero. Hubs got the ranch water (served in a Topo Chico, gotta love that)!   Nicole our waitress and Erin the bartender are solid assets at this establishment! Thank y'all for a great Saturday afternoon!"

Sit and stay awhile, listen to the live music on the patio and if you need to cool down, the interior is a WHOLE mood.   Be sure to visit their gift shop to buy an adorable handmade clay shotglass (SO CUTE) and a bottle of their famous Sotol.   The staff was also astoundingly friendly and the kind of people you want to hang out with."

Super kind, didn't rush, had great recommendations and allowed my boyfriend to surprise me with two little cakes.   Everything on their menu hits the spot but I got the fettuccine dish and my boyfriend got the penne vodka (which he claims is the best he's ever had). The drive is a bit long from ATX but 100000% worth it.  I will be visiting back when the weather is nicer to also enjoy the vineyard next door"

                "description": "Had a great dinner with my partner the other night at Trattoria Lisina. We didn't have an appointment but were able to grab a table right away.  The driveway was hard to see coming off the road but I suppose this is due to the \"dark sky\" community. Albeit, Some extra signage would be nice.   We ordered meatballs as an appetizer and these were delicious! The garlic toast that comes with this dish is soooo tasty!   Focaccia and oil is complimentary, wish the bread was softer and less greasy but it was free..   We split the taglierini portofino. It was the right amount! The scallops in the dish was perfectly cooked, the shrimp may have been over seasoned but the lemon butter slightly cuts the seasoning.   Over all, We spent about $80 for our meal and 3 drinks.  We were pretty satisfied! Thanks for the great service and delicious Italian!"

We understand mistakes happen but NO ONE from management came to apologize and no concessions were made, not even a drink or the meal of the person who got soaked.   Poor management.

I think this is your best bet if you're looking to eat and be away from crowds (for COVID).  I have to say all the food was good. The linguini was my favorite, followed closely by the mashed potatoes. The breads (focaccia and garlic) were each tasty, i could eat that focaccia all dayyy.  The lasagna was good, a bit heavy for me, though.. but what do you expect with lasagna!  I'd probably skip the Caesar salad next time..  While not my favorite Italian food ever, the grounds are beautiful, and it's a great place to bring a date or some friends and have a picnic style meal with some wine ;)"

While it is not easy to get to, it is the only gourmet restaurant I know of that accommodates helicopters.  (We arrived by car.)  We have met Austin friends here several times and the food has always been excellent, but we all agreed that it is now even better than we had remembered it from pre-covid days.  Warm bread came early with a plate of olive oil and herbs for dipping.  The antipasto plate and the fried calamari were both excellent, with a spicy dipping sauce.  Our friend loved the pasta dish with sautéed scallops, and the 8 ounce filet that my wife and I shared  was the best of our eight decade lifetime.  We will be back again and again."

We drove 45min today (Sunday) and arrived before 11 AM - the place was completely empty.  We took a walk around the property and upon return checked in with the hostess for a party of 6.    We were shocked when she asked if we had a reservation.  Looking at the empty restaurant we politely asked if she was sure we needed one?  She mentioned they were short staffed and completely booked, but we could order take out.  Confused, considering the place still only had one table occupied, we left and went to a different venue."

                "description": "I must start by saying, Morgan is one of the best servers I have had in recent years.  She was attentive and knowledgeable without being aggressive.  She knew the menu perfectly and made great recommendations. We started with the asparagus salad and prosciutto pizza (upside down as Morgan recommended). The asparagus was grilled perfectly with a slight char to it. The pestos on the salad were amazing. The pizza was crisp and delicious. Honestly, it couldn't have been better. I then had the duck breast with cranberries and my dining partner had the ribeye.  Both were cooked perfectly and seasoned just right.  For dessert we got tiramisu.  It was light and delicious. The mascarpone was airy and lady fingers had just the right bit of liquor. The decor was a bit \"overdone\" for my taste, but I can't dare take away any points for my view on that. Really a solid 5."

                "description": "First ever dining experience at Trattoria Lisina.  We we did for a special occasion, a \"mile stone birthday.\"  We drove 1-1/2 hours to get there!  Let's start with negatives (which I don't normally do!).  The most expensive menu item, aside from the bottle of wine, was a pistachio encrusted red snapper filet.  The fish was 2x over cooked, and was tough as leather.  The main problem was it's a filet, skin on, blood line still intact.  As a seasoned Gulf fisherman and chef, I know you need the blood line cut out of the filet, even the fishing guys on YouTube get that.  Great piece of fish, tough to cut even with the knife provided.  It's not all about presentation.  Issue raised with waiter (Joseph S), and \"he could have the manager come over to discuss.\"  As a waiter, when the dish is bad, take it away and redo!  The craft cocktails were OK, not worth the $14-$15 price tag.  The star of the evening was the calamari fritti, which was great!  Fresh, hot, tartar and marinara sauces were on point, terrific.  The veal osso buco, the best in TX, by far!  There's something about fresh bone marrow!  Dessert was the tiramisu, which was awesome, until James S added to the bill.  Overall, Trattoria Lisina is a \"destination\" restaurant, but for the $$, it's not worth the hype.  Enjoy one of the Mandola locations in ATX, the food is better and the price tag is 80% less ..."

                "description": "Driving to Trattoria Lisina from Austin is always a fun field trip out into a totally different part of Texas. No traffic, windy two lane roads and there you are, in a vineyard in the middle of nowhere. I'd have never guessed a place the size and class of Trattoria Lisina would be nestled in hill country like this.  The inside felt distinctly Houston/Dallas vibes: much more corporate and big scale than a little mom-and-pop, but in a good way. Nice and air conditioned with plenty of space too. Now for the food:  The focaccia they serve with garlic/herb olive oil is OUTSTANDING. I could have eaten it all night, so so good. Like fools we ALSO ordered garlic bread. The garlic bread was toasted baguette slices that were burnt and dried. No bueno. Also: how is one bread item the best thing on the menu and the other maybe the worst? Strange, but anyway, don't get the garlic bread when you have garlic oil and bread in your lap, overflowing. The calamari was ok but the entrees were amazing. The osso buco was SO TENDER and so full of flavor. It came with a little marrow spoon and was a huge portion. My husband got the crispy duck with polenta cakes and cranberry salsa and he was a big fan too.   The service was so nice and sweet and the setting was beyond stunning. I really liked my time here and would definitely take guests when they visit too!"

                "description": "This restaurant came highly recommended to us so we had high expectations.   First off, the free focaccia they give you is the bomb. Best item we ate all night.   We ordered garlic toast and it was BURNT. We were told that is how it normally is but we asked for it to be taken off of our ticket. All we could taste was char.   I had the fettuccine con prosciutto. It was ok. I would've preferred thinner prosciutto. I also added chicken and it seemed like it was frozen not fresh. Would I order it again,no.   We did also order the garlic potatoes and they were really good. They really only tasted like the cheese in them but they were great.   We ordered the tiramisu and chocolate caramel cake. Tiramisu is rum HEAVY and I mean it. The chocolate caramel cake was overly salty. I couldn't even eat it. I do normally like \"salty\" desserts so this was a bummer.   Service was ok. Took awhile for refills. Would I come back, probably not. Great ambiance but based on what we ordered we wouldn't come back."

                "description": "A second (or maybe third) run at Trattoria Lisina. Owned by the Mandola family, it's a nicely isolated property with vineyards along the drive, play structures and other outside amenities, a pretty outdoor dining area with umbrellas for the tables and a vine covered facade that demands to be Italian. The inside if modern rustic upscale Italian. They are obscenely popular, so plan to make reservations well in advance. Don't expect to walk in and get a table.  Service today by Jeremy was impeccable. He was hyper attentive and considerate. One of our party has a citrus allergy, and he adapted wonderfully to that.  We started with fried calamari and some artichoke frittatas from the antipasti menu. The calamari was tasty and not over cooked, and the serving was the size of Cleveland. We never finished it. The frittelle al carciofi (artichoke fritters) were scrumptious and unique. What an interesting and creative use of artichoke. The spicey Mayo and marinara sauces were ordinary but fitting.  As it was brunch time, I had a Bloody Mary while she had their Sicilian margarita. Both were well executed. I chose the grilled asparagus salad for my main course. Nearly to die for. The asparagus was grilled just enough, crisp not mushy, beautifully presented, and the mixed greens were fresh, and the dried tomato pesto spiraled outside was rich. She had the Insalata Mista, a mixed greens salad with shrimp added. And she loved it. Since we'd indulged pretty heavily on the calamari and their incredible bread, Jeremy accommodated with a half size salad for her.  We'd intended to have a desert, but, since we'd been such greedy swine with the bread and artichoke fritters and calamari, we had to forego.   Trattoria Lisina lived up to their billing. Actually, they exceeded it. Well done, folks."

Today wasn't one of those days.   We were seated and immediately greeted by our waitress.  She left us with our menus  and within 2 minutes came back to as if we were ready to order.  We shared we hadn't had a chance to view the menu.  She returned within another few minutes, we had decided to order calamari to start with.  We ordered wine after the 4th time she stopped at our table.  We ordered our entree, she came by and asked if she could remove our plates as we're eating some of their delicious focaccia bread.  We let her know we were still working on it.  Another five minutes passed and she picked up the plates.  After about 10 minutes she came to see what plates she could remove.  This was how the rest of our lunch went. As for the food, the calamari was rubbery.  I had ordered pasta alla nino and the chicken seemed like it was a precooked fillet that been microwaved for too long with the pasta being hard on the ends.  They did right by taking it back and not charging me for it.  However, the waitress didn't ask if I'd prefer something else."

My wife and I came here for our anniversary a few months ago and loved it. Came back and brought some out of state guests and they loved it as well. Beautiful location, great food, and wonderful views if you're seated by a window. Service is always on point, and the staff is wonderful. Yes.. it is from the founder of Carrabba's, but this feels much more personable and more of a \"pet project\" on a winery - so don't go in with the mindset your getting chain Italian. Hint: the later you go, the fewer kids that are around, which lends itself to a more intimate dinner with less iPads.  As for the food - the lasagna is a favorite, and the artichoke fritters were excellent this go around. We always get the caprese and it's always so fresh, with wonderful burrata."

The first time I was there I remembered picnic tables so we took a chance. There was already a line when we arrived at 11:30 am.  All of the outdoor tables were wet and no one was  eating outside. People were just standing around the picnic tables waiting to be called inside.  I asked the hostess if we could sit outside since we had the pup. She said due to the rain they didn't have any servers working the outdoor tabled so she recommended that we order to go and were welcome to use the picnic tables.  We had our waterproof picnic blanket with us so that was perfect.  Also, the picnic area was BYOB so my husband had a beer from our cooler before we got our meal.   We had the ribs and burnt ends plate with sweet tea.  The plate came with potato salad, coleslaw and baked beans.  The coleslaw hang a tangy taste as did the bbq sauce. We both really enjoyed our meal and will be back next time we're in the area."

We opted for a to go order. Took about 30 minutes. We ordered the brisket and ribs meal for $27. You would have thought the meat was top notch expensive stuff with how little they gave us. And to think, for $3 more (and 60 minutes more of a wait) we could have gotten all you can eat.  Thank God for the delicious BBQ sauce I poured all over the meat as well as the sides. If it wasn't for the sauce I would have thought I had Corona virus because this stuff had no taste.   I see reviews saying they only accept cash. We paid with a credit card. There was a minimum payment for alcohol though. I think it was $18."

There are little items for sale like candles and honey.  I tasted a few where one was too tangy for me but did pick up a bottle of Salt Lick Cellars BBQ White.    Outside will find tables under huge oak trees and games to play like bocce ball. This place is designated as over 21. Besides wine they sell buckets of beer bottles to enjoy."

It's a nice drive out of Austin, getting a little taste of Texas hill country. Ideally I'd go to a swimming hole near by, then stop at salt lick for a great meal to finish the day.  Everything is delicious and it's an awesome atmosphere. Plenty of outdoor seating which makes it an even better experience."

                "description": "The Salt Lick Cellars was a nice little bonus to our trip to The Salt Lick bbq. With a little bit of a wait ahead of us, we decided to walk over to the cellar for some beers. You walk down the sidewalk along side of the actual Salt Lick restaurant and drool as you see the other patrons inside eating their bbq.   As you enter the cellar you are faced with various wines wall to wall hut on the far left, their selection of beers. We looked over their beer selection and picked up 3 buckets of various beers including lone star and shinerbock. After grabbing our buckets, we enjoyed some on their benches outside. From there you can enjoy looking at their vineyard or play some bocce ball. Or you can walk back with your drinks back to the wait area to be seating.   Perfect side stop if you're looking for an adult beverage while you wait if you forgot to BYOB"

Well, it was a girls weekend, we were soaked to the bone and freezing, unhappy/snippy tenders, and we were jammed in a tiny wine tasting room stuffed with other people trying to avoid the rain.  The fellow customers were likely just as unhappy as we were, but there was wine!  One note though - everyone else was just standing there, we were the only ones that were paying customers and we STILL got attitude.    Our least favorite tasting we did all weekend, but wines were good (not great).  Need to try again one day when there is great weather!"

There are 2 main buildings but the wait for a table was over an hour. Sat outside, food came out super quick. Even got to go in the back and check out where they smoke all the bbq. Authentic as it comes. Texas bbq. This places is BYOB there were even college kids with handles of liquor on their tables as if it was almost a daily event or something to do on the weekend. Atmosphere is cool and kid friendly but you can also have a great time in the winery. Definitely a must if you visit austin, it will not disappoint my meal was about $33 and this place is cash only. The ATM wasn't working so this was somewhat of an issue but we got it handled. Awesome bbq"

People from all walks of life enjoying the weather and listening to some good live music. BBQ was really good and came with all the fixings. Winery ladies were very approachable and helpful.

I mean what else do you do after a 6 mile walk  through the parks but stop for wine!   We got good service inside, both the woman that helped us and the younger guy behind the bar were very friendly and helpful .   We both did a wine tasting (I did the whites) and hubs did the reds. 5 tastings for 12$ which I thought was pretty reasonable. The Chardonnay they had was pretty good along with another I can't pronounce . Hubs enjoyed a couple of the reds as well.  Both left with a cup of white sangria while waiting for our food next door. It was a perfect day to enjoy it on the patio as well.   Would we take an Uber out from Austin just to go here, meh probably not. However, if you're in the area it's a great spot with friendly service. When we're back in the area with friends we'd go back."

                "description": "Honestly so disappointed by the service and quality. We waited for a long time to get our six pack, then when we started drinking it, we noticed that the beer had a best by date of December 18th which was a week and a half ago. When I brought this to the bartender's attention, she said that she could only give us new beers if they hadn't been opened. She also said that the best by date didn't mean anything and brushed off my concerns. This is a quality issue. No restaurant or store should be charging full price or even selling goods past their best by date. I find this extremely upsetting as I've spent money on beer that should have been sold a week and a half ago. Also, we opened the beers but stopped drinking immediately after noticing the date on all the bottles. I don't think a cellar should be able to sell beer or wine past the best by date, and I'm sure no one wants to buy it either. Word of advice, check the date on the bottles before opening. Or better yet, don't bother waiting in the lines and spend your money elsewhere."

She said \"Ok\" and gave me a menu. I was a little surprised she didn't try to talk me through any wine options or tell me about the Winery off the bat. Just an OK and then she turned away to talk to another guy who worked there about \"this lady they apparently both know who's daughter is so big now\"...   Honestly I learned alot about that lady and nothing about their wines. Went with the chilled rosé. After she'd already poured it she goes 'Oh! This is a dry bubbly, is that ok?' - It was, because I love dry champagne, so lucky us. I would have done a tasting if asked, I read on a sign they are $12. I probably would have bought a bottle if I had been able to pay for a tasting.   In short, the rosé was in fact dry but really tasty. Service just dry."

Five stars off the top for the Cellars being a kid free Zone. The rustic tasting room offers wine by the glass or bottle. Unlike the restaurant they do take credit cards. They allow you to bring your wine or beer back to the restaurant to have with your meal. The staff were super friendly. I had a bottle of Rose which was very nice."

The atmosphere is lively with board games and great decor inside, and a food truck and lots of picnic tables outside for large groups.   However, my group ordered 2 different red wines and 1 sparkling white wine and felt that the wines were lacking in flavor and very watery. Maybe this is how Austin wine is, but if you're looking for deeper, richer flavored wine, I would go somewhere else."

I was not going to get any snacks, but their cheese and charcuterie board was calling my name.  We both got the tasting. Each of us got different wines. Our favs were the Tempranillo, Grenache and spaghetti western. You can get all your wines at once or one at a time. I suggest getting them all at once because staff can get busy.  The cheese and charcuterie board paired well with our wines and it was definitely the perfect snack. Loved the cheese selection. The bread sprinkled with olive oil made my day cause who doesn't love bread They have inside and outside seating available. Parking is onsite, but shared with other businesses."

The first time we came here, they had a private event going on so that was sad. The second time, we got here a few hours early so they hadn't opened - that's our fault. Finally, our third attempt was fruitful!  The service here is super chill and on top of things. We 2 flights so we got to taste a good variety of samples. Great pours. We ended up leaving w one of their best bottles and now we're saving it for a special occasion.   We got (ranked from 'pour me another' to meh): *Violet Crown *Tempranillo Nuevo *Vermentino *Red-Nat *Picpoul *Piquette - this seems to be a star here but we personally hated it - tasted a bit like dilute pickle juice  A bottle we had before coming to this place was their Hill Country Rosso and that's still my favorite.  As far as COVID safety goes, the tables are super spread out, the staff wears masks at all times, and everything seems clean.   This place is super cool and what seems to be a hidden gem."

The Yard is the location and they have several business including this winery, a distillery, a brewery, and a few other places. The wine was good and the cheese and charcuterie board was a good size. I'd like to give 5 stars, but we had to ask for napkins, no plates given either. It was also a bit messy inside. Not sure if they were re-organizing or what. But friendly staff, good wine, and cute space! I recommend a stop in!"

During the 'rona, it is recommended to ensure you can get a spot.   My hubby and I did a wine flight a piece. We tried all the reds, the rose, and white wine (Vermentino). We ended up buying a bottle of Malbec to take home which we both had enjoyed. Note, the staff was very knowledgeable and helpful.   I really like the atmosphere of the winery as it is inside a warehouse where they make their own wine and buy their grapes. The winery has a few things to eat or you can buy pizza from Lil Nonna's. The pizza takes awhile but you can always purchase online and set a date. If you are done at the winery you can also bar hope in the area for beer, cocktails, and whiskey."

                "description": "Star service and a non-judgmental space. I dig you, Austin Winery!  We decided on Austin Winery after we had plans to go to Spokesman next door for some beers. Unfortunately, Spokesman had an event going on that looked a little noisy and full for our study date, hence the change in venues. The winery was very spacious and lofty--I love that in an industrial winery! We asked if we could move a table (to plug in to their only one outlet--score!) and do some computer work with their wifi. The gal at the tasting room was fantastically wonderful. She gave us a large smile and told us to do whatever we wanted. Wonderful service alone will get me to come back. That's for sure.  We each got a flight of wine to try, and got down to it until they closed. They have a good selection of whites, rose's and reds, so fret not friends. All is provided. They also have some light bites like cheeses and charcuteries, so you can definitely go with that if you're hungry. The tastings were a little pricey compared to what you might get at a wine tasting out in the vineyards (I used to work in the industry), but you're paying for the convenience of being in South Austin and lots of space to hold conversations, play board games and just be with your groups. They have loads of seating and an upstairs area (that a Bachelorette party was using). Restrooms are clean and wifi is strong. We also walked home with some Brose (a hilarious take on rose especially because it was a women-lead winery effort). Clean, classy and airy space."

We were a bit skeptical because of its limited reviews on yelp but I'm so glad we went and tried it out. Their wine is great, their flights are customized to your individual pallet, and their charcuterie board is to die for. If you go during the summer be sure to try their peach/apricot wine. I thought it would be way too sweet for my liking but it was a great refreshing summer drink! They are located in a small development that also has a few shops, a bakery, and Nate's coffee and cocktails right next to it... and we can't forget, this place is only two blocks from Louies barbecue"

Wonderful areas for kids to play and adults to chill. Lots of great beer options for everyone no matter what your taste is. I tried the Everything is Aussome - an Aussie sparkling ale. It tasted a lot like an IPA to me. I may have expected it to be a bit lighter in taste but still a great bold flavor. Great for groups, family picnics, or just a fun day out to relax. Definitely worth the stop in the area."

Stopped here on Friday night and caught the tail end of their acoustic live music set which they happen to do every Friday night. They stage by far is the best set up I've seen In the area under a natural oak tree with twinkling lights scattered above. Could easily see this place being a great wedding venue. They also had a nice little hiking trail where there's additional seating and a kids playground located further down. Now let's talk about the beer and the brewery. The brewery is huge and has a nice modern approach with a little Texas flare. As far as beers I ended up trying a flight and by far definitely grab a Barton creek gold on a hot summer day. If your looking more of a full bodied beer destination ipa would be my choice. Can't wait to come back here once the weather starts to cool down."

It has a great location right by Deep Eddys and Salt Lick BBQ, which allows you to make a nice day trip out of it.  Starting with the service, my party and I were seated immediately and were served. For drinks, we ordered  1. Adair 2. Zwickled  All the beers were excellent, especially the Adair.  For food, we ordered  1. Pretzel  2. Brisket Sandwich   The food was also great and a lot better tasting than other breweries, for sure. I did think it was interesting to have brisket pastrami cold, but it was still solid.   Overall, I will definitely come back to the spot because they have great food and even better beer."

We were looking for a tap room, since Texas doesn't let you buy beer beer before noon on a Sunday.  Vista has a huge outdoor seating area and they have a real good beer menu. I got two IPAs. They had snacks you can buy as well and I got a beanie and they had stickers if you ask.  Very nice people at the bar and lots of COVID appropriations were in place. Their free was was super good as well!  A really great place to try!"

                "description": "Came here on a Saturday evening, was pretty easy to get a reservation and their patio had tons of open space. They did a great job of enforcing masks when people aren't seated at their table and made it easy for us to keep distance while in line.   Their beer selection is very diverse, so I opted for a flight in my first round. I was pleasantly surprised they allowed you to include their more expensive barrel series in the flight which made the 4 4oz pours for $12 a great deal. While those were tasty my favorite was the dark Pilsner, for such a dark beer it had a more mellow, malty flavor than you would expect.   Food wise it was fairly typical brewery fare, but the $1 hunks of watermelon really hit the spot on a hot August evening.   If you're looking for a brewery a little outside of Austin to escape the city for an evening I'd definitely recommend checking them out!"

                "description": "Vista Brewing is one of the Breweries exempt from the new closed bar order (during Covid19) because of their food to alcohol  sales ratio.  We were excited to make a reservation for a special occasion and were assured (by way of Facebook messenger) that their \"kitchen was open and ready for business\".   We arrived, ready for some good beer and food.  First disappointment:  Their reservation check in system.  A chalkboard sign indicated a table for to-go order pick ups and simply an arrow for reservations.  No employee to greet, direct or be helpful.  2 employees filling to go orders as we stood in what we estimated to be the 'reservation' line.  Several people were behind us when 2 young women cut in front of us and said loudly \"Will you take walk ins\" and to our astonishment they got an employee's attention who completely ignored us and helped them get a table.   Very rude!  Once we were checked in we found a table in the shade and went to get our  beers and food.   Disappointment #2:   No food.  Only popcorn and a cheese plate.  That was it.  We told them we had been assured over messenger that their kitchen was open and they shrugged and said  \"Don't know what to tell you.  It's being renovated.\"     I can't understand how they are allowed to stay open with beer and POPCORN sales as food, under the Governor's new restriction.   At this point we already had our beer so we went back to the table to make the best of it.  Disappointment #3:   the amount of flies and mosquitoes. We go out to another \"farm style brewery\" frequently and have never had an issue with flies or mosquitoes like we did here.   Maybe it's one brewery using a spray service vs. not?  Maybe it's dog poop from being a dog friendly brewery (although, so is the other farm Brewery we go to...)  We had 4 mosquito bites while sitting there and this was at 5:00.  Flies were insane.  It was a disappointment all the way around as we had really been looking forward to several hours of relaxation, beer and food out under the trees.  Added on 7/11:  I have not changed a word of my original review, however I am adding a Star based upon the great communication I have had with one of the owners, Kent, who wrote to me after my original review.  He seemed genuinely interested in my feedback and responded in a very thorough manner."

                "description": "First time ever at Vista! Also first draft beer (not Crowley/growler) since beginning of lockdown. Such a great spot.   COVID: Vista has a GREAT outdoor area with plenty of tables distanced from one another. The ordering process specifies 6 ft of distance in line. Hand sanitizer is everywhere. Beers are delivered in single use cups. They have also started their live music Fridays again where you can venmo the artist tips. Masks are required everywhere but at your table.  You can make a reservation on Open Table for their outdoor area. Currently, they are open until 8PM.  We brought our own chairs and a blanket to use as a tablecloth. We also brought our own glasses to pour the beers into. I love beer out of a glass so this was a need for me.   Overall: This brewery has a ton of good stuff going for it. It's a little out of the way for Austinites (40 minutes), so you've got to make a night out of it. We're generally bigger IPA fans, so there are a few breweries we would check out ahead of this one. BUT they still have a ton of great beers on tap, and it is so worth checking out."

We love sitting indoors and outdoors depending on the weather and like that we have that option. They have live music on weekends and the beer/wine selection is good. Pre-covid their food was farm to table and delicious. We're anxiously awaiting the return on their standard food items. Definitely a great place to check out!"

I didn't realize the current menu is because of covid. The sandwiches were all cold. The pimento cheese dip was good but hard because it's also cold. Literally everything came out of the fridge as they handed it to us.   It was a terrible first impression. I understand it's covid, but I think they could've at least heated the sandwiches or tried to make some better food that can be packaged.   Great venue. Not sure I'll come back."

                "description": "Big fan of Vista. We didn't get to experience their food as they are doing snacks only for now. I recommend bringing food as the snacks aren't great, but I recognize they're doing their best given COVID.   The beer is pretty good though and they have a good variety with their more evergreen beers like kolsch, pilsners, steam beer, IPAs, etc. The other half of the beer selection are collaborations they'll do with a lot of ales and they have a saison on top as well.   You can't beat the environment either. You're in a beautiful forest with a ton of outdoor seating. Great for kids; there's a playground way in the back too. They'll bring in good live music on a few days. Looking forward to trying to food when things open back up."

Plenty of seating in and out.  lots of room for the kids to run about and having a great staff about was wonderful.   only ding was the coordination / distribution of food.  Basically they ran out for our guests, and well, there is nothing you can do about it.   Events are hard to plan for, especially with family and kids, so we will work with them next time to better handle the food service / serving.   The beer was good, the wine selection was pretty good.   What i liked the most was the atmosphere. on a cool evening, with the stars out, it was a great place to be to unwind and chill with friends / family.    Plenty of parking..   Finding the place...well, thats tricky.  See punch in the address in Google Maps, you will be ok, just know that when you get close, slow down, and know the entrance is on top of a hill ... so you can miss it if you are not paying attention.   will I go back: of course, and I would recommend you go and visit."

                "description": "The pop up location at Bee Cave Galleria refused service to me because I have a health condition that prevents me from wearing a mask. Congress passed Public Law 88-352 (78 Stat. 241). The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or health condition.   Violating my civil rights is illegal and immoral and no public business can make a rule that overrides states and federal law. Imagine if Vista Brewing company refused service to a black or gay persons. This is exactly the same situation and they deserve a lawsuit.   There is no law in Texas or the USA that enforces a mask wearing policy. None. Period. No law allows a business  to ignore The Civil Rights Act of 1964. That is federal civil rights legislation that prohibits discrimination in numerous settings including: employment, education, voting, and public accommodations.  No law exists in Texas or USA that enforces mask wearing. No business may ignore SEC. 201. (a) All persons shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, and privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation, as defined in this section, without discrimination or segregation.   Corporate lawyers of Starbucks, Whole Foods, HEB, Home Depot, Lowe's and others allow those of us who are medically exempt. They know the law and don't want to be sued for civil rights violations. I shop there all the time maskless and have no issues.   Places of public accommodation are forbidden to violate state and federal law. Not obeying the laws from ignorance or self righteousness doesn't change the law. Businesses can't make laws.   My suggestion is - get educated on your legal responsibilities if you own or run a business of public accommodation. Wanting to have your costumer's safety is admirable but when that crosses the line to breaking the law, that's a line nobody may cross."

                "description": "Finally I was able to make it out to the distillery with my good friend early on a Saturday so that we could get some direct tasting vodka notes from Deep Eddy themselves rather than me taking shots at bars around Austin.  Parking was easy for us but do note that we showed up around 11:20AM on a Saturday so we didn't have any issues.  The later you arrive parking could be a thing and you may have to wait/stalk someone who is leaving to get a spot. Also as the day got later there were many buses and charter vans parked in the front and roundabout chilling out as the company they are driving around are inside getting down too.  Cocktails in a paper cup runs $8 with plenty to choose from the menu that is thoughtfully laid out in sweet, sours, spicy, etc. A nice mason jar with the Deep Eddy logo is $12 and slightly larger.  Do know that they will not refill your mason jar after you buy your first one so be prepared to be clanking around the distillery with your extra mason jars if you keep going the $12 route. Also be careful with your glass too - I saw many people let that mason jar slip out of their hands and the mason jar just crash on the concrete floor. So sad! Also frozen drinks / cocktails can only be purchased downstairs so be ready to wait in a little line if it is busy.   Loved the areas to sit inside the tasting room and even in the 2nd large downstairs area.  The pillows, decor, and the small touches around the sitting areas on the first floor are super cute and selfie-worthy.  I can imagine in the winter, with the large fireplace going, this space is cozy AF!  We didn't go outside at all as it was super hot in July but it looked like there are plenty of tables, shade, and seating for some large groups both in the front, side, and back areas.  After 2 cocktails in a mason jar we were feeling a good buzz and knowing we still had to trek back home (south Austin) we cut it off there. By the time we left around 2pm the place was buzzing with people, all 3 bars had 10+ waiting to be served, and I wasn't planning on waiting to close my tab in a long line.  I was super surprised to find out you can close your tab at the merch area with the cashier there so don't fret and add in that mug, stickers, shirts, bar additions, and Deep Eddy cool pool lady in red signage to your basket to check out while you close out your tab. You will save yourself some time and be out of there in a jiffy!  We plan to come back especially now knowing they are opened on Thursdays at 11am!!!!"

My favorite is probably the peach vodka and they have many cocktails to choose from. We went on a Sunday where there were local vendors there too as well as live music.

                "description": "Like I was saying earlier, I find tasting rooms gimmicky and this one is a perfect example of it.   We chose to come here because I have deep respect for Deep Eddy as a company for their commitment and contributions to the local community. They've gone above and beyond again and again. Respect!  The tasting room is a large hall, with flights consisting of tiny cups of flavored vodka. You don't taste the actual spirit because the fruity flavors are so sweet.   The \"Colombian\" food options on-site is a joke. It's an old school concession stand (movie theater of the 80s style) with heat lamps keeping nacho chips warm on a folding table. Don't expect tacos or empanadas.  The space, both indoors and outdoor, is quite large. And they have a cute performance stage inside.  We stayed a total of 15 minutes."

Bartenders are very friendly and fast but the drinks are simply made and during Covid they are all touching the mint in their hands by smacking it. Id rather a gentle crush/roll in a glass... felt a bit gross (others commented too).

The set-up is gorgeous and feels so clean when you walk in. You get a behind the scenes taste of where the best Texas vodka comes from. The staff was kind and knowledgeable. They answered any questions we had about the drinks. I ordered a $10 flight and my Husband got the Orange dreamcicle drink. You have the option to get your drink in a mason jar as a keep sake.  There is a great gift shop on site, so we got matching shirts because we are cheesy like that.  There was a delicious food truck out front that had Vegan and Meat Eater options available. I like that they cater to both.   There is so much to do in the surrounding area. We went thrifting and enjoyed the nature that Hill Country has to offer."

We are already big fans of Deep Eddy's vodka and all of their flavors, so we had no doubt we would enjoy our time there. The cocktails they serve at their bar are innovative and refreshing.

Our bartender was also very kind and helped us choose the right cocktails for each of us."

The weather was perfect and they have a nice little patio area. The spot is family friendly meaning you can bring your kids, but there isn't a lot for them to do except run around in the patio area. I would have liked if the patio area was fenced off and not open to the parking so I could relax a bit more. I had to keep a close eye to make sure my kid didn't wander off. I enjoyed both of the drinks I tasted and would definitely stop in here to explore more of the tastings, but will likely leave the kid at home next time."

FINALLY this past weekend we got there when they were open! Oh we were so excited and the place lived up to the hype. The seating atmosphere both inside and out is very roomy and comfortable. All the staff is friendly and easy-going. Everywhere including the bathrooms were incredibly clean. The cocktails... the cocktails are downright amazing. They're inventive, delicious, and fresh. You're going to have a hard decision to make no matter what kind of drinks you like... I actually ended up ordering two at once because I couldn't decide! On the way out, we stopped at their little gift shop and man do they pack that area with goodies! Talk about variety and options. The shirts are awesome and made very well to boot, and they have tons of other merch. I left with a soft tanktop, a wicked fun tin can that I plan on using for a cactus or succulent vase, a magnet, and a collapsible dog bowl! We'll be back every chance we get. Loved it, loved everything, love the vodka."

The whole group willingly gave our ID's for inspection and the birthday girl's ID was \"questionable\", so she was taken to a cop car by a Sheriff, put in the back and questioned.  While Maddy was at the cop car getting her ID verified, the rest of the group had our full drinks/cups (that we paid for and were able to take home), snatched out of our hands. We all requested a refund for the drinks and were denied??  After the Sherriff verified that Maddy's ID was real, the manager proceeded to threaten tresspassing charges against us??   I have never experienced anything like this and would love to be contacted/reimbursed for the mistake that was clearly made."

I will preface that this whole COVID thing has still, for some reason, has some still on edge.  However, this place has taken it to new heights.  While the great state of Texas has opened to 100%, this place seems to have missed that memo.  We literally got yelled it for actually standing up at our tables and told that if we do stand to have a mask on.  Additionally, we got yelled at for moving a table.  The guys exact words were \"I'm picky where our furniture is placed.\"  Additionally, if you want to get a beverage, you actually have to MAKE A RESERVATION just to go in get one.  That is ridiculous!  By the way, the Hays County police are on site to enforce all of this over-the-top nonsense.  Most of us stayed for a single drink and then left for better and more fun pastures.  It's obvious that this place has forgotten all about who the consumer is and how we should be treated.  Not only will we never go back, but I am never going to purchase any of their products again.  By the way...the Jeep community here in Texas is very tight-knit and we will talk..."

The inside tasting room is a tad bit shabby and small. We went outside on the deck and they have lovely views but only one side is shaded, the other side has a retractable awning but they did not open it so it was roasting hot.   While there we tried their Cabernet Sauvignon and unfortunately it was not memorable. I was going to give this winery a two-star but the views and the staff are sweet, so I bumped it up a star."

Thanks to the people at Canyon Gorge we discovered this hidden gem in the Hill Country!   The proprietors do everything from crushing and pressing to making their own labels and they consider their wine \"holistic\". They produce only dry wines with no preservatives or additives and is sulfite free.   Patty gave my friend and I and our dogs a tour and tasting on a Sunday when we stumbled upon the vineyard. But, the official tasting hours are Noon - 7PM on Saturday and by appointment.   If you like a dry Merlot I recommend Fawncrest."

                "description": "As the BF and I found ourselves taking care of business in Canyon Lake, I thought it would be awesome to check out a local Texas Hill Country winery. Seeing that there were only 2 in this town, we went for the one that was closer to where we were. GPS landed us in a neighborhood of houses which confused us as we were used to visiting wineries with long pebble stone roads filled with vineyards and an entrance sign. Don't expect that here as the tasting room is truly located in the owner's house! We were definitely thrown off and nervous to approach a house with two dogs in the back yard fence for fear of being shot for trespassing, but luckily, there is a small sign on the front of the house providing directions to walk around to the back and enter in the sliding glass doors. We ended up in the small cozy tasting room which is an extension of the owner's house and were welcomed with open friendly arms. The McNeil's are the sweet couple that owns the small vineyard. One side of the house has a sit and sip porch that has a view out onto the lake and the 4 rows of grapes. The tasting room is air conditioned with a TV that we found ourselves watching football with the owners and playing with their big puppy. The free wine tasting was the icing as we got to try all of their wines and have a second sample of our favorite. They make a delicious Chardonnay which is aged with both French and American oak chips. They also have a Cab Sav, a Cab Franc, a Merlot, and a red blend of 3 grapes called The Meritage. We loved the relaxed charming atmosphere and the selections of wines this vineyard had to offer. BTW, there is an outside tasting bar that they have to host larger groups which is nicely covered to block the hot sun in case you're wondering. We left this little charming simple vineyard with a large smile, 3 bottles in hand, and another fond memory to add to the book."

Gruene Historic District is embellished with historic buildings, antique stores, specialty shops, quirky restaurants, and beautiful landscapes. It is small enough to walk by foot, but big enough to discover new things to do and see for an entire day. There are restaurants for coffee, pecan candies, ice cream, and even pickles! And there are shops for toys, unique t-shirts, plants, and pottery. The possibilities are endless.  There are a few unconventional hotel and cottages conveniently located nearby that are walk-able distance. Otherwise the drive from New Braunfels is about 10 minutes. I came here on a Sunday and there were quite a few people walking around, but it wasnt so crowded that I couldn't feel a breeze. There are also plenty of street and parking lots scattered throughout, but there is a main lot located near Got Toys and Typsy Gypsy."

I love old historic buildings and this is the perfect place to come learn some history and see how well they preserved their town. Tons of restaurants, wineries, and little shops to explore. I wouldn't say it's necessarily kid friendly but a nice romantic getaway or girls trip would be perfect here. Everything is within a five minute walk of each other which was nice.  Parking was easy for us to find, the biggest parking area we found was behind the grapevine winery so I would head there first before wasting time circling in front of the store you wanna go into."

We come to Gruene often, to shop and/or eat. Recently we stayed for a couple of nights during the week just for a get away. We stayed at the Gruene Mansion Inn which was fantastic. Gruene itself, however was awful. I walked early in the morning and it was like walking on the side of the freeway. The traffic was non-stop, including big trucks. Cars were moving fast. I had to run to cross the street, in between cars, no one stopped. After my walk (probably around 0800), I headed back to my room and noticed that there were lawn workers cleaning at Gruene Hall with leaf blowers. At around 0930, we walked to go shop and they were still blowing leaves at all the shops in the area......lunch at Mozie's......still blowing. Tried to go back to our room at 1300, still blowing. My husband tried to take a nap at 1430, couldn't because of the leaf blowing. It was ridiculous! Not so cozy or peaceful."

                "description": "It's pronounced, \"Green\" Gruene is a historic district outside of New Braunfels, along the Guadalupe River. It's an old Civil War era cotton town that was once somewhat of a ghost town. It's bounced back with tourism!  Gruene is a place to go to hang out for an afternoon, and take in the antique shops along Gruene's main street. They also have a wine sampling spot. The Gristmill is a great place to get some German food, and then head to Gruene Hall for some live music at Texas' oldest dance hall.  Gruene, Texas was founded in the 1840's by German settlers. The entire area is all German. The downtown area is mainly made of old brick buildings that have been restored. They're cool architectural designs that make up the shopping district. During Gruene Market Days, local vendors come out for a public market in the streets. As far as I know, you can't really go tubing through Gruene, as it's a bit out from all the tubing spots. The water comes rushing through here, and it seems like it might be difficult to tube it here. Try closer to downtown New Braunfels."

But it's a nice cool, overcast day. Shops, food, wine. . . enough to make everyone happy.  If you've never visited, do.  If you've visited before, what's taking you so long to come back?  I promise you'll find something to enjoy."

My friend and I were early coming back to Austin from a weekend getaway in San Antonio on a Sunday afternoon.  Being newish to the area I wasn't familiar with Gruene.  We saw the highway signs advertising Gruene, and usually my curiosity gets the better of me and I will find myself driving out to these places that end up being nothing.  However, Gruene is the first time the signs haven't lied.  My friend and I fell in love instantly with the magic of Gruene's historic wooden downtown main street buildings.  There is something for everyone here,  restaurants and cafes galore, an amazing historic music hall that has some fantastic bands regularly playing, little boutique shops, a winery, a wine tasting room highlighting the best of Texas wines + a couple of beers on tap, numerous adorable BandB's, outdoor market days highlighting local artisans, and of course the token water tower.   I recently spent an afternoon here enjoying the market days, tasting great food, and sipping some great wine.    Time moves a bit slower here, and even though you are 45 minutes from home, you are on a mini holiday."

A few times a month they have something called Gruene Market Days where artists/bakers/creators of all things hand crafted come out and sell their goods.  Restaurants like Gruene River Grill, Grist Mill, Adobe Berde and La Cantina offer great dining and nice views. Gruene Hall is a must stop! Lots of antique shops too. Parking can be hard but be patient and something will open up."

There is so much new construction of new shopping centers, which look like little Bavarian villages, new homes, upscale condos, and of course quaint gift shops, restaurants, and coffee houses.  The bikers love to make it one of their pass through routes, as well as the snowbirds, and river/tube crowd. Come to Gruene for all your antique hunting, shopping, drinking, and even visit one of the many winerys that have daily wine tastings."

The inside is small because it's in a cottage so there's a sign saying one group at a time. The wines are from California. You can do a flight for $15 or a glass. We all chose a glass (8oz pour) whereas a tasting is 6 oz. loved our reds. There's a sculpture garden to stroll. Lovely place for convo. Also we tried the fat boy cheese spread w ritz crackers and it's so good!"

However perhaps I will be a bit biased coming from California and having tried some of the best wines, the wine here is not something for a refined wine pallet. It's a cute little spot to check out and try out but not something that would leave you wanting more. Sauvignon Blanc was the best choice of the flight and the others did not leave me too excited."

                "description": "I keep meaning to post a review for this winery. My husband and I visited them a few weeks ago to celebrate a recent job interview. They have only recently opened up, so we had never heard of them before and were excited to try them out. They had a very cute tasting room with nice stone that also felt very homey. The tasting was $20 and you get to try 6 wines. $20 still feels a bit hefty for a tasting in Central Texas for me, but their pours were pretty generous and you're not being served by someone who looks like a teenager who couldn't care less about your experience (like what Becker has become). All of these wines are from Sonoma. Overall, we didn't love the tastings except for the Zinfandel and the Cabernet which were absolutely outstanding, but I don't typically love lighter-bodied red wines or most reds from Sonoma. The quality is great, but a few of the prices were just slightly higher than what we can personally justify - I absolutely loved the Cab but it was $60. The Zinfandel was more affordable at $39. Their Wine Club gives you 20% off purchases which is nice, but it is a 6-bottle quarterly shipment. The winemakers are the Parmesons themselves and we had the pleasure of getting to chat with them while we did our tasting. They are a wonderful couple who were very welcoming and lovely to chat with. We loved hearing their story of how they got into winemaking. I would highly recommend checking this place out!"

I was unenthusiastically greeted by a girl who acted as if I was bothering her by coming into get coffee. I was asking her questions about the place and what they had and she was incredibly rude and continue to answer my questions with one word answers. No smile ever came across her face and she really made me feel uncomfortable as I was just trying to get some information about the store. My family is really big on cigars /coffee/ whiskey and I was very disappointed in the customer service or lack of customer service. I decided to push through and continue with ordering a coffee and when I asked her for a dry cappuccino she proceeded to roll her eyes and told me she didn't know how to make it and asked me what a dry cappuccino was. When I asked her \"isn't this a coffee place?\" she said \"I don't know how to make the coffee I just push the buttons\". As somebody that has been a barista and worked at a coffee shop I tried to explain to her how to make it and she just increasingly became annoyed with me. I decided to scratch the dry cappuccino just ordered a double shot of espresso which was awful by the way. As I continued to try to make small talk it was very apparent that I was not welcome there. I even asked her if she wasn't having a good day because of the way I was being treated. As I was paying, I asked her if there was a place that I could leave a review for the store she looked me dead in my eyes and said no. I confusingly asked her, \" oh you don't have a Yelp?\" She straight up told me no. As somebody that has worked in customer service I have got to say this is the worst customer service I've ever experienced and I would never treat a customer the way that I was treated. I just hope that the owners can see this and know what goes on in their store when they're not there because if I was the owner of the store I would want to know about one of my employees making people feel very uncomfortable And not being helpful at all. I made several attempts to try to turn this experience around and give her the opportunity to create a pleasant experience for me but she just acted like I was interrupting her day of sitting on the stool behind the counter. Customer service was awful coffee was awful she didn't even know how to make a dry cappuccino. If I were you I would steer clear of this place it's not worth it."

                "description": "My wife and I went to Bella Vista Ranch for a 4th of July tour with lunch, and we found it to be terrific value for the money. There was a nice lunch from a food truck (the name of which eludes me, unfortunately) followed by an interesting talk about the history of olive oil and the origins of the Italian family farm dating back to the second century BCE. The owner explained how he established Bella Vista on the ancient Roman model and described the modifications he has made to make olives grow in Texas. Then we toured the olive orchard and learned about the different varieties of grapes grown on the property. We saw the processing room containing the \"frantoio\" or olive press as well as the vats where this year's wines are aging. We then tasted several oils as well as four glasses of wine per person. All this for $25 (the regular tour without lunch is only $15).  Oils, vinegars, wines and soaps are available for sale. These are pretty expensive (e.g. $18+ for 250ml of their basic Texas Blend oil), but I don't mind paying those prices for high-quality locally produced specialty goods. This is a fascinating day out, which I recommend wholeheartedly.  Pro tip: If you're coming from San Antonio, take I-35 instead of US 281 and the back roads. We were expecting a relaxing drive in the country, but construction and traffic made it a stressful trip. Coming back on 35 was a joy by comparison!"

                "description": "So, so rude. The olive oil and vinegar are excellent, but the experience was ruined by the lady--the one everyone complains of here. The hours on Sunday are until 4. I get there at 3:25, and she walks past me with her whiny, demanding voice telling me that they close at 3:30. Uh, wanna put that on your website as your updated hours?  I went in anyway. The gentleman doing the oil tasting was knowledgeable and helpful. He told the lady to close the gate.  You know, what a non-stupid person would do should they slothfully decide to close early since they dont work for a living.  My mother was incredibly upset by this lady's rudeness. When you run a service like this, you stay open until you no longer have a good flow of customers. Closing is at 4? Hi, if a bunch of people are coming in at 3:30 thru 4:00, you keep working. Lazy Texas people who inherited their property and think they work hard by paying others to harvest their crop and bottle it. Meritocracy, right? They are the class of people who make this state an impoverished mess.    Don't run a customer service business dependent upon people stopping by on a lark like a fascist regime. You don't get to do that. Then again, when you dont have a legitimate concern about how you pay your bills, i guess you can just work until you get bored with the whole work thing.   Go sell wholesale if you hate customers. Working for yourself does not mean you get any more freedom. You have are dependent on good will. And you don't have mine.  The lady tried to make up for her garbage attitude when i made my purchase. You know what? Have a blessed day, lady. A.BLESSED.DAY.  Tl;dr. There are other puveyors of Texas olive oil, particularly in south Texas. Do not waste your wine tasting trip here. If you want to support local, consider others who are hard-working enough to sell their products in Central Market."

I regret not reading the reviews before coming here because everyone is saying the same thing. We did a wine tasting (which was $10) and were barely served anything. My husband and I both left this place wondering how they are still in business. The wine was super expensive (not good at all), and they have horrible customer service.

Before I could even ask a question about the wine or olives, an employee firmly told me as she was finishing up with another set of customers that \"I don't have time to answer your questions.\"  She then proceeded to hard sell our group to pay $10 for the \"last minute\" tour. And, to add insult to injury, as 2 of the 4 of us completed their purchases, both employees proceeded to exit the store and watch us walk to our vehicle and  drive off. I will never spend a dollar at your business.  Good luck to you."

The tour and history of olives was really interesting. Definitely try the balsamic and infused oils. The wine tasting was pretty brief compared to the olive portion but great none the less. The wines are dryer, not sweet. I thought they were great. A lot of the other local wineries wines are very sweet, but I really enjoyed these! You should absolutely plan to visit if in the area."

He just didn't want to serve us so we left.   The second time we went there were 4 of us and it was in the middle of the day. While the wine is fine, the server was the single most rude person I've ever encountered at a winery. Just astounding how she could be that rude for the duration of the wine tasting. I will never go back and suggest no one ever go there. You cant drink the wine fast enough to over come they workers rudeness."

                "description": "We liked the olive oil a lot.  However... I think the \"thorn\" of this place is the owner.  He seems rather joyless in making something that could ideally fulfill the soul.  His 1 1/2 hour (yes, it's long) \"tour\" is mostly comprised of the history of the Olive, snarky political opinions, braggary of his past career in Silicone Valley, and a hatred for Texas AandM.   Not a place to take a kid. Seriously.  We sat and listened to him for well over an hour then briefly stood under two olive trees, looked at another one that was hurt in a storm, looked at the press machinery, and then did a \"tasting.\" Like I said, the oil was good. I got the impression that the lady helping in the gift shop/tasting room didn't want to be there either. Basically I was confused why this man (and his 5th wife...no lie) were running this business and opening it to the public.  I walked away a little sad that something so wonderful like successfully growing beautiful trees to make a solid product could be reduced to something so joyless."

                "description": "We were warned at great length that we could not even look at our cell phones during the tour which seemed odd when people might have a kid or babysitter or be waiting on something important from work to come through--I mean we are all adults...but I soon found out why.  Far less than an entertaining traditional tour, you sit and listen to someone talk more like a college class lecture, but with way too many rabbit trails of information that eventually make you tune out.  Like what a certain blizzard is called in different parts of the world, how accounting dates back to the Romans, etc.  I am passionate about olive oils and wine but learned too much about history and every other subject to even focus on what I wanted to know about olive oil. Or feel entertained.  The group I was with concurred.   There are 3 types of learners: auditory, visual, and tactile and the class is entirely sit and listen to one man talk for half of it then stand and listen by a tree then a press for the other half. So only appealing to auditory learners. And no audience engagement during the lecture.  At the end you actually get to see and touch. But they had no bread for us so we had to drink an olive oil and talk about it for 30 more minutes so I left before I tasted the other flavored oils as it had already been a full day of just listening to way too much info to retain.  In a very strict manner rather than entertaining with audience engagement.  And strict rules.  Obviously people tune out and begin looking at their cell phones so that's why they don't allow them.  Rather than making the tour entertaining so you dont' want to--It was in the hot sun as well so it was pretty miserable.  The olive oil was good but I've had better, it was a bit weak to me, we did the wine tasting as well and those were not acceptable to me.  I actually would recommend skipping the tour and talking to the staff as you taste the olive oil because they knew all of the information given on the tour without the lengthy side notes of things that should be shaved off for entertainment value.  And that's really the best part.    I don't think they like people very much though to be honest."

                "description": "A hidden mecca of olives.  In central Texas.  The Bella Vista Ranch was designed as a traditional Italian family farm and features the first commercially grown olives in Texas.  And the olives I sampled are Texas size and Texas good.  Apparently the crowd favorite is the bleu cheese stuffed olive.  We sampled a garlic stuffed olive that was really good.  The ranch also offers delicious balsamic vinegars and olive oils which go for around $17 a bottle.  My lips slurped the Fig Vanilla Balsamic over and over again.  I am sure I was sample cheating but that stuff is incredible.     This is also a working winery that produces several red and white varieties plus a Natural Blackberry Wine!  Yum.  Wine tastings are $5/per person.  I think the owner has a great thing going for him and a beauty of a property. Tours of the orchard happen on the weekend and include a wine tasting for $10/per person."

I have been back four times now and each time come away with a little more understanding of the narrative that is offered. While I purchased my typical bottles of olive oil - some for myself, some for holiday gifts - I did also indulge in some olive oil based soaps.   The olives and oil are fabulous. I am not as great a fan of their wines. They are not awful, just not with the properties I care for, typically. The in-laws found a favorite to take home, though.  The tour is still $10 and includes the wine tasting, which is a good deal.  Bottles of oil range from $16-$27 each, depending on size.  Soap is $6.99 a bar.  They also feature balsamic vinegars (not made there) and jars of olives, which are delightful as well."

Take one look at Jack and the humble grounds here at Bella Vista, and you'd never guess that he has olive friends he emails with back in Italy or that he can tell you all you'd ever want to know about the science and technique behind growing and processing olives.  I would highly recommend the tour - while there isn't much walking involved in this tour, my husband and I found it to be highly informative. And with Jack's red-blooded Texan sense of humor, it was a very entertaining education. Be sure to note the times of the tour (Sat @ 10am and 1pm, and Sun @ noon) since it's a group setup.   After the tour comes a tasting of several types of olive oil produced on site along with some of their balsamic vinegar offerings. While they also have wine offered, I'd recommend sticking with the olive oil - clearly what they specialize in. If you're only interested in tasting the oils/wines (not the tour), it's probably good to avoid arriving at the tasting room about an hour after each tour start since the tasting room isn't overly large and tends to fill up easily with the folks coming off the tour."

                "description": "While I thought it was pretty interesting to learn about and taste boutique olive oil (as I'd never been to an olive ranch before) $15 per person does seem a little high when the actual tour is quite short and obviously the intention is that you're going to buy some stuff at the end, and all that stuff is small batch and quite pricey (understandably so.)  So it ends up  being more like $100 for two people when you include the olive oil you will want to buy plus the wine you might want to buy (some people seem to think it sucks, we liked some of it.)  But you will leave with a buzz on and some delicious olive oils!  The owners were away so their daughter gave the tour; I thought she was pretty funny and personable but there were some questions she couldn't answer but it was really no big deal (and she wasn't super long winded like the owner seems to be  but of course some people like that and some people don't.) It's also probably better when there are olives on the trees but it was still overall pretty interesting to see the different trees different olives grow up and hear some history and facts about olive oil production.  I liked hearing about the process and seeing the machinery. And of course I liked tasting the fresh olive oil, which was indeed super tasty and surprisingly spicy. Most of their oils are made from all different olives smushed together but they have one variety that's just made with one kind of olive which we got to try. They also had a blood orange infused oil that I'm now obsessed with; we bought some and later made some asparagus on the grill that had been rubbed with the oil, it was the most delicious asparagus ever! We also enjoyed the wine; we are not wine snobs in any way but we enjoyed what we had and bought a bottle just  because it's the polite thing to do. We sat out on the bench in front of the tasting room and enjoyed our wines and just had a lovely afternoon.   I will say that it gets a little hectic in the tasting room when people come in just for a tasting after a tour- I would say if you want just a tasting, don't come between 1:30-2:30 because it's going to get confusing!"

She was delighted to hear that we moved out here from San Francisco (that's where she grew up but couldn't  stand the fog). The husband is an old curmudgeon, but delightfully so. He worked in high-tech in Silicon Valley and moved out his last company to Austin in the early 90s, eventually leaving to grow olives and make wine.   it's not always the case that you visit a winery and the owners pour for you, so that was a treat. They are a very small production and a bit off the beaten path, so it was pretty quiet there too. A small group arrived just as we were leaving, but it was nothing like the bustling tasting rooms at nearby Driftwood Cellars.  The blackberry wine is actually good--you wouldn't necessarily guess that it's made of blackberry not grapes. And the other three reds we tasted were also nice."

It's basically an outpost of the parent company in California. Based in Paso Robles, Graveyard Vineyards is a small producer. The wines offered are all grown and made in California.   We opted for the tasting. They offered 6 wines for $15. We enjoyed generous pours of 2 whites, 1 rose, 2 reds, and a dessert wine. All of them were very good! You can tell their not Texas wines (in a good way!).   The staff was incredibly helpful. They offered tastings outside and were very attentive!

The wineries prior, all staff wore masks which was nice since we had a couple high risk individuals in our group. When we arrived at Graveyard, the outside was not impressive, not exactly the winery ambience. Once we got inside, the male was not wearing a mask (ok... fine... mask mandate lifted.... ) but he then told me I could take off my mask standing about a foot away, and I told him no I can't, we have high risk individuals. He then said to go outside for the tasting which we did. But honestly, who tells people to take off their masks or suggest they take off their masks during a pandemic? He has noooo idea of our health conditions, concerns or even has the right to even suggest on the matter. I was definitely taken back.  Once we went outside the table was just covered in pollen and debris and leaves. We were all so itchy from all the leaves under the table. Just no grooming or landscaping or care given to the on-site property. It was not a relaxing atmosphere whatsoever, as mentioned prior, a parking lot view/feeling.  The female local staff member had superb customer service, but again, in our faces pouring wine with no mask on. Out of the wineries we went to that day, this is the ONLY place where they were mask free. Although the mask mandate was lifted, we're still in the midst of a major pandemic and felt other establishments honored that respectfully. We felt very safe at all the wineries prior.   Grapes not from Texas.   Pros: Wine was good."

                "description": "This review is meant as an FYI to those people who are thinking about joining the Graveyard vineyards wine club.  Graveyard expects you to take three shipments and are unwilling to cancel your membership before you pay for, and receive three shipments.  I have received two shipments and did not want any more Graveyard wine.  When I reached out to the wine club, the response was \"you are asked to received three shipments; you've had two.  Your third one is coming up.\"  I am going to be candid here.  I just don't care for the wines.  I know others like them very much.  My sister, who lives near the tasting room in Dripping Springs, loves the wine.  There is nothing wrong with the wine; I just don't care for it and I think two shipments is enough to make up my mind.  I conveyed my feelings to the wine club manager and her solution was to downgrade me from a 12-bottle shipment to a 6-bottle shipment.  I really don't mean to knock Graveyard.  But my suggestion is to buy a case of wine and try it before you join the club.  I want to emphasize that there is nothing wrong with the wine; it just does not align with my tastes."

                "description": "Graveyard is a brand new addition to the winery community in Drip, having opened in late January. They are an offshoot of a parent winery in Paso Robles, CA. The wines they sell are all produced, bottled and shipped here from that operation. They do yet carry the entire CA inventory but do plan to increase the Texas offerings.   The wines available include a couple of Graveyard's more affordable blends - Paso Tombstone White and the red blend from that line. Both are pleasant, sippable blends at a very reasonable price point. The red was light slightly complex mix of common reds produced at the parent vineyard. They also stock Ascender, a credible Brut. Their estate Cab is actually very good- a lighter Cab with a nice effect on the palate.   The lounge itself is pleasant and airy without being pretentious. The staff, especially manager Adam, are all personable and informative."

It was a relaxing time playing checkers and sipping wine under the trees, though. Our server was wonderful and covid-safe. Unfortunately, one staff wasn't wearing a mask, even inside, but we didn't have to deal with him much. We really enjoyed the wines. I know they are based out of Cali, but it was still nice to get a decent sparkling wine at a Texas vineyard. They were all good, but that was a nice surprise."

The bar tender seemed to be really put out that we were even there.  Didn't welcome us, when we asked if we needed to go to the register part of the bar to order,  he looked at his phone and rudely said, I'll be with you in a min. Then continued to be annoyed that he had to take our order. The place was empty only 1 pinter group of 4 so wasn't like he was super busy.  They even said he didn't really seem to want to be there and definitely didn't want to be taking our orders.  The AC was also very lacking we were all fanning ourselves with the menu which seemed to be the best use of the menu since he didn't want to serve us. The sink in the women's bathroom barley had water coming out if it and they were out of toliet paper but we dare not ask the 1 bar tender as that would have really put him over the top. I wouldn't recommend this place and if I was the owner I'd want to know how bad my employee is. No wonder there was no one inside."

It'll be a great space to spend an afternoon once the pandemic ends.  Call ahead if you want to pick up some of their fabulous Texas Holiday Nog, but remember, only 2 bottles per person per month.  Careful though and drink responsibly. This is not your father's Oldsmobile eggnog. It will sneak up on you and kicks you in the noggin like a freakin' mule."

                "description": "We passed by this place heading to the Drip yesterday and since I'd never heard of it, I immediately yelped it.  A new distillary only about 10 minutes from my Casa?  Hell yes, I'm curious.  And I'll admit I became even more curiouser after reading Arian's review....I intended to ask them about this \"one of the best after-hours swingers hangouts in Austin!!!\" sitch.    The tasting room was a little hard to find as it's around the back of this little warehouse strip but it's open and spacious and we were only the 2nd couple there on a Friday evening.  We were warmly greeted and bellied up to the bar.  Our bartender (and all the staff I think) are in the Stinson family.  She was very friendly and gave us all the history of the place and explained each tasting in length.  They are currently offering a tasting of 4 of their liquors for $7 (these served quaintly in communion cups) and have cocktails they can serve as well.  We sampled everything (of course), the vodka, the white rum and dark rum, the elderflower liquor (think St Germaine) and the Holiday Nog.  She also threw in a sampling of their Bailey's style coffee liquor that's not quite \"ready\" yet.  I immediately fell in love with the Holiday Nog, which doesn't actually have any egg in it (thank goodness) and is made more with rum than whiskey (again, thank goodness).  This will go great with holiday gatherings.  I will keep an eye on their FB page for release of that coffee liquor!  All of their bottles run in the $25 range.  Hubby and I each had a cocktail, him the mojito and me the Citrus Fizz, and both were made well and were tasty.  We also bought several of their cocktail glasses as they are sturdy heavy glass, perfect for Bourbon.  Which, btw, they are still perfecting their whiskey recipe and will offer that in the future as well.    We really enjoyed talking to everyone and after getting a little liquid courage, I did ask about the swinger's parties.  She laughed and said that was just a friend making jokes....I wonder......"

It would be okay to play some music as it's awkwardly quiet due to the lack of patrons.  Finally, the people at the counter seemed annoyed with people overall.  Another couple in  the parking lot stopped us and asked if we had the same bad experience so it was not just us."

Glad we stopped at this place after seeing a sign off the side of the road and following a winding path down to see this gem.  Very homey vibes with a great patio for outdoor seeing that just has a fantastic view of the hill country. Decently priced drinks consisting of either gin or vodka.  Seating is pretty limited inside, but the outdoor space is just amazing and honestly makes the experience really that much better. I'd highly recommend 'The Bullfrog' with vodka. Tasty drink, but not overpowering and has a nice kick (smooth vodka that doesn't burn like gasoline).  P.S. They have some cool looking merch! Make sure to take a look at their terrariums...they are wicked!"

However, this time I made a trip purposefully to stop in.  I am glad I did.  Frog Pond is a family-owned business and passion project. The entire family was behind the bar the day my friend and I stopped in except for mom and I think a daughter.  The family owns the land and has slowly overtime built the tasting room and production area themselves.  They currently make a vodka and gin.  They offered us a free sip of each to determine which we would prefer in one of their handcrafted cocktails.  Both had a nice flavor profile that blends well in cocktails.  Their cocktails were creative and they mentioned the family came up with the recipes together.  The cocktails were delicious and very reasonably priced.  Their space has a fun modern 50's theme.  They have an outdoor patio you can sit back and relax on a nice day."

It's very obvious that a lot of careful thought has gone into this place. The actual distillery is incredible. The whole place is just beautiful. Even on a scorching Texas Summer day, there's a strong breeze out on the porch.  It's a very \"Austin-esque\" type place, down-home and friendly. Although I don't drink, my wife enjoyed a cocktail very much and we bought a bottle to take home. They had some nice lemonade and infused water for me too.  Great design of the logo, bottles and everything. Really worth stopping in if you're in the area or just feel like a nice drive from Austin."

We started off at another well known distillery down the road and googled what else was close by and found this awesome little spot with a great view. They make small batches of vodka and gin at the distillery and make a few different drinks to try. Their porch was a great place to hang out while playing giant jenga and relaxing. I noticed cornhole as we walked in as well. We watched deer randomly wandering in the distance. The drink I had was great, a cranberry vodka fizz, so I had another. The indoor space is fairly small and the patio could fit maybe 30 people comfortably. It was not crowded at all when we were there on a Sunday afternoon. We'll go again next time we're in Austin!"

I am very happy to say that the product that they are offering, not only the liquor, is amazing. They couldn't have picked a better location to place their distillery. The hills of Texas, day or night, make relaxing on the patio with the variety of gin and vodka cocktails that much more relaxing. The bright pops of color when you venture inside of the distillery are such a delight and really made my girlfriend and I feel happy to be in such a welcoming place.   The gin was delicious and I plan to buy more bottles very soon. Don't think that my lack of praise for the vodka means that it isn't good (I am just not a fan of vodka..rough nights in college) but I definitely suggesting venturing out to this family run, local organization. You will not be disappointed."

Located right off the Square so easy walking distance to restaurants, shops, and the creek. I recommend Kiss the Cook (souvenirs, kitchen gadgets, coffee, etc) and Wimberley Cafe (good burgers and pie). The courtyard is beautifully decorated and relaxing. Plenty of FREE breakfast and pre-packaged snacks available even during COVID (cereal, Nutri-grain and Nature Valley bars, Chewy bars, muffins, coffee, orange juice, apple juice, pudding packs, fruit cups, yogurt, chips, milk and water for $1).  Stayed in the Maeson room. You have to exit the home into the courtyard to access this room, but I liked the privacy. Very comfortable king size bed, fresh linens, very spacious room w/ mini fridge, microwave, and tv, not much counter space in the bathroom though. Hosts were incredibly nice and welcoming. I would return!"

                "description": "My sister got married last week in Wimberly, TX. Our family thought, \"this is so random\". Neither of the families lived there and most of us had never heard of Wimberly. Then my sister said she had booked us at The Square Inn and gave us room arrangements.   I had flown in leaving MD at 4 am then getting to Dallas and then drove an hour. It felt like it was 5 in the afternoon but in reality it was 11am.   We walk into the Square Inn and was greeted by the owners. It never even hit my mind from the crazy traveling, check in was at 3 PM. To be honest I didnt think about it till others said there hotels would not let them early check in.   When meeting the owners, it felt like family. It almost felt like we were all coming home. They were so great. They let us in early and was cool enough to say, \"we need to run out before the others come, you are in charge.\"   The whole place was beautiful and amazing. Every room was perfect for single friends, to my other sisters and my crazy, but loveable nephews. Mr. Loyd one of the owners was like a natural grandfather with letting the boys run around but also telling them to close the door to keep AC inside. Lol  My favorite spot was the court yard. It looks like something out of a movie. Plus when it rains you can sit and watch the rain hit the roof. It's so peaceful.   So on top of a friendly, welcoming, beautiful space to stay and socialize, they also cook breakfast. Let me tell you it was the best food I have ever had at a bed and breakfast place.   We could smell the bacon at 6 am. Yum yum   So hands down this is place to stay in Wimberly. Its walking distance of all the cool shops and places to eat in town."

(This was the biggest con) * When we placed the \"service our room\" card on our door, no one ever came to fix the bed or resupply fresh towels. We were gone for like the whole day, and no one came, so that wasn't nice * The water pressure in the shower was too hard * The bathroom floor would get soaking wet anytime we took a shower because the curtain wouldn't stay closed all the way to prevent the water from going outside the tub. * When they gave us the wifi password they spelled it with a capital T, but really it was all lowercase, so we had a hard time getting the WiFi to work until we called the front desk.   Pros: * it is within walking distance to all the little stores and Wimberley cafe. * the staff is friendly. * The price of the room is reasonable   They just need to fix all the cons listed, and I think they would have a fine place to stay. Very unique and quirky. Also, I do think it would be nice if they had cable television."

                "description": "Okay. We ended up in wimberley on the coldest days of the year for my wife's 50th birthday. We arrived on Thursday and joined by our two adult sons. We were lucky to have made reservations at the Square Inn.  This place is quaint and hip at the same time.  Our room/suite was large and clean and really comfy.  The staff and owners were great and accommodating. We had to leave early due to the weather so we really couldn't enjoy all of the amenities, but we r definitely going to return. The Square Inn is a great choice for being close to the Square. Lots of great places to walk to and enjoy. Can't wait to go back and we will absolutely b staying at the Square Inn. Thx for making our short stay so pleasurable."

I don't know which was better, the gracious hospitality of the owners' and their family or our very comfortable room. The breakfast, served from 0800-1000 is also awesome. We stayed in the \"Lauren\" room located by the back patio area. The entire establishment is quiet and clean and I loved having a mini fridge in the room. The Inn is centrally located and quaint shops and restaurants are right outside the door. We would definitely stay here again."

Excellent pricing, often lower than other BandB's in the area.  I stayed a night mid-week. If you want to stay over the weekend, make your reservations early. It often fills up on the weekend. My room was off the patio in the back, the patio was a nice place to relax."

Wonderful breakfast served every morning with plenty of shopping steps away. Our room was warm and quaint - bathrooms with recent update and decor.  We loved that the BandB had 24 hour come and go as you need as we were attending a wedding outside of town. Each room felt like it had it's own private oasis as it faced in to a beautiful courtyard area to sit and drink your morning coffee or a glass of wine. We can't wait to visit Wimberley again and stay at this adorable little BandB!"

All the details were great: towels were fresh and soft, wifi was fast, bed was comfortable, shampoo was even great!   But the location was amazing! Right on the square, so my wife and I literally walked almost everywhere! If we needed to refresh our drink, we simply walked back to the room. No problem!   Now the food. Breakfast is served daily and is delicious! In addition, they have a great selection of coffees, teas, and cocoas! Snacks like chips, pound cake, muffins, granola bars, microwave popcorn, etc. were available all day.   Can't say enough good things about this gem! Wouldn't change a thing!"

They took 20 mins to show up at the front desk when we arrived. they are charging us for damages they refuse to show us documents of. i went back and forth emailing the so called staff there and she told me she didn't have time for my problems. when I asked for her bosses number she gave me her fiances number. which, big surprise was no help because he would only side with her. he said hes the gm and theirs no higher position then him which is a lit because every gm has a boss and while we were there a lady was talking to them about things they needed changed who i'm assuming is Marcilia B. the owner. also the couple who runs the place was arguing so loud while we were there we could hear it from our room, when i went to see what was going on i saw her yelling at him.There was NEVER anyone at the front desk the whole time we were there and they lied about their medicine variety they claim to have. I'm pregnant and can only have Tylenol which the claimed they had in their \"large variety\" which only consisted of off brand aspirin. when i emailed them asking for documents all they did was argue with me (a customer) instead of trying to resolve the problem. I don't recommend  to anyone to stay here or waste your money because you will only get horrible service. DO NOT GO HERE WASTE OF MONEY."

They were extremely accommodating even though we could only spend one night when they normally have a two night minimum. The room was very spacious,  decorated perfectly and very clean. The inn was fully booked but you wouldn't even know it because it was so nice and quiet. We felt as though we had the whole place to ourselves. The owners are so very nice and informative. The inn is walking distance to many shops and dining options. We weren't able to stay for breakfast but it smelled delicious. We will definitely be going back!!"

                "description": "Myself and my fiancee recently visited Square Inn, and were very pleased with our stay.  The Lauren Room was clean, with warm, rustic interiors and a fabulously comfortable king-size bed.  The patio located just a few steps from our door was spacious; nice place to hang out before venturing to either Marco's Italian or Cypress Creek for dinner (both restaurants, by the way..  wonderful).  Square Inn is walking distance from some truly amazing dining, along with quaint knick knack shops (soaps, candy, etc.)-- not to mention you're swimming the Blanco, or tasting at Wimberley Valley Winery, in just a few minutes' drive.  Can't beat that.  Which reminds me: amenities included a big-screen t.v. in the common area, a decent library of DVD'S, an Xbox 360 game console with games, and complimentary wine in the afternoon and evenings.  Really, really nice being able to wind down for the night with a movie, and a glass or two from Duchman Winery.   Marci, our innkeeper at Square Inn, was very friendly, and courteous, even during a fluke front-door locking mechanism malfunction which resulted in our having to wake her up."

They were suppose to serve breakfast between 9-9:30 and it never got you'd until close to 10. The trash in our room was very taken out upon our arrival so our  bungalow smelled like somebody else's trash. We couldn't check in on time because they were short staffed even tho they told us we could the day before. One of our screens was falling off. We have extra pillows in closet but no extra pillows.  I swear our place was never actually cleaned between the people before us and us.   Serenity you looked so cute and wrap wanted to book our wedding there but you were just too dirty.  Hot tub had so many chemicals it took off my spray tan in less than 5 minutes. You couldn't sit in tub because you couldn't breathe with all the chemicals."

                "description": "To begin with the website is messed up and doesn't let you book reservations....  Next, the phone number listed is to an answering machine in which you have to leave a message and hope they call back.   Upon making the reservation I was assured everything was going to be great with my room and the special lovers cruise package I paid for.  On our way to the resort I called to inform them we were on the way and to ensure everything was good with our room.  I was assured by the staff that everything was in order with my room and the lovers cruise package.    Upon arrival we went to our room and not only was the lovers cruise package I paid extra for not set up but there was also animal feces on one of the rugs!  This naturally upset us to a large degree.  Here we are not two minutes into our stay and we have two major screw ups.   The next day I informed the staff that my wife and I would be gone for a certain time (I was specific about from when to when).  During the time when we were away I requested that they refresh/clean our room.  I was again assured it would be done with no problems.  Upon our return, of course, the room had not been touched.  When I went to the staff and complained they stated that they again were sorry for the failure and would rectify it quickly....  We had just a little time before our wine tour and needed back in our room to get ready.  So I politely went into the room and asked the maid how much longer she would need to finish our room.  The maid gave me attitude and disrespectfully said another five minutes.  Even after this insult I again was polite to the maid and thanked her for her efforts, she in turn ignored me.   This was a disaster of a three year anniversary celebration for me and my wife. I would give zero stars if I could.  For the amount of money I spent there, I expected far better customer service and professionalism.  I would certainly not recommend this place to anyone."

                "description": "We stayed in the White Buffalo Bungelow with hot tub. 6/28-6-30/19. Communication was difficult. They had to send 3 different sets of pictures to get them correct. We arrived at 10pm and there was no light on the 75 yard flagstone walk to our cabin. The place was nice but the exterior deck with hot tub had over grown weeds all near the outdoor seating and bugs were crawling everywhere. The next day Saturday, I asked if they could cut the weeds back, they said no. Can you imagine?!? We paid $67.00 for a $20 brunch voucher on Sunday which was a joke. Place needs updating and needs to be more accommodated to people arriving at night. Refused to negotiate a partial refund. So bad service gets bad reviews. No excuse. Poor management and ownership. They said my expectations were too high????!!! Make sure everything is right because it won't get fixed the next day. Avoid this place"

The staff is friendly and very helpful. The layout of the grounds is perfect - everything is nearby but still far enough away so it's quiet outside. We stayed in the Farmers Market, and it was absolutely adorable, cozy and comfortable. Each morning a delicious breakfast was delivered to our door, and when we were done all we had to do was put the tray outside and the staff discreetly came out to pick it up. The sunset views were spectacular, and watching the deer walk around during the evenings was the perfect way to end our day. We cannot wait to visit again!"

I would have given it a Ten but the property is about 8 miles outside of town where all the happenings are. If you love the country and rural areas then this is the place. The cottage was very nice and a huge heart shaped tub for 2 people but no shower. There is a bunch of cats on the premises and my saw a pregnant fox. Hey Welcome to Wimberley Texas."

                "description": "We had a wonderful stay at Serenity Farm House Inn! They were so kind and welcoming to us. We stayed in the bungalow named, \"Merci Mimi\". It is an \"upgraded\" one with a hot tub! The property is located off of the busy highways, so it is always peaceful and relaxing out there!   When we arrived we were able to park near the cluster of bungalows and were welcomed with some fresh sangria wine! The hot tub was already up and running for us and they had a few coupons for certain shops/restaurants around the town for us!   As we explored around the grounds, we found they have a pen of a few rescue animals like donkeys, goats, and pigs which was a unique touch. The pool was also located near the houses and was small but had a beautiful view (as seen in pictures).   The houses were very nice and well kept. They had plenty of towels, kitchen supplies (everything you would need to cook), the kitchen appliances were in great shape and worked great! One thing we had some issues with is the ac unit, there was one in the bedroom, which I liked, and one in the living/kitchen area. They were just kind of complicated to use, we sat up late one night, with the handy manual they had laminated for us, trying to get it to keep the fan on while we slept. What I would suggest is having a ceiling fan in the bedroom or at least an easy setting on the ac to turn the fan on. We also were constantly adjusting the ac, it seemed like it would get really hot and then really cold. We also tested out the hot tub, it was really nice, but we couldn't go out there at night because there was hardly any lights out there. I also wish the hot tubs were a little more private, the house's windows next to us looked right down into our hot tub and people using the walk way by our bungalow could see straight into where the hot tub was. I noticed most of the other houses with hot tubs were more \"private\" than ours so it may just be the way the houses are laid out.   They also brought us delicious breakfast every morning complimentary! It was so good and fresh! So much better than any complimentary breakfast at regular hotels!   Overall it was a great stay and we will definitely want to come back in the future!"

We remarked every day on how quiet the place is although there were many other guests staying there at the same time. The drive to the inn is remote but it will be worth your while. Each morning we were greeted with eggs, bacon or sausage and bakery (I requested gluten free and was accommodated easily). We had champagne and chocolates in our room upon arrival. We couldn't have asked for a more perfect place to spend a week just to relax and get out of town."

                "description": "Nice stay, but could be improved.  We stayed 2 nights at the Rocky Creek Retreat in the resort village area, full price and not from a Groupon deal.   The grounds were nice and well maintained with cute decor.  The hot tub was clean and the cover looked brand new.  As we left Monday, I heard them cleaning other hot tubs.  We enjoyed our 2 kitty visitors that hung out and 'talked' to us.  We saw deer, a tarantula, and a fox roaming the property in the evening.  Lots of butterflies and birds, and wasps.  Breakfast was served promptly at 9:30 each morning, and it was divine.  Sunday we had chocolate covered strawberries atop a small bowl of fruit, with champagne and glasses of orange juice, a boiled egg, a cinnamon roll which I believe was made from croissant dough, and bacon.  Monday we had cheddar scrambled eggs, sausage links,  a blueberry lemon pound cake slice, peach jam, biscuits, and orange juice.  I wish it were served earlier, but we were aware of that at the time of booking.  Be forewarned - the roads that lead throughout the bandb are very rough with significant bumps and deep gouges for small cars, so drive slowly.  Another note on the vehicular aspect - you are not able to park directly in front of this particular cottage.  There is an area for you to park, then walk to your cottage. When lugging heavy luggage and in warm weather, it is a bit of a chore.  When we arrived and I mentioned this, the lady who greeted us offered to use her golf cart to tote our bags for us to our cottage, which was very kind.  The bungalows are pretty close together.  We arrived about 10 minutes before check in time, and our bungalow was still in the process of being cleaned, which was expected to take 30-45 minutes.  She offered us complimentary drinks and coupons to various restaurants in town if we would have liked to start there versus waiting, but having all of our things in the vehicle, we chose to wait for it to be cleaned.  It took only 30 minutes, and she prepared a fruit and cheese plate for us since we had to wait.  The very first thing I noticed about the bungalow was that it was very clean, from top to bottom.  The bathroom towels were clean, soft and thick.  Another thing, which I didn't think to ask about, was whether or not they stopped in while we were out to refresh towel supplies.  They didn't, and we used 3 towels on the first night, leaving us with 1 bath towel.  No fault on the bandb's part.  I wasn't going to call late in the evening for 1 bath towel when we'd already brought 4 of our own beach towels.  We had 2 a/c units, one in the kitchen area and one in the bedroom.  They got cold and stayed cold quickly.  The floorplan and furniture set up were odd and not necessarily conducive to what you would use a particular room for.  The TV was was mounted to a wall, that would you could a) watch from one wicker chair or b) watch with your head sideways from the couch.  In the bedroom, there was in fact a queen size bed as stated.  Unfortunately, it was set up sideways in order to make it fit in the bedroom.  Instead of sleeping with our heads against a headboard, we slept with our heads against a wall.  There were not blinds on the back door leading out from the bedroom, just a gauzy curtain.  No shielding from the morning sun.  There was little storage for our things - we had expected a dresser at least.  There was one tiny closet, from which we were able to hang some of our clothes, but it was stuffed with about 5 huge pillows on the raised part where you might set a bag or something.  Ultimately, we dug clothes and things from our bags daily rather than being able to stow them in a dresser.  When we booked, we were told that the grotto like setting of the hot tub was private.  Our 'grotto' was easily viewable from the two neighboring cottages.  Private in my mind means not in plain view - it should be described as personal hot tub, not private.  There needs to be some wasp patrol - we had an active wasp's nest on our back patio, so enjoying the back patio was a no go.  One of the back deck chairs was missing a cushion, and some old fencing like material was just laid against the back deck.  One of the cabinets had a window drape just randomly thrown in.  The shower door was completely off its railings. It has been this way awhile, as the linoleum is starting to pull away from the shower wall due to the long term leaking water.  Also missing were smoke detectors.  There were outlets, but no smoke detectors. There were 5 missing vertical slats from the sliding doors, which 1 or so would be okay, but that was a bit much.  The kitchen window was cracked as well. The lack of storage, odd layout and the lack of maintenance on some things detracted from our stay.  Overall, our stay at Serenity Farmhouse Inn was okay, but we intend to try elsewhere for the amount of money that we paid.  I hope that their maintenance improves as it is obvious that they put a lot into getting the cottage built and decorated."

They informed us that the White Buffalo Bungalow was ready and we would be able to get settled in before leaving for the wine tour.   White Buffalo Bungalow was just breath taking from the private drive to the private jacuzzi.  The room has a full kitchen and had a bottle of welcome sangria to begin the pregaming before the wince tour.  The shower was amazing and the soaps, shampoo/conditioner smelled so good!   This was a Wednesday so we were lucky to be on the wine tour with only one other couple.  Jodi is such a pleasant and inviting soul. She got asked about each person's preferences as to be able to personalize the tour and pick which wineries she decided to take us too.  Jodi is so knowledgeable of the town and the wineries.  The lunch she provides is just amazing.   The pool area is so nice and calming.  Again it was the middle of the week and we had the pool to ourselves which was great.  Breakfast is brought to our room by about 9:45 each morning and was so good. (We were the last delivery.)  I was able to walk around the property 1  1/2 times and get a mile in each morning.   If you are not wanting to leave the property stop by HEB and pick up food to prepare in the room.  This was such a wonderful  experience I am already planning to go back next year."

I really appreciate all of the attention to detail in the beautiful antique linens, fresh flowers, pillows, seating areas, bath tray etc. I could go on an on. It was a beautiful and relaxing retreat. It was in a wonderful central location for day trips to State Parks, great Texas BBQ, cute little towns and wonderful back roads. The view from the pool is spectacular. Nothing quite like a Hill Country sunset or sunrise either.   We really enjoyed the big Jacuzzi tub. It would have been nice to have a shower for quick mornings, but we made do. When the neighbors used theirs, their jets were so loud we could hear them. We could also hear the man's booming voice at times.   Their breakfast was amazing and presented in such a lovely way. I wish we could have gotten it a little earlier. I think 930 is probably perfect for a leisurely vacation where you sleep in, but we were up and hitting the roads early. We did wait around for it one day and I am so glad we did."

                "description": "How have I not reviewed the kind people at this wonderful establishment yet?  I so enjoy the the solace of their old farmhouse venue. And the great ciders they serve up certainly do not hurt the wallet or the ambience.  It's so relaxing sitting at the picnic tables out among the oaks listening to your favorite band. Strategically placed fans hidden among the trees aid in making the glade that doubles as a stage tolerable even on 90º days.  In these seemingly never-ending days of the pandemic, it's also refreshing to see the servers masking up indoors and out. I tend not to venture out too much for exactly that reason, but felt totally safe here even when ordering inside the tap room.  Maybe I should keep it a secret, but it's also one of those places you want to share exactly because it is so very special."

                "description": "Wonderful place! We went on a recommendation while we visited family. The ciders were great, as was the food. The only issue we ran into was that we ordered hummus, and the person taking our order didn't let us know that it didn't come with bread or anything else to eat it with. Considering we had just had a conversation with her about it being our first time there, we're about to present she didn't let us know that important bit of info. Not a big deal, and the person who brought us our food outside asked if we had ordered anything to eat it with and quickly brought us an order of a baguette.  Aside from the establishment itself, the vendors selling goods were all friendly and talented, and the other patrons of the establishment were friendly as well. We struck up several conversations with passers-by.  I would definitely go back!"

They often have wonderful live music and their drinks are absolutely perfect for a Texas summer. They are so refreshing. We got one of the picnic baskets and it was full of yummy cheese, sliced meats and bread. Highly recommend!  It is worth noting, they do not have a full lunch/dinner menu. They basically have an assortment of DIY charcuterie boards, which we really enjoyed. However, if you go expecting a full dinner you may be disappointed."

                "description": "I have been a long time fan of Texas Keeper Cider. I love the Tap Room, the grounds, the staff and especially the cider. The cider is dry and they make a wide variety of ciders to appeal to many palates.  They have successfully reopened the Tap Room and I decided to have my belated retirement party there. I was able to reserve a space for my large group and the staff was very attentive. If I had one criticism, it would be their food choices.  It's now a make your own picnic, and you choose cheeses, meats, and sides. It's not really a charcuterie tray, as they don't prep the plate.  The cheeses,  meats and bread all need to be sliced.  This made eating difficult with a large group. Most of my guests had to leave early so they could go eat somewhere else.  I know this new menu makes it easier for the staff, and they are a cidery, not a restaurant, but I miss their old menu.  I will still go to Texas Keeper Cider, but may not hang out as long.  (Or make sure I eat beforehand!) Overall, it's a beautiful South Austin gem."

                "description": "The ciders are essentially tribute to the apple gods, extremely generously priced, and the cidery is tucked away--makes for a great escape from the city of Austin!  Came on a rainy day with some girlfriends after dinner, and we LOVED it. It reminded me of Jester King Brewery because of the fact that it felt very off-road and secluded. If you're driving at night and a little too fast you might miss the entrance, so slow down as your GPS tells you you're near. The stone cobble walkway is so organic and lovely, that it felt like we were entering into a storytale cottage. Upon entering, everything screams wood and warm pinterest vibes. The three of us sat down at their tall barstool table, and started on our flight! What prices! Normally they do 5 for $9, but they tapped out of one of the selections so we did 4 for $7! Such a great price for the variety of ciders. I loved their hefeweizen + cider combo, and the first cider on their flight list (a name I forgot). Everything was so juicy and tasty, would highly recommend coming back.   The staff is very knowledgeable, and the lady doing the taptending that night was so sweet and helpful. She trusted that we knew which selection we were on during our flight. She also told us that there are five cideries in all of Austin! So for my cider lovers--let's hit all of them up."

                "description": "I don't know why it took me so long to get here but now that I've been, I'll be telling everyone about it and making return trips! If you're a fan of Argus Cidery, you'll like this place. I do think Texas Cider Keeper is making cleaner ciders than Argus (nothing was infected or had off-flavors).   It's easy to miss the entrance, but it's right next to the cemetery! The outdoor space is very quaint but all Texas and has tons of picnic tables. The tasting room is beautiful with butcher block tables and plenty of seating.   We opted for the tasting flight menu which is five 2 oz. pours for $9. Their mainstay Texas Keeper Cider No.1 is dry, refreshing and well balanced. I'm not a fan of sweet ciders, so this was perfect.  I also really liked their Grafter Rose -- which is made with Rome apples and some grapes, which gives it the beautiful rose hue. It's also on the drier side, which is nice.   Our least fave of the five had to be the Cider Weizen, which had a bit too much coriander (and this is coming from a girl who LOVES coriander and hefeweizen beers).   The bartenders were all knowledgeable and really try to give you an explanation of each cider they're pouring (a la a wine tasting).   They also have a tempranillo wine on tap because in Texas it all falls under a \"fruit fermentation\" permit. Apples, wines, it's all the same permit.   I'll be making it a point to come here more often, and I would if traffic getting through downtown and south Austin traffic weren't so bad."

                "description": "My new favorite place in Austin. Love everything about it.  It's basically the only Place I ever want to be. If you haven't been yet- get on the ball!  The cider is so delicious - nothing is overly sweet and they have a good assortment of dry and well-balanced choices. Their sampler is 9$ for 5 generous pours and is a great way to find the cider you like most. For us it's the rose, but the original is a close second. Your best bet is to purchase a bottle and drink affordably. You even get a discount when you purchase bottles to go (although I'm not sure if that's just at the end of the night - we've closed this place down a few times).   We are also big fans of the food. The carrots in a blanket are so yummy and very unique! A must-have. The curried egg salad is a go-to as well. It's made with eggs from their own chickens! They also add pickled veggies on the side which is always a win for me.   The location is so spacious and beautiful. Plenary of tables inside and out. Even a great view from one side where you can watch the sunset over the trees. I've enjoyed live music there and loved the tunes they were playing inside."

                "description": "One year later I returned for their 1st Anniversary Party and release of The Grafter Blanc.  For $9.50 (w/fees) your ticket included your admission and 10 oz tulip glass (not the standard 12 oz tulip most breweries sell for $5-6). There were no drink tickets included; all cider and other offerings were for purchase only.  Certainly not the best deal in town....a town full of breweries with taproom festivities.  The Grafter Blanc is definitely my favorite of their ciders, with the perfect balance of acidity, tartness and dryness."

                "description": "Wow! So before coming here I always assumed ciders as overly sweet and flavored froo-froo drinks for those who don't like beer. I have never felt so mislead before! Cider is made from apples (no matter what the flavor), and real, legit cider is found here! It isn't overly sweet and there are many different kinds! Some reminded me of wine and a not-so-Sweet cider mixed together.  At Texas Keep there is room to bring a large group, or even the dogs or kids to run around. There is a small indoor area with games and a huge outdoor area with room to move about and enjoy the Texas sun (or stars).  The people here really enjoy and are PROUD of what they do. They are excited to tell you the story behind the names of the ciders and what they entail. They have seasonals and guest bottles and taps. Normally I would feel gross trying something out of a bottle opposed to tap, but the whole experience was so eye-opening, I didn't care. They told me their 1 bottle of (maybe a 750ml cider) has about 10mg of sugar in it as opposed to he \"cider\" I knew such as Angry Orchard that has upwards of 50mg PER BOTTLE! Yowza- no wonder they were too sweet!  I was definitely iffy about coming here since they didn't serve \"regular beer\", but I'm definitely glad I stepped out of my comfort zone- and you should, too!  Only reason it's not 5 stars- the food \"truck\" setup (not a truck just a station) was out of food by 6:30p on a Saturday night. We had ordered 1 of the 4 items on the menu for our group to try. When we went back to order our favorites, they claimed they were out of everything and turned around and took 1 more order. Annoying. So we ordered a pizza and left early to meet the delivery man at home. Maybe have more food or more options and we would've stayed until the 9p close."

We've been here during all seasons of the year and the property is always gorgeous and inviting. Staff is so knowledgeable and helpful. The kitchen is Now built in to the main tasting room.

We brought our dog too but he could not go inside which was challenging even for ordering. Our favorite cider is the No. 1! There was an event going on that sounded fun so we will definitely check out those options. We did not order food, just did a shared tasting. No one came outside to check on us or offer to pour and tell us about the cider which is common when visiting wineries with our dog and friends. It's a cute little spot for a weekend drive."

                "description": "I've been here four times and will keep coming back. The location itself is beautiful - plenty of outdoor space surrounded by forest and a valley. The ciders are so much better than what you find in the beer aisle at the grocery store, and they have a surprisingly large selection. During the week, this is a great place for a quiet, relaxing evening. During the weekends, especially when they are hosting a festival or band, it's a different atmosphere (but still great) - lively and fun, a good place for friends to hang out if they're tired of the usual bar scene.  The only negative preventing Texas Keeper from five stars is the new food menu. While the ciders are fairly priced, the food is anything but. We ordered a cheese and meat tray for $20 and got a platter with barely enough for one person. When we asked for more crackers, they charged us $2 more. Hopefully, this new menu is still a work in progress and they will make adjustments until it is reasonable."

                "description": "Stopped by this charming wine shop for the first time, and absolutely loved it! First of all super pet friendly, so we were off to a great start. I'm not too familiar with wine, so Nancy made a fabulous suggestion. The sparkling wine Naveran hit the spot!   The ambiance is chill, so you want to stay awhile. She has beautiful local art decorating the indoors and plenty of outdoor seating. There is also lovely music playing in the background, and just a friendly place! Will definitely make it a must visit spot on trips to Wimberley!"

                "description": "I picked this place at random when my friend and I decided to meet up near Wimberley. It had good ratings and it looked nice. It turned out to be the best decision; there was a huge event (and beautiful weather) so the heart of Wimberley was PACKED. This place is a bit outside of the main part of town and had plenty of parking, and the best part was it was not crowded. :) They've got minimal seating inside, but plenty of outdoor seating. They also have a nice selection of both beer and wine, plus some yummy snacks (like edamame and hummus!). My friend and I both opted for the wine flight: 4 tasters of wine ranging from red to white to bubbly, all great, and the staff was attentive and ready with the next pour in order to keep the cold ones cold. We had a lovely experience. I definitely recommend if you're near the area!"

This little house is full of rooms and nooks that give it a very intimate feel where you and your friends and family can congregate and feel at home. The bar is loaded full of wines and the staff here isn't shy in regards to providing you with samples and information on each of them.  I don't know very much about wine, but was able to follow along and still get an enjoyable experience out of what they had to offer here. We came on a Sunday afternoon so you know I had to try the mimosa out. Crisp, clean, and refreshing!  Be prepared to shell out some $$ as this place isn't the cheapest option, but you do get a high quality and a large amount of variety which is hard to find in Texas.  Support this local business and lets keep their doors open! Spots like this are hard to come by."

Today I did wine tasting for six dollars a for several wine tastings plus you get a cute small wine glass for free. Delightful place to take your spouse or date.  The host is very smart about the wines they sell here and enjoyed the smooth wines tastings I received. It located downtown Wimberly so you can't miss it. I certainly will visit again soon. It does cost a few dollars more but worth the fun you have visiting such a cute cosy wine store. So stop in and see what I mean .....happy wine hunting!!!"

Jason did an excellent job of showing us around the distillery, while providing great details of the distilling process. While Still Austin knows it isn't a mega distillery, it embraces that and makes the tour and experience feel personalized. We were able to sample several different whiskeys and one gin, and we even sampled a few unreleased items, which were all very good. My wife and I would recommend this tour to everyone. Thanks Still Austin for a great experience!"

Our tour guide was incredibly knowledgeable and was able to answer all our questions. I felt like I got a lot out of the tour and now have a basic grasp of how whiskey is made.   The distillery is pretty small and they currently sell bourbon and gin as their bread and butter, both of which you'll get to sample at the end of the tour. Highly recommended to check it out as it's just a fun atmosphere."

When we arrived, the place didn't have electricity or AC due to an electrical issue in the area.   Rather than cancel, they treated us to some complementary drinks to make up for the electrical and AC issue.   The staff was very friendly, professional, and turned a bad situation into a very fun and amazing time. Couldn't have imagined it being any better!   The guide was very knowledgeable, the tour was insightful, and the tasting at the end was great! Go support this local Austin business!"

Got an old fashioned for 6 bucks so that was a solid deal. Didn't get any good but it looked like a bunch of fried options which my friends seemed to enjoy. It was about 60% full on a Sunday afternoon. I will say that the music was way too loud during the bingo so that made it hard to talk. Outside of bingo, the volume was fine. Overall I'd recommend it. If not, St Elmo brewing is next door."

There is a great open patio area that shares space with a food truck and the Bearded Bread Company, but the winds were blowing like crazy and the temps were too cold to be outside long. Definitely try this place!  And then explore other spots in the same Industrial Park!  The artwork on the buildings is also great to tour on its own."

I'm a tequila girl so I wasn't too eager to learn how gin and bourbon are made, but she really had my attention the entire time!   We were in a group of 10 which was just right. Everyone could get a few questions in if they wanted...laid back...chill...ITS AUSTIN!  Now, to the best part....and boy I was a bit disappointed. I've been on several tours in distilleries and the tasting at the end could get you about 2 shots away from tipsy. Typically there are about 4 samples....1.5-2 ounces each.....  Here....there were 2 samples with 1.5 ounces TOTAL!  I know all they do is gin and bourbon but can a SISTA have a bit more?! The tour is around $15pp, but I'd be happy to pay the standard $30-$40 for a tad bit more licka.    The gin and bourbon are still yummy!  Get a cocktail.....The old fashioned will have you stumbling!"

They don't have tasting flights, but they do have an option to order a taste of any of their liquors for $2 each. That's not bad at all. We were able to taste the whiskey and gin. The two year whiskey was the winner. I did see some yummy cocktails that I would love to try in the near future.   They have inside and outside seating. The outside patio has a cover for shade, but you do have areas where you can get sun   There's a food truck on site.   Parking is available on site, but shared with the other businesses. For those that want to make an afternoon or day out of your visit, the other businesses are all drink or food related."

However our experience today was really disappointing and it was simply based of the service provided. I wish I got the gentleman's name because he was awesome and his drinks were well balanced. There was a female bartender who made the drinks extremely sweet and when we asked to have them remade, she was extremely rude and confrontational in her demeanor. The other male bartender took it upon himself to remake our drinks and when he tasted what she had served us, he also agreed with the taste being off. Kindness goes a long way and I wish she adopted a more graceful attitude."

My parents were staying at the cabins at onion creek right behind this place and when we stopped I saw a dog inside so I called my parents and said meet us up here and told my husband whoa we gotta pet that dog!  I enjoyed the bead as I had never had it before and loved the inside decor and how the place is set up.  Cozy if you want it, outside on the patio ( not for us since it was raining) up at the bar or in large tables.  If you're in the area its definitely a must."

We met beforehand to plan where to place the food, decorations, and talk about special drink offerings. The staff was super friendly, went out of their way to make us feel welcome, and made it a very special night. We had a party of about 25 and the space was perfect!

Beer, wine and mead only in a warm industrial space. The service was very accommodating, however not as knowledgeable as I had hoped, given the selection and the many questions several of us had as we tried mead for the first time. Prices seem to be a bit high considering we aren't in downtown, but it's a place we'll visit again."

                "description": "Hill Country Tasting Room is a wonderful find - I strongly recommend it! We rented out the entire venue for our rehearsal dinner, and it was absolutely perfect. We had ~50 people with an outside catered buffet dinner, and the venue was the perfect size - it still felt intimate during the speeches, but there was enough room for everyone to sit, eat, and mingle. The layout worked really well for us - for dinner, people could sit and eat on both the ground floor and mezzanine, and for speeches people mingled on the ground floor while the speeches were held on the landing. We love the atmosphere there - a combination of industrial, rustic, and chic that totally matched the vibe we were going for!  Planning was a breeze too - first Lindsey and then Deepa were both so accommodating and answered all our questions. Especially compared to some of the other venues I was talking to, Hill Country Tasting Room responded so quickly, kindly, and didn't mind when I asked a bunch of questions! I would definitely recommend them for hosting an event.  The drinks themselves were also amazing. We loved that it was all Texas beverages, and there were so many options! We were so glad to find a place that offered such a wide variety.  On the actual night of the rehearsal dinner, the bartenders were so helpful - I even got comments back from a couple of guests stating how nice they were! I can't wait until our next visit to the Dripping Springs area - we are definitely going back!"

The staff were very friendly and knowledgeable about the selections they were carrying and they were able to make great recommendations based on our tastes. They have reasonable prices, they were in line with the other tasting rooms we had visited during the day. Their concept was awesome! Their selection is from local craft breweries and wineries and rotates between different companies. They also had the beverages available to take home if you found one, or more, you enjoyed."

                "description": "Two friends and I went to Driftwood Tasting Room and asked to do a wine tasting. The only employee there, Antonio, said the tasting would be $8 for four tastings. The menu had a long list of beer, mead, and cider as well as wine. We asked if we could mix and match the tastings between these drinks, and the employee said yes. We then asked, several times, if this would still be $8 for the tasting. He again said yes. When we went to pay, we discovered that our bill came out to more than twice that amount. Apparently, the tasting was not $8. He told my friends that we received full pours, and that's why it was more. Here's the thing, WE DIDNT ASK FOR FULL POURS; we asked for a tasting. The employee took it upon himself to give us the full pours, which we did not ask for and shouldn't have had to pay for. We left upset and confused as to what happened. One of my friends went back into the establishment to discuss a refund. We didn't want to all three go in and cause a scene, since the man was kind to us, we just wanted to remedy the situation. Apparently, he reexplained the full pours THAT WE DIDNT ASK FOR and then offered my friend $10 out of his pocket. She felt guilty about this and didn't ask for compensation for the other two of us that did a tasting. I repeat, tasting and not full pour. I'm not sure why he would offer us his own money instead of trying to correct the problem initially. Maybe he knew he was wrong? Or maybe he just wanted us to go away and not complain? I really don't know why he would do that. We discussed it more and felt upset about the whole situation and how it was awkwardly handled. It was a damper on what was supposed to be a nice day out. I decided to contact management through the Driftwood Tasting Room's Facebook page the next day to see if we could be fully refunded for the employee's mistake. I explained everything to the manager, Lindsey Pierce, who, of course defended the employee. I understand this, and I have nothing against the employee, but a mistake was made and I wanted it corrected. I didn't mention the $10, since it went to my friend who spoke to the employee. Apparently, this gave the manager reason to believe that I was lying. She said that my friends could contact her for a refund and I could get one after I returned the $10 cash, which I didn't even get, but ok. I mentioned how she was treating me like I was lying and like I was a criminal for complaining about what happened. Lindsey Pierce then THREATENED to take me to SMALL CLAIMS COURT for SLANDER for writing this negative review. All I tried to do was express my dissatisfaction and try to get a refund, and the manager treated me so impolitely and with such disrespect. I would never want to go to a place where the management treats a customer so rudely. There are better places down the road where the servers charge you what you expect to be charged and the managers are polite and genuinely care about your experience at the winery. I'd avoid this place at all costs simply because of how the management treated me when I tried to explain what happened."

                "description": "This place is a hidden gem and definitely a much needed place for the growing area. It has huge potential and I hope they get enough business to stay in business! I live nearby and it's a nice place to grab a drink. Beautiful interior! The glasses of wine were a little pricey compared to the nearby vineyards but everything else seemed reasonable. The guy serving my friend and I was super friendly and helpful I hope they continue to have great service. The only things I would recommend would be to maybe add a couple TVs without sound on to keep some of the guys happy should there be UT games or golf on. The bar is a beautiful spot to hang out. I'd also recommend having some nice big glass jars with some pub mix or nuts in that folks could purchase by the scoop and maybe even a cheese/meat plate or some olives. It's a great hidden gem for us who live nearby to be able to have an upscale bar with great local beer and wines. And sometimes someone in a group doesn't want wine so it's nice to have the options! Something for everyone. Hopefully eventually a food truck or some dinner pairing event would be fun. I have seen some really cool events advertised on fb but haven't had a Chance to make it in to one yet. I will add as I have two kids I wouldn't recommend this a place for kids as there isn't really an outdoor space. A great date spot or place to meet friends for a small birthday. Bonus would be to add a happy hour or special pricing for driftwood locals!!"

Very reasonable tasting price at$7 for 6 wines. You can order the dry red flight, the white flight or the sweet flight. Most all the wines from the Escondido Valley in west Texas. This is were most of the grapes are grown in Texas anyway although not widely publicized. Lost Draw Cellars and William-Chris are two of our favorites. Really enjoyed both the red and white flights. The sweet flight is VERY sweet and all about fruit. One exception is the Choco-wine. Sounds really awful- chocolate wine!? I am NOT a sweet eater and don't really like chocolate but this is a perfect combination similar to non-dairy Baileys.   So enjoyed the owner-host that helped navigate the wine. Super personable and great to talk to. We'll return here again!"

                "description": "This little shop offers tastings from various Texas and other wineries, organized by a preset menu of either whites, dry reds, or sweet wines. You pay $7 for an etched glass promoting Wimberley as a Little Taste of Heaven (well, why not?), and that includes the tasting of all the wines from the menu of your choice.  There's room for about 6 or 7 people at a time to belly up to the antique bar (standing room only), and the sommelier/host pours for each group separately, explaining each wine and its history as he/she goes.   The afternoon my friend and I were there, we both tried the dry reds, and our host was knowledgeable and entertaining. There was not a bad wine in the bunch, although we each had our separate favorites. A lot of these wines are served by the glass or bottle in the local and regional restaurants, and you can buy them here more reasonably (about $22-36/bottle for the reds we tried) without having to visit each winery. They also have an entire wall of wine-related gift items and cute bar accouterments.  Definitely a place to put on your list to stop by during an afternoon of shopping in Wimberley. Be aware that like most of the shops, they close up for the day at 5PM."

                "description": "The old bar is beautiful and from an old Willie Nelson movie, \"Red Headed Stranger.\" Their \"dry\" red wines were not dry. They were all very fruit forward compared to the traditional tasting notes of the types they are serving. It's a cheap tasting at $7, and comes with a glass that is etched with \"taste of heaven\" and Wimberley on it.  Now, it's more of a shop, than a winery. So, don't expect to have a few glasses, sit down, or to use a restroom. The girl that was waiting on us was very young and knew very little about wine, and seemed to care very little. That's not the best wine experience! If I came back, it would be to show my boyfriend the bar. Overall, the wine was mediocre! So, it's kind of a one time thing!"

William Chris is my go-to when stopping in. The Rodeo Red Malbec and Choco Noir are also hard to beat. Happy tasting!!!"

Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of great wineries and vineyards in the vicinity but Hill Country definitely finds the best. Stop in for a casual quick tasting and be sure to get a few bottles of your favorites. You won't tend to find these in the grocery store!"

                "description": "Take a break from shopping and enjoy some of our Texas wines. This tasting room offers several wines from around Texas. They do have a set list. You can only choose from reds, whites or sweets. The tasting comes with a free glass. It's a cute souvenir. The lady serving us that day was very knowledgeable and even gave us a history of each wine and winery with each pour. The tasting room is small and can get crowded. There's no sitting, but it's not a bother. They do sell some cute wine associated items. I ended up leaving with wine and extras. I can see myself going back when in Wimberley."

                "description": "I was not impressed at all by the wine tasting here. I would recommend this place for the wine merchandise over the wine tasting/ wines. (I purchased a candle). It is a very small place with a bar that has no seating. They hand you a menu with with 3 lists of wine (Red, White andSweet) and tell you to pick one and they go down the list and give you a sample of each one off the list you chose. There was only 1 gentleman working at the time we myself and 2 friends went and he was too busy to even acknowledge us. We waited while he finished up with other customers then started the tasting. The man told us what we were drinking, which we read from the list, but other than that, seemed to have no other wine knowledge. A few times he told us about the wine maker who was featured in a magazine, or gave us facts about the prizes a wine had won, but no true wine knowledge about what we were drinking. I had to even ask for water to rinse my glass between tastings. He was just pouring wine after wine in my friends' glasses, even a white after a red! This was the strangest wine tasting I have ever done and to be honest, not something I would ever pay for. We had a gift certificate for a free tasting.   Bottom line, if you know anything about wine, I don't recommend it. If not, and you're just looking for a casual experience with a little wine involved, go for it."

However, when the owner is there, she is rude, condescending, and cheap.  Pours a few drops in a tiny cup.  I won't buy anything from her. ...and if she continues with that poor service, I won't ever go back.    So, let's see???  Act friendly and let people actually taste the wine...you get business. You act rude and give people cheap service ---- no business.  It is shocking to me that people have such poor business sense - especially in this economy."

                "description": "We regularly go wine tasting here.  They only stock wines from Texas wineries that make batches too small to distribute to stores, plus one red and one white wine from Italy for the Italian restaurant goers across the street.  It's like visiting half a dozen wineries in one stop.  The wine lists change minimally throughout the year, though, and sometimes they can't get a particular winery's top products (ex. Sistercreek won't sell them their best blends).  Wine tasting is $7 per wine list (red, white or sweet), and each list includes ~8 wines.  Purchase 3 bottles and the tasting is free.  Purchase 6 bottles and 1 tasting is free + 10% off.  My husband and I usually taste both the red and white lists and walk away with 3-4 bottles of wine.  Each bottle is only a few dollars more than if bought at the wineries.  If you want to taste more than 1-2 types of wine, please be respectful and purchase a wine tasting.  They get a lot of foot traffic and can't give all their wine away."

                "description": "Stopped by, last night.  The woman I was with asked for a sample of the Christmas Wine and was given a plastic goblet that held about an ounce, or more, of wine.  She ended up buying a bottle.  I asked about the blueberry wine and was asked if I'd like a sample.  I was given an ultra-mini, paper souffle cup to drink from.  I then asked for a sample of the mead.  Again, I got a mini-cup and, inexplicably, an extremely rude, \"That's the last sample I can give you\" from the owner.  Keep in mind that my friend got a sample, in a plastic goblet, that was five times the amount I received in the paper mini-cup.  She also bought a friggin' bottle of wine.  There was no excuse, ZERO, for the owner's rude way of treating me.  As I sipped the mead, groups of women came in and the owner was all over herself to serve them and strike up animated conversation.  I was amazed and angry.  Maybe there's more, here, than meets the eye, but that's not the point.  I should have been treated as well as the women customers.  I certainly wasn't.  I will never go back to this place.  You can count on that.  The reason I gave the two stars:  The owner was extremely knowledgeable about wines.  She did give me good information about sulfite content of the sweeter wines, comparing sulfite addition in wine to oatmeal addition in meatloaf.  Mitigating factor?: She did tell my friend that her store had been flooded by a broken refrigerator while she was visiting her husband in another state.  She struggled to reopen her store once she got back to town, just a day ago. Even so, her rude behavior cannot be excused.  FWIW, my friend told me that if this woman had responded to me, in the manner she did, before she, my friend, had purchased the bottle of Christmas Wine, she would not have completed the purchase."

                "description": "This was my first, and sad to say, my last time doing this festival. A friend who had been a few times before highly recommended it and when I balked at the $40 (plus a $3.50 processing fee) \"pre-event discount price\" with the at the door price being $50, he assured me it was well worth it because there were so many great food and wine vendors, you get your money's worth.  This was absolutely NOT the case! Firstly, this whole thing just seemed disorganized at best and I am sorry, but for $50 ($40) they could have gotten a much nicer location than a dusty, stiflingly hot cattle stockyard!   As for what you get for $40, 6 drink tickets and 10 food tickets when drinks and food run you anywhere from 1 ticket for a meager barely 1oz pour for most of the wines to several tickets for very small portions of the food, you barely get $10 worth of food and drink! You can purchase ticket for $1 a piece, which is most definitely not worth the portions or pours you receive.   As for the vendors/vintners at the festival, there were not nearly as many as you would expect for the price point and the layout was just haphazard. Also, there were several vendors that were out of food by the time we got there just after 2pm...the \"festival\" was supposed to go until 6pm...so how the heck were vendors running out of things w/4hrs left!?!   The only highlight, for me at least, was the grape stomp, but even then, they ran out of tshirts to \"stamp\" with your grape-soaked footprints.   In any case, my $43.50 would have been better spent and enjoyed at an actual local restaurant where I could have gotten multiple full pours of wine and actual food instead of leaving this joke of a festival hungry, overheated, more sober than when I arrived, and feeling like I had just been scammed somehow. Lesson. Learned.   I am honestly shocked this \"festival\" has lasted 10yrs let alone one!"

                "description": "I had a lovely time as the guest of a coworker. However, I felt like the overall value wasn't quite there for this event. Drink and food tickets went way too fast when some places asked for multiple tickets for less than an ounce of wine or a small sample of food. The actual value was about $1 per ticket. There were also some vendors that were somewhat rude or rushing. The whole point is to get business by having people try your product, right? Well there's some wineries I'd think twice about giving my money to after their lack of friendliness.   The options for food was more limited than I expected and many ran out of food even though we got there just an hour after the event started. There are lots of raffles going on and free koozies and pens galore. The arena was stuffy inside and though fresh near the doors you ran the risk of also eating dirt.   The music was good but there needed to be more sitting areas to relax and open a bottle of wine. I will definitely go back next year, but I do hope to see more offerings."

                "description": "This was by far the most awful \"festival\" I have ever had the misfortune of wasting money on.   First of all, in 2012 it was held at the Texas Hill Country Olive Company. So all advertisements this year were of a gorgeous event at this lovely vineyard - The photos were of a classy event, surrounded by olive trees and rolling hills, adorable art booths scattered about the lovely property, smiling faces holding wine glasses. I was so excited based on what I was reading of the Olive Company event that I had my mother travel up 3 hours on the morning of Saturday the 14th to accompany me. Then I convinced another girlfriend of mine to join. We had our tickets in advance, $40.00 online purchase, and my girlfriend paid at the door - $50.00.   Now, regardless of where the ACTUAL event for 2013 was advertised as being held - between the advertisements on Yelp, on Facebook and scattered about Dripping Springs, it was VERY unclear to anyone coming from outside of town where the hell this event actually was.   So we arrived at the Texas Hill Country Olive Company to find no tents, no events, no nothing but a beautiful building surrounded by beautiful land. Inside there were very few customers. But we were greeted warmly, given amazing samples (DO go there and DO try their olive oils and balsamic vinegars and DO check out their $55.00 romantic date night packages).   Making the best of what was already frustrating, we had a few samples and they sent us on to the Dripping Springs Park Ranch - or something like that, up Ranch Road Twelve.   We were still optimistic until we saw the HUGE metal pavilion looming ahead, situated in the midst of probably two square miles of plowed up red dirt which will eventually be a parking lot. As we navigated in, driving through dirt among hundreds of cars, we noticed piles of dirt, bull dozers, caution tape... this entire venue was a.) an agricultural fair pavilion and b.) UTTERLY UNFINISHED.   I was mortified. I brought guests, I paid money, and we were supposed to be in the midst of lush, rolling hill country sipping wine and sampling cheese. Not walking through 300 yards of dirt to get to an unfinished metal building. This was already so embarrassing and already not worth the money.   We had to enter at the back of this enormous, godawful construction, walk through the art vendors, then across MORE dirt on the rodeo floor (where the paying guests tables were and the music) where we were given six drink tickets and ten food tickets. When we reached the one interior part of the building, we were encountered by swarms of casually dressed, generally rude, pushy guests who were buzzing around a square room with no proper traffic flow. There we found out that each drink ticket gave us ONE OUNCE of wine, which was poured by rude and distracted vendors. We also found that each food ticket did not entitle us to a sample - samples cost anywhere from 2 to 5 tickets. One ticket got you the likes of ONE chip with a dollop of something on it.   I was blocked and almost run over by a RUDE and completely OBLIVIOUS staff member who was blocking the only entrance to the tasting room. Other guests were hogging the only FIVE standing tables in the are, they'd put their purses up there and stand around and send other guests to get them samples, so there was no where to set down your things and you had to juggle a glass of wine, your tickets, your purse, and a plate of food and in order to eat it, back through the ONE door you went, down the stairs to the dirt on the rodeo arena floor.   We left without even using the tickets we had - not worth the paltry return for what we'd spent and what we had to endure to get there.   I will never return to this event. I want my money back from this event. The Dripping Springs Chamber of Commerce should be ashamed of the overall mess and disappointment this fiasco was - they don't deserve a dime of the money they raised from it.   TERRIBLE."

I enjoyed the wide variety of beer, wine, and liquor to choose from, but I wish there were a few more food options. What made it worth the price of admission was the sommelier talk at 3:30 where there was no-ticket-required wine comparison tasting, and I learned a few things. Take advantage of those demos if you go next year. Also there were a few food stands with free samples no tickets required (pecans were a favorite, olive oil, chips and salsa, etc). I wish I had hit the liquor area sooner, they seemed to have generous pours. I may hit this event again next year, or I may not, but I definitely had a good time."

For that money you receive a twin Iiquors reusable bag, some goodies inside the bag including a wine glass, 10 food tickets and 6 wine tickets.  Each wine ticket was good for a 1oz pour.  And the food tickets could be used at more than 10 food vendors for various amounts.  It is called Dripping with Taste because it is supposed to be a \"taste\" not a full glass or full meal.  I will tell you that I had plenty of food for my 10 tickets!  And got to try 6 different wines!    I will say that a previous post about volunteers having to work 2 hours and then getting unlimited food and drinks is absolutely false.  Volunteers had to work a minimum of 3 hour shifts but most worked many, many more hours not only the day of the event but also prior to the event and they got the same 10 food tickets and 6 alcohol tickets.  I learned a lot about local wineries, breweries, and distilleries and tasted some awesome food from some local restaurants that I had not yet eaten at."

                "description": "If you choose to attend this festival, DO NOT PAY. You get 6 drink tickets and 10 food tickets for $40. 1 oz pours. That's about 1/6 of a glass of wine. So you pay $40 for a single glass of wine. HEB gave away 2 chips with salsa for 1 ticket, empanadas were 5 tickets. I was denied BUYING a bottle of water, so that the volunteers could have them.   This brings me to the point, if you want to go to dripping with taste, volunteer. They treat the volunteers far better than paying guests. They do their jobs for 2 hours then get to enjoy UNLIMITED drinks and food and get cool shirts that aren't available to buy to us regulars.   I was very unimpressed Dripping Springs."

                "description": "I was really excited for this, but sadly disappointed. Paid $40 ticket, which included 10 food tasting tickets and 6 wine tasting tickets. Get there and see that almost every vendor is charging 2-5 tickets for food tasting and the wine tastings are  only 1 oz pours. What??! What did my $40 pay for?? A couple sample size appetizers and a few gargle-worth 's wine samples! Furthermore, it was inside and stifling!! I'd much rather pay a little more and get unlimited tastings, at least I'd feel like I got my money's worth. Sorry Dripping, won't be back. Huge disappointment."

                "description": "They did a good job this year except for signage. There was a huge lack thereof at the back entrance where they were having everyone park when I arrived.  Everyone parking had no idea where to go. Other than that, the new Ranch/event center is nice. There were lots of vendors and lots to choose from. The tickets were more than enough to try things and the staff were friendly. Dripping Springs is a gorgeous city that should be visited by all."

                "description": "A piss poor event.   It was raining when we arrived, I know that no one can help that, but we were one of the first to arrive and we directed to park at the back end of a mud field. Instead of filling up the lot nearest the event, we had to walk though a water logged muddy field.   Then the signing up volunteers, one of the online register volunteers, was the rudest person I have met in a long time. She reminded me of one of the Orks from Lord of the Rings.   So you get 10 food tickets and 6 drink tickets. What you fail to learn until you have paid ($50) is that 10 food tickets doesn't mean 10 small samples, all of the samples were multiple tickets. Essentially, your $50 gets you two tacos and the six drink tickets equal about one glass of wine.   A truly crap festival."

I saw more of what hard work goes into making it a success. I still had time to taste wine and food and work to help this year be more successful than the last. I had fun and really love this part of Texas. Perfect place and lot of hard work went into making this a fun day.  Good job all who make this happen!!!!"

                "description": "After reading the other reviews I felt that I had to write one myself. Just how many wine festivals have these people attended?!  I have attended literally dozens of wine festivals, mostly in California. Believe me that the Dripping with Taste Festival is, by far, the best value on the market. Spending $40 for the initial tickets is next to nothing compared to the analogous events in California. AND purchasing additional tickets for a buck each is very cheap compared to other such events.   I have attended the last two Dripping with Taste festivals and plan to continue to attend every year. I look forward to this event based on the quality of the event and the very, very low cost. Both years I have come away with the feeling that I got more than my money's worth and found several Texas wines to add to my wine cellar!"

I live in Drippings and saw this massive structure being erected.  Its quite the eye sore.  That'd be fine if it wasn't so expensive.  Worse, it is actually held in a tiny closed off indoor part of the complex that's maybe a 1/8th the size of the whole place.  Needless to say, it was over crowded, people packed in like sardines.  My family wanted to leave rather quickly because it just flat out sucked.  Some the vendors were generous some were stingy and acted like it was a chore to deal with you.  Stay away from this event."

                "description": "The last time I went to this event was several years ago and I was very disappointed with the venue and the offerings and had not gone back. I decided to try it again this year since it sounded like a great venue but I was very disappointed here as well. The place was nice and large but very hot and had a messy, red dirt floor. Really, I spent $40 on a cattle pen?  The wineries were nice but there were not enough food vendors and most were over-priced. My legs and feet were disgustingly dirty by the time we left. It also made me wonder how much of that dirt ended up on the food.  That's two out of two disappointments with that event and I will not be going back until a better location is used. If it happens a third time, well it will be third time and your out. There are plenty of nicer wine events around Texas that don't charge that much for entry and are much more fun."

Mother Nature decided that we needed some rain, and she was right! Though we were a little soggy when we arrived, that didn't dampen our spirits. We sampled food from most of the vendors, the quality was outstanding and we found everyone to be warm, friendly and knowledgable. As always, great wines, loved the beer garden, and glad to see the addition of spirits. The music added a nice ambience. We enjoyed our beer, wine and food sitting comfortably watching the shows. We had a wonderful day, we're looking forward to next year's Dripping With Taste. The Chamber should be very proud of this years event."

This place super surprised me, it is decked out with liquor from top to bottom, pretty much anything you could ask for. And if they don't have it, they'll get it, just for you. I was looking for a bottle of a special Asian wine, this location didn't have it but another did... and the owner, Paras, delivered it himself within an hour to the store. Owner, Paras, great person, super knowledgable, and way cool. It was Friday night and he had about 6-8 bottles out for samples and gave recommendations on best ways to drink and mix. Gotta try this place. And if you want \"high-end\" bottles, Paras is the man to talk to."

                "description": "My friends and I went on a wine tour for our friend's birthday party the first weekend in August and it was great!   From the beginning stages of planning, Francesca, (the owner, planner, driver, etc.) worked her hardest to make sure the event was personalized for our group. Fran was also very quick with correspondence and letting me know important information and what she needed from me.   We decided that the Wimberly/Dripping Springs tour was the best route for us since a lot of people had already been to Fredericksburg wineries. Fran picked us up at 9am in Round Rock (she'll work with you on your pick up/drop off site) and she drove us around in an air conditioned mini tour bus! Did I mention that the bus is BYOB?! We brought on our own ice chests and bags for snacks which was great for the 45 minute trip we had! Fran also has a DVD/CD player on the bus but we brought our own speakers for our iPod. She also had tips on wine tasting and a map of the wine country for us to take a look at on the road.   We went to three wineries and an olive oil orchard. It was so hot outside for the olive oil orchard that our group decided to leave early but the rest of the wineries were all inside and all of the staff at the wineries were so nice and informative. One of our friends even bought a case of wine from one of them! Remember to bring money with you in case you fall in love with one or more of the delicious Texas wines that you have to buy a bottle or two!   Fran also arranged for our group to have Saltlick bbq plates for us at one of the wineries! Our group pre-ordered either turkey, chopped beef, sliced beef, etc. We had our sandwich with potato salad, coleslaw, beans (the best beans I've had in awhile), extra delicious seasame seed bread, extra bbq sauce, Tiff's Treats cookies, Sweet Leaf Tea, water, etc. etc.! It was a lovely lunch outside at the winery. We were all so full! But all of that came in the price of the tour! Fran even got us a deal with a cake-maker and we had a birthday cake waiting for our friend along with candles to surprise her!  Fran and her business associate, Melinda, were with us during every tour and let us know when we needed to move on to the next winery. They really made sure we that were ok and having a great time. They even had patience to take pictures of us with our multiple cameras.   We all headed back around 4pm and returned safe and sound (and still pumped up from the awesome day) around 5pm. All in all, it was a great day! Fran really has a great business and will personalize tours for all types of groups. She's very professional and you can tell she takes pride in what she does and will go the extra mile to make you feel your group is top priority! We'll definitely be going back to try more tours with L'Avventura Dolce, especially when the weather cools down! Great job!"

We booked their bus for a winery tour for my bachelorette party, and they unfortunately ruined it (really by no fault of theirs...but still).  We were scheduled for pick up at 1.  At 12:30, they called to say that their bus broke down and that they would be an hour and a half late.  At 2:30, they finally showed up in an old, dirty van.  My group and I were squished together with all our things, and what's worse is that we couldn't really see or talk to one another.  The speaker system rattled and was distracting.  Also, since the wineries close at 6, our tour was cut drastically short, and we had to rush.  We also had someone who had to leave early, so in turn, had to miss the entire tour.    The only redeeming quality was the excellent customer service of the company.  Both the driver and the owner were truly wonderful and apologetic.  I know that these things happen, but I do think that having an acceptable backup vehicle is important."

My friends and I had an amazing time, as did the rest of the bus based on the jovial environment (laughter, singer, and a showing of \"The Christmas Story\") created by our host and bus driver.

                "description": "First, the Driftwood Bistro is on the grounds of Driftwood Estates winery, just off RR 12 south of Dripping Springs. There are several things to be said about that. First, be prepared for the rough, rocky driveway up the hill to the grounds. Once on top, though, the vista is splendid, especially as the sunset rolls across the hills beyond and the flats below. The grounds are lovely and spacious and pleasing. It is an exceedingly pleasing setting.  Beyond that, the Bistro is on one side of the hilltop and the wine house on the other. The Bistro doesn't have a liquor license, so you have to walk across the grounds to get a glass or bottle to go with your meal. An inconvenience. Their wines are middle of the road, and the selection of wines by the glass are very limited as far as whites go.  The Bistro has a pretty experimental and ambitious menu, with creative choices and options. We had the Caribbean Shrimp and Rice and the Open-faced Stuffed Avocado. The avocado dish was superb, with the featured avocado just the right level of ripeness, tender grilled chicken and a picante that was dynamite. The salsa Fresca and crema helped create a very satisfying entre. The flavors both blended and contrasted with each other. A very nice choice of a cool dish for a summer evening. The shrimp dish, on the other hand, was disappointing. It was tepid, to start with. And the shrimp had a very fishy flavor. The sautéed squash was credible, but overall it was disappointing.   Service was cordial. Lexi,our server, was very warm and welcoming and attentive. It was not her fault that the shrimp wasn't the proper temperature   The Bistro gets a 'maybe' on this visit, with hopes that they will improve on speed out of the kitchen and address that glitchy separation of wine bar and restaurant. The place has much going for it, and, if they can up their game, it will be a killer destination."

I stumbled upon the Austin Brewery Tours' website while searching on Yelp for ideas.   I had an awesome time exploring Austin's growing beer scene. I also had a great time meeting and making friends the other tourists on our tour.   I enjoyed all of the 3 breweries but the behind the scene tour at Independence Brewing Co. made it my favorite.   The price is very fair when you consider it includes your tastings and tips for your severs.   In a nutshell, a good alternative tour for those interested in the Austin craft beer scene."

No one In our group lived in Austin so it was good to get some info about the city and neighborhoods. The 3 breweries we stopped at were all unique from each other in size, atmosphere, and beers. At each stop you choose two beers to try which is great. We've been on other tours where you do not pick. We were given about an hour at each stop which was ample time. I would highly recommend this tour company!"

                "description": "Apparently it's become a tradition that we do a brewery tour when we travel. One of the breweries I was told I MUST visit, while in Austin, was Jester King. Searched online for brewery tours that included this and finally decided on Austin Brewery Tours.  Almost daily tours, online booking was so easy, and we got a reminder, a couple of days earlier to our tour, via email.  Tour starts at noon.  Meetup time was 11:30am. At around 11:25am the van was there.  Out comes Shane, owner and tour guide. He immediately introduced himself, thanked us for being on time and proceeded to ask us our names and where we were from. Once the other people taking the tour arrived, we were all introduced and in the van we went.  During the time we were driving, he would ask us questions to get to know us better, and see the style of beers we liked. He also gave us an intro of each of the breweries we would visit. He made the time driving pass by fast and welcomed all questions we could have.  At each of the breweries, he explained the process and what we had included in the price of the tour. At Jester King, they even had a special release and he bought a sample of each (which was not included in the price but he gifted us with it) making sure we had the complete experience.    You can tell he enjoys doing these tours and meeting the people.   He even took us to Revolution - which was in front of one of the breweries we visited - to try locally made flavored gin.   So greateful he allowed us to do this quick stop - this was delicious, and gave me the opportunity to talk more with one of the ladies on the tour, exchanging ideas on recipes with the gin we had just tried.    Shane is grate at incorporating everyone in the tour and conversations.  He allows you plenty of time to enjoy each brewery and every beer you choose.   He is now friends with the staff at each of these breweries, which works on the advantage of everyone in the tour since we got excellent/ friendly service at each stop.  Best part of this all, is you meet new people, get to enjoy all the beer you can drink, and don't have to drive. Great way to spend a day in Austin.  If looking for a beer tour, look no further, this is it!"

                "description": "October 2018. 5 out of 5. We decided to take a brewery tour while we visited Austin. This ended up being a great decision. The tour is structured well. We did three stops which gave us a good opportunity to try three different breweries without having to worry about driving, parking, or any of the attendant Logistics. The tour covers all expenses including tips which is a nice touch. You can tell that the tour is well organized and that the breweries appreciate the business. That means you end up getting much better service at all of the breweries than you sometimes get with such packages. The tour guide also is able to make excellent suggestions so if you don't have a lot of experience with craft beer this is a great way to learn. If you have any interest in a brewery tour while in Austin I highly recommend this tour."

He made the day so fun, stress-free, and kept us all on track.  We stopped at a mix of well known and off the beaten path breweries. If you're visiting from out of town, this is one of the best tours to see the heart of Austin craft brewing. I can't recommend them highly enough."

Of all the awesome people we met and food we ate, our guide Shane as well as the guys at the Lotus Joint food truck were freakin awesome!  SXSW had Austin jammed with a lot to do but Shane made sure we got to see Austin and its beer community like the locals do. He was insanely knowledgeable not just about beer but also about Texas. When you've solo traveled the world like he has, you gain a perspective that makes you far more relatable too which made him an all around cool guy to hangout with.  Most important.. The beers were phenomenal! (Try the goat tacos at Lotus also!)  In town for a day, a week, or a life time - Hands down recommend this for anyone in Austin!"

He was very friendly and ensured we had a good time. Even though it was about 1000 degrees outside, he kept the van cool and ensured we were cared for.  We had opportunities to not only sample excellent beers, but also visit several food trucks in the area. His rapport with the brewery owners gave us extra attention and really made us feel special.

Brooke was a wonderful tour guide, and she made good beer recommendations (especially considering that I'm not much of a beer drinker).   We did the Hill Country Tour and visited Jester King, Last Stand, and Skull Mechanix. Each tour had a tasting option (one where we all tasted beers as a group and the others where we each got to pick our own beers to try). After selecting beer to taste, we got to explore each brewery on our own before moving onto the next location. We had enough time to eat (plan on eating at Jester King. The food is awesome and we spent the most time there) and to drink at every place, while still getting to individually wander and see all that these breweries had to offer. We also got to take the Jester King tour, which is really cool.   I'd highly recommend an afternoon with Austin Brewery Tours!! Thank you Brooke for a great day!"

I filled out an inquiry form and then was contacted right away. We booked a private tour for a couples trip. Alee was great in providing suggestions and making sure to fit what we wanted as part of the tour. We got to tour Hawk's Shadow, then had a tasting at Duchman and ended our tour with some delicious BBQ from Salt Lick, next to Salt Lick Cellars. Tom, our driver was so nice and flexible with our schedule. He reminded us of how much time we had but did not feel rushed at all. We'll definitely be booking Slowpokes for any future trips!"

After talking with her she designed a day that was diverse and showed us a number of new things in the Dripping Springs area.  Our day included several of the high country wineries, one brewery and a visit to the quaint town of Wimberly. We highly recommend this group over  other Austin wine tour groups as they create a very personalized day and made sure everyone enjoyed the stops.   Our day started with lunch at Homespuns in Dripping Springs - excellent start to a beautiful day!  The Bloody Marys are highly recommended."

Lindsey chose our wineries very wisely; we started with lunch at Crowson (whose owner will drop incredible knowledge on you), enjoyed a rainstorm and a glass of red at the beautiful Ron Yates, and ended with cheese and BOOOOM wine at Hye Meadow Winery. It was lovely day of booze, conversation, and sisterhood. And, yes, we loved Lindsey so much she became a part of our wolfpack. Lindsey was fun, energetic, and knowledgeable about the area. I would definitely do this tour again!"

She made a wine bottle with me and my moms photo on it with a sweet birthday message and quote.  She took so many photos of us, and really made us feel special. We were able to choose our wineries and she even picked us up and dropped us off at our BNB. She had the most amazing tapas tray, with cheese, mixed nuts, her special dip, crackers, breads and meats. She had this prepared and sat out for us at Wimberly winery,  halfway through the tour. At the end of this stop, she even had cupcakes for my moms birthday. I had actually called around different wine tours in the area and Slow Poke Wine tours offered the best value and I can tell you now, the best service. We wouldn't hesitate to do it again. This trip with my mom was priceless and so special. I thank you Linda for making an amazing memory for my mom and I."

We went to a beautiful winery to begin and enjoyed a lunch spread while there; then we went to a distillery with AMAZING frozen mint juleps, outdoor games and great scenic views; finally we ended at the olive oil and balsamic producer for more snacks and great wine. Linda was very attentive to us and did a great job of keeping us on schedule without rushing us, she picked us up around 10:30AM and we returned around 4:30PM. Hope to enjoy this tour again in the future, a very diverse experience that I think even the guys would enjoy!"

My now fiancée and I rode in the Model T Ford, which was all-original except for the brakes. I contacted Linda with any questions, concerns, and booking, and Linda picked up my fiancée in a Mercedes van.  We went to a great breakfast, and then David drove us around in the Model T Ford. The route was scenic, breathe taking, and beautiful.  The wineries we stopped at were great, and, the customer service from Linda and David was unbeatable.  They have a unique business that is more than just a van or limo driving you around to distilleries, breweries, or wineries (although they also have a Mercedes van option).  I am now going on another tour with them for a bachelor party, and they could not have provided more prompt replies to my requests for information related to travel, pick up at different locations, types of tours they offer, and pricing.  What a great business run by some truly nice and professional people who offer very reasonable pricing.  I plan to use their services again in the future."

On the day of, I got a heads-up call to confirm the time and pickup location. We had a larger, rowdy group of gals on a bachelorette trip and our driver Song took SUCH good care of us! She immediately asked us what music we wanted to crank and encouraged all the \"wooing\" from the back of the van. She also offered to take pictures of us, scouted out the best locations for group photos and even took TONS of candid pics of us while we enjoyed the winery and distillery we went to. She helped with all of the logistics of checking in at each stop and making sure we were taken care of. She also let us make a pee stop on the way home...and overall she was just SUPER nice and was basically hyping us up the entire day, making sure the bride felt special and making sure we all had fun. By the end of the day we all felt like she was part of the crew. Thank you again Song!!"

                "description": "The review that I left in regards to the services booked through Austin Wine Tours was in no way false. I will stand firm by what was written.   I even received a call back in May while on a business trip from the shuttle service company asking if we would pay the overtime for Hugo because AWT had not paid them yet. We even tipped Hugo an additional amount for his extra time spent with us.   The response just posted (almost 4 months later) is also extremely unprofessional and misleading. We were promised a great time for a bachelorette party and were let down. Plain and simple. Those employed by AWT that we spoke with were rude as well. Secondly, I never said that AWT hosted prom events/transportation. I was told that the company that is usually utilized was completely full (by Brad) and that prom happened to be a priority and the school bus that was sent was all they could get us even though we were promised a party bus.   At the end of the day we were completely dissatisfied with the services offered by AWT. Calling a client a bridezilla (who in fact actually never spoke to any AWT employee), claiming your company has gotten PTSD from our group and falsely accusing our group to be racist by saying we told \"blackie to leave\" is unprofessional and disrespectful amongst other things said in response to our reviews. All of those involved would be happy to discuss this event again in a professional manner since you mentioned that we were offered a full refund when that in fact was not true. We were offered maybe $350 (I could be wrong on this amount since we haven't heard/spoken to anyone from AWT for several months) in return if we removed our reviews.  As a company you should take responsibility instead of blaming others for your mistakes that way you can fix the problem and do better for future patrons. Especially since there has been no money refunded at this point."

Sara was very informative and laid everything out, giving us a doable timeline for the afternoon we wanted. The itinerary we received gave us a good idea of how long to spend at each venue. There were only 4 people in our group, so we were able to do a very flexible hourly option, with appointments at the wineries.  Since we had less than 5 passengers, our tastings weren't included (informed that going in) however, that did not deter our experience... it was awesome! Buying a bottle of wine at each venue was very affordable when we split the cost among us.  George, our driver, was professional and friendly; and the limo experience was awesome! You might want to bring snacks just in case someone gets a bit tipsy, but most wineries offer food of some kind. Thanks Austin Wine Tours, for making me look like a champ with my high maintenance friends... I'll be back!"

I approved it and paid (all on line)... and in just a couple of days I was picking up my special surprise for my wife's and my 10 year anniversary.  They were friendly, did the work exactly to my specifications and were quick!  I will definitely remember this and us them again!"

But I had to reach out to inquire about the status of the shipment. Once I did, she made sure to tell me that I had made a mistake and that they would charge me $19 to reship the package. I assure you, the address I shipped to is correct. Verified by the client and his business website.   Just all around poor customer service. Blame your customer, over-charge your customer, and then dismiss them when you don't want to deal with the issue any longer.   I will never use this company for client gifts again."

I had no idea I could personalize a bottle of wine online. I ordered the magnum with a customized label and the process was very smooth and easy! I never got a shipping confirmation email so I reached out to them and got a response pretty quickly. The package did arrive the morning after they guaranteed it would, so I would recommend giving yourself a few days as a buffer so you aren't in a pickle. The label looked amazing and the bottle was packaged in styrofoam so it was protected during shipping."

                "description": "I am not an avid wine drinker like many I know, but I am an avid person who appreciates unique products and great customer service.  I previously learned about Personal Wine at a local charity event where they had custom engraved wine bottles as gifts to help raise money for the charity; knowing this, it planted a seed in my mind to give them a try.  Recently, while in a crush of thoughts and ideas to get a gift I remembered Personal Wine. Committing to using them for my inspired gift needs, I decided that I wanted a custom label printed on two nice bottles of wine.  So, I went to the website.... and it seems that since the website was far too simple for me to understand [self-deprecating humor and honesty so you can laugh]... then I simply called them so I could speak about options.    In a short timely manner I spoke with their customer service and I was placed in contact with Michael and his customer service focus was a great relief and helped me sort out my thoughts for the logo, design, capabilities they have and much much more.  In the end and in the perfect storm of timing, I was able to get them what they needed and they were able to get me a perfect product by days end. It's not everyday that they can process things in a timely manner so fast, but the staff and team helped me out greatly. Michael even personally cut out the unique shape of the label like a skilled surgeon to meet my needs. (it was unique per my request)  I ended up getting 2 custom labeled bottles of wine and a pine box to present them in. It surely will be a unique gift that will not be expected.  If you are looking for a great gift that displays your personal style, I would try Personal Wine as they can pretty much match your wants and needs for gifts. Remember they are local, but they do deliver around the United States (read the website for details).  Additionally, I learned that they are also available for \"venue\" opportunities if you would like to have a private event, wine tasting, meeting space, etc. so just contact them for details. The space is really classic, comforting, and reminiscent of old school \"speak easy\" lounges with the great oak tables and comfortable leather seating.  Personal wine deserves the 5-Star rating for helping me meet all my gift needs when I needed it most."

                "description": "I ordered some custom inscribed wine glasses and was disappointed. The etching was so faint I could barely see it. The font and logos were also very small and badly proportioned. Dealing with Franco at customer service was like speaking with a 5 year old, he didn't listen and just kept repeating what he was trained to say, constantly talking over me and in denial. I didn't feel that the quality or design was worth the cost. The best part was after I told franco the product did not measure up to what was promised he did offer me a discount on future orders ? Again, obviously he wasn't listen. Why would I order more if the product was less than desirable. Denial is a river in Egypt, its a protocol at Personal Wine."

We have sent out a lot of corporate gifts over the years, as well as thank you notes, but the customized bottles of bubbly wine we sent through Personal Wine have been far and away the most popular gifts we've sent.  Ordering was a breeze. Ben Myers was a total gem and walked me through all of our options. We had a huge list of addresses we had to send to, and our order arrived well before the anticipated date. The labels looked beautiful and our customers took to social media to proudly show off their custom bottles of wine.  I honestly couldn't be more please with both the final product and the customer service I received. They are an awesomely rocking company and I would absolutely recommend them to any and every person who's looking for a unique, personalized gift for friends, family, and corporate contacts. Thanks so much Personal Wine!"

Got a few Pinot Grigio bottles personalized for one of my fav former co-workers for her birthday, and I was really impressed with the end of result. She LOVED it, and I seriously couldn't be more happy from the pictures she sent me after receiving the gift. The only criticism I have is that the templates don't necessarily align with the corresponding event--I picked a label for her birthday that was actually under 'Valentine's Day'--but it was easily remedied by a few font changes and so forth. There were a few templates that were perhaps misplaced or mislabeled, but that aside, the final product was an absolute gem. I definitely recommend this company for anyone looking for a thoughtful gift that resonates with fellow wine lovers!"

The recipients of the personalized wine and glasses absolutely loved them and admired the professionalism and wondered how it was done or where I got it!   They work fast and quality of work is high end. I wouldn't say you get what you pay for - I think that you get more than what you pay for in terms of wine, personalized product and customer service. They work to your needs and are very flexible and very willing to do what they can to get your orders the way you want them.   Highly recommended and will be ordering from them in the near future!"

I thought the writing was really small and was concerned that they wouldn't notice that we had made a personalized sticker. Another concern was the card that I ordered... it looked like somebody sat on it...it was on very thin paper and came in a sealed envelope all crumpled up... I am so happy that I opened it and took a look. This kind of thing just makes the whole gift look cheap...  I went out at the last minute to buy a card."

Not one of those scenes where people are there to be seen and you have to talk loudly to the person sitting next to you. This is a place where wine lovers go for a glass or two and relax and have some conversation. They have a nice variety of bottles and truly believe a wine expert could find a few that they love. The seating consists of over sized leather chairs and many leather sofas. They have a bar area and one really long table perfect for large parties or tastings. This place has cement floors and walls lined with bottles. No one expects you to arrive in a suit or anything stuff like that. This is a come as you are sort of place. The only prerequisite is that you like wine and are of legal drinking age. Oh one more thing you won't find this place over run by the 6th street crowd, this place is much more relaxed then that."

                "description": "LETS MAKE POUR DECISIONS!   I am in Austin this week for a couple days. We are celebrating christmas as a family here in Austin this year.   My brother and I needed to get some alcohol for my parents before their arrival here tomorrow evening.   This store was very spread out and easy to find exactly what you are looking for. The staff is helpful too and they know where things are in the store too.   I have missed total wine as it is hard to come by when in AL due to liquidity laws. But we do have ABC stores.   I must say that they do card if you appear to be under 30. So myself, my brother and his girlfriend were all carded. But I am taking it as a compliment as yes I do look young.   I think my parent will be happy with what we got for them. :)   If you need an alcohol pick me up or a gift they have amazing gift sets too!   Wonderful experience here!"

                "description": "DO NOT USE ONLINE ORDER DELIVERY.  I recently learned a lesson using Total Wine and More's very ill-partnered delivery service.  Someone brought a wrong order in decent time to my house.  We noticed the erroneous bag together at my doorstep and she proceeded to take the delivery back to the store and my order is subsequently cancelled as I am informed by E-mail.  I wait an entire week and receive a refund 13 dollars less than my original payment.  I have spoken to customer service two weeks ago and they initiated a pass of my complaint to higher authority.  On my end, I have seen the same result as taking no action at all.  I am at a point now where it makes no more sense to spend any more time on getting my 13 dollars back as this as a fraction of what I can make spending that time actually working.  Total Wine online orders get all the thumbs down!"

                "description": "Thanks to Total Wine and More for being my go-to spirits supplier during the 'Rona.  I've only had need to use them for bottles of wine for special occasion during the pandemic. It's easy to shop online from their website to pickup curbside. Service is typically quick, accurate, and convenient. Curbside is free with a $35 order; otherwise a minimal service charge applies.  They were already my inside favorite based on the wonderful in-store atmosphere and experience. Being a solid citizen and not putting my health at risk to purchase adult beverages during the pandemic has won them a fan for life."

Came in here during Coronavirus and had a few odd items I couldn't find. An employee directed me to another employee who turned out to be the manager, and he personally walked me around the store and gave me his own personal opinions on which bottles to get. Amazing. This guy was super knowledgeable and helpful. I already love Total Wine as a brand and this location is now my favorite. I just wish this was the closest Total Wine to me!"

                "description": "If you are like me my drink of choice changes with the seasons, moods I have, and sometimes based on what holiday(s) are coming up. Total Wine is THE best place to come if you are like me - curious, excited to try something new, looking for some advice on what else I can try, etc then you have come to the right spot for your libations.  Ask any employee, I dare you, on what they suggest after telling them what you like. They will point you to some solid suggestions and even walk you over to that area where it is located. Total Wine has some very knowledgeable employees who are willing to walk you through the entire store if you requested that.   The prices are the best in the area for all of it - liquor, beer, wine, mixers, etc.  It's a one stop shop where you just might end up finding a cooler-than-the-one-you-have-at-home cocktail shaker or wine stoppers too.   Also, if you are looking to put together a gift last minute come here.  They have it all - bags, gift sets, tape, cute decor for bars, and whatnot here. It's super easy to roll up, park, and strut in to get a really cool and curated gift if you ask for some help."

He was so helpful with picking out our first bottle I went and searched for him to help pick out the second bottle. He helped us pick out an islay whiskey and a flavored whiskey and I was surprised at how knowledgeable he was on them .   In short nice store and the service was friendly knowledgeable and descriptive. Thanks again to Andrew!!"

I like that they have so many choices for wines and also a huge inventory of distilled spirits... plus quality beers, craft and imports. They've kept up with the mezcal boom, to my joy.  And there's always excellent single-malt Scotch options.  All I'd like to see more of is Greek wines (Kourtaki retsina, please!) and Portuguese madeira.  I still have to go to Spec's for those.     A tip of the hat to excellent and helpful staff. I always look for Belle up front, she is a delight!  I hope she's appreciated, managers!"

They have a wide selection of liquor, wine, and beer.  I even found some exotics like moonshine from the TV show 'Moonshiners'.  And carry many local Austin and Texas brands.   My trip included finding a nice bottle of Rosé, bourbon and a few mini single serving bottles to sample. The staff was very nice.  For Texas residents they have a rewards program and a phone app."

My husband and I discovered Total Wine while living in California. Our store there was one that we went to every Saturday with our dog and we knew everyone who worked there. We were sad to be moving back to Austin because we didn't think there was a Total here. After a quick search, we found out there was this one on Brodie. We used to live north, but would make the trek down every weekend to see them. Now that we live south, we are there all the time.  We now have two dogs and they are the store mascots. Their picture is literally on the front door! When we walk in, us and the girls are welcomed with open arms.  Lisa is the best at working the wine tastings. She can tell you anything you want or need to know. Laurie is the sweetest and so helpful! Bob is always giving us the best recommendations. I wish I could name everyone, but will work on updating this review as I remember everyone's names. We feel like family when we are there. Total is the ONLY liquor store in my book. I have brought so many people to Total and they have nothing but nice things to say. They are helpful; if you can't find something they know exactly where it is. If they don't have it, they will see what they can do to get it in store. Their prices can't be beat! They are very knowledgeable; if you ask someone a question they don't know they will work endlessly to find the answer and store it for helping others in the future. I literally can't say enough about Total and their promise to hire amazing employees."

HOLY COW! Not only did this young woman have a deep deep knowledge of every varietal and suggestions on labels in a variety of price ranges- but she help me select a case of assorted wines, but wouldn't let me leave without one of her favorite bottles of Syrah.   When I was checking out at the cashier, she asked \"Gracie helped you, didn't she? She has an encyclopedic knowledge of wines and impeccable taste.\"  Well, I just cracked open that bottle of Syrah and BLAMMO. I'm hooked."

I even attended a sweet Yelp wine and beer tasting event there in Fairfax, VA about two years ago.Total Wine sold me at that event and I was able to get some of my favorite beers. I love the fact I could do a mix and match 6 pack of anything I wanted.   Anyway, I wasn't feeling like Spec's on this particular day and wanted to see how Texas does Total Wine and more. Texas does it right. I was in awe and bewilderment as I toured the store. I ended up with of course more than I needed but no worries there.   I will note I found something there called a pocket shot. A pocket shot is made of plastic and looks like a Capri Sun container. It would of have been great to take to ACL the other weekend. So if you want to sneak or smuggle booze in I recommend buying those pocket shots."
